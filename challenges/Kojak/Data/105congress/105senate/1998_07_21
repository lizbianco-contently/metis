Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak briefly on the \nnomination of Mr. James Hormel to be the United States Ambassador to \nLuxembourg.\n  Mr. Hormel has a distinguished record as a businessperson, as a \nlawyer, as a former dean of the University of Chicago Law School, and \nas a philanthropist. His family owns one of the largest agriculture \ncompanies in our country.\n  He has, throughout his distinguished career, been a contributor and \nsupporter of many worthy organizations. His philanthropy is well known \nthroughout the United States. He has contributed significantly to the \nCatholic Youth Organization, to the United Negro College Fund, \nSwarthmore College, Breast Cancer Action, and to many, many other \nassociations. He has also served as the alternate representative to the \nUnited Nations General Assembly on behalf of our country, the United \nStates of America.\n  Mr. Hormel's nomination was favorably reported out by the Committee \non Foreign Relations and is widely supported here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Indeed, hundreds of distinguished Americans have favorably commented \non his nomination, and they have stated that Mr. Hormel has the ability \nand skills to successfully represent the United States in Luxembourg.\n  Now, there are many who are watching this proceeding who would ask, \ngiven all these qualifications, why would Mr. Hormel be denied a vote \non his nomination to be Ambassador to Luxembourg? The simple answer \ncomes down to the fact of Mr. Hormel's sexual orientation.\n  There are many--the vast majority of Americans and the vast majority \nof Senators--who feel that this is irrelevant to the duties that he \nwill perform as Ambassador to Luxembourg, and we should look not to his \nsexual orientation, but to his record of achievement and to his ability \nand to his responsibilities throughout his career in\n\n[[Page S8596]]\n\nterms of advancing not his personal agenda, but in fact serving well \nboth the institutions he represented, such as the University of \nChicago, and many, many philanthropic activities which he has been \ninvolved in.\n  But there are some in this Chamber who I fear would rather not have \nan Ambassador, but would rather have a political issue. My preference \nis to have an Ambassador serving the United States with distinction in \nLuxembourg. And I believe Mr. Hormel will do that.\n  Mr. President, the Providence Journal newspaper in my home State of \nRhode Island put it best when they headlined the editorial by simply \nsaying ``Vote on Hormel.''\n  Mr. Hormel does not want this ambassadorship as a pulpit to advance \nany agenda. What he wants to do is represent our country with \ndistinction and great diligence. I believe he will do that.\n  In his own words, in a letter to Senator Gordon Smith, our colleague, \nhe said:\n\n       I will not use, nor do I think it appropriate to use, the \n     office of ambassador to advocate any personal views I may \n     hold on any issue. . . . I assure you that my public \n     positions will be those of the U.S. Government.\n\n  I believe that however one feels about Mr. Hormel's qualifications, \nthis institution deserves to give him a vote, to give him an \nopportunity to have his case decided openly here on the floor of this \nChamber, allowing individual Senators to make whatever point they may \nchoose to make about his qualifications, about his potential to serve. \nBut to deny him his vote, I think, is to deny not only one individual \nbut this country the opportunity to make a decision about his \nqualifications to serve.\n  I hope that we can quickly bring his nomination to the floor for a \nvote and then let the will of the majority prevail. I believe it is \nwrong and unfortunate that we retain this nomination and not allow it \nto come to the floor for the vote. I hope in the days ahead we will \nvote on Mr. Hormel and we will vote favorably.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be permitted to \nyield myself 10 minutes of the time of Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/21/senate-section/article/S8595-7", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8596-S8597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, countless Americans have come to understand \nthat the health care system in this country is in a total state of \ndisarray, if not crisis. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis \nof coverage, bought and paid for with hard-earned dollars from our \nfellow taxpayers, but a coverage that seems to disappear when you need \nit the most.\n  Our fellow citizens no longer believe that their insurance companies \nare prepared to provide them with the quality of service or the choice \nof doctors that they were promised or that they paid for with their \npremiums. Some health insurers have put saving costs way ahead of the \nprospect of saving lives.\n  I think most people in the Senate have come to understand the nature \nof this crisis. The impact of the decisions of the insurance companies \nin countless stories across America and across my State of \nMassachusetts is immeasurable. Americans are suffering because the \nsystem puts the choices of the insurance company administrator far \nahead of the choice of a doctor.\n  The story of Ellen O'Malley, a mother of two, from Canton, MA, \nunderscores the full measure of the problem that we face today. Ellen \npassed away in the summer of 1994, a victim of breast cancer at the age \nof 38. Her husband, Steve, a schoolteacher in Canton, and her two \ndaughters, could tell anybody in the Senate about the trouble that \npeople face today as a result of the way in which choices are made for \nthe delivery of health care. They could also tell you about the \nstruggle of what it is like to live without a mother and wife. I think \nall of us understand that happens and that there are sometimes \nunavoidable consequences of some diseases. But clearly there are \ntotally avoidable consequences of what kind of care is delivered to \nsomebody in the course of an illness.\n  The O'Malley family's story is even more tragic than the loss of \nEllen because they would tell every Senator about the new language that \nthey learned, the experience that they went through, as a consequence \nof her illness--a vocabulary of the HMOs. Ellen O'Malley should not \nhave had to spend her last year of life jumping through bureaucratic \nhoops just to get treatment for breast cancer. She shouldn't have had \nto be shuttled around the city of Boston from one hospital to another \nhospital, from one doctor to another doctor, because an HMO refused to \ntake the word of her own family doctor or her oncologist. Ellen \nO'Malley was very, very brave in facing the struggle with a killer \ndisease. She should not have been asked to be brave in facing a \ndifferent struggle with the bureaucracy.\n  The simple fact is that health insurers should not make the decisions \nthat are fundamentally the decision of a doctor or a trained health \ncare professional. The truth is that in times of family crisis, people \nshould not have to worry about whether or not a bureaucrat is going to \nallow them to be able to see a doctor in whom they have placed trust. \nThat is precisely the kind of turmoil that Ellen O'Malley suffered \nevery single day of her illness.\n  Steve O'Malley remembers his wife hearing the promises from their HMO \nwhen they were signing up, promising that she would undergo care with \nher doctor, Dr. Erban, who had treated her for the past 10 years, and \nthe promise that she would be able to continue to be treated at the New \nEngland Medical Center.\n  But the O'Malleys found that when push came to shove, when it came \ntime for the promise to be delivered on, the promise disappeared. Steve \nO'Malley knows full well about an HMO that sent Ellen all over the \ncity, to one hospital for a mammogram, to another hospital for a \nbiopsy, and to still another hospital for treatment. Steve O'Malley \nremembers hours spent painstakingly writing lengthy appeal letters to \nthe HMO, begging them to reconsider their decisions. He also remembers \nwhat it felt like to receive a 5-line form letter rejecting his wife's \nappeal.\n  Steve would tell you that the personal and painful decisions for his \nfamily were merely business decisions for the HMO, and that is \nunacceptable. It is unacceptable for the O'Malleys, as Steve remembers \nhis late wife saying, ``HMOs are great unless you're sick. They're fine \nif you have a cold, get the flu, break your arm, or stub your toe, but \nthey are not fine if you're dying.''\n  Steve and Ellen O'Malley and their two daughter suffered an enormous \npersonal tragedy when breast cancer dashed their hopes and dreams for \nthe future. I believe they should have been able, as a family, to \nendure that tragedy secure in the knowledge that Ellen could make her \nmedical decisions side by side with the doctor she trusted--not a \nbureaucrat who never went to medical school and, more importantly, \nnever knew Ellen O'Malley.\n  I believe that no HMO should rob a family of peace of mind in times \nof crisis. HMOs should be more than organizations that are great unless \nyou are sick. For every person who buys into an insurance program, \nthere ought to be the confidence that the coverage that you buy is the \ncoverage that you will get. That is why we have proposed the Patients' \nBill of Rights. We recognize we have built a system that currently puts \npaperwork ahead of patients and ignores the real life-and-death \ndecisions being made in our health care system. We have to do better.\n  All across Massachusetts, I hear from people who are angry at how \nhard it is to find the health care that they believe they have \npurchased. And they are frustrated with policies that say that our \nelderly can't go to the doctor of their choice. They are convinced \ntheir HMOs don't give them straight answers about their coverage, and \nworking families across the country believe it is time to take \ndecisions out of the hands of the insurance companies and put them back \nwith patients and doctors where they belong.\n  The U.S. Senate should agree with them. I believe it is vital for us \nto take up and pass meaningful patient protections now, in this \nCongress. There are judges all across the country who have watched in \ntheir courts as patients and families, victimized by HMOs, come before \nthem, to beg for restitution, for a fair shake in getting the health \ncare\n\n[[Page S8597]]\n\nthey were promised in the terms of the policy that they purchased. \nThose judges were helpless because they didn't write the laws that \nlimit the ability of working families to appeal the decisions by HMOs.\n  In Boston, we have a U.S. district judge, William Young, a Reagan \nappointee to the bench, who ruled on an HMO case not very long ago.\n  Judge Young knew the law and he knew that insurers could, in our \ncurrent structure, put paperwork and profit ahead of patients. He knew \nhe could send a message to those of us who write the laws in this \ncountry. That is why he wrote in his highly publicized decision in \nClarke v. Baldplate Hospital that ``while the insurer's conduct is \nextraordinarily troubling, even more disturbing to the court is the \nfailure of Congress to amend the laws.'' Judge Young was challenging us \nto act on behalf of hundreds of thousands of families left unprotected \ntoday. He had never met Ellen O'Malley, but he challenged the Congress \nof the United States to stand up for her.\n  Mr. President, we have the Patients' Bill of Rights, S. 1890, which \nwould prevent senseless tragedies in the health care system from \nhappening. Under our plan, Ellen O'Malley would have been able to \nimmediately appeal her insurer's rejection of her doctor's prescribed \ntreatment. Under our plan, the decision of Ellen O'Malley's doctors \nwould have come first in the insurer's decisions. There is little, \nobviously, we can do for the O'Malley family, except to perhaps in her \nmemory pass a bill that will change the way in which all of these \nchoices are made in the future. We could pass a Patients' Bill of \nRights. The clock is ticking. I hope this Congress will do so in the \nnext days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Under the previous order, there are 22 minutes remaining on the time \nthat was equally divided by a previous order.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, we are here this morning--myself and \nseveral other Senators--because the American people should experience a \ntax cut before Congress gets its funding for the year.\n  We are here this morning to oppose cloture on the legislative branch \nappropriations bill. On Friday, Senator Brownback of Kansas, and I \nattempted to enter into an agreement to offer the marriage penalty \nelimination amendment to the legislative appropriations measure.\n  Marriage penalty elimination means that we simply want to stop \npenalizing people, tax-wise, because they are married. A cloture motion \nwas filed because the Democrats would not allow us to offer that \namendment to this bill. Therefore, a vote against cloture is a vote for \neliminating the marriage penalty tax. If we are not going to be able to \noffer this amendment to the bill, we will be back on other pieces of \nlegislation, because this issue of providing equity to people who are \nmarried, and returning the hard-earned money of American taxpayers is \ntoo important to ignore.\n  In 1948, President Harry Truman called the Republicans in Washington \na ``do-nothing Congress.'' Now the President and Senate Democrats are \nresurrecting Truman's phrase. I don't worry about being called a ``do-\nnothing Congress.'' We have done plenty of things. But if we tried to \ndo nothing about taxes, that label just might stick.\n  Last April, a group of like-minded Senators and I stated our \nintentions to oppose the Senate budget resolution unless meaningful tax \ncuts were included. We were promised that eliminating the marriage \npenalty would be the Senate's top tax priority for 1998. Mr. President, \ntoday, the 21st day of July, there are less than 40 legislative days \nleft in this session of the Congress; yet, we are no closer to giving \nthe American people the tax cuts than we were 3 months ago.\n  We stand here in mid- to late-July with the real possibility that \nCongress will not pass a budget reconciliation and will not deliver on \nthe tax cut promise that was made to the American people. I think we \nought to put this into context. This isn't a situation where cutting \ntaxes would be a strain or be difficult. To add insult to injury, last \nweek the Congressional Budget Office indicated that there would be $520 \nbillion of surplus over the next 5 years. Now, the $520 billion of \nsurplus over the next 5 years would be $63 billion of surplus in this \nyear alone.\n  We have not asked for the Moon. We have asked for a modest \nopportunity to cut and eliminate the marriage penalty. It would not \ntake $520 billion. It would not take $420 billion. It would not take \n$320 billion. It would not take $220 billion. It would take about $1 \nout of every $5 that is to be provided in surplus, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office. So we are just asking that the American \npeople have the opportunity to have, in return, $1 out of every $5 of \nsurplus. This isn't asking that we have massive, Draconian cuts, or \nthat we displace some Government program--although there are plenty of \nGovernment programs I would be happy to seek to displace. We are merely \nsaying that, over the course of the next 5 years, some fraction--a \nminority fraction, as a matter of fact, not the major portion of it--of \nthis rather substantial surplus be devoted to providing equity on the \npart of our taxation program, which is an insult to the values of \nAmerica. I don't know of anyplace in the country you could go, or any \ngroup of individuals you could talk to that would not tell you that the \nfamilies of America are simply fundamental, that if we have strong \nfamilies in the next century, we are very likely to have a strong \ncountry. If we don't have strong families, it is going to be very \ndifficult for our country to survive.\n\n  I believe that when moms and dads, as families, do their job, \ngoverning America is easy. If moms and dads can't do their jobs, if we \npull the rug out from under families and make it tough for them, \ngoverning America could well be impossible. The truth of the matter is \nthat families mean more to America than Government means to America, \nbecause the fundamental restraints of a culture, the values and \nprecepts, are taught in families.\n  Government can try to do all those things. We have tried to replace \nfamilies with Government before. The tremendous failure of the social \nexperiment called the ``Great Society'' of the 1960s and 1970s told us \nthat checks and Government programs weren't substitutes for moms and \ndads. They didn't work. What we need to do is make it possible for the \nculture to survive and to thrive, for the culture to prevail and to \nstop penalizing the most important institution in the culture--the \nfamily. Durable marriages and strong families are absolutely necessary \nif we are to succeed in the 21st century.\n  Starting in the sixties is when the marriage penalty became \nprevalent. For about 30 years, we have systematically penalized \nmillions of people. The truth of the matter is that there are 21 \nmillion couples--about 42 million taxpayers--who collectively have paid \n$29 billion. It is so easy to forget how much money a billion dollars \nis. A billion dollars is a thousand millions. Now, these 42 million \ntaxpayers have collectively paid ``29-thousand-million-dollars'' more \nthan they would have paid had they been single. That is an average \nmarriage penalty of about $1,400 per family. Think of that. We go into \na family and, simply because the mom and dad happen to be married \ninstead of single, we take $1,400 off their table; we take $1,400 out \nof that family's budget. These are not pretax dollars, these are \naftertax dollars. It would go right to the bottom line.\n  Think of what a family could do with an extra $130 or $125 a month. \nThink of what it means to the family, the capacity of that family to \nfend for itself and to be able to survive as a family. We are attacking \nthat family. The policy of America is attacking the principles of the \nAmerican people. And it's easy. We can do it. CBO has told us that we \nare going to have five times as much money, or four times as much--a \nlot more money--well, $520 billion extra. We said we have to have a \nminimum\n\n[[Page S8598]]\n\n$101 billion to begin this relief. That is five times as much as we \nhave asked for. Yet, we are so focused on providing for the Congress, \nso focused on providing for the legislative branch, and we are ignoring \nthe people of America. The families of America are more important than \nthe legislative branch of Government.\n  As much as I think our country needs the House and Senate, why we \nshould provide all the funding the House and Senate need and not \nprovide any of the relief that we have promised to the American family, \nwhy we should continue to attack the American family, is beyond me. \nDiscriminating against Americans who wish to engage in marriage is--\nwell, it is just against everything we stand for.\n  The penalizing of income at the median- and lower-income levels is \ngreatest for married households with dependent children. The obligation \nto file a combined income means that the one spouse working to earn the \nsecond half of the income is working largely to feed Government \ncoffers. Often the couple would pay a lower percentage of their income \nto the Government if one of its spouses was not employed outside the \nhome. The marriage penalty is a grossly unfair assault on the bedrock \nof our civilization--married couples.\n  Does the Tax Code really influence people's moral decisions to \nprevent couples from getting married? Unfortunately, there are \nindividuals who simply have gotten divorced, set aside their marriages, \nin order to avoid the penalty that we impose for being married. Some \ncouples even divorce and remarry to avoid paying the penalty.\n  The Senator from Kansas brought up an example last week of two \neconomists who divorce and remarry every year to avoid paying the \nhigher taxes. The facts point to tragic instances of where couples \nsimply cannot afford to get married because the Government is going to \ncharge them $1,400 for the privilege of being married. Sharon Mallory \nand Darryl Pierce of Connorsville, IN, were ready to get married when \nthey learned from their accountant that it would cost them $3,700 more \na year. The amount results from the forfeiting of a tax refund check of \n$900 and an additional $2,700 to be owed to the IRS as a married \ncouple. A growing number of married couples are in a similar position \naccording to a recent study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  (Mr. SMITH of Oregon assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Now, the incentive effects of the current Tax Code were \nnot intentional. I have to say this. I do not believe that the Congress \never set out----\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, will my colleague from Missouri yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would be most pleased to yield for a question from my \ncolleague from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Last week when we put forward this notion of doing \naway with the marriage penalty, one of my Democrat colleagues said, ``I \nwould be willing to do that if you offset it by doing away with the \nmarriage bonus.'' He raised the question of the marriage bonus in the \nTax Code. I told him I am not about raising taxes. But I wonder if the \nSenator has thought about this issue. Is there a marriage bonus that is \nin the Tax Code? Is that something that should be addressed?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Our Tax Code has and still operates in some instances \nto allow combining, by having a joint return, combined return, to have \na lower tax for married people, and that really results from the \nconscious decision we make to recognize the value to our culture of a \nstay-at-home spouse. It focuses attention on the children and says we \nought to give some benefit taxwise for doing that. And you do that by \nallowing the spouse who works to attribute some income to the stay-at-\nhome spouse.\n  I don't think there are very many of us who are married who, when one \nor the other has had to stay at home, doesn't realize that the one who \nfocuses on the homeplace and undertakes that responsibility is really \nresponsible for income and is responsible for the benefit of the \nfamily.\n  I believe that the ability to split the income so that you get to the \nlowest tax bracket is something that should be provided to everybody in \nmarriage. I wouldn't call it a bonus as if it were giving something \nout. It is a recognition of the value of the spouse who stays at home \nand the contribution that spouse makes, not only to the marriage and to \nthe family but the contribution they make to the country.\n  Most of the data we are seeing now about children--and I am sure my \nfriend from Kansas agrees with this data and has witnessed the articles \nand all the expounding--indicate that when one of the spouses can stay \nat home and spend a lot of time with the children, it is a big \ninvestment in the children and it results in children having lower \nincidences of bad health and lower incidences of school failure, \ndropout, lower incidences of juvenile delinquency and all. So that kind \nof attention from the family really is a social benefit to the entire \nculture, because if there are fewer dropouts, it means that your \neducation system works better; if there is better health, it means the \ncost of the benefits of the health providers are lower; and if there is \nlower juvenile delinquency, it certainly means we benefit.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If my colleague will yield for another question, it \nseems the bonus is to America; it is not necessarily to the married \ncouple that we are talking about in this.\n  The other thing I would ask my colleague about is, the marriage \npenalty that we are talking about affects nearly 21 million American \nfamilies, most of them young, starting families. These are all families \nthat make between $20,000 and $70,000 a year. They are two-wage-earner \nfamilies. So you are really talking about that group of young Americans \njust getting started, both working, both struggling, both trying to \nmake this family go, and we actually penalize them on an average of \n$1,400 per year. My colleague is familiar with that. Also, this is a \nrelatively new tax. We have only put it on since 1969. That was the \nyear of Woodstock. I don't know if there is a significance to any of \nthat, but perhaps this is now the time that we should get away from \nthat sort of penalty.\n\n  I just was curious; I know my colleague knows of those statistics and \nthe importance of trying to help those struggling young families that \nare just now getting a foundation started for their families.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of that. I thank the Senator from Kansas for \nthe question. I am desperately aware of it. This is the time when the \nstress on families is the hardest. If you look at the things that break \nup families, if you go to data that tells us whether or not a family is \ngoing to make it past the threshold and be able to persist as a strong \nfamily with the kind of durability that has the capacity to really help \nour culture with the lasting relationships of support that families \nbring, one of the biggest items is financial problems.\n  So here we have tender families at the very beginning, when they are \nstruggling, they have kids, they are torn between responsibilities at \nthe homeplace and the workplace, and what do we do? Instead of easing \nthat financial burden, we zero in. It is almost like these families are \nstaggering under the load they are bearing, because children are \nexpensive, we know that--it costs a lot of money to clothe them, feed \nthem, provide for them --and as they are struggling under that load, we \ncome in and take another $1,400 a year off their table, out of their \nbudgets, out of their capacity to provide for their children.\n  It is an anomaly. It certainly wasn't something that I think the \nCongress ever intended. I have absolutely every faith the Congress of \nthe United States did not intend to hurt families with the Tax Code. \nBut it has kind of grown this way, and here is where we are. The \nquestion is not what we intended. The question is what we are going to \ndo about this. Are we going to, at a time of $520 billion of surplus, \ndecide we would rather feed the bureaucracy than relieve the families \nof America of this burden? That is plain and simple. Are we going to \nhave new programs and more Government or are we going to have stronger \nfamilies with less tax burden?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If my colleague will yield, I would also note the \nindividuals who have contacted various offices around here signing on \nto this very issue. This is a lady from Indiana who said this:\n\n       I can't tell you how disgusted we both are over this tax \n     issue. If we get married, not\n\n[[Page S8599]]\n\n     only would I forfeit my $900 refund check, we would be \n     writing a check to the IRS for $2,800. Darryl and I would \n     very much like to be married, and I must say it broke our \n     hearts when we found out we can't afford to get married.\n\n  This is from Indiana.\n  This gentleman from Ohio said:\n\n       I have been engaged to be married. My fiancee and I have \n     discussed the fact we will be penalized financially. We have \n     postponed the date of our marriage in order to save up and \n     have a running start in part because of this nasty unfair tax \n     structure.\n\n  Those are just two. And I have a number of other letters of people \nsaying: ``What is this? You guys are talking about family values and \nyou penalize us for getting married.'' And particularly the youngest \ncouples just getting started.\n  All we are asking for today is to let us vote on this issue, and we \nare being blocked. I am asking people not to vote for this cloture \nmotion, in order that we can vote to do away with this extraordinarily \nbad tax that is taxing those fundamental family-building units, the \nmarriage institution that we need so much to be so much stronger.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I have to answer the question of the Senator from \nKansas in the affirmative. I understand that. I am aware of it, and I \nreally think that we have a chance to say to the American people: Look, \nwe want to give you a wedding present. We would like to say to you that \nwe are no longer going to make it tough on you if you do the most \nimportant thing to sustain this culture in the time to come.\n  I am a little distressed that this body does not want to let us \nconfront that issue--I mean, there are Members of the body who do not--\nand that cloture would keep us from being able to make a priority the \nwell-being of America's families, so we do not take care of ourselves \nin the legislative appropriations bill and ignore the families of \nAmerica with the elimination of the marriage penalty tax. I hope \nMembers of this body will vote against cloture. Let us vote so we have \nthe possibility of addressing the needs of American families.\n  I, for one, commend the Senator from Kansas for his outstanding \neffort in this respect. At some point we simply have to stop business \nas usual, continuing to tax these families, taking an average of $1,400 \na year off their tables, out of their budgets. When they sit down to \nfigure out, ``What can we spend this year,'' $1,400 is more than a \nvacation. Lots of families can take a little time off. But it may be \nschool books, it may be school clothing, it may have to do with whether \nthey can--well, I am sure there are many things that individuals look \nat, for $1,400 a year.\n  It is time for us simply to say: Before we continue to balloon \nGovernment, before we consume this $520 billion surplus, before we rush \nto governmentalize that, we should say at least some portion of this, a \nmodest portion, far less than half, far less than a third, could \nsustain total relief for America's families by eliminating the marriage \npenalty--and it ought to be done. It should provide individuals the \nopportunity to say, ``We will be married, we will have durable \nfamilies,'' and it should stop taking from families who are staggering \nunder the tax load, it should stop those families from being further \ninjured when the Government comes and says, ``We simply think we are \nmore important than you are,'' especially as it relates to the surplus \nmoney that is supposed to be here--as a result of the hard work of the \nAmerican people. I started to say this money is coming as a result of \nthe Congressional Budget Office's estimation. What arrogance that would \nbe. We do not bring money to Washington. Money comes to Washington \nbecause people work hard, because they are entrepreneurs, because they \nget up early and stay up late--take care of their kids.\n  I thank the Senator from Kansas. I know there are others here wishing \nto speak. I just say eliminating the marriage penalty is important to \nthe future of the United States of America. We should vote against \ncloture because we need to have the opportunity to provide this relief \nto America's families.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this morning to support, in a small \nway, the efforts of my colleagues from Kansas and from Missouri, \ntalking about how to abolish the marriage penalty and help instill \nAmerican values into the U.S. Tax Code. I applaud them for their \ncontinual efforts to bring this issue to the floor, to continue to talk \nabout the need for us to take a very hard look at this and hopefully \ncreate the means of eliminating this very unfair tax on American \nfamilies.\n  Since the founding days of this Nation, the family has always been \nconsidered to be the bedrock of American society, the first unit of \nGovernment. Strong families make strong communities, and strong \ncommunities are what has made a strong America. For generations, our \nancestors built this country on that very foundation, and the \nGovernment respected that tradition by ensuring that its laws did not \nusurp the family role.\n  Then how do we explain the existence of the marriage penalty, a piece \nof Government tax trickery that actually penalizes couples who choose \nto commit to a family through marriage? Let me read to you, this \nmorning, from a study of the marriage penalty prepared by the National \nCenter for Policy Analysis.\n\n       Prior to 1948, the Tax Code made no distinction between \n     married couples and individuals. In that year, Congress \n     changed the law to allow income splitting. In effect, couples \n     were taxed like two single taxpayers even if only one had \n     earned income. The result was to sharply lower taxes for \n     married couples. In short, a de facto subsidy for marriage \n     was created.\n       By 1969, the magnitude of this subsidy had grown to such an \n     extent that it was possible for a single person to pay 40 \n     percent more in taxes than a married couple with the same \n     income.\n       This led Congress to create, for married and unmarried \n     people, separate tax schedules [that were] designed to reduce \n     the subsidy to no more than 20 percent.\n       An unintended consequence of the 1969 law change was to \n     create a marriage penalty for the first time.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Go ahead.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding that there are more couples who \nbenefit from the Tax Code when they get married than those who are \npenalized, is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAMS. I am not sure, but when you look at couples across the \ncountry who are unfairly paying $29 billion or 21 million couples \nacross the country who are unfairly paying about $29 billion a year in \ntaxes--if there are some discrepancies, we should look at all of it. \nBut what we should not do is penalize those families who are paying an \naverage of $1,400 a year more, just because of the way the codes are \nset up.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. So, let me ask the Senator a question. If the code, in \nfact, benefits more families who get married--in other words, their \ntaxes go down--than those who are penalized by getting married, the \nSenator from Minnesota is not suggesting that we want to change the \ncode and make it so that it will be the opposite, is he?\n  Mr. GRAMS. No, I am not. What I want to do is reduce the tax burden \non families all across the board, but to start right away with what is \nthe most unfair tax.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, I certainly support that. I think \nwe did vote--did we not vote on this when it came to the tobacco \nlegislation? Didn't Senator Gramm, from Texas, offer an amendment on \nthis marriage penalty?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Yes, it did pass.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It did pass. And we have already had a vote on this \nquestion. And that became one of the burdens carried by the tobacco \nbill, if I am not mistaken, was it not?\n  Mr. GRAMS. That was part of that legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would just say to the Senator as well, that I have \nlistened carefully to the speeches and I marvel at the suggestion that \nthere are people who are so much in love and ready to get married, and \nnext check that with accountants and decide not to. I haven't run into \nthose folks, but I am sure there are some out there like them. But I \nthank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMS. When my colleague says he hasn't run into those folks, I \nhave, and I concur with what the other Senators said, that they have. I \nhave had a number of couples come up to me, whether at airports or at \nmeetings or at other times, and tell me exactly the same thing the \nother Senators have said. They have actually planned around this, \nwhether they have delayed\n\n[[Page S8600]]\n\nthe marriage for a year--I even had one elderly gentleman tell me he \ncalled his wife from the accountant, he was 79 years old, and he said \nto his wife, ``I think we need to get a divorce.'' She was kind of \nshocked by it and she said, ``Why?'' And he said, ``Because we would be \nmuch better off if we were filing single.'' And then he went through \nthe explanation.\n  So this is not something that has gone by Americans, and especially \nfamilies, and especially dual-income families. So I think there are \nmany out there who are aware of this. When it comes to a difference of \n$3,500 a year, for those first years I think a lot of families are \nthinking very strongly about it.\n  But just briefly, I want to wrap this up and give a couple of minutes \nto my other colleagues here. But I just think, when we look at the \nnumbers, Washington created this ``unintended consequence'' within the \nTax Code, that, as I mentioned, penalized some 21 million American \ncouples to a tune of about $29 billion a year. I remember President \nClinton saying at a news conference not too long ago that he agreed \nthis was an unfair tax, but he also had to put in a qualifier, ``But \nWashington cannot do without money. This $29 billion is too important \nfor Washington to give up.'' In other words, we are willing, bottom \nline, to impose an unfair tax on many of our American families just so \nWashington can have a few additional dollars--if you count $29 billion \nas a few additional dollars--to have that at the end of the year.\n  According to the CBO, couples at the bottom end of the income scale \nwho incur penalties paid in, on an average, nearly $800. When we talk \nabout low income and we want go give them a tax break--they paid an \nadditional $800 in taxes. That represented about 8 percent of their \nincome. Repeal the penalty and those low-income families will \nimmediately receive an 8-percent increase in their income.\n  So my constituents have been very clear on this issue. As I \nmentioned, many have come and talked to me. Many have written letters. \nOne wrote:\n\n       This tax clearly penalizes those who marry and are trying \n     to possibly raise a family by working two jobs just to make \n     ends meet. Our tax laws need to give the proper incentives \n     encouraging marriage and upholding its sacred institutions.\n\n  Mr. President, I couldn't agree more.\n  Also, we began to add some real reform last year with the passage of \na $500-per-child tax credit. It is a small step, but in the right \ndirection. This Congress should do everything in its power to promote \nfamily life, to return the family to its rightful place as the center \nof American society. Whether lawmakers intended it or not, Congress \ncreated the marriage penalty and it rests on Congress to take it back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has 57 seconds.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I want to explain to Members what is taking place \nhere. Yesterday I filed an amendment to the legislative appropriations \nbill that would eliminate the marriage penalty we have been talking \nabout this morning. My amendment, which is being cosponsored by several \nSenators, would reinstate income splitting and provide married couples \nwho currently labor under this Tax Code with some relief. I tried to \noffer my amendment last Friday with spending legislation that was \noriginally supposed to be debated. However, because of objections from \nthe Democrat side of the aisle to the unanimous consent request that \nwould have guaranteed a vote on eliminating the marriage penalty, we \nhave not been able to get a vote on the elimination of the marriage \npenalty.\n  Later in the day, another UC was propounded that would have allowed \nthe Senate to move forward with the legislative branch appropriations \nbill but without my amendment, and to that UC I objected. Subsequently, \nthe cloture motion was filed to bring debate about tax relief to a \nclose and move forward with this legislation.\n  I am asking my colleagues today to vote against this cloture motion \nso we can consider the marriage penalty that is being objected to by my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/21/senate-section/article/S8597-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have asked for this time this morning \nbecause this is the last week I will be here for a while. As of a week \nfrom today, I will have traded in my 1921 knees for some 1998 models. \nAnd during the time that I will be absent, the credit union issue will \ncome up before the Senate. Now, I could duck the issue and probably \nmake out all right, but I do not operate that way, and I feel I should \nnot merely lay out for the record my views about this piece of \nlegislation, but I should speak them publicly so that they can be \nknown.\n  Mr. President, I suspect that most, if not all, Senators will agree \nthat a certain type of democracy has, without question, been at work in \nterms of the astounding number of postcards and letters, faxes, \ntelephone calls, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, from representatives \nof the credit union industry at all levels. It would be an \nunderstatement, in fact, to describe the deluge as merely an impressive \ncampaign. It is far more than that.\n  I have been around this place for quite a while, and I have spent \nmany hours meeting with citizens on both sides of the credit union \nlegislation that the Senate will shortly consider. I have seen North \nCarolinians who support H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access \nAct, and I have seen and visited with North Carolinians who are opposed \nto it.\n  In any case, the supporters of this bill are an important segment of \nour community. Credit unions provide basic, efficient, and affordable \nfinancial services. And I have to say for the record that North \nCarolina's credit unions do good work in providing for the needs of \ncountless of their fellow hard-working Tar Heels.\n  Mr. President, it may be of interest to Senators from other States \nthat this debate began in Randolph County, NC, which is the home of \nRichard Petty. And anybody who does not know who Richard Petty is, see \nme after I finish these remarks and I will fill them in on who Richard \nPetty is.\n  In February of this year, after a 7-year court battle, the Supreme \nCourt handed down its decision on the case titled National Credit Union \nAdministration v. First National Bank & Trust Co., which was a lawsuit \ninvolving several North Carolina financial institutions.\n  It may be that a bit of history will be useful at this point. Credit \nunions, as clarified in the preamble of the Federal Credit Union Act of \n1934, were created by Congress ``to make more available to people of \nsmall means credit for provident purposes.''\n  In order to serve these individuals of ``small means,'' credit unions \nwere awarded back then specific benefits that others did not have in \nconnection with their carrying out a clearly defined purpose, which was \nto provide essential basic financial services.\n  Now then, these benefits, including exemptions from Federal taxes and \nthe extraordinarily burdensome Community Reinvestment Act, CRA, as it \nis known around this place--have enabled the credit union industry to \nserve their customers with a marketplace advantage--very clearly an \nadvantage--not allowed to other insured depository competitors which \nmust pay taxes and which must abide by complex Federal regulations, \nwhich credit unions do not have to do.\n\n  In the early 1980s, the National Credit Union Administration used its \nregulatory power for significant alteration and expansion of the \noriginal intent of the Federal Credit Union Act.\n  Specifically, in 1982, the NCUA allowed credit unions to expand their \nmemberships to include multiple employer groups, an action which \neffectively eliminated the meaning of the common bond. This, in fact, \nwas the precise holding of the Supreme Court's February 1998 decision.\n  When this debate started, some shrewd Washington lobbyists--and that \nis about the best I can describe them--these lobbyists circulated the \nnotion that the Supreme Court's intent was--now get this, Mr. \nPresident--the intent of the Supreme Court, they said, was to kick \npeople out of their credit unions.\n  But what happened? Credit union members promptly began calling and \nwriting to me, and all other Senators, I am sure, pleading with us to \nprotect their right to remain members of their credit unions.\n  Mr. President, that of course never was in doubt, and these lobbyists \nknew it. But they struck fear in the hearts of the credit union \nmembers; hence the deluge of telephone calls and faxes and letters and \nvisits and all the rest of it.\n  In no way--let me say this as plainly as I can--in no way will these \nmembership rights be revoked from citizens who were credit union \naccount holders prior to the February 25, 1998, Supreme\n\n[[Page S8602]]\n\nCourt decision. I hope I have nailed down that falsehood pretty well.\n  Parenthetically, Mr. President, it should be made clear that such \nrevocation has never--never--been remotely considered by anybody. It \nwould have been fundamentally unfair for anybody to even think of it. \nIt should also be emphasized that the banking industry is unanimously \nsupportive of the position that it would be unfair.\n  Mr. President, I am persuaded that many Senators may have been \nincorrectly persuaded by the deluge of contacts with their constituents \nthat small bankers are attempting to take away the account rights of \ncredit union members, which, in fairness, Mr. President, is an absolute \nfalsehood, and even the lobbyists who contend otherwise are bound to \nhave known and know to this moment that it is false.\n  Let the record be clear, nobody--nobody--has a membership in a credit \nunion where that membership depends on passing legislation that will \nallow the unrestrained expansion of credit unions.\n  Now, the fact is, most traditional credit unions were not, nor ever \nwill be, affected by the Supreme Court decision of last February. The \nfact is, in that decision the Supreme Court supported the original \nstatutory intent of the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 that credit \nunions must have a common bond, that is to say, some reason to be \nconsidered as a group. In fact, the Court was unanimous in its \ninterpretation of the law, identical in effect to the way it was \nwritten way back in 1934.\n  All right. You see, Mr. President, most credit unions operate under \nthe definition of a ``common bond,'' as was clearly the intent of the \nFederal Credit Union Act.\n\n  Mr. President, most credit unions will continue to operate and the \nmembers will continue to benefit from their regulatory tax-exempt \nstatus--taxes that their competitors have to pay.\n  Now, the point is unmistakably clear. The only credit unions affected \nare credit unions that have expanded, in clear violation of the Federal \nCredit Union Act of 1934 which the Court upheld this year. The \nviolation of this Federal Credit Union Act has been done in several \nways--primarily by the unlawful inclusion of hundreds of groups, large \nand small, and thousands upon thousands of employees of these hundreds \nof groups.\n  Now, the change in the National Credit Union Administration \nregulatory policy launched the credit union industry into an era of \nunprecedented growth. For example, in the 8 months following the \nregulatory change, one credit union added more than 1,000 different \ngroups. That was done in less than 8 months' time.\n  No longer were credit unions required to represent groups of \nindividuals with common workplace or geographic interests, but hundreds \nof unrelated groups not joined by any commonality. Larger credit unions \nhave used this newfound freedom to an advantage at the expense of their \nfinancial competitors.\n  This legislation--and the name of it, just for the Record, is the \nCredit Union Membership Access Act; the number is H.R. 1151--this \nlegislation proposes to codify, to place into law, the NCUA 1982 \nregulatory interpretation and thereby invite another major expansion of \nthe credit union industry. H.R. 1151 proposes to authorize multibonded \ncredit unions to bring in groups of up to 3,000 members--a number, by \nthe way, which NCUA can waive at its discretion--and would effectively \nallow credit unions to target every entity in the United States.\n  Now, the Bureau of the Census has declared that 99.9 percent of the \nbusinesses in the United States employ fewer than 3,000 workers. So you \nsee the practical effect of allowing multibonded credit unions to bring \ninto their membership groups which have less than 3,000 members would \neffectively repeal all limits of expansion on the credit unions which \npay no taxes.\n  In summary, H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access Act, soon \nto be the pending business in the Senate, is a long way from the \noriginal concept and intent of the very clear common bond. According to \nthe NCUA, to qualify for this tax-subsidized service--and that is what \nit is--one would simply have to walk in and sign up. It follows that \nmany credit unions are moving beyond their original purpose of aiding \nindividuals of ``small means'' with basic services. In fact, already \nsuch things as professional sports teams, yacht clubs, law firms, \ncountry clubs, and many, many others now have their own credit unions. \nI suggest that this exceeds any rational definition of individuals \nliving by ``small means.''\n  In all fairness, the reason I am here this morning is H.R. 1151 does \nnot qualify as simply a pro-credit union bill. It is really, if you \nwant to call it what it is, an anti-competitiveness bill. If Congress \nwants to alter the intended dimensions of credit unions, Congress \nshould be willing to say so clearly and not hide behind the guise--and \nthat is what it is--that the intent of the soon-to-be pending \nlegislation is to protect credit unions following the Supreme Court's \nruling.\n  Now, then, in realty, Congress is setting the stage for the expansion \nand growth of the credit union industry into thousands upon thousands \nof new markets well into the 21st century, while continuing to be \nexempt from paying the Federal taxes that the competitors down Main \nStreet have to pay.\n  If the credit union industry wants to expand its presence in the \nfinancial marketplace and increase its ability to offer various \nservices to more and more groups--in short, if they want to operate \nlike community banks--I commend their ambition because I believe that \nthe banking industry will and should welcome them into the marketplace \nas long as credit unions are required to live under the very same tax \nstructure and the very same regulatory morass that America's small \ncommunity banks and small town bankers live with every day.\n  Let me be clear, as I wind up, that I oppose both higher taxes and \nburdensome regulation. If Congress chooses to allow credit union growth \nwithout taxation and without costly regulations, then let's be fair and \ndo the same for America's community bankers, the small bankers who are \ncompeting for the same core of business without the benefit of a \nFederal subsidy paid by the American taxpayer.\n  It is unfortunate that the debate on this legislation up to now has \npitted the banking interests versus the interests of the credit union \nindustry. The debate should be about the willingness of Congress to \nprovide a level and fair playing field for all financial interests. Is \nit equitable for credit unions, comprised of countless hundreds of \ngroups and assets in the billions, to have a competitive advantage over \nsmall bankers who are competing for the same business? I am convinced \nthe obvious answer to that is no. Unless and until this becomes a \ndebate about fairness in the marketplace instead of a politically \nexpedient response to a shrewd and energetic lobbying campaign, I \ncannot and will not support such misguided and tragically misunderstood \nlegislation.\n  In closing, a few personal observations: Earlier, I mentioned the \nenormous public relations campaign crafted by lobbyists for the credit \nunion industry. I am confident that every Senator's office has \nexperienced this full court press.\n  This past week, in fact, a rally was staged right here on Capitol \nHill by several thousand credit union supporters who had been brought \nto Washington to demand immediate passage of H.R. 1151, without \namendments.\n  Now, I am genuinely impressed by the willingness of the credit union \nindustry's supporters to travel to Washington to express their support \nfor H.R. 1151. However, I must question the actions of some of the \nlobbyists who staged this demonstration on the Capitol steps and used \ndistortion and half-truths and even untruths to get their message \nacross. This undermines the integrity of the people who they purport to \nrepresent. I hope in the future they will use greater care in \nrepresenting their constituencies.\n  So this debate boils down to an issue of fairness. Most Senators, \nincluding myself, have friends on both sides. I take great care in \ntrying to ensure that the small guy, whether he is a bank customer or a \ncredit union member, is given a fair and equal deal, the level playing \nfield that we so often hear so much about. This bill does not represent \na level playing field. Congress amended the Federal Credit Union Act in \n1937 to give tax-exempt status to federally chartered credit\n\n[[Page S8603]]\n\nunions to serve a narrow purpose, not to give a distinct market \nadvantage over their competition with the small bank down the street.\n  Now, it must be said that many credit unions such as the U.S. Senate \nFederal Credit Union, right here on Capitol Hill, have used this \nadvantage judiciously in serving their clearly defined customer base.\n  The employees of the Senate are their customer base. They won't lose \ntheir membership. Nobody is about to lose their membership. That is all \nhogwash. Unfortunately, too many other large credit unions have \nexpanded the reach of their tax-exempt status far beyond the original \ncongressional intent--extending their Government-subsidized services to \ninclude hundreds upon hundreds of unrelated groups and businesses.\n  I say again, as a result of this tax-free status and their exemption \nfrom Federal regulations that require other financial institutions to \nreinvest in low-income areas, credit unions are able to offer deals on \nloan rates and checking accounts that most community banks simply \ncannot match.\n  It gives me no pleasure to stand here and take this stand, Mr. \nPresident. I could have kept silent and gone on down to North Carolina \nto have my sore knees fixed. But I am obliged to say, in conclusion, \nthat if we allow credit unions to expand tax free and act more and more \nlike banks, then we should at least try to ensure that there is a level \nplaying field for all similar financial institutions. If we tax the \nbanking industry, the small bankers, we should tax the credit unions--\nbut I don't think we should tax either one of them. If we are to force \nbanks to function under burdensome community reinvestment regulations, \nshouldn't we support equally demanding regulations for credit unions? \nIs this not, in the final analysis, just an issue of fairness? It would \nbe simpler and easier for me to keep silent, but my conscience would \nnot let me do so. I cannot engage in that luxury. I felt obliged to \ntake my stand and I have done so.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at the end of this week, Vice \nPresident Gore is scheduled to depart for Moscow to conduct meetings in \npreparation for a summit meeting between President Clinton and \nPresident Yeltsin in September. I believe this meeting and the future \nsummit is really long overdue and extraordinarily important. I would \nlike to take a few minutes to speak about the relationship between our \ncountry and the new Russia.\n  United States-Russian relations today stand at a critical juncture. \nIt has been almost a decade since the end of the cold war, and although \nwe have made great strides in reestablishing the friendship that \ncharacterized relations between our two countries in the recent past, \nwe have yet to establish the basis for the kind of partnership that is \nadequate to guide our two nations into the next century.\n  The Russian Federation is nearly twice the size of the continental \nUnited States. It covers 11 time zones, with a population of close to \n150 million people. Lest we not forget, Russia is a country with a \nnuclear arsenal capable of annihilating the Earth many times over.\n  Few countries on this Earth have undergone the sort of wrenching \npolitical, economic, and social transformation that Russia is now going \nthrough. While China has moved slowly and carefully to release \ncentralized control over its economy, the Russian model has moved \nrapidly, in a macro way, to embrace both economic and social democracy.\n  Today, Russia remains fragile. The United States has a huge stake in \nwhat happens now. Our goal must be to see that Russia remains a stable, \nmodern state, democratic in its governance, abiding by its constitution \nand its laws, market-oriented and prosperous in its economic \ndevelopment, at peace with itself and with the rest of the world. A \nRussia that reflects these aspirations is likely to be part of the \nsolution, rather than part of the problem, to world peace.\n  Conversely, a Russia that erects barriers against what it sees as a \nhostile world, that believes the best defense is a good offense--such a \nRussia could be in the 21st century just as it was for much of the 20th \ncentury--one of the biggest problems the United States and the rest of \nthe world will face.\n  Russia may be down as a major power, but it is far from out. Although \nit is all too easy for some to look at Russia today and conclude that \nit is not a country that demands attention as a top U.S. foreign policy \npriority, that, in my mind, would be a grievous error in judgment. To \nplace United States-Russian relations in a secondary category of \nconcern is a surefire recipe for disaster. The United States has an \nenormous stake in the outcome of the present Russian struggle for \ndemocracy and free markets.\n  I believe that it is in Russia's own interests to conduct a concerted \neffort against the antidemocratic forces and the ultra nationalistic \nones, against crime and corruption and, yes, against old Soviet \nattitudes and habits. This is the course which the government of \nPresident Yeltsin has undertaken, and he has done it despite many \nimpediments that still stand in the way.\n  Too often we have been quick to point out the shortcomings and \nimperfections of the Yeltsin government and of Russia--and as recent \nquestions regarding Russian assistance to the Iranian missile program \nindicate, there is some reason for deep concern.\n  I am fully supportive of the President's decision last week to \nsanction nine Russian companies for cooperation with Iran. In my mind, \nRussia's assistance to Iran indicates just how far Russia has yet to \ntravel if it wants to be a full partner with the United States in the \ninternational community. But I must also note that the cooperation that \nRussia now provides is a welcome reversal of its stance of a few years \nago. I hope that this new level of cooperation is a major harbinger of \nthings to come.\n  Indeed, for those who care to look, there have been many positive \ndevelopments in Russia over the past years--positive developments that \ninclude President Yeltsin's constitutionally based election and \nreelection in 1996, the defeat of hyperinflation, the end of the war in \nChechnya in 1997, the signing of the NATO-Russia Founding Act, and \nsuccessful Russian participation in joint peacemaking operations in \nBosnia.\n  Russia has also made enormous strides in integrating into global \neconomic and regional economic institutions, including the World Bank, \nthe International Monetary Fund, the ASEAN Regional Forum, the Council \nof Europe, the Paris Club, and more. Russia has strengthened its ties \nto the European Union and is active in the United Nations and \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n  That is not to say Russian reform has scored a knockout blow against \ncrime and corruption, or that the Russian economy is home free. In \nfact, the current economic crisis and resulting political instability \npresents the new democracy with its greatest challenge to date.\n  The package agreed to last week by Russia and the International \nMonetary Fund provides significant funding, we hope, to stabilize the \nRussian economy, and it contains major fiscal reform elements, \nincluding tax reform, some of which are going to be put in place, as \nwell as far-reaching structural reforms to increase growth and free-\nmarket competition. It represents an important pledge by Russia to \ncontinue the development of a free-market democracy, and it is an \nimportant vote by the international community in the importance of this \nnew Russia.\n  Russia may still be struggling, but it is my belief that it is on the \ncusp of a constructive interaction in the international community as a \ndemocracy. This must be encouraged. As one analyst wrote about World \nWar II era Germany and Japan, ``There are no dangerous peoples; there \nare only dangerous situations, which are the result, not of laws of \nnature or history, or of national character or charter, but of \npolitical arrangements.''\n\n[[Page S8604]]\n\n  In Russia today, there is a growing ultranationalism which represents \na major threat to its progress as a democracy, and we must be cognizant \nof that.\n  It will take courage for Russia to look to the future positively, to \nabandon obsolete thinking, to reassess its national security needs and \ninterests in light of new alliances. It will require a high level of \ndetermination and hard work by our country to work with Russia to \ndevelop these institutions, institutions which can encourage the growth \nof democracy and free markets and lead to a more stable and cooperative \nand prosperous new Russia.\n  But if future generations are to be spared the danger, the expense, \nand the terror faced by my generation in dealing with Russia, if we are \ntruly to reap the benefits of the end of the cold war, we cannot stand \nby and wait to see whether democracy and free markets will survive in \nRussia.\n  In more concrete terms, I believe that the time is ripe for a full-\nscale, high-level, new initiative towards Russia as we approach the \n21st century.\n  The Vice President's trip and this September's summit, I hope, will \ncontribute greatly toward this process, but the Senate bears a special \nresponsibility for the conduct of our Nation's foreign policy. We must \nplay a role, too.\n  This initiative, I believe, should focus on ways in which the United \nStates can work effectively with the new Russia to strengthen and \nencourage democratization; to support efforts by the IMF and the \ninternational community to assist Russia's economy to make the full \ntransition to free markets; to examine and revise outdated legislation \nwhich has created roadblocks and bottlenecks in United States-Russian \nrelations and which place United States firms doing business in Russia \nat a competitive disadvantage; to provide help in the fight against \ncorruption and organized criminal enterprise in Russia; to expedite \nexisting United States resources now available through OPIC, the \nEximbank, and other financial institutions through the development of \nfast-track type programs which cut red tape for worthy business \nprojects and investments; to encourage and expand existing academic, \ncultural, and other exchange programs, including those between the \nCongress and the Duma which aim to support Russia's reformers; and, \nfinally, to work to fully integrate Russia as an equal partner in the \ninternational political, economic, and security institutions.\n  We must understand how the right kind of foreign assistance can play \na crucial role in assuring Russian economic growth and vitality. And we \nmust understand how our assistance can help create the ability for \nRussia to consolidate its gains and provide the opportunity for Russia \nto work out its national identity and destiny in ways which will \ncomplement American interests.\n  None of this will be easy and all of it will require sustained \neffort. To that end, the Vice President's trip this week is a first \nmajor step. And to that end also, I hope to be able to work with the \nchairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee of this \nbody to conduct hearings to examine the nature and future direction of \nUnited States policy toward Russia. From these hearings I hope we can \ndevelop legislation to address United States policy in the areas I have \noutlined above, and to strengthen United States-Russian ties in an \nappropriate way.\n  I deeply believe that this relationship needs the most intensive \nconcern and interaction at the present time. We must give Russia both \ntime and opportunity to consolidate the reforms that constitute the \ngood news of the past few years, to work with them to beat back the \nforces that threaten this progress, and to assist them to become a \nstable, prospering, democratic republic which can be a partner for \nworld peace in the next century.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. \nIndividuals from strong families contribute to society. In an era when \nnearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve \ninto divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor \nthose who have taken seriously the commitment of ``till death us do \npart'', demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, \nhonor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Elsie and David \nDrake of Springfield, Missouri, who on July 26, 1998, will celebrate \ntheir 50th wedding anniversary. Many things have changed in the 50 \nyears this couple has been married, but the values, principles, and \ncommitment this marriage demonstrates are timeless. As this couple \ncelebrates their 50th year together with family and friends, it will be \napparent that the lasting legacy of this marriage will be the time, \nenergy, and resources invested in their children, church, and \ncommunity. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we celebrate a \nsimilar milestone.\n  The Drakes exemplify the highest commitment to the relentless \ndedication and sacrifice. Their commitment to the principles and values \nof their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/21/senate-section/article/S8604-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2260) making appropriations for the Departments \n     of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me begin to address this issue. I know \nSenator Hollings is on his way to the floor, the ranking Democrat, who \nhas worked so conscientiously on this, along with his staff and my \nstaff. This is the appropriations bill which covers some very core \nagencies that the Federal Government has responsibility for, \nspecifically areas of Justice, things like the FBI, the DEA, the INS; \nareas within Commerce--many areas, of course, are covered by the \nCommerce Department including, of course, the census issue. Equally \nimportant, in fact more important in many ways are ITA and NOAA, two \nagencies that deal with the manner in which the U.S. economy functions \nand the manner in which our environment is reviewed. We try to stay \nahead of weather conditions.\n  In addition, this bill has the State Department--obviously the State \nDepartment is a core function of the Federal activity--and the \njudiciary, which is the third branch of the Government, that is also \nunder this bill, along with a number of independent agencies, agencies \nlike the FCC and the FTC and the Small Business Administration. So this \nis a bill that has broad reach and is a very significant item for the \nSenate to take up.\n  This funding bill has been put together as a result of the hard work \nof a lot of people. I especially thank my ranking member, Senator \nHollings, whose input and assistance is always invaluable on this \nissue. His background and knowledge of the questions which are raised \non this bill are extraordinary. I look to him for advice and counsel on \nmany issues. When we agree, we make great progress, which we have on \nthis bill. This bill was reported out of the committee unanimously.\n\n[[Page S8605]]\n\n  In addition, I thank my staff which has worked so hard, and minority \nstaff which has worked so hard, and the other members of the committee.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GREGG. During the pendency of this bill, I ask unanimous consent \nfloor privileges be made available to Jim Morhard, Paddy Link, Kevin \nLinskey, Carl Truscott, Dana Quam, Vas Alexopoulos, Kris Pickler, Lila \nHelms, Emelie East, Dereck Orr, and Virginia Wilbert.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. That request also included members of the minority staff.\n  Mr. President, this bill, S. 2260, is, as I mentioned, a bipartisan \nbill. It was reported out of committee unanimously. It is a bill that \nallocates $33.2 billion for fiscal year 1999. The bill provides $1.1 \nbillion more than was spent on these agencies last year. I will explain \nthe reasons for those increases as we go on. It is $3.6 billion less \nthan what the President requested.\n  It is a lean bill. There were difficult decisions that had to be \nmade. But the legislation supports the core functions which are \nrequired of these agencies while improving a number of activities \npursued by these agencies.\n  We provide $17.8 billion for the Justice Department. This includes \nfunds to combat terrorism, violence against women and children, illegal \ndrug running, and cybercrime, along with many other worthwhile \nprograms.\n  I am proud to say the committee included a total of $17.2 million to \nbolster programs that help law enforcers find and care for missing \nchildren. This bill furthers our goals of making communities safer for \nour children.\n  You may recall last year the committee increased funding for the FBI \nand the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to prevent \nthe use of the Internet to exploit children. Based on the follow-up \nhearings we held this year, I believe those funds have been put to good \nuse. The Center was involved in recovering 4,878 children this year \nwith an overall recovery rate of 90.3 percent. The Center increased the \nhours of operation for their phone tip hotline and created a web site \non the Internet for public use. The hotline, in conjunction with the \nweb site, should lead to more pedophile apprehension. The Center also \nprovides special training for local law enforcement people at the Jimmy \nRyce Law Enforcement Training Center about how to pursue missing \nchildren. This is a serious issue, missing children, and we are trying \nto address it aggressively in this bill.\n  As part of this effort, we have recommended $5.2 million for the FBI \nto combat child abductions and serial killing.\n  The FBI has put together an exceptional task force to address the \nissue of child abductions and serial killings.\n  The tragic school shootings in the past few months that have shocked \nthe Nation are also a concern of ours. According to the National School \nSafety Center, 25 students have been killed in U.S. schools since \nJanuary 1 of this year. This is the same number of students who were \nkilled for the full 1996 school year, but in half the time.\n  For this reason, the Senator from South Carolina and I created a new \nSafe Schools Initiative which provides $210 million to introduce a \npositive law enforcement presence in our school systems. By working \ntogether with educators and local communities, we believe law enforcers \ncan find ways to stop the escalation of murders and violence in our \nschools. The funding is found in three Department of Justice accounts: \n$175 million from Community Orientated Policing (COPS) for additional \nofficers; $25 million for the Juvenile At-Risk Children's Program for \nprevention efforts; and $10 million from the National Institute of \nJustice to develop new, more effective safety technologies. These funds \nwill be used by local law enforcers in partnership with schools and \ncommunities to develop programs to improve safety in our schools.\n  I congratulate and appreciate the support of the Senator from South \nCarolina in developing this new initiative. Our intention is to provide \neducators with the means to improve hostile environments. We must make \nsure that violence does not become a commonplace event in our school \nsystems.\n  In addition to this new Safe Schools Initiative, we fund many of the \nout-of-school programs for children that will likely be familiar to \nyou. We increase funding for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, for \nthe Big Brothers/Big Sisters program which brings young people together \nwith responsible adults willing to serve as long-term mentors. These \nprograms give students positive reinforcement while expanding their \nhorizons while taking up those hours of the day when students are most \nat risk --the time right after school.\n  There are prevention programs, such as the National Crime Prevention \nCouncil, whose well known mascots of McGruff and Scruff make learning \nsafety tips fun, or Parents Anonymous which advocates prevention of \nchild abuse and which will be creating an immediate-response system \nwith the fiscal year 1999 funding.\n  Many States have youth programs tailored to their communities, and \nthese communities may be eligible for Federal grants to assist in the \nareas of education, research, prevention, and rehabilitation. These are \nthe types of programs the committee is supporting by placing $284 \nmillion in the juvenile justice programs account.\n  I stress here that we have not tried to reinvent the wheel. We have \nsupported programs that work, and we have turned to communities to give \nus their ideas as to how these funds should be allocated.\n  Also in line with youth support, the committee is recommending $12 \nmillion to expand the Youth Gang Program and $95 million for incentive \ngrants for local delinquency programs, including $25 million to enforce \nunderage drinking laws.\n  Most of the programs I have mentioned are prevention programs to work \nwith youth, but there is more to this process. The committee, with help \nfrom the chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Youth Violence, \nadded $100 million for the juvenile accountable incentive block grant. \nThese funds will go towards functions that are in place to emphasize \naccountability to juveniles after they have committed crimes, such as \ndetention facilities and probation officers.\n  The committee recommends an increase to $282 million for the Violence \nAgainst Women Program. According to the Justice Department, violence by \nan intimate accounts for 21 percent of the violent crime experienced by \nwomen. Our legislation increases the number of law enforcers and \nprosecutors who will address these crimes. Our intent is to develop and \nimplement effective arrest and prosecution policies in order to provide \nbetter handling of crimes against women. Women ages 16 to 24 experience \nthe highest per capita crime rates of intimate violence. Therefore, the \ncommittee is providing $10 million within the funding level for the \nprevention of violence on college campuses. By doing so, we will be \nhelping the women who are most at risk.\n\n  Many of our colleagues are familiar with the story of Megan Kanka who \nwas killed by her neighbor, a convicted sex offender, in New Jersey in \n1994. Congress subsequently passed Megan's law that asks States to \nrequire its violent sex offenders to register their address with \ngovernment officials upon their release from prison. To further this \neffort, this bill contains $25 million for the National Sex Offender \nRegistry to identify, collect, and exchange sex offender data from the \nStates through an automated registry.\n  Further, the bill includes $45 million to assist States in improving \nthe automation, accuracy, and completeness of criminal history records. \nThis will facilitate the exchange of interstate information.\n  In addition, we add money for the DNA programs so that States will be \nable to communicate effectively with each other on the issues of DNA.\n  The balance that we tried to reach was between those areas of \nprevention where we can assist children, especially children in school, \nand give them leadership when they are out of school during those \ndifficult hours, with the need to have a tough enforcement process, and \nthat enforcement process has been adequately funded and aggressively \nfunded as a result, in large part, of the Senator who is sitting in the \nChair right now whose leadership on the issues of juvenile justice is \nprimary in this body.\n  Another area of Justice activity we have addressed is the terrorism \nissue.\n\n[[Page S8606]]\n\n Terrorism continues to be a primary concern and threat to our country, \nso the committee is continuing to support a strong counterterrorism \npolicy, something we began a couple of years ago with the work of \nSenator Hollings and myself.\n  The Attorney General is working on a counterterrorism strategy that \nshould be completed by the end of the year. We look forward to the \ncompletion of that plan, and we are recommending $224 million for \ncounterterrorism initiatives.\n  Our counterterrorism recommendation is comprehensive. A portion of \nthis funding will go to the first-responder training and equipment as \nthe Nation must be able to quickly react to a terrorist incident. \nAnother portion will provide funding for specific programs to build \nthis capacity, such as metropolitan medical strike team training and \nequipment, the acquisition of equipment for the largest cities and \nlocalities in the United States, the implementation of situational \nexercises, State and local bomb detection and technician equipment, and \nequipment grants for local fire and emergency agencies. The intent of \nthe committee is to provide direct assistance to the first responders \nas well as to guide our national policy toward a coordinated and \neffective response.\n  We also recommend significant funding for State and local law \nenforcers to have the same training and equipment as their Federal \ncounterparts. The committee recognizes the need for the Federal, State, \nand local law enforcers to work together, especially in addressing a \nterrorist attack.\n  We provide funding for the FBI to prepare for terrorist attacks. The \nissue of terrorism is a two-fold event--one of trying to stop it and \nanticipate it through intelligence and, second, trying to react when \nsuch an unfortunate incident occurs. We have aggressively funded the \nFBI initiatives.\n  As part of the counterterrorism effort, we enable the Attorney \nGeneral to quickly receive reimbursements from other agencies as well \nas to acquire the necessary equipment and services during a terrorist \ncrisis.\n  We have further requested the Attorney General to conduct a no-\nnotice, counterterrorism-readiness exercise involving the leadership of \nall pertinent agencies. We look forward to the results of that \nexercise.\n  This is just a brief summary of some of the elements of our \ncounterterrorism strategy. Obviously, some parts of it have to remain \nclassified, but our purpose is to have a comprehensive, all-\nencompassing response to what is clearly one of the biggest issues \nfacing our country.\n  Are we prepared for a terrorist attack at this time? No, we are not. \nAre we moving in the right direction to get prepared for such an \nattack? Yes, we are. Having visited almost all the agencies that are \ninvolved, those that are in our purview of jurisdiction and those \noutside our purview of jurisdiction, the one thing I have been most \nimpressed with is a sincere and genuine effort to have a coordinated \nresponse to this issue, and there appears to be very little in the way \nof a turf fight going on, which is absolutely critical that we avoid in \ntrying to address this issue.\n  In the area of drugs, we also have a major effort. The strategy \nincludes $24 million for DEA's methamphetamine initiative and $13 \nmillion for the heroin strategy. To also combat methamphetamine \nproduction and trafficking, we are recommending a $15.5 million \nmethamphetamine program through the COPS program.\n  The Senator from South Carolina and I have worked with the DEA \nAdministrator to create regional drug enforcement teams to address the \nstrategies of the cartels. The committee directs $21.8 million for this \neffort, and there is an additional $5.6 million provided to handle the \ninflux of violent drug-trafficking groups based in the Caribbean.\n  We included also $25 million for S. 1605, the ``Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Act,'' sponsored by my friend and colleague from Colorado, \nSenator Campbell, and signed by the President on June 16. This funding \nwill go to law enforcement officers for the purchase of bulletproof \nvests.\n  The committee recommends a new initiative which provides $144 million \nto improve law enforcement in Native American communities. The funds \ncome from a variety of agencies. However, we have seen, unfortunately, \nthat adequate law enforcement in Native American communities is \nwoefully lacking, and there are a number of initiatives which we have \nundertaken in this bill to try to assist those communities.\n  In the area of the INS, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, \nthis bill provides $3.9 billion. We want to equip the INS with the \nmeans to manage its two-pronged duty of law enforcement and legal \nimmigration. On the enforcement end, we are recommending an additional \n1,000 Border Patrol agents for the borders and a 100-person integrated \nteam designed to intercept illegal aliens traveling on highways in the \nSouth and Midwest in order to counteract problems arising in the \ninterior of the country.\n  When we take these 1,000 agents and add them on top of the 1,000 \nagents we put in last year, we are making a huge personnel expansion in \nthe INS in the area of the Border Patrol where the problem exists.\n  For the second prong, the administrative portion, we provide \nsufficient funding that is enhanced by technology. The INS construction \nand maintenance has been woefully under funded in the past years, and \nwe recommend more than a 33 percent increase. The $110 million level \nwill strengthen training, border control, and detention and \ndeportation.\n  Detention space shortfalls and the naturalization backlog will \nbenefit from the increased revenues from revived fees. Where possible, \nnew technology should ease the burden on our overworked personnel.\n  Of note, this bill does not address the INS reform issue. Reform is \nneeded in that agency, but it is too complex an issue to address in the \ncontext of this appropriations bill. Clearly, it needs to be addressed \nin the future and, hopefully, in the near term.\n  In the Commerce Department we have provided $4.9 billion. The \ncommittee provides funding requested by the President for the U.S. \nTrade Representative and the International Trade Commission, and a \nvariety of other international trade activities, including ITA, at \nfunding levels which are more than adequate to address the concerns in \ntrade which are so critical to strong commerce. Commerce Department \nprograms are supported specifically at a level that will adequately do \nthe job that is required.\n  In the area of the census, we have put in $848 million, over a half-\nmillion dollars. This is the amount that was requested. We have not \naddressed the issue of the question of the proper way to count the \ncensus. The decennial census is important not just for the \napportionment of Representatives in the House of Representatives but \nfor many of the formulas that create grants to the States.\n  The dress rehearsal for the census raised several issues which \ndeserve congressional scrutiny. This occurred recently in two cities in \nthe United States. Going into the dress rehearsal, the Census Bureau \ndid not have in place software which could detect duplicate or \nfraudulent census forms. The inability of the Bureau to test such an \nimportant system during the dress rehearsal is troubling.\n\n  The keystone of any census is the mailing list. In this bill, \nadditional funds are provided to assist the Bureau in ``re-\nengineering'' its mailing list. The forms returned as ``undeliverable \nas addressed'' during the rehearsal were twice the number estimated by \nthe Census Bureau. Mailing list problems varied in three locations in \nwhich the dress rehearsal was conducted.\n  The purpose of the dress rehearsal is, of course, to identify \nshortcomings which must be corrected in order for the decennial census \nto be successful. The Census Bureau is behind in its efforts to create \nits Master Address File for the decennial census. Also, reports of mail \naddress problems from the dress rehearsal do nothing to increase the \nconfidence that the address list ``re-engineering'' will be successful. \nDuring the dress rehearsal, maps for enumerators to follow up with \nthose not responding to the census were found to be hard to read and, \nin some instances, inaccurate.\n  A successful census will require a good mailing list, a way to detect \nfraudulent or duplicate forms, and maps to permit enumerators to follow \nup on nonresponsive citizens. We will\n\n[[Page S8607]]\n\nspend billions of dollars on the year 2000 census. We should expect \nthese basic elements to be in place for the dress rehearsal. They were \nnot, and this should concern every Senator.\n  We need to know what is going to happen with the census when it \noccurs. Clearly, there is a fight going on over whether there should be \nsampling. But one thing is obviously clear from the dress rehearsal: \nWhether there was sampling or whether there was not sampling--whether \nthere was a head count or not--the census is not ready to go forward \nand a lot needs to be done.\n  The bill funds the National Institute of Standards and Technology \n(NIST) programs at a level of $646.7 million. This level will enable \nNIST to upgrade its facilities and to build a state-of-the-art Advanced \nMeasurement Laboratory. NIST's activities are actually critical to \nAmerican industry. They are especially important now where exporters \nare running into trade barriers which are sometimes technically applied \nto them, and this can assist them in being more responsive to these \ntechnical barriers.\n  The committee also funds the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration (NOAA) at $2.2 billion. This exceeds the requested \nlevel. This committee is totally committed to being sure that we have a \nfirst-class NOAA effort. Clearly, in light of what we have seen from El \nNino and other weather events in this country in recent times, it is \nabsolutely critical that we have a strong Weather Service. And the need \nto expand our activity in the area of ocean activities is also equally \ncritical.\n  NOAA advises us that they are getting near to the ability to \nadequately forecast an El Nino type of event, and we intend to make \nsure they have the funds to accomplish that. In addition, this year's \nbudget request includes the Advanced Hydrological Prediction System, \nwhich should assist in forecasting floods in the Missouri flood basin, \nan absolutely critical issue, as well as the Advanced Weather \nInteractive Processing System which the National Weather Service needs.\n  Further, we have created a new Oceans Policy Commission. This is \nbasically the outgrowth of an initiative of, again, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina. As some may recall, NOAA was initially created under \nthe Nixon administration by Executive order. The idea for an agency to \nconduct research on oceans and atmosphere came as an outgrowth of the \nStratton Commission, which was created in the 1960s. I think it is fair \nto say that the Senator from South Carolina and I believe the time has \ncome to reinvigorate and assess the state of U.S. ocean policy and \nresearch. This commission will accomplish that.\n  In the area of the State Department and its related agencies, we have \nprovided $5.6 billion. We are totally committed to modernizing the \ninformation technology and facilities, and especially housing, of the \nState Department. The committee recommended $118 million, the full \nrequest, for computers and communications equipment. This funding is an \nessential part of achieving the year 2000 compliance. Another $5 \nmillion is provided for systems unique to the United States Information \nAgency. And $550 million, approximately, is provided for the security \nand maintenance account, and $52.9 million is allocated for desperately \nneeded housing. Finally, we fund the design of two new chanceries in \nBeijing and Berlin and anticipate funding the construction in next \nyear's bill.\n  As for the international accounts, the committee recommends $1.1 \nbillion for international organizations and $431 million for \npeacekeeping. Though the administration did not request it, the \ncommittee recommendation includes $475 million for arrears. The $475 \nmillion is consistent with the State Department authorization bill and \nthe 1998 budget resolution. This year's payment brings the total \navailable for arrears to $575 million. That is the amount that the U.N. \nrequested. And we are on course to full funding of the arrears. With a \nstroke of the pen, the President can restore the credibility of the \nUnited States at the U.N. by simply signing the appropriate legislation \n--specifically, the State Department authorization bill which was \nagreed to. So the Congress has done its part and continues to do its \npart on funding the arrears issue.\n  The problem lies with the White House.\n  Finally, because of the crisis in India and Pakistan, we fully fund \nthe Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.\n  In the area of the Judiciary, out of a total of $3.6 billion, we \nrecommended full funding for the Judiciary's highest priorities: court \nsecurity, defender services, and the Supreme Court. The remaining \naccounts receive increases across the board, although not all at levels \nthat they were requested. We also include a cost-of-living adjustment \nfor the justices and the judges.\n  We, as I mentioned, have a number of independent agencies. In regard \nto the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), we are funding that at \nthe levels they requested. However, there remains the issue of the \nPortals II building. I am sure there will be considerable discussion of \nthat before we complete this bill, but the fact is that there has been \ngross mismanagement relative to the Portal II building. The FCC should \nnot be forced into moving into a building that does not meet its \nrequirements from the standpoint of technology or security, and that \nbuilding is really a total affront to the taxpayers of this country--\nthat being the fact that we continue to pay for uninhabited space which \nis uninhabitable space as well as being uninhabited.\n  In the Federal Trade Commission, we have aggressively worked with the \nleadership of the Federal Trade Commission, Chairman Pitofsky, to \npursue an aggressive program on telemarketing fraud. Consumers lose \nanywhere from $3 billion to up to $40 billion a year as a result of \ntelemarketing fraud. We are seeing a great expansion of this activity, \nespecially on the Internet. The committee is working with the \nCommission and has set up a new program to try to address this, \nincluding an 800 number. The Commission feels quite confident this will \nhave a significant impact on the problem.\n  The Small Business Administration is also funded at a high level, \n$613 billion. Of this, $240.8 million goes to business loans and $94 \nmillion goes for the disaster loan account.\n  Of concern to the committee is the administration's request to \nincrease the disaster loan interest rate. This request was soundly \nrejected. The committee has made it clear to the SBA and the \nadministration that increasing the interest rates on loans to Americans \nwho have experienced disasters is unacceptable. The administration \nshould reverse its ill-considered proposal to make disaster victims pay \nmarket rates for assistance in recovering from economic injury.\n  I thank the Senator from South Carolina for his strong assistance in \nhelping with this bill. There is a great deal more to talk about, and I \nam sure we will have plenty of time to do that as we proceed forward.\n  I thank the Senator from South Carolina for his courtesy for that \nlong statement. I understand we may break at 12:30, so he may want to \nreserve his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I think the distinguished chairman has \nstated it extremely well.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join my Subcommittee Chairman and \ncolleague, Senator Gregg, in presenting to the Senate S. 2260, the \nFiscal Year 1999 Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary and \nrelated agencies appropriations bill. Once again, I would like to \ncommend Chairman Gregg for his outstanding efforts and bipartisan \napproach in bringing to the floor a bill that--given the number of \npriorities we have been asked to address within our limited 302(b) \nallocations--is good and balanced.\n  In the Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations bill, we fund a \nwide variety of Federal programs. We fund the FBI, the DEA, the State \nDepartment and our embassies overseas, fisheries research, the National \nWeather Service and weather satellites, the Supreme Court, the Federal \nCommunications Commission, and the list goes on and on. In total, this \nbill provides $33.2 billion in budget authority which is a little over \na billion above last year's appropriated levels and a little over a \nbillion below the President's request. The bill is right at our section \n302(b) allocation.\n  Chairman Gregg has touched on many of the funding specifics in this\n\n[[Page S8608]]\n\nbill, so I will not repeat the details; however, I would like to point \nout to our colleagues some of the highlights of this bill:\n\n\n                      justice and law enforcement\n\n  This bill provides appropriations totaling $17.8 billion for the \nDepartment of Justice. Within the Justice Department, the bill provides \n$2.95 billion for the FBI, $1.2 billion for the DEA, and $1.08 billion \nfor the U.S. attorneys.\n  Safe Schools Initiative--The bill also includes a new initiative, the \nSafe Schools Initiative for which Senator Gregg and I have provided \n$210 million in an effort to combat violence in our schools.\n  This past spring it seemed like there wasn't a week that went by \nwithout the country having to suffer through the trauma of watching on \nthe news another story of school shootings or school violence unfold. \nAnd the ages of the victims and the violent youth get younger and \nyounger with each report.\n  National statistics provided by the Justice Department indicate that \nbetween 1989 and 1995, there has been a 37 percent increase in the \nnumber of students age 12-19 reporting violent crimes at school. In \n1995, there were 3 million students age 12-19 reporting that they knew \na student who brought a gun to school, and over 1.2 million students \nreported seeing a student with a gun at school.\n  The idea behind this initiative is to stop violence from spreading \nthroughout our Nation's schools like so many drugs have.\n  This initiative is aimed at protecting our children by putting more \npolice in the school setting. The bill provides $175 million through \nthe COPS Program, for local police departments and sheriff's offices to \nwork with schools and other community-based organizations to develop \nprograms to improve the safety of elementary and secondary school \nchildren and educators in and around our nation's schools.\n  In Richland County, Columbia, I recently visited a school that \nemployed a police officer as both a teacher and a mentor--serving as an \nauthoritarian figure while at the same time establishing friendships \nwith the kids. We need more programs like this--and this initiative is \na step in that direction.\n  This initiative is also aimed at creating prevention programs for our \nyoung people to stop this violence before it begins. The bill provides \n$25 million from the Juvenile Justice At-Risk Children Program for \ncommunities to implement approaches unique to their particular \nproblems. For example: State centers may provide accountability and \nresponsibility training, violence reduction training, juvenile \nmentoring, training for teachers to recognize troubled children, parent \naccountability and family strengthening education.\n  In Richland County, Columbia, the same program that puts the \npoliceman in the classroom has him out of the school fields after \nclasses are over, teaching students about responsibility, cooperation, \nand positive interaction.\n  Mr. President, three years ago, Richland County began a program of \nplacing police officers in the school setting. This program, operating \nout of the Sheriff's office, places 20 certified police officers in \nhigh schools and middle schools throughout Richland County. The police \nofficers are called ``School Resource Officers'' and basically serve as \ncounselors, role models, and teachers. The officers assist teachers in \nthe school by developing and teaching lesson plans that include: \nconflict resolution, law related education, psychology classes on drug \nabuse, and how to vocalize concerns rather than act out violence, etc.\n  This program is a proven success. Officer David Soto of Richland \nCounty, just named School Resource Officer of the Year, made 126 \narrests at the school in his first year, 56 is the second, and only 36 \nthis past year. His presence is most certainly making a difference. And \nthis new initiative will too.\n  For grants, the bill provides $1.4 billion for the Community Oriented \nPolicing Services (COPS) Program, $282.7 million for Violence Against \nWomen Program, $711 million for State prison grants, $552 million for \nthe Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program, $40 million for drug \ncourts, and $284 million for juvenile justice programs.\n\n\n                         DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE\n\n  The bill provides $4.823 for the Commerce Department, an increase of \n$572 million over this year.\n  $451 million of that increase for the Department of Commerce went to \nthe Bureau of the Census to fund the decennial census at the \nPresident's request level of $848.5 million. The bill does not take a \nposition on whether the Bureau should use statistical sampling or \nenumeration.\n  NIST's Advance Technology Program (ATP) is funded at last year's \nappropriated level of $192.5 million, and the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership (MEP) program is funded at a level of $106 million. Funding \nis extended for those centers affected by the existing sunset \nprovision. The bill supports the bipartisan efforts of the 17 members \nof the Commerce Committee who voted to report out a reauthorization \nbill and the 20 cosponsors of that legislative proposal.\n  The International Trade Administration is funded at $304 million.\n  The bill provides $2.2 billion for NOAA, an increase of $200 million \nover this year's funding level. Chairman Gregg and I have continued to \nwork bipartisanly to keep a focus on our Oceans.\n  Oceans Commission funding. Senator Gregg and I have also included in \nthis bill $3.5 million in funding for the creation of an Oceans \nCommission. Thirty-two years ago, Congress enacted legislation that \ncreated a national commission (Stratton Commission) whose ideas have \nshaped our ocean policy for almost thirty years. Resulting from the \nCommission was the creation of NOAA and enactment of such vital \nlegislation as the Coastal Zone Management Act, and the Marine \nSanctuaries program. This Commission--modeled after the successful \nStratton Commission--will look at U.S. ocean and coastal activities and \nreport within 18 months on recommendations for a national policy.\n  Today half of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of our shores \nand more than 30 percent of the Gross Domestic Product is generated in \nthe coastal zone. Our ocean and coastal resources that were once \nconsidered inexhaustible are severely depleted, and our wetlands and \nother marine habitats are threatened by pollution and human activities. \nMeanwhile, recent technological advances related to the oceans offer us \nnew economic and scientific opportunities. In an effort to address the \nincreasing environmental, economic, and scientific demands on our \noceans, our ocean-related government bureaucracy has grown rapidly \nduring the past three decades into a patchwork of regulations and \nprograms. This Commission will give us insight into what direction our \nnational policy should take to preserve, manage and use this limited \nresource during the next thirty years.\n\n  A number of marine user and interest groups have endorsed our efforts \nto create a new Ocean Commission, including: The American Coastal \nCoalition; the American Oceans Campaign; the American Sportfishing \nAssociation; the Center for Marine Conservation; the Coastal States \nOrganization; the Consortium for Oceanographic Research and Education; \nthe H. John Heinz III Center for Science, Economics, and the \nEnvironment; the Jason Foundation; the National Fisheries Institute; \nthe Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations; and the World \nWildlife Fund.\n  It is time for this country to reassess our national policy toward \nour oceans and this provision takes the first necessary step to get us \nmoving in the right direction.\n\n\n              state department and international programs\n\n  The bill includes $5.6 billion for the Department of State and \nrelated agencies. Within the State Department, the bill provides $550 \nmillion--an additional $146.8 million above this year's level of \nfunding--for security and maintenance of U.S. missions, including \nfunding for the chancery in Beijing, China and Berlin, Germany.\n  The funding level also includes payment of international organization \nand peacekeeping funds, including $475 million for U.N. arrears, \nsubject to authorization.\n  International broadcasting is funded at $333 million which includes \nvoice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Free Asia.\n  Mr. President, in summary, given the allocation we received, this is \na good\n\n[[Page S8609]]\n\nbill. Many--but not all--of the administration's priorities were \naddressed to some extent. Likewise many--but not all--of the priorities \nfor members were addressed to some extent. Tough decisions were made \nbecause of, on the one hand, the limited allocation, and on the other \nhand, the critical need to fund the Census, and 1,000 Border Patrol \nagents, and counterterrorism efforts, and the FBI's capabilities to \ncombat child abductions, and DEA's continued war on drugs, and weather \nsatellites, and critical fisheries research, and peacekeeping and the \nlist goes on and on and on.\n  Mr. President, let me emphasize a couple of things. One, of course, \nis my gratitude for the outstanding leadership that Chairman Gregg has \ngiven our subcommittee in submitting this measure to the U.S. Senate. \nWe worked around the clock to get this done, and no one has been more \nconscientious in trying to hold back spending.\n  The appropriation for State-Justice-Commerce is $33.2 billion, \nslightly over a $1 billion increase from this present year. This \nincrease is accounted for by the fact that we had to provide for the \nCensus, and what is due and owed to the United States, and for law \nenforcement. This increase, however, is actually $1 billion less than \nwhat was requested of us by the President of the United States.\n  As should be emphasized, the Safe Schools Initiative, under the \nleadership of Chairman Gregg, provides a good $175 million increment in \nthe overall $210 million appropriations with respect to school resource \nofficers within the school system.\n  Some three years ago, in my own backyard of Richland County, SC, \nSheriff Leon Lott came upon the idea of putting some of his deputies in \ntroubled schools, rather than putting them all on the streets. Sheriff \nLott's idea has been a tremendous success. There now are about 20 \nofficers, school resource officers, in Richland County schools. In one \nparticular school, one officer has made almost 250 arrests in one year. \nHe made 156 arrests the first year, and then some 56 the second year, \nand now down to 36 this year--the dramatic decline in arrests shows \nthat this program works, it reduces crime.\n  What really occurs is that these officers teach courses in law \nenforcement, teach respect for the law, and engage the students and the \nadministration. Also, of course, they talk to the administration and \nknow when a child is troubled or doesn't have any help from home and \neverything else of that kind, and they can more or less become a friend \nand mentor to the child.\n  In this day and age, we hear much talk about the family on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate. Three out of four women with children in school \nhave a job. Now I don't believe that is the fault of the U.S. Senate \nand I don't believe that will be solved by the U.S. Senate. There are \nchildren who come to school who don't have a father, and whose mother \nworks. In essence, they don't have parental guidance. The teacher is \ncalled upon not just to teach but to substitute as a parent and keep \nlaw and order in the classroom. Teaching class, these officers will \ncome to know the students well. They will serve as mentors and their \nunderstanding of the students will help them combat crime and prevent \nit before it starts. And in the afternoon they will participate in \nathletic events. Around the clock, these officers will become known and \nbecome role models.\n  Three million students last year attested that they knew of someone \nwho brought a pistol or a knife onto school grounds, but that they \ndidn't tell anyone because they didn't want to get involved and get \nthemselves in trouble. But now with that officer engaged as he is \naround the classes and in the exercises in the afternoon, becoming a \nrole model, trusted and known, these students just nudge, just point. \nThe officer knows why they are pointing. They don't have to say \nanything. They are right on top of these situations. I think it is a \ntried and true, valid approach now to this problem of violence and \ndeath in America's public schools.\n  I commend Chairman Gregg on this particular initiative, the Safe \nSchools Initiative. I commend, of course, the leadership that we had \nunder Sheriff Lott back in my own backyard that has gained acceptance \nfor this particular program. Also, I think that you have to be able to \nmention the fact that we are taking care of the United Nations. We have \nnot gotten into that Census sampling problem. That will have to be \nsolved in conference. We do have an oceans initiative that the Ocean \nCommission--that was passed by the U.S. Senate almost unanimously. We \nreinstate more or less the old Stratton Commission of 32 or 33 years \nago.\n  We need to update that. And we find that we have billions and \nbillions to go up into space, but we can't find, seemingly, enough \nmoney for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for \nresearch and to get the attention of the public generally with respect \nto seven-tenths of the Earth's surface.\n  I would like to take a moment before closing to acknowledge and thank \nSenator Gregg's staff--Jim Morhard, Kevin Linsky, Paddy Link, Dana \nQuam, Karl Truscott, and Virginia Wilbert--and to my staff--Lila Helms, \nEmelie East, and Dereck Orr--for their hard work and diligence in \nbringing together a bill that does everything I have just mentioned and \nmore. They have worked nonstop in a straightforward and bipartisan \nmanner, and those efforts are evident in the product before the Senate \ntoday.\n  Mr. Prsident, in closing I would like to make a few final comments \nabout Scott Gudes who left my staff several weeks ago after working as \nminority clerk on this subcommittee for the last 4 years, and as \nmajority clerk for the 4 years prior.\n\n\n                         tribute to scott gudes\n\n  As Senator Byrd said about Scott Gudes 2 years ago, nobody knows \nbetter. Scott has worked with me on the Commerce, Justice, State bill \nfor 8 years and it has been a prvilege working with such an \nintelligent, diligent, hard-working, and genius staff member. Senator \nByrd hit the nail on the head--Scott knows appropriations; Scott knows \nSenate procedure; and Scott has common sense better than anyone. His \ndeparture from my committee staff is a geuine loss to me, to everyone \nwho had the opportunity to work with him, and to the United States \nSenate.\n  Scott began working with me in 1990 as majority clerk for the CJS \nSubcommittee and stayed with me in this position through this year. \nBefore that he was hired by Senator Stevens and worked for him, Senator \nStennis, and Senator Inouye on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee \nfrom 1986 to 1990 where he was responsible for all Department of \nDefense Operation and Maintenance accounts. During 1989 and 1990 he \nserved as a subcommittee branch chief/assistant staff director and in \nthis tenure on the Defense Subcommittee, Scott earned a reputation as \nhandling the broadest and largest portfolio of any House or Senate \nappropriations staff.\n  This reputation followed him to the Commerce, Justice, State \nSubcommittee, where Scott became responsible for knowing the policy \ncontext and daily operations of a vast array of programs operated by \nfour cabinet departments, the Departments of Justice, Commerce, State, \nand USTR, the Federal Judiciary, and 24 independent Federal agencies \nsuch as the FCC, SEC, FTC, LSC, EEOC--he was in a world of acronyms, \nyet he was able to tell you the current and historical status of each \nand every one of these agencies, he could assess their budgetary \nconcerns, identify future year needs, and quickly determine the \npolitical astuteness of contemplated legislative action on any of the \nprograms or agencies in the bill. He was our utility player--able to \njump from satellites to fisheries to telecommunication to immigration \npolicy to small business development, demonstrating his technical \nexpertise and political acumen in the broadest array of programs \nimaginable.\n  Scott deserves the credit for a number of innovative and forward-\nthinking initiatives on the CJS bill during his tenure. His creativity \ncompelled the subcommittee to consider and adopt such important \ninitiatives as the NOAA fleet modernization program, acquisition of a \nhigh-altitude hurricane reconnaissance aircraft for the National \nWeather Service, methods of supporting the COPS on the Beat program, \nways to hire and keep funding more border patrol agents, successfully \nintegrating the 1994 Violence Against Women Act into our appropriations \nbill, finding ways to make the GOES satellite program start working \nunder\n\n[[Page S8610]]\n\nthe necessary time table--the list could go on. But the important thing \nto note is that more often than not, Scott's recommendations at how \nbest to technically and politically institute these initiatives were \nthe recommendations we would follow, whether in the majority or \nminority.\n  Scott is now working for the Department of Commerce at NOAA, the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as Deputy \nUndersecretary of NOAA. Scott has followed his passions--the oceans, \nfisheries, atmospheric science--and NOAA, the Department of Commerce, \nand we as U.S. citizens reaping the benefits of NOAA's programs are all \nthe better for Scott's high position in this agency. Scott will \nundoubtedly excel at this position just as he had here in the Senate, \nbefore that at OMB, as a Presidential Management Intern working in the \nOffice of the Secretary of Defense, and at the city manager's office \nfor the city of Costa Mesa, California. Scott is indeed a fine, fine \nperson--NOAA is lucky to have him, and I expect to see his star shine \nfor many, many years to come. I wish Scott all the best in the world--\nand know that in whatever position in life Scott finds himself, his \ndecency, intelligence, and integrity will continue to be synonymous \nwith his name. Congratulations, Scott. You will truly be missed.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Chairman Gregg and \nSenator Hollings on their leadership in crafting the Fiscal Year 1999 \nCommerce, Justice, and State, the judiciary, and related agencies \nappropriation bill. Given the broad reach of this measure and our \nbudgetary constraints, this was no easy task.\n  From a parochial standpoint, I wish to thank the Chairman and Senator \nHollings for their sensitive consideration of programs of importance to \nthe State of Hawaii, including the East-West Center, Hawaiian monk seal \nrecovery, endangered sea turtle research, and coral reef research, \nassessment, monitoring and management, to name a few.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the outstanding work of the staff: \nJim Morhard, Kevin Linskey, Paddy Link, Dana Quam, Vasiliki \nAlexopoulos, Lila Helms, and Emelie East.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Scott Gudes for his many years of \ndedication to the Senate Appropriations Committee, and in particular, \nthe Defense and Commerce, Justice, and State Subcommittees. Throughout \nthe years, Scott worked tirelessly and conscientiously, and garnered \nthe deep respect of Members and staff who had the privilege of working \nwith him. Scott recently left the Senate to become Deputy Under \nSecretary at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. I \nwish him much success and fulfillment in this new endeavor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3227\n\n(Purpose: To establish a prohibition on commercial distribution on the \nWorld Wide Web of material that is harmful to minors, to persons under \n                            17 years of age)\n\n  Mr. COATS.

The distinguished Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the McCain No. 3228 \namendment to Amendment No. 3227.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join my \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, in urging the Senate to adopt \nour Internet filtering amendment, the Childsafe Internet bill.\n  We come here today for one simple reason: to find a way to protect \nchildren on the Internet. The Internet is growing and expanding faster \nthan we ever thought possible. It has become a daily tool for many \nAmericans. As the Internet continues to grow, I believe it is our \nresponsibility to do something to protect children from harmful \nmaterial.\n  I have worked hard over the last 6 years to get computers and \ntechnology into our schools. I have sponsored legislation to allow \nsurplus Government computers to be put into schools. The Senate, in \nfact, just passed my Teacher Technology Training Act, to make sure \nteachers can incorporate technology into their curriculum.\n  I have worked hard to establish the e-rate to help our schools get \nconnected to the Internet. I have been out in schools, and I know \npersonally what a great educational tool the Internet can be. And I \nrepresent a state that is leading the way in many of these new \ntechnologies.\n  I want our students and I want our teachers to have access to this \ninformation. But, as we continue to see, there is a small amount of \ninformation on the Internet to which children should simply not have \naccess.\n  In fact, a 1997 national survey of U.S. public libraries and the \nInternet revealed that students often unintentionally download \npornography while on the Net. Mr. President, 22 percent of the children \nsurveyed admitted that this had happened in school, while 25 percent \nadmitted it had occurred in a public library.\n  I understand no solution is perfect. Technology alone won't filter \nevery objectionable item on the Internet. We must remember, though, \nthat this technology has made enormous strides in just a short amount \nof time.\n  I have heard from people who say health information, such as breast \ncancer, would be blocked from viewing. That may have been the case, but \nfiltering companies have developed new technologies and are employing \nnew procedures that do protect children while allowing more and more \neducational information to be used.\n  Our legislation is a first step. It is the right thing to do. The \nChildsafe Internet bill would simply require any school or library that \ngets reduced Internet access, the e-rate, to install some technology on \ntheir computers that keeps inappropriate material away from young \nchildren.\n  What is great about our bill is that it gives power to local school \ndistricts and libraries to determine which filtering device to use and \nwhat constitutes inappropriate material. Decisions must remain at the \nlocal level with those who best know their students.\n  Mr. President, let me give a few examples I have heard of the need \nfor the Childsafe Internet Act.\n  Last month, a seventh grade teacher in Washington state told me that \nit was impossible to watch 30 young students at their computers all of \nthe time. She did not want a situation in which a child found \ninappropriate material, complained to their parents, and then have a \nparent come screaming back to the classroom, where the teacher was \nultimately responsible. She turned off the Internet.\n  I do not want that to happen. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a number of letters I have received from parents about \nthe need for this bill.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 19, 1998.\n       Dear Senators: You were both in Vancouver this week, and I \n     wasn't able to reach you through your office. Would you \n     please update me on the status of SB 1619 the Internet School \n     Filtering Act? In SW Washington, the regional group reported \n     that they are the state internet provider service is looking \n     at filtering at the state level as a result of SB 1619. As \n     you can see from this report, filtering isn't perfect. \n     However, without any filtering, far more youth at much \n     younger ages come up with inappropriate material.\n       In Camas, pop. 9000, elementary students are not allowed to \n     do searches on the internet for this reason. There is no \n     reason to allow technology to serve as an excuse for lowering \n     standards of acceptable material in publicly funded \n     institutions. The Camas library continues to fight filtering, \n     and points to the schools lack of one as justification. The \n     Ft. Vancouver library board most recently on Monday April 13 \n     though optional filtering was a good idea. That defeats the \n     whole purpose and keeps the porn option wide open to kids. I \n     hope you got my report of abuses noted. If they had a log \n     like this, I'm sure the number of accesses reported would be \n     much higher. Please continue to work so that our tax dollars \n     do not found porn and inappropriate material to children. \n     Thank you for your time to reply please. E-mail is best, \n     since it is faster, and a number of meetings are coming up \n     the first week in May.\n           Sincerely,\n     Margaret Tweet.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 29, 1998.\n     Senator Patty Murray,\n\n     Attn: Kay\n\n       Dear Kay: This also came out today. Ft. Vancouver records \n     show one employee who quit rather than provide porn to minors \n     with that as the stated reason. At the KOMO Town Hall, \n     another Washington librarian announced she made the same \n     decision after 6 months of wrangling over whether providing \n     access to internet porn to a 14 year old patron was a part of \n     her job she could live with. Adult businesses cannot sell \n     pornography to children, an indication of public policy. It \n     should not be an option for youth in libraries either. Thank \n     you again for your time.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Margaret Tweet.\n\n[[Page S8612]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                     May 17, 1998.\n     To: Senator Murray,\n     Subject: Filtering Library Internet Access.\n\n       Dear Senator Murray: I just finished watching Town Meeting \n     on ABC. You go girl! I am a parent of a 17 month old. I am \n     horrified that she could go to the library in 4 years and \n     pull up pornography or any other sexual sites. Yes, the \n     library is a public place, that does not mean they have to \n     provide information about such things. Why protect the bad \n     guys when children are our future. And people wonder how this \n     world came to what it is now with these kind of issues. If \n     someone wants to look at pornography let them buy their own \n     computer and do it in the privacy of their own home, not \n     expose our kids to it, that's just what the sickos want. I'm \n     with you all the way. Even if the filtering isn't perfect, \n     software companies will continue to upgrade and patch their \n     software, and why not do what we can now to protect our \n     children!!!!\n       Good luck June 9th, you have our prayers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  Shelton, WA,\n\n                                                     May 30, 1998.\n\n     To: Senator Murray.\n     Subject: Cyber porn.\n\n       Senator Murray: You and I disagree on most issues, but on \n     the issues of limiting access to highly graphic pornography \n     to children on the Internet is something we do agree upon.\n       I support the concept of schools mandated to utilize an \n     electronic block to preclude elementary, middle school, and \n     high school students from entering pornographic websites. \n     There isn't any defensible reason why these websites should \n     be available for the children to explore. I am certain most \n     parents do not allow their children to surf porn sites so at \n     home, and the same expectation is needed to protect the \n     children while they are in school.\n       The technology is currently available for school districts \n     to block out websites which are deemed pornographic. This \n     does not in anyway impede the purveyors and pimps of this \n     demeaning material of their First Amendment rights. You would \n     defend these children if some individual were to turn the \n     school into a toxic waste dump. The same fervor is needed to \n     prevent pornographic pollutants from being introduced into \n     the minds of impressionable children.\n       Since the educational establishment benefits from taxpayer \n     dollars, it is not an onerous request to have this country's \n     school system voluntarily act upon this issue in a \n     responsible manner. School districts which are non-compliant \n     may have their federal funding significantly impacted until \n     compliance is gained.\n       Thank you for taking this time to read my this piece of \n     email.\n     Jeffrey K.

Patty Murray,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murray: My family has a concern regarding \n     pornography on the Internet that is dramatically different \n     than you may have been asked to look into or even aware of. A \n     few days ago, our fifteen year old daughter was doing school \n     work using the Internet. The address for one of the most \n     popular search engines is, ``www.infoseek.com.'' She made a \n     one adjacent character key typing error and typed, \n     ``www.infoseel.com.''\n       She was shocked, stunned, and nauseated at the vile \n     explicit pictures that instantly were presented on the \n     screen. Enclosed are black and white print outs. As you can \n     see the first shows anal intercourse with the text, ``Free \n     Live Fucking, Now With Sound.'' The second is a gynecological \n     close-up with the text, ``hot hole, enter free.'' This \n     brought our traumatized daughter running out of the room in \n     tears.\n       This kind of revolting garbage has no place in our home and \n     no place in American society. There are two aspects of this \n     issue that warrant federal action. One, the people behind \n     this website, by their intentional choice of their URL \n     address, were seeking to put their pornography in front of \n     those who made reasonably foreseeable typing errors. This \n     amounts to intentional interstate delivery of pornography to \n     minors. It should be immediately prosecuted as such.\n       Second, the National Science Foundation assigns the \n     Internet URL addresses. It should be a simple matter for \n     Congress to legislate the denial of URL addresses to people \n     and organizations who engage in this kind of malicious \n     perversion.\n       The apologists for the present laissez faire state of \n     affairs on the Internet are fond of telling us parents that \n     it's our responsibility to supervise our own children. This \n     disgusting incident proves that to be a totally inadequate \n     approach, and is in fact a self serving ruse. My family sees \n     this as nothing less than visual child rape. Please let me \n     know what actions you can take to quickly curtail this abuse \n     and protect our children from this kind of intrusive filth.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dock Brown.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  Bothell, WA,\n\n                                                February 26, 1998.\n\n     Subject: Childsafe Internet Bill.\n\n       I am writing to urge your support of the Childsafe Internet \n     Bill being pushed by Senators John McCain, Patty Murray and \n     others which will limit the right of access by children to \n     smut on the internet when federally funded commuters are used \n     in classrooms.\n       This one is a ``no-brainer''. Institutions who want federal \n     money to buy computers must agree to block and/or filter \n     pornography when children are using computers in the \n     classroom.\n       Will you support the Childsafe Bill?\n       Respectfully,\n     Vincent T. Saulin.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Oak Harbor, WA,\n\n                                                 November 4, 1997.\n     Tom Mayer,\n     Director,\n     Marysville, WA.\n       Dear Mr. Mayer: For over a year people in our community \n     have been doing research on children's access to pornography \n     on the Internet at public libraries. Among other material \n     such as feature articles in ``The Wall Street Journal,'' and \n     ``New York Times, '' and numerous news magazines, we have \n     studied the ``Report and Recommendation on Internet Filtering \n     Software and Its Use in Public Libraries, July 1997'', \n     prepared by the Sno-Isle Regional Library System.\n       We sincerely hope that we can persuade the Sno-Isle Library \n     system to install filters on the juvenile computers. We \n     believe that the filters are a sensible and reasonable way of \n     copying with the problem.\n       A list of our concerns is attached, but the basis of our \n     decision is as follows:\n       1. Public libraries have always been held accountable for \n     their resource material, especially where children's sections \n     are concerned.\n       2. The Internet should pass the same criteria as all other \n     material.\n       3. Filtering software is available to block child \n     pornography and other smut sites, and libraries all across \n     the country have installed this software without any legal \n     challenges so far.\n       We urge the Sno-Isle Library system to follow the advice of \n     your internal staff report of July 1997, which recommended \n     filtering software on juvenile computers.\n       Someone has to speak for our children. We the parents, \n     grandparents, teachers, law enforcement officers and social \n     service workers are doing just that.\n       May we hear from you soon?\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Trudy J. Sundberg,\n                                   Founder, Save Our Kids Crusade.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. My concern is if we don't act now to do something about \nthis issue, teachers and librarians across the country will begin \nturning computers off, preventing children access to this valuable \neducational tool. None of us wants that to happen.\n  The Childsafe Internet bill is the right way to go. It allows local \nschools districts to make important decisions about Internet content. \nIt is a common sense solution. We have provided this Internet access \nthrough the E-rate. Now we must finish the job by providing our \nteachers and parents with the right tools to help educate our children.\n  Most parents would not send a child to a playground in their local \ncommunity unsupervised. We cannot allow our young children to be in the \nInternet unsupervised.\n  Lets give our teachers and librarians some help, our parents some \ncontrol, and truly pass legislation that will protect America's next \ngeneration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I oppose Senator McCain's amendment, \noriginally introduced as S. 1619, to require schools and libraries \nwired with federal funds to install Internet filtering software. \nCongress has wisely seen fit to make the Internet widely available to \nyoung people throughout the country by subsidizing school and library \naccess to the Internet through ``E-rate'' discounts. The McCain \namendment would undermine the benefits of that access by forcing \nschools and libraries to use filtering technologies to remove a \nsignificant percentage of material available on-line. Internet \nfiltering issues should be discussed and implemented locally, not \nnationally, and certainly not by piggybacking a filtering bill onto a \ncrime bill and spiriting them to the Senate floor as amendments to an \nappropriations bill.\n  While we can all agree that some material available on the Internet \nmay be unsuitable for certain age groups, there is serious disagreement \nconcerning the best approach to the challenge of protecting our \nchildren from exposure to unsuitable material. Fundamentally, this is a \ndecision that should be made at the local level, by families and school \nboards, librarians and educators in their own communities. Although I \nshare the deep concerns about children's access to obscenity and other \nharmful materials on the Internet, in the rush to protect children, we \nshould\n\n[[Page S8613]]\n\nnot unnecessarily chill the freedom of expression that occurs on-line.\n  The intention of this amendment is good. But good intentions do not \nalways make for the best policy. The primary problem with this \namendment is that it usurps local authority on whether to use filtering \ntechnologies on computers with Internet access. That's why educators \noppose it. The National Education Association and the American \nAssociation of School Administrators testified before the Commerce \nCommittee that they opposed making E-rate discounts contingent upon \ninstallation of blocking or filtering software. Imposing a top-down \nmandate requiring schools to install filtering software as a condition \nfor accessing E-rate discounts violates the principle of local control \nof curricular matters.\n  Placing the burden on libraries, schools, and other public \ninstitutions to supervise our children's access to information is also \ncounterproductive. Schools have already been forced to comply with \nextensive congressional and FCC requirements to participate in the E-\nrate program. Forcing schools to comply with further requirements would \nstrain the already overburdened financial and staff resources of the \nnation's schools. Although at first blush this requirement does not \nappear to be overburdensome, given the number of federal requirements \nwith which schools and libraries receiving Federal assistance already \nmust comply, the mandate would require extensive research, installation \nand implementation. Some of our local schools already have their own \nsystems in place to monitor Internet access. The McCain amendment could \nforce them to scrap these systems and start from scratch. A number of \nschools and libraries have not yet even received the computers and \ntechnologies to gain access to the Internet, and are in the process of \napplying for E-rate funding to obtain infrastructure, such as wiring \nand connectivity. Schools may be unable to make the requisite \ndemonstration as to how the filtering software will be implemented if \ntheir computers are not yet in place.\n  The goal of the federal Internet subsidies is to give our schools, \nlibraries and public institutions open and universal access to the \ntechnology and information that will help prepare our children and \nyoung adults for the challenges that lie ahead in the next century. By \nmaking the subsidy available, we are helping to bridge the gap between \nwealthier and poorer communities' access to information. The McCain \namendment would widen the gap. Wealthier schools that do not receive \nthe subsidy are permitted, within First Amendment bounds, to decide for \nthemselves whether or not to place limits on Internet use. Requiring \nuse restrictions is one more way of telling subsidized schools that \nthey are not trusted to make these decisions for themselves. This is \nprecisely the type of access inequality that the federal E-rate subsidy \nwas designed to cure, not foster.\n  Wresting control of educational and informational access from the \nlocal communities that are best equipped to make these decisions is not \ngoing to solve the problem of inappropriate material on the Internet. \nFiltering software is one way of restricting the access by minors to \nsuch material, but other options exist. Local school boards, \nadministrators, and librarians more familiar with their own systems and \nculture are the proper people to decide how best to implement any \nprograms restricting access to information.\n  I would support efforts to address these issues that allow more \nflexibility at the local level. Instead of a blanket mandate requiring \nfiltering and blocking technology in all schools and libraries that \nreceive E-rate subsidies, we should have more research into how to \ncombat the problem of minors receiving inappropriate information over \nthe Internet in e-mail messages and in chatrooms. We should encourage \nschools and libraries to distribute their policies to parents, \neducators, children, and community members, and to state whether they \nuse any technological means to block access to inappropriate materials.\n  There are more sensible approaches. We should alert our communities \nto the potential problems of inappropriate materials on the Internet, \nand allow and encourage informed decisionmaking at the local level. \nThat is why I have created a page on my website dedicated to providing \nguidance to parents and educators on how to protect children from \ninappropriate material online. But above all, we should support the \nmission behind the E-rate subsidy: open and universal access to \ntechnology and information.\n  Our children and our schools need as much support as we can possibly \noffer to help prepare the next generation to meet the challenges that \nlie ahead.\n  Mr. President, with reference to the amendment offered by Senator \nCoats, less than three years ago, during the 104th Congress, the Senate \nvoted overwhelmingly to adopt the Communications Decency Act as part of \nthe telecommunications deregulation bill. The CDA, like the current \namendment, sought to criminalize the transmission of constitutionally \nprotected speech over the Internet. I opposed the CDA from the start as \nfatally flawed and flagrantly unconstitutional. I predicted that the \nCDA would not pass constitutional muster and, along with Senator \nFeingold, I introduced a bill to repeal the CDA so that we would not \nhave to wait for the Supreme Court to fix our mistake.\n  We did not fix the mistake and so, as I predicted, the Supreme Court \neventually did our work for us. All nine Justices agreed that the CDA \nwas, at least in part, unconstitutional. Justice Stevens, writing for \nseven members of the Court, called the CDA ``patently invalid'' and \nwarned that it cast ``dark shadow over free speech'' and ``threaten[ed] \nto torch a large segment of the Internet community.''\n  The Court's decision came as no surprise to me, and it should have \ncome as no surprise to the 84 Senators who supported the legislation. \nOne of the sponsors of the current amendment said in a floor statement \nlast Friday that the Supreme Court should have approved the CDA because \nthe law used the same indecency standard that the Court had previously \napproved in connection with the dial-a-porn statute. This statement \npuzzled me because, as I recall, the Court did not approve the \nindecency standard in the dial-a-porn statute. The Court approved that \nstatute only insofar as it applied to obscene communication, which can \nbe banned totally because it is not protected by the First Amendment. \nThe Court invalidated the dial-a-porn statute as it applied to indecent \ncommunication, which does enjoy First Amendment protection. This is \nprecisely the same distinction that the Court drew in the CDA case, \nwhere it struck down the restrictions on indecent material, but left \nthe restrictions on obscene material standing. The CDA decision \nfollowed the dial-a-porn decision; it did not break new ground in that \nregard.\n  Now here we are, again, taking another stab at censoring \nconstitutionally protected speech on the Internet, again, in the name \nof protecting children. Of course, we all want to protect children from \nharm. I prosecuted child abusers as State's Attorney in Vermont, and \nhave worked my entire professional life to protect children from those \nwho would prey on them. But we have a duty to ensure that the means we \nuse to protect our children do not do more harm than good. As the \nSupreme Court made clear when it struck down the CDA, laws that \nprohibit protected speech do not become constitutional merely because \nthey were enacted for the important purpose of protecting children.\n  The amendment makes a valiant effort to address many of the Supreme \nCourt's technical objections to the CDA. But while it is more narrowly \ndrawn, it still raises substantial constitutional questions. The core \nholding of the CDA case was that ``the vast democratic fora of the \nInternet'' deserves the highest level of protection from government \nintrusion--the highest level of First Amendment scrutiny. Courts will \nassess the constitutionality of laws that regulate speech over the \nInternet by the same demanding standards that have traditionally \napplied to laws affecting the press.\n  The current amendment does not meet those standards. For one thing, \nit calls for a single, national definition of the ``harmful to minors'' \nstandard, which until now has always been defined at the State or local \ncommunity level. We should not forget the Supreme Court's admonition in \nMiller\n\n[[Page S8614]]\n\nversus California that: ``our Nation is simply too big and too diverse \n. . . to reasonably expect that such standards could be articulated for \nall 50 States in a single formulation. . . . It is neither realistic \nnor constitutionally sound to read the First Amendment as requiring \nthat the people of Maine or Mississippi accept public depiction of \nconduct found tolerable in Las Vegas, or New York City.''\n  In addition, the way in which the amendment defines ``material that \nis harmful to minors'' is not altogether consistent with prior law. The \nsponsor says that the definition was taken ``word for word'' from the \nGinsberg case, but the fact is that several important terms were \naltered or omitted. This could be confusing, and it could well have the \nunintended consequence of limiting the meaning of state ``harmful to \nminors'' laws.\n  The strict liability provisions of the amendment are another matter \nof concern. The amendment imposes criminal liability and authorizes \nsevere criminal and civil sanctions on anyone who fails to take \naffirmative steps to restrict access of certain materials by minors. \nThere is no requirement that the person acted knowingly, willfully, or \neven with criminal intent. The strict liability imposed by the \namendment would chill content on the Web. Also, since this amendment \nonly applies to the Web, I am concerned that if it becomes law it would \npressure Internet content providers and users to use or develop other \nprotocols with which they would be able to exercise their First \nAmendment rights unfettered by the threat of strict liability criminal \nprosecution.\n  There are other problems with the scope of the amendment. It does not \ndefine who would be covered by the crucial phrase ``engaged in the \nbusiness of the commercial distribution of material.'' Would the \namendment cover companies that offer free Web sites, but charge for \ntheir off-line services? Also, if we restrict coverage to commercial \ndistributions, are we just encouraging people to post the very same \nobnoxious materials on the Web for free? Is that what we want?\n  Further, it is entirely unclear whether the amendment's affirmative \ndefense provision can be used in the civil context, since it states \nthat it is a defense to ``prosecution'' under the amendment. Would \ncompanies that restrict access to their Web sites in accordance with \nFCC procedures nonetheless be exposed to the stiff civil penalties \nestablished by the amendment?\n  We can and must do better. There are other more effective and less \nrestrictive solutions--solutions like filtering technology, which \nempower individual Internet users without reducing the level of \ndiscourse over the Web to what would be suitable for a sandbox. This \namendment, like its predecessor, places an unacceptably heavy burden on \nprotected speech. We should not run another ambiguous speech regulation \nup the flagpole and expect the courts to salute. We owe it to the \nmillions of Americans who use the Web not to make the same mistake a \nsecond time.\n  Finally, I note that the Senate is considering this important \nmeasure, including its creation of new federal crimes, as part of an \nannual appropriations bill. Until recently the Senate had rules and \nprecedent against this kind of legislating on an appropriations bill. \nUnder Republican leadership, that discipline has been lost and we are \nleft to consider significant legislative proposals as amendments to \nannual appropriations. These matters are far-reaching. They deserve \nfull debate and Senate consideration before good intentions lead the \nSenate to take another misstep in haste.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to state for the record that I \ncontinue to have serious reservations about the federal government \nmandating the use of specific technologies to solve the problem of \nschoolchildren's access to inappropriate material on the Internet. I \nbelieve that school boards are much more effective in making decisions \nabout appropriate policy or technology when dealing with Internet \naccess for students than Washington. Advances in technology have \nbrought wonderful opportunities, but we must not rely on technology to \ndeal with complex public policy questions. Congress sets a dangerous \nprecedent by stamping its ``seal of approval'' on software that may be \nobsolete next year or even next week.\n  I initially expressed my reservations about a bill which would \nrequire mandated filtering systems, S. 1619, during the Commerce \nCommittee markup that was held this past March. I considered offering \nan amendment during the markup that would have required schools and \nlibraries to certify that they had appropriate Internet Acceptable Use \nPolicies in place in order to receive universal service funding. The \nChairman of the Commerce Committee assured me that if I were to pull my \namendment he would be open to working with me to reach a compromise on \nthe issue. Upon receiving this assurance, I withdrew my amendment.\n  Over the last several months, I have held numerous meetings among all \nof the parties involved in the markup in an effort to reach consensus. \nMy office has had an open door policy and had significantly altered the \noriginal language to expand its scope to reflect the concerns of my \ncolleagues. The draft compromise amendment I was prepared to offer \nrequired that schools have Internet use policies in place that address \nnot only access to the World Wide Web, but also the security of \nschoolchildren when using E-mail and chat rooms. These policies would \nhave to be public, widely distributed and effective. Furthermore, the \ncompromise amendment would significantly expand criminal penalties on \n``cyberstalkers''--criminals who use computers to exploit or abuse \nchildren.\n  The compromise amendment has achieved significant support because of \nits inclusion of these vital matters and its reliance on local \ncommunities rather than federal mandates.\n  I am deeply disappointed that the Chairman of the Commerce Committee \nchose not to compromise on this very important issue. I had anticipated \nthat this issue would be dealt with in its own right and that we would \nhave several hours of debate to deal with S. 1619 and the amendment I \nhad planned to offer along with several of my colleagues. Instead, it \nwas attached to the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill today. I \ndid not express my opposition to the inclusion of S. 1619 because I did \nnot want to hold up the passage of crucial Commerce-State-Justice \nappropriations. However, I want to make it very clear that I remain \nsteadfastly opposed to big government mandates on the filtering issue \nand I will work closely with my colleagues as S. 2260 heads to \nconference to perfect the bill to reflect these concerns.\n  I continue to believe that local communities acting through their \nschool and library boards, rather than software programs that are at \nbest questionable or the federal government, are in the best position \nto make decisions on this critical issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . MULTICHANNEL VIDEO PROGRAMMING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) The Congress finds that:\n       (A) Signal theft represents a serious threat to direct-to-\n     home satellite television. In the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996, Congress confirmed the applicability of penalties for \n     unauthorized decryption of direct-to-home satellite services. \n     Nevertheless, concerns remain about civil liability for such \n     unauthorized decryption.\n       (B) In view of the desire to establish competition to the \n     cable television industry, Congress authorized consumers to \n     utilize direct-to-home satellite systems for viewing video \n     programming through the Cable Communications Policy Act of \n     1984.\n       (C) Congress found in the Cable Television Consumer \n     Protection and Competition Act of 1992 that without the \n     presence of another multichannel video programming \n     distributor, a cable television operator faces no local \n     competition and that the result is undue market power for the \n     cable operator as compared to that of consumers and other \n     video programmers.\n       (D) The Federal Communications Commission, under the Cable \n     Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, \n     has the responsibility for reporting annually to the Congress \n     on the state of competition in the market for delivery of \n     multichannel video programming.\n       (E) In the Cable Television Consumer Protection and \n     Competition Act of 1992, Congress stated its policy of \n     promoting the availability to the public of a diversity of \n     views and information through cable television and other \n     video distribution media.\n       (F) Direct-to-home satellite television service is the \n     fastest growing multichannel video programming service with \n     approximately 8 million households subscribing to video \n     programming delivered by satellite carriers.\n       (G) Direct-to-home satellite television service is the \n     service that most likely can provide effective competition to \n     cable television service.\n       (H) Through the compulsory copyright license created by \n     section 119 of the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1988, \n     satellite carriers have paid a royalty fee per subscriber, \n     per month to retransmit network and superstation signals by \n     satellite to subscribers for private home viewing.\n       (I) Congress set the 1988 fees to equal the average fees \n     paid by cable television operators for the same superstation \n     and network signals.\n       (J) Effective May 1, 1992, the royalty fees payable by \n     satellite carriers were increased through compulsory \n     arbitration to $0.06 per subscriber per month for \n     retransmission of network signals and $0.175 per subscriber \n     per month for retransmission of superstation signals, \n     unless all of the programming contained in the \n     superstation signal is free from syndicated exclusivity \n     protection under the rules of the Federal Communications \n     Commission, in which case the fee was decreased to $0.14 \n     per subscriber per month. These fees were 40-70 percent \n     higher than the royalty fees paid by cable television \n     operators to retransmit the same signals.\n       (K) On October 27, 1997, the Librarian of Congress adopted \n     the recommendation of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel \n     and approved raising the royalty fees of satellite carriers \n     to $0.27 per subscriber per month for both superstation and \n     network signals, effective January 1, 1998.\n       (L) The fees adopted by the Librarian are 270 percent \n     higher for superstations and 900 percent higher for network \n     signals than the royalty fees paid by cable television \n     operators for the exact same signals.\n       (M) To be an effective competitor to cable, direct-to-home \n     satellite television must have access to the same programming \n     carried by its competitors and at comparable rates. In \n     addition, consumers living in areas where over-the-air \n     network signals are not available rely upon satellite \n     carriers for access to important news and entertainment.\n       (N) The Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel did not \n     adequately consider the adverse competitive effect of the \n     differential in satellite and cable royalty fees on promoting \n     competition among multichannel video programming providers \n     and the importance of evaluating the fees satellite carriers \n     pay in the context of the competitive nature of the \n     multichannel video programming marketplace.\n       (O) If the recommendation of the Copyright Arbitration \n     Royalty Panel is allowed to stand, the direct-to-home \n     satellite industry, whose total subscriber base is equivalent \n     in size to approximately 11 percent of all cable households, \n     will be paying royalties that equal half the size of the \n     cable royalty pool, thus giving satellite subscribers a \n     disproportionate burden for paying copyright royalties when \n     compared to cable television subscribers.\n       (b) DBS Signal Security.--Section 605(d) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 605) is amended by \n     adding after ``satellite cable programming,'' the following: \n     ``or direct-to-home satellite services,''.\n       (c) Notice of Inquiry; Report.--Section 628 of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 548) is amended by \n     adding at the end of subsection (g): ``The Commission shall, \n     within 180 days after enactment of the Act making \n     appropriations for the Department of Commerce, Justice, and \n     State, the Judiciary and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     evolving September 30, 1998, initiate a notice of inquiry to \n     determine the best way in which to facilitate the \n     retransmission of distant broadcast signals such that it is \n     more consistent with the 1992 Cable Act's goal of promoting \n     competition in the market for delivery of multichannel video \n     programming and the public interest. The Commission also \n     shall within 180 days after such date of enactment report to \n     Congress on the effect of the increase in royalty fees paid \n     by satellite carriers pursuant to the decision by the \n     Librarian of Congress on competition in the market for \n     delivery of multichannel video programming and the ability of \n     the direct-to-home satellite industry to compete.''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Copyright Office is prohibited from implementing, \n     enforceing collecting or awarding copyright royalty fees, and \n     no obligation or liability for copyright royalty fees shall \n     accrue pursuant to the decision of the Librarian of Congress \n     on October 27, 1997, which established a royalty fee of $0.27 \n     per subscriber per month for the retransmission of distant \n     broadcast signals by satellite carriers, before January 1, \n     2000.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I offer an amendment to H.R. 2260 \nthat will keep consumer prices for satellite TV service from abruptly \nincreasing and, thereby, promote competition in the market for delivery \nof multichannel video programming. This amendment was originally \nintroduced as S. 1422, the Federal Communications Commission Satellite \nCarrier Oversight Act. Twenty-seven Members of the Senate are \ncosponsors of S. 1422. I ask unanimous consent that the list of \ncosponsors be printed.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1422\n\n\n                                sponsor\n\n       Senator McCain (introduced 11/07/97)\n\n\n                             27 cosponsors\n\n       Senator Burns--11/07/97\n       Senator Dorgan--11/07/97\n       Senator Collins--01/28/98\n       Senator Craig--01/28/98\n       Senator Hutchinson--01/28/98\n       Senator Murkowski--01/28/98\n       Senator Inouye--02/03/98\n       Senator Bryan--02/09/98\n       Senator Hollings--02/23/98\n       Senator Gorton--02/23/98\n       Senator Baucus--02/24/98\n       Senator Kerrey--02/27/98\n       Senator Enzi--03/11/98\n       Senator Cleland--05/07/98\n       Senator Conrad--11/07/97\n       Senator Brownback--01/28/98\n       Senator Coverdell--01/28/98\n       Senator Hagel--01/28/98\n       Senator Inhofe--01/28/98\n       Senator Roberts--01/28/98\n       Senator Allard--02/04/98\n       Senator Snowe--02/11/98\n       Senator Robb--02/23/98\n       Senator Johnson--02/24/98\n       Senator Kerry--02/24/98 (withdrawn--02/27/98)\n       Senator Sessions--03/09/98\n       Senator Chafee--03/31/98\n       Senator Smith, Bob--06/01/98\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the bill was reported unanimously by the \nCommerce Committee.\n  Mr. President, with cable television rates increasing at seven times \nthe Consumer Price Index and three times the rate of inflation, \nCongress has an urgent interest in assuring that consumers have a \nchoice of video providers at competitive rates. However, recent \nregulatory action threatens to raise the rates consumers pay for \nsatellite television service, and therefore will hurt the ability of \nsatellite television operators to compete effectively with cable \noperators.\n  On October 27, 1997, the Librarian of Congress adopted a precipitous \nand unjustified increase in the copyright fees satellite carriers pay \nfor superstation and network affiliate signals delivered to satellite \nTV households.\n\n[[Page S8616]]\n\n  Before this increase, satellite copyright rates were 14 cents per \nsubscriber per month for each superstation signal and 6 cents per \nsubscriber per month for each network signal. Cable operators, by \ncomparison, pay much less for the same signals--an average of 9.7 cents \nfor the exact same superstations and 2.7 cents for the exact same \nnetwork signals. But, under the new copyright rates adopted last \nOctober, satellite carriers are forced to pay almost 270% more than \ncable pays for superstation signals, and 900% more than cable pays for \nnetwork signals.\n  These new copyright rates would add substantially to the regulatory \nand technical barriers satellite carriers already face in providing \nservice that customer consider a fair substitute for cable television. \nThey will hit consumers in rural areas particularly hard, because \nresidents in those areas have traditionally relied on reasonably-priced \nsatellite TV service as their only source of multichannel TV.\n  This amendment rolls this unreasonable satellite TV copyright rate \nincrease back to the rates in effect prior to January 1st of this year, \nand it delays the effective date of the rate increase to January 1, \n2000.\n  Mr. President, the 7.5 million U.S. households who currently \nsubscribe to satellite television deserve to have the effect of this \ncopyright fee increase on video competition reconsidered to ensure a \nless arbitrary and more consumer friendly result. This delay will give \nthe FCC an opportunity to analyze the impact increased copyright fees \nwould have on satellite's ability to compete with cable, and it will \ngive Congress an opportunity to evaluate the FCC's report and respond \naccordingly.\n  The bill also addresses an issue of continuing concern to the \nsatellite TV industry. Signal theft represents a serious threat to \nsatellite TV operators. In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress \nconfirmed the applicability of penalties for unauthorized decryption of \nsatellite TV services. The amendment we propose would confirm the \njudicial interpretation that civil suits may be brought by satellite TV \noperators for signal theft.\n  I thank the 27 Senators who co-sponsored this bill which affects \nevery single consumer of multichannel video service.\n  Mr. President, I thank the managers for allowing me to propose this \namendment. Let me say briefly, we all know that cable rates are on the \nrise, that the American consumers are very angry about it and they want \ncompetition. This will provide more competition.\n  There are other areas where we can provide more competition, such as \nthe ability to broadcast local news and local weather. Even the cable \nindustry does not oppose this move, because they know that in the \ninterest of fairness, we need to have a better equalization of these \ncopyright fees.\n  I hope we can have the amendment adopted. I thank the managers of the \nbill. I thank the Senator from California if I went ahead of her in the \nqueue. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am not sure if the Senator from South \nCarolina wants to make a statement, but we are ready to accept this \namendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? \nHearing none, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3229) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The amendment in the second degree I have just sent to the desk \nrequires that all handguns sold in the United States include a child \nsafety lock. I am offering this amendment for one extremely simple \nreason: to keep our children safe.\n  The Centers for Disease Control reports that 1.2 million children \nhave access to guns in the home, and a survey sponsored by the National \nInstitutes of Justice found that 34 percent of handgun owners store \ntheir guns unlocked and loaded. As long as this continues to be the \ncase, our children are not safe.\n  I have on this chart just some numbers. In one year, firearms killed \nno children in Japan--no children; 19 in Great Britain; 57 in Germany; \n109 children were killed in France; 153 children were killed in Canada; \nand in the United States of America, the greatest democracy in the \nworld, the greatest nation in the world, 5,285 children have been \nkilled.\n  I know that some of my colleagues prefer that I not offer this \namendment at this time. They will argue that my amendment is not \ngermane under a strict definition of the term ``germane,'' and I should \nwait until an authorization bill reaches the floor.\n  To those colleagues I say today that I have tried. For more than a \nyear, I have waited for the Senate to consider a firearms bill or a \ncrime bill, a juvenile justice bill, any bill to which I could attach \nthis amendment.\n  As the Senate waited, our schools have exploded in an unprecedented \nseries of shootings, many of which involved unlocked handguns stolen \nfrom the home of a friend or family member. As we waited, Mr. \nPresident, children across the country have died violent deaths.\n  I see my colleague from Illinois is here. He has worked on so many \nimportant issues, and he is working hard on this issue.\n  We were together just a few weeks ago with a mother who lost a child \nin the Arkansas shootout. She approached the microphone and, barely \naudibly, told us that we have to act. She understands, better than any \nof us, that our kids are dying. More kids are dying in this country \nthan any other country. And it would be so simple to lower those \nnumbers if we could get these safety locks on these weapons.\n  So we have waited. I think it is time that we stopped waiting. We \nhave to ask ourselves, How many children must die before we decide it \nis time to act? We cannot wait. We cannot delay. We must act now. The \nsafety of our children depend on it. I do not think any American wants \nto turn on the television and witness another one of these shootings \nthat could have been prevented had there been a safety lock on the gun. \nI am not saying it would prevent every single accident. But, Mr. \nPresident, we know it would definitely prevent many of those shootings. \nWe cannot delay.\n  Of these 5,285 children who were killed by firearms, Mr. President, \n440 died as a result of accidental shootings--kids, little kids, \nusually shot by other little kids, playing with a gun, found in their \nparents' bedroom or at a friend's home. That is over one child per day.\n  Look at this chart, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S8618]]\n\n  ``Boy paralyzed in a gun accident. Cousin, 9, mistakenly thought he \nremoved the bullets from the gun, police say.''\n  ``Avra Valley boy shot to death as his best friend handled handgun.''\n  ``3-year-old finds gun, kills sister.''\n  You know, we cannot be so jaded that we forget about the personal \ntragedies every family goes through when this happens. The mother from \nArkansas, Suzann Wilson, told us, ``I taught my daughter so many \nthings,'' because she said that ``it's a dangerous world.'' She said, \n``I taught her never to take a ride from a stranger. I told her, when \nyou walk down the street at night, be with a friend.'' She said, ``I \ntaught her everything I thought I had to. But,'' she said, ``I never \ntaught her, `Don't go outside when the fire alarm rings in school \nbecause some kid may have triggered the alarm and has a gun and is \ngoing to kill you.' ''\n  And just listening to her words, we knew we had to act as soon as we \ncould. I know my colleague from Illinois has been a leader in the area \nof the Brady bill and in the area of making parents responsible when \nchildren use a gun. All of these things together are important. And \nthis is very important.\n  Mr. President, over one child a day--more than one child a day--dies \nby accident because they are doing what normal children do. Normal \nchildren, they explore, they are curious; they find a gun, and they \nshoot it.\n  I want to put back the other chart which shows those numbers one more \ntime, because I hope Senators will take a look at these. I am going to \nexpand on some of the stories that I talked about here.\n  The 3-year-old who found a gun and killed his sister from Fort Myers, \nFL. Colton Hinke and his 2-year-old sister Kaile were playing in their \nparents' bedroom when Colton found an unlocked, loaded handgun in a \ndrawer. A neighbor who heard the shot rushed to the scene, found Kaile \non her back--her face pale, her lips blue, a small hole in her chest. \nShe was in shock. She was rushed to the hospital, but it was too late.\n  The neighbor told the Fort Myers News:\n\n       She was a beautiful little girl. She had the biggest blue \n     eyes. . . . The boy didn't even know what was going on. The \n     hardest thing is that they are both innocent victims.\n\n  A little 3-year-old brother--it is unbelievable, an accidental \nshooting of probably the little human being in his life he loved more \nthan anything else.\n  From Kansas City, KS, a 1-year-old Kansas City girl, shot in the \nhead. Here it is. ``1-year-old Kansas City, Kansas, girl shot in the \nhead.'' This article tells the story of a 1-year-old girl critically \ninjured when shot in the head by her 3-year-old brother.\n  Mr. President, something is desperately wrong. Their mother kept an \nunlocked, loaded handgun under her mattress to protect her family \nagainst intruders. But one evening, when she was changing the linens on \nher bed, she removed the handgun and placed it on a nightstand. It took \na few seconds for the 3-year-old son to pick up the gun and shoot his \nlittle sister.\n  A neighbor took the baby to the hospital and later said that the \nmother ``had the baby all covered up, but I could see a lot of blood. I \nhaven't seen that much blood for a long, long time.'' Miraculously, Mr. \nPresident, the little girl survived.\n  And from Salt Lake City, UT, ``Boy Playing With Gun Shoots and Kills \n13-year-old Friend.'' Here it is--Salt Lake City. Three boys were \nplaying in a Salt Lake City home when one found a loaded, unlocked \nhandgun hidden behind the headboard in the master bedroom. You know, \nkids are very smart. You think you are hiding something from them, but \nthey can find these things. They were horsing around in the bedroom and \nthe gun fired. The victim was transported by helicopter to the hospital \ntoo late--he was declared dead an hour later.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on. I am not going to take the time \nof the Senate to repeat all of these stories, because to repeat a \nstory, behind every headline, it would just take too much of the \nSenate's time. And the other reason is that when you keep telling these \nstories, you get so sad that you do not want to keep on focusing on the \npast. But let us talk about what we can do, what we can do to prevent \nsimilar tragedies in the future.\n  My amendment does that. Again, it was carefully crafted by Senator \nKohl, Senator Durbin, and myself. Just think, if the parents of those \nchildren, whose terrible stories I have told, were given a safety lock \nwhen they bought their handguns, these senseless tragedies--every one \nof them that I cited here--could have been avoided.\n  So what is a child safety lock? And how does it work? A child safety \nlock is simple; it is inexpensive device, designed to prevent the use \nof a firearm by unauthorized users--very simple. The most common are \ntrigger locks, which fit over the trigger of a gun; and chamber locks, \nwhich fit into a firearm's chamber, preventing it from discharging. I \nhave seen these locks. I have used these locks. They are very, very \nsimple to use.\n  My amendment also defines lockboxes--which are storage cases designed \nto hold guns securely--as child safety locks. If someone does not want \nto put a lock physically on the gun, they can lock it in a lockbox and \nit will qualify under the amendment. These devices are generally locked \nwith a key, although combination and other kinds of locks are \nacceptable.\n  Safety locks work. But do not take my word for it. Listen to what Gun \nTests magazine, a publication for gun enthusiasts, said about safety \nlocks:\n\n       If a lock is properly designed, it will ward off the \n     curious fingers of those too young to handle firearms \n     responsibly, while conveniently preserving access to guns \n     used for self protection.\n\n  So if you need to have the gun for self-protection, it is there.\n  Even Charlton Heston, president of the National Rifle Association, \nexpressed qualified support for safety locks during an appearance on \n``Meet the Press'' last month.\n  It is important. We all love children here. Most of us are parents; \nmany are grandparents. I think of my 3-year-old grandson. As \nresponsible parents we ought to make sure that these lethal weapons \ncannot be used by children.\n  This amendment is not about taking people's guns away. It aims only \nto protect children while preserving a citizen's right to keep a \nfirearm in the home for self-defense or any other legitimate purpose.\n  Again, Senator Kohl actually authored this bill and many of us are \ncosponsors. The good news is that many of the handgun makers have \ndecided to do this voluntarily, about 75 percent of them. This is good \nnews. The bad news is, 25 percent have not. That means there will be \n350,000 guns sold which will not be sold with a safety lock.\n  If we pass this legislation, the voluntary agreement will move \nforward and we will make sure that those 350,000 guns that will not be \ncovered by the voluntary agreement will be covered by a child safety \nlock.\n  If we pass this amendment, children will live who would otherwise die \nas a result of accidental gun shootings. Exactly how many? I don't \nknow; let's look at those numbers again. Out of the 5,000 deaths of \nchildren, 440 were accidents. Mr. President, I believe of those \naccidents, we could stop the majority.\n  I am proud to stand here for the children, to protect them from \nsafety and harm. Child safety locks will do that. I hope we will get an \noverwhelming vote.\n  I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California.\n  I rise in support of the Senator's amendment, first and second \ndegree.\n  Mr. President, at this point, does the Senator from California retain \nthe floor or is the correct procedure for me to ask for recognition \nunder my own right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from California is not going to \nyield the floor, the Senator can respond; if the Senator from \nCalifornia chooses to yield the floor, the Senator may rise and seek \nrecognition.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield for a question to my friend so I can retain the \nright to the floor at this time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I certainly rise in strong support of what the Senator \nfrom California is setting out to do. I want to acknowledge that she \nshares the important position that the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator \nKohl, has taken on this legislation.\n  I have a query of the Senator from California. Many of the critics \nwho come here saying this is unnecessary,\n\n[[Page S8619]]\n\nit is impractical, are the same people who have lamented, along with \nall of America, the tragic loss of life involved in children picking up \nguns. I will offer another amendment later on dealing with what I \nbelieve to be the responsibility of gun owners when they have a gun in \nthe presence of a child.\n  The Senator from California, though, really raises this question \nabout a very important mechanical part of this equation: Shall we put \non each handgun in America a device which will protect it so that if \nthe gun owner is not present and a child picks it up, the child can't \nhurt himself?\n  I brought with me evidence of that, which I am happy to share with \nthe Senator from California, to show exactly what we are talking about. \nThis is a trigger lock. And this trigger lock, as the Senator from \nCalifornia has noted, is easily disengaged, just with the turn of the \nkey, and opened.\n  I first saw one of these when I went to Elgin, IL, and the chief of \npolice showed me that every officer going home in the evening takes a \ntrigger lock and puts it on the gun. Of course, the officer may need \nthe gun for self-defense or law enforcement; they don't think a trigger \nlock is an impediment. With the key not in it, that gun can't be used.\n  I pose this question to the Senator from California: Is the Senator \nfrom California aware that the Federal Bureau of Investigation requires \nthat all of its agents have trigger locks on the guns that they take \nhome in the evening?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I answer my friend in this way. I heard that is their \nadvice. I was unaware it was a rule. Is my friend saying it is a rule?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, it is. As a matter of fact, is the Senator aware of \nthe fact that when Mr. Freeh, the Director of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last \nyear, I asked point blank, ``What has your experience been at the FBI \nwith this policy that requires child safety locks or trigger locks to \nbe used by every FBI agent?'' And Director Freeh said, ``I think it has \nworked very well. I think it hasn't impeded any readiness or ability to \nprotect. I think it is a very simple but very wholesome requirement. \nHaving five small boys myself, I think it is a very good idea, whether \nor not it is mandated.''\n  I just ask the Senator from California, is she aware of any of the \ncritics of this legislation who can overcome this testimony from the \nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that they already use \nthese trigger locks for law enforcement agents who take the guns home \nin an evening?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think it is very difficult to take the other side of \nthis issue. I am sure we will hear it, but try as I might, I can't \nunderstand one reason why we shouldn't do this. Seventy-five percent of \nthe makers of guns, I say to my friend, have agreed to do this \nvoluntarily, but still there are 25 percent of the guns that will come \non to the market with no safety lock.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Can the Senator from California tell me what is the cost \nof one of these trigger locks?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Five to ten dollars each.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In my home State of Illinois, the City of Elgin, which \nhas decided to pass a local law, actually subsidized the trigger lock \nsales so anyone coming to the police department could buy one for $3. \nSo anywhere from $3 for a subsidized trigger lock to a maximum of $10 \nbuys this peace of mind that I think is so important when we consider \nthis trigger lock legislation.\n  I might ask the Senator from California, your legislation would \nrequire, then, a trigger lock be sold with each handgun?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct. It would be part of the purchase, yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. At this point, I yield the floor back to the Senator from \nCalifornia, and at such time as she is finished, I will address it \nmyself.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \nremarks the Senator from Illinois be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I believe there are other \npeople who wish to address this issue. It would seem fair that we \nalternate from side to side.\n  There is nobody on our side now who wants to address it right now. \nHow much longer does the Senator from California plan to talk?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have completed my remarks at this time. I am happy to \nenter into a time agreement on this issue if the managers would like. \nIt is not my intention to hold up this bill as a member of the \nAppropriations Committee, so if you want to put together a time \nagreement, it would be excellent.\n  I know my colleague has been trying to get the floor; we can continue \nto do questions and answers, because that is another way we could go, \nbut I would prefer if he had an opportunity to speak, following my \nremarks.\n  Mr. GREGG. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will get ready to yield the floor to my \ncolleague from Illinois for 15 minutes of his remarks, but I want to \ntake this opportunity to thank him and again to thank Senator Kohl, who \nI know will be coming to the floor at some point to talk about this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Torricelli be added as a \ncosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I simply say this: If ever there was a matter that was a \ncommonsense matter, this is it. We are losing kids; 5,000 kids are \ndying. In my State, gunshot wounds are the No. 1 cause of death among \nchildren. So anything we can do to prevent that is worth doing.\n  My colleague has shown a typical safety lock. It is not expensive. \nMany companies have agreed to do this voluntarily. It seems to me we \nneed to give a boost to those others to join. This law would not \nadversely impact those who are voluntarily moving forward with these \nlocks.\n  I am interested to hear the argument against this because it will be \nhard for me to understand how we could look at this figure, say that we \nlove our children, say that we should be protectors of our children, \nand still not stand up for our children. We can do it with this \namendment. It isn't rocket science, it is a simple child safety lock. \nJust as we would keep out of the reach of our children anything \ndangerous, this is the only way to keep guns out of the reach of \nchildren.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their patience. I am looking \nforward to an overwhelming vote on this.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Mikulski be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, can I say something at the outset? There \nare people on the floor who oppose this amendment. I will be happy to \nyield during the course of my statement to debate it. I know they have \nstrong feelings on the other side. I think we can add something to this \nissue if we have a real debate instead of just monologues on both \nsides. I invite any Senator on the floor who opposes the Boxer-Durbin-\nKohl-Torricelli amendment to feel free at any moment to engage us in a \nquestion and debate. I think that would help the public in the \ngalleries and those watching television to follow this debate and to \nunderstand the simplicity and the honesty of the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from California.\n  Let me say that we should look at the scope of this challenge. We are \na Nation of 265 million people. We are a Nation of 300 million guns--\n300 million guns. As we stand here today in the midst of this debate, \napproximately half of those guns at this moment in time are accessible \nto children. They are accessible in the drawer behind the socks, in the \ncloset up on the shelf, down in the bottom of the closet behind the \nshoes--accessible to kids.\n  As the Senator from California will tell you--and I can attest to it \nhaving been a father and now a grandparent--children will always find \nChristmas gifts and guns. I don't care where you hide them, they are \ngoing to find them. When they find a loaded gun, tragic occurrences \nhappen. In fact, in this Nation that we live in, 14 times a day we lose \na child to a gun--14 times a day.\n\n[[Page S8620]]\n\n  What the Senator from California is suggesting is something that is \nso simple and practical that I think this Senate should go on the \nrecord with a vote in support of our amendment. This little trigger \nlock can save a life. It can save the life of that baby who you love so \ndearly--the grandchild who means so much to you.\n  I am going to make a little confession here. I have a conflict of \ninterest in this case, as does the Senator from California. She is the \nproud grandmother of 3-year-old Zack. I am the proud grandfather of 2-\nyear-old Alex. I am reminded every time we get in this debate of how \nmuch of a heartbreak it must have been for the parents and grandparents \nof those children who came home to find they had lost this baby they \nloved so much because of a tragic accident. Could it have been avoided? \nYes. For the lack of a trigger lock like this one, lives were lost.\n  Let me tell you something else that troubles me about this debate. \nThe National Rifle Association, to no one's surprise, opposes this. The \ngun lobby opposes this. Yet, I have spoken to gun owners about this \nissue, and I get an interesting response from them. How concerned are \nthey about children who are being injured with guns? They are very \nconcerned. They are also troubled that these gun lobby spokesmen stand \nup in Washington and say, ``This is none of your business, you should \nnot be passing laws to do this,'' because the gun owners I speak to \nsay, to a person, ``We never want a single firearm that we own to ever \nharm anybody in our household or any innocent victim, regardless of \ntheir age.'' These are responsible gun owners who understand their \nresponsibility under the law when they exercise their right to use guns \nsafely and legally.\n  What the Senator from California is trying to do----\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I bring to the Senator's attention that it \nis inappropriate under the Rules Committee's rules to bring an item for \ndemonstration to the floor. So I say that if this debate is going to \ncontinue, we will not proceed with the demonstration.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator objects to my showing a trigger lock on the \nfloor?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct. The Senate rules object to your showing \nthat on the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am relatively new here, and I am happy to be advised. I \nwill try not to violate the rules.\n  I ask unanimous consent to display a trigger lock during the course \nof this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  Mr. DURBIN. All right. I think you saw what I showed you, in \nviolation of the rules, a few minutes ago. I think you understand that \nthis tiny object, which could fit in my hand, which I can't pick up \nunder the rules of the Senate and under objection on the floor, is \nsomething that is not a major investment by any gun owner, but could \nbring peace of mind not only to the gun owner, but to other people.\n  When I held a press conference in Chicago, IL, and invited a friend \nof mine who had been, unfortunately, a statistic in this debate, he \ntold a story that chilled me about his 10-year-old son. He said, ``My \nwife and I never had a gun in our house because we were afraid that \nwith children around something might happen. We thought we were a safe \nfamily. Our son went next door to play with another child. . .'' and I \nguess you can come to a conclusion as to what happened. His child was \nkilled when the neighbor boy picked up a gun, playing with it, shot his \nson and killed him.\n\n  Suzanne Wilson, who testified 2 weeks ago, a mother from Jonesboro, \nAR, who would have faded into the background of all of the American \npeople who do their duty and raise their families, now has become a \nnational spokesperson. She will not let the death of her daughter in \nJonesboro, AR, be forgotten. She is supporting this legislation by \nSenator Boxer, as well as many other efforts to reduce the likelihood \nthat guns will be fired accidentally or will harm some young person.\n  I will tell you what. I cannot believe the opponents of this \nlegislation could stand and look this woman in the eye--a woman who \nsent her daughter to grade school, who loved her with all her heart, \nkissed her good-bye in the morning, and never saw her alive again. I \ndon't know if we will avoid the tragedy in Springfield, OR, or Pearl, \nMS, or Jonesboro, AR, or somebody else's hometown, tomorrow if we pass \nthis law, but I know it is the right step forward.\n  I know this Senate is capable of coming to the conclusion that we can \npass laws that will save lives. I know that we are willing to say to \ncertain special interest groups, ``No, you have gone too far.'' We have \nto use a trigger lock--which I can't show you--to protect our kids. I \nthink that is something that is just basic. How many people in America \nnow buy these clubs that they put on their steering wheels to protect \ntheir cars? This is a club to be put on a gun that is easily \naccessible. I can't show it to you, but you can turn the key and pull \nit off. Under the rules of the Senate, I can't show you that anymore.\n  I think you understand what I am saying. This is not a major \ninvestment, nor a complicated issue for people who dearly love these \nchildren and understand what is at stake. Believe me, this debate is \nabout you, not about States rights, not about the Bill of Rights. This \ndebate is about our children and their lives. That is what is at stake \nhere. This U.S. Senate can come together in a bipartisan fashion and do \nthe right thing for families across America. We will all join in \nlamenting any gun violence. We will give speeches on the floor, and at \nhome we will send letters of regret and condolences, as we should. But \nwhen it comes to the bottom line, how are we going to vote? \nRepresenting the people of Illinois, I will vote in favor of this Boxer \namendment. I think she is right that we need a new day in this country, \nwhich says that we are not going to take guns away but we are going to \ntake guns seriously, and guns not taken seriously become, \nunfortunately, the objects of crime and the objects of accidents, which \nbreak hearts and destroy families forever.\n  This is not too much to ask. What the Senator from California has \nproposed should be supported. I have been waiting for those who oppose \nthe amendment to engage me in debate. I hope they will. I am still \nwaiting. Even without my trigger lock, I am waiting. I would be happy \nto engage any of them in a debate on this issue. I see they are not \nready to do so.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have before us this afternoon an \namendment offered by the Senator from California that is one of those \nfeel-good amendments. Obviously, the Senator from Illinois has taken \nthe feel-good debate to its ultimate. All of us are dramatically \nconcerned and frustrated when anyone dies in this country accidentally. \nThere is no question that there is always a quick rush to mind saying \nthat there ought to be a law against that--especially if it appears to \nbe an accidental death that occurred because somebody was negligent. \nEven more reason to want to do something to disallow that kind of an \naccident from happening.\n  Now, I do not apologize for the fact that I am an active member of \nthe National Rifle Association, and I believe in trigger locks. I agree \nwith the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from California that \ntrigger locks ought to be employed in the storage of a gun for \nsafekeeping reasons, but I do not believe trigger locks ought to be \nused on loaded guns.\n  The gun that killed the child that the Senator from California so \ndramatically spoke of was a loaded gun, and therein lies the \ndifference. No FBI agent, no Federal agent of law enforcement in our \ncountry or State or local law enforcement agent with proper firearm \ntraining ever puts a trigger lock on a loaded gun. Why? Because the \nmanufacturer says don't do it. And why does the manufacturer say don't \ndo it? Because trigger locks are not a guarantee of safety--a jostling \nof the trigger lock, a dropping of the gun, a jamming of the trigger \nlock object that surrounds the encasing for the trigger could cause it \nto fire.\n  That is the reality. I know. I am a pistol shooter. I know about \nwhich I speak. But I am for trigger locks. I am for gun safes. I am for \ndrawers with\n\n[[Page S8621]]\n\nlocks on them because I want firearms safely stored in this country so \nthat the citizens who use firearms legally under the second amendment \ncan be guaranteed that that right will never be abridged.\n  What the Senator from Illinois talks about this afternoon is, in \nfact, tragic, and, of course, the Judiciary Committee spoke to this \nissue and said that everyone ought to be made aware of them. Certainly \neveryone who purchases a gun ought to have a full understanding and \nknowledge of the use of trigger locks for safekeeping. Should it be a \nFederal mandate? I don't think so.\n  Most importantly, it should not offer a sense of false security. That \nis what is important. And yet I will tell you that the Senator from \nCalifornia speaks of panaceas: But for the trigger lock no child will \ndie. The Senator from Illinois: But for a trigger lock the world will \nbe safer. No, it won't be if the gun is loaded. Now, if the person who \nowns the firearm is responsible, if the person who owns the firearm \ndoes not plan to use it for personal protection and needs it \nimmediately for their access or personal protection, that gun ought to \nbe unloaded. The ammunition ought to be stored separately from the \nfirearm. That is the rule of the game. That is what you are supposed to \ndo as a law-abiding citizen. That is how you properly handle a firearm.\n  Well, let's talk about tragedies in this country. There is no \nquestion that when a small child finds a firearm which a parent has \nleft loaded, and that small child plays with it and either kills him or \nherself or kills a brother or sister, oh, my goodness, what a \nphenomenal tragedy. I mourn; we all mourn. Parents who have acted so \nirresponsibly as to cause their child to die under those circumstances \nare the responsible parties. The gun should have been unloaded. The gun \nshould have been properly stored. If it were unloaded, it should have a \ntrigger lock on it. But it does not happen that way all the time. Cars \nare never intended to kill people, but they kill people every day. \nTeenagers should drive safely, but they don't. They are very \nirresponsible at that age. Dramatic accidents happen such as just \nhappened on the East-West Highway locally and teenagers are killed by a \nvery safe car. They acted irresponsibly. They should not have done what \nthey did.\n  While the number of privately owned firearms in this country has \nquadrupled since 1930, the annual number of accidental fatalities--and \nthat is what the Senator from Illinois is talking about, accidents--not \nintentional shootings, accidents--the number of accidents involving \nfatalities with firearms has declined 56 percent nationwide, against a \nphenomenal increase in the number of firearms owned by citizens, law-\nabiding citizens. We don't count the criminals.\n\n  Firearms are involved in 1.5 percent of accidental fatalities \nnationwide, and they are oftentimes the most dramatic or they are \noftentimes the most dramatized on the front page of a local, State or \nnational newspaper. And I know why. Because the Senators from Illinois \nand California speak with the same emotion I do, especially when it is \na small child who is involved in that kind of a situation. But let me \ntell you what is going to kill small children this summer on a 5-to-1, \n6-to-1, 10-to-1 basis. It is not going to be a gun. It is not going to \nbe a gun. It is going to be the very thing that the Senator from \nIllinois has in his drinking glass right now. It is going to be water. \nMore children are going to drown this summer in neighborhood pools and \nbackyard swimming pools--by the hundreds--than will die by a gunshot. \nAnd yet the Senator from Illinois is not proposing to outlaw or put \nlocks on swimming pools.\n  Now, all of those deaths are just as accidental. But, you know, one \nsize fits all and if we have a Federal law, it is going to take care of \neverybody, and everybody will be safe and the world will be better, and \npolitics will be more clear.\n  It does not work that way. It should not work that way. We are \nsupposed to be a land without Federal mandates, and yet this year more \nchildren are going to die by drowning. Remember, accidental fatalities \nthis year: 4.8 percent by drowning, 1.5 percent by a firearm. But if \nyou really want to get big numbers, more children are going to die this \nyear by falling, probably out of the high chair under the supervision \nof a careful mother who accidentally turns away or inadvertently turns \naway or momentarily turns away from her infant child, or maybe the \nfather, and that number is going to be about 13.5 percent, but that \ndoes include older people, too. In other words, the reality with which \nwe speak this afternoon is not all black and white, not at all. Death \nby falling, 13.5 percent; vehicles, cars, 47 percent; poisoning, 11 \npercent.\n  When somebody dies by poisoning or by accidental poisoning, it isn't \nas dramatic because the national media isn't as intent on getting rid \nof our second amendment rights, so they don't publicize that as much. \nAnd they really don't have anything against backyard swimming pools so \nthat only usually is covered by the local or the State media simply \nbecause of the tragedy of the loss.\n  Well, those are the realities with which we speak on this issue. \nProper storage of firearms is the responsibility of every gun owner, \nand also education, safety, training and careful consideration.\n  All factors that relate to an individual's particular needs are key \nto this responsibility. That is really the issue here. And I know the \nSenator from Illinois and I would wish that everybody was appropriately \neducated on gun ownership, had been through the right schooling or the \nright training, would always unload their firearm and store it a long \nway away from its ammunition.\n  That is not what happens. People oftentimes become not careless, but \nthey just assume. We have seen teenagers breaking into homes. That is \nstealing. That is theft. And yet we pass laws on that. We have laws \nagainst teenagers breaking into homes and stealing things, including \nguns, and yet they still do it. That is why it is important that we \ntalk about this issue this afternoon. Oh, it is politically very \npopular. It is the right thing to do in an election year, but it may be \nthe wrong thing to do when it comes to safety and security if it isn't \nappropriately handled. I recommend trigger locks. If I owned a pistol--\nand I don't--I would have a trigger lock on it. And it would be empty \nwith a trigger lock on it. But that is the reality of the kind of \nissues that we debate here.\n  A general firearm safety rule that must be applied to all conditions \nis that a firearm should be stored so that it is not accessible to \nuntrained or unauthorized people.\n  That is the right rule. That is the one that really fits. That is the \none that really works well. And then you don't have the accidents to \ntalk about.\n  Antigun groups overstate the number of firearm-related deaths among \nchildren by defining ``children'' to include anyone through the age of \n19. The statistics that have been talked about here on the floor \ninclude teenagers acting violently. The reason is, 84 percent of \nfirearm-related deaths--that includes homicide, suicides, and accidents \namong persons zero to 19 years of age--are accounted for by adolescents \nand young adults from 15 to 19; 84 percent, 15 to 19 years of age.\n  No; the examples cited by the Senator from California, while very \ndramatic and very emotional, are clearly the exception, the horrible \nexception, and not the rule. So, when we talk statistics this \nafternoon, and we talk about children, we are talking about zero to 19, \nby those statistics. At least that is what I am told.\n  The anti-firearm Children's Defense Fund and other gun control \nadvocates have applied, if you will, the trick to all of the national \nstatistics and data relating to that 1 child for every 90-odd minutes, \n10 children out of 5,000--all of those figures. The reality is zero to \n19, if anyone listening is interested in those kinds of statistics.\n  So a few moments ago I was giving you figures about these dramatic \ndeaths that occur when a firearm is misused. The annual number of \nfirearm accidents among children in 1995 fell to an all-time low in \n1995--181 children. That is below the age of 15. We are pleased about \nthat number, although terribly saddened, because I think some of the \neducational programs that some independent groups are using out there \nright now are helping educate young people to stay away from firearms \nif they don't understand them\n\n[[Page S8622]]\n\nand if they have not been properly trained to use them.\n  Other types of accidental fatalities among children--children of the \nsame category--where there were 181 killed by firearms, there were \n3,095 killed in auto accidents. The Senator who is presiding at this \nmoment has worked to dramatically lessen the impact of airbags when \nthey are deployed because mishandled, and the child in an improper seat \ncan be killed by an airbag in a car. I am not sure this Congress has \nresponded to that in a timely and appropriate fashion, although Senator \nKempthorne has worked over time to make that happen. It just so \nhappens, it is a 30-to-1 relationship of children who will be killed in \nauto accidents every year compared to those young people who might be \nkilled by the mishandling of a gun.\n  I mentioned the local swimming pool. It is a hot day out there. We \nare fortunate being in an air-conditioned building. Tragically enough, \nthere will probably be more children drowned today across this country \naccidentally than will be killed by a firearm. The statistics bear it \nout--1,024 in 1995 killed by drowning.\n  Fires, suffocation, falling--I have talked percentagewise. Let's talk \nstatistics. Fires: 833 children burned to death in 1995; suffocation, \ningestion of an object--we have all--not all of us, many of us--have \nraised small children. We know how frightened we are about a child's \nchoking on an object, getting something in that mouth, picking up \nsomething and swallowing it. Mr. President, 213 will die, on an average \nbasis, annually because of that. We haven't outlawed small objects, I \nguess because we cannot, although some here might want to try. But that \nis the reality of what we deal with.\n\n  And the statistics go on and on. There were 44,583 deaths amongst \nchildren in 1995; .04 percent firearms. All the rest were the kinds of \nthings that we can do very little about. We should try where we can. We \ncan change the deployment impact of airbags. We probably cannot outlaw \nbackyard swimming pools. We probably cannot mandate better \ncaretakership at the community swimming pool. And somehow, we just \ncan't teach moms and dads about child safety seats and not putting \nyoung children in the front seats of their cars. And that still goes \non.\n  So, those are some of the facts and statistics that we will talk \nabout today, probably more than once, as we deal with this issue.\n  I do not in any way try to misrepresent the intent of the Senators \nwho have offered the amendment. But I will speak to reality based on \nknowledge. Manufacturers and anyone else knowledgeable in the use of a \nfirearm will say not a trigger lock on a loaded gun--no, no, not at \nall--because you risk even a greater chance of accidental death. \nTrigger locks are recommended and should be used on unloaded guns. But \nthat is the reality. So if we mandate it by Federal law, we risk even \ngreater numbers of accidents. You even risk a great number of people \nviolating laws because of the inability to accommodate or live up to \nthis. That is the issue we deal with. That is the issue we will debate \nfor a substantial period of time today.\n  It is very important that we understand it, because, try as we may as \na Congress with good intent, as a Senate and Senators who care a great \ndeal, we cannot legislate out of this life of ours accidental death or \nwe wouldn't have any of the 44,000 children who will die this year die, \nbe it by gun or by car or by drowning or by falling or by choking.\n  Let me close by saying I forgot to talk about the bicycle and the \ntricycle and the accidents that occur when children use those in an \nunsupervised way. We read about that on a regular basis, tragically \nenough. But I don't think the Senate is going to try to outlaw the \ntricycle or bicycle today--only the gun--or at least legislate it being \nmandated as to its management, its handling. That is the issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I come to the floor to support this \namendment which would require the sale of a child safety lock with \nevery handgun. This amendment is based on the Child Safety Lock Act \nwhich we produced last year with bipartisan support from Senators \nChafee, Durbin, and Boxer.\n  It is a commonsense measure, obviously, and it is not an extreme \nmeasure. It is a measure that will reduce gun-related accidents, \nsuicides, and homicides by young people. It will make children safer \nand it will make mothers and fathers feel more secure in dropping off \ntheir children at their neighbors' homes after school.\n  In brief, all it will do is bring all the industry up to the level of \nmost manufacturers who have already agreed to include safety locks with \ntheir guns. Our amendment is simple, effective, and it is \nstraightforward. It requires that whenever a handgun is sold, a child \nsafety device--or a trigger lock--also be sold.\n  These devices vary in form, but the most common resemble a padlock \nthat wraps around the gun trigger and immobilizes it.\n  While we want people to use safety locks, we do not require it. In \nthat sense, we treat safety locks like States used to treat seatbelts: \nYou have to buy them, but you don't have to use them.\n  This amendment is sorely needed. Mr. President, 2,000 young people \nare killed each year in firearms accidents and suicides. This is not \nonly wrong, it is unacceptable.\n  While our proposal is not a panacea, it will prevent many of these \ntragedies. Just today, in the Washington Post there is a story about a \nPrince George's boy of 4 who shot himself while playing with a handgun \nthat was left laying around by his grandfather. Had that handgun been \nsecured by a child-safety-lock device, this needless tragedy just \nyesterday would not have occurred.\n  Safety locks will also reduce violent crime. Juveniles commit more \nthan 7,000 crimes each year with guns taken from their own homes. That \ndoesn't include incidents like the school shooting in Jonesboro, AR, \nwhere the guns were taken from the home of one student's grandfather, \nagain, because most of ``dad's guns were locked up.''\n  If parents and relatives would use safety locks on these guns, then \nat least some of these incidents will be prevented. To be sure not all, \nbut some. The fact is that a child with a handgun is an accident or a \ncrime just waiting to happen. Of course, we should commend the gun \nmanufacturers who already have voluntarily agreed to comply with this \nproposal. But we still need this legislation because too many \nmanufacturers still resist common sense.\n  The voluntary agreement covers about 77 percent of all new handguns \nmanufactured in the U.S. each year, which is an impressive number. But \nit still leaves at least 350,000 handguns for sale each year without \nsafety locks. This proposal brings hundreds of thousands more handguns \nup to the industry standard.\n  Mr. President, this amendment deserves our support. I thank you, and \nI yield my time back.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nWisconsin who, in the Judiciary Committee, has shown exceptional \nleadership on this issue, along with the Senator from California.\n  I defer to my friend from Idaho who spoke earlier about the member of \nthe National Rifle Association executive board. I am certain his \nknowledge of firearms and handguns surpasses mine. But I will say that \nhis statement, ``No one should use a trigger lock on a loaded gun'' \napparently depends on the type of lock involved.\n  I have in my hand from the Safety Lock Company an advertisement that \nsays:\n\n       Lock for life. Hopefully, the garden hose is your kid's \n     most powerful weapon. You no longer have to choose between \n     your home security and your children's safety. Safety Lock is \n     the only child safety lock for guns that can be locked safely \n     while the gun is loaded, permanently installed on a handgun, \n     unlocked in a few seconds, even in total darkness.\n\n  It appears it depends on the type of trigger lock or safety lock we \nare discussing as to whether or not the gun should be loaded.\n  I would like to address what I think is the more central argument \nmade against this amendment by the Senator from Idaho. I am not \nsurprised by\n\n[[Page S8623]]\n\nthe argument, because we hear it all the time. In legislative circles, \nit is known as the argument that the best is always the enemy of the \ngood. Someone will come in and say, ``Yes, you may save, oh, 5,000 \nkids' lives a year, but there are 44,000 other lives out there that you \nought to try to save, too.'' I am not going to argue with the Senator \nfrom Idaho. I think we should take every reasonable step we can to \nprotect all children in all circumstances.\n  In this particular case, though, the Senator from California and the \nSenator from Wisconsin come forward with a practical answer to a \nproblem which haunts families across America with the proliferation of \nguns in our Nation. They have suggested trigger locks be sold with \nhandguns. It is not an outrageous and radical idea. Law enforcement in \nAmerica, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, already uses \nthese trigger locks, and they work.\n  For the Senator from Idaho to say, well, kids drown in swimming \npools, that is a sad reality, too, but we are not about to close down \nswimming pools. We talk about children being trained, but we also talk \nabout lifeguards and parents' responsibility.\n  I say to my colleagues, this is about a parent's responsibility, too. \nNo parent is going to take a 2-year-old toddler who has never been in \nthe water and toss him in the swimming pool and walk away. They would \nnever consider it.\n  Would that parent leave a loaded gun where a 2 or 3-year-old can grab \nit? Sadly, that is happening time and time again. What we are saying is \nput a device on that gun that lessens the likelihood that a child is \ngoing to be injured.\n\n  The National Rifle Association's opposition to this seems to be that \nit means there is too much Government--too much Government--to ask that \nwe put a safety trigger lock, a child-safety device with each handgun. \nIn States across the United States now, we are adopting laws to mandate \nchildren's car seats to protect kids riding in a car. We don't consider \nthat too much Government. We consider that common sense. It is common \nsense when we are talking about seatbelts, children's car seats, \nchildren's seats in airplanes. It is common sense--protect the \nchildren. They are too young and immature to protect themselves. A \ntrigger lock does that, too. It is not a matter of too much Government.\n  The other argument from the National Rifle Association and others is \nthis is too much to ask. You are asking a gun owner to spend another \n$3, $5 or even $10 to make their gun safe at home?\n  I don't think that is too much to ask. I really don't. I think this \nis a reasonable suggestion. I think what you will find is as it becomes \ncommonplace across America, the cost will go down and quality will go \nup on these trigger locks. That is something that is a reality of life. \nIt is something that is not too much to ask.\n  The seatbelt analogy, I think, is a good one. The Senator from Idaho \nmade reference to it earlier. What we are talking about here is not \nputting every gun owner in jail who doesn't have a trigger lock. We are \ntalking about creating an environment of thinking in America.\n  Let me confess here that when I grew up, the first car I owned didn't \nhave seatbelts in it. I guess you know how old I am. Then for a number \nof years, I bought cars with seatbelts and promptly sat on them every \ntime I got in the car. Then somebody in my State said, ``Let's pass a \nlaw and say you have to buckle your seatbelt.'' I never got arrested \nfor that, and I started using seatbelts. I don't feel all that \ncomfortable without it.\n  What we are trying to do is say to gun owners across America, \n``Please join us. This is not taking your guns away. It is trying to \ncreate an environment of safety around children.'' What the Senator \nfrom California and the Senator from Wisconsin are suggesting is taking \nguns seriously. I will offer an amendment later along the same lines, \nbut much like seatbelts, we want people to think twice about those \nguns.\n  The Senator from Idaho criticized the bill and said, ``Oh, there are \nso many teenagers who are misusing guns.'' He is right. There are so \nmany things we need to do about it, and he and I will join in \nincreasing criminal penalties and so many other things that can be \ndone.\n  In most instances, we are talking about immature children, children \nwho pick up a gun and don't have a clue as to the danger of this \nweapon, turn it on a playmate, turn it on a sister or brother and \ntragedy follows.\n  I think the American people don't believe this is an unreasonable \nintrusion in their lives. They think it is common sense.\n  I salute both Senators from California and Wisconsin for their \nleadership on this. I am happy to stand as a cosponsor of this \namendment, and I hope Members of the Senate, gun owners and those who \nare not gun owners--Democrats and Republicans--will step back for a \nminute and say this just makes sense. Let us at least save some of \nthese children's lives. Let us put safety into the equation. Let us \nunderstand that an industry that has basically fought off every effort \nto put safety standards on the guns they manufacture should at least \nnot stand in the way of trigger locks to save lives.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senators Kohl and Durbin for their \neloquent remarks and, again, say to my colleagues, it is Senator Kohl's \nbill that we essentially have here with very few changes. It almost \npassed the Judiciary Committee. It was defeated by a very narrow \nmargin.\n  We are going to get a vote up or down on this amendment. I am very \npleased about that.\n  Every single one of us on both sides of this issue absolutely love \nchildren. It is just very hard for me to understand that we cannot come \ntogether on this commonsense approach.\n  This amendment does no violence to the right to own a gun, to the \nright to buy a gun, to the right to use a gun lawfully. It merely says \nthat we are going to make sure that parents, when they buy a gun, have \nwith it a safety lock that is easy to put. And I have to tell my \nfriends and colleagues here, I know if you could meet with just one of \nthe parents of these children who were killed accidentally, you support \nthis amendment.\n  Of the 5,285 children killed every year by gunfire, more than 440 are \ncompletely accidental deaths. And let us think about 400 kids dying \naccidentally every year and what that means--kids who would have grown \nup and had families of their own and given joy to their parents and \ngrown to be grandparents. This is a small thing to do. I am always \namazed, I say to my friends, that we cannot come together and reach \nacross the party lines on these issues.\n  I want to put into the Record a letter that I received today from the \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Officers, or IBPO. And this is what \nthey write. This is important because these are the law enforcement \nofficers:\n\n       On behalf of the entire membership of the IBPO, I want to \n     thank you for the amendment that will require that all \n     licensed manufacturers, importers or dealers must include a \n     separate child safety lock or locking device with each \n     handgun purchased. The IBPO strongly endorses your \n     legislation and looks forward to working with you on this \n     important matter.\n       The IBPO represents street cops.\n\n  So these are cops who are on the beat and on the street.\n  Police officers, the letter goes on are out in the community every \nday.\n\n       By far, the most difficult part of their job is to arrive \n     at home where a gun is left out, unsecured and tragedy has \n     occurred. This legislation simply put will save lives. Each \n     day in America, 16 children, age 19 and under are killed with \n     firearms. Many of these deaths could have been avoided with a \n     simple trigger lock attached to the gun.\n\n  My colleagues have shown those trigger locks here. They are very \ninexpensive. They are very easy to use. And, yes, there is one company \nthat makes them so you could place it on a loaded handgun. So the \nargument you would have to leave your gun unloaded is simply not \ncorrect. However, it should be noted that all law enforcement agencies \nrecommend storing firearms locked, unloaded, and out of the reach of \nchildren.\n  The letter from Kenneth Lyons, the National President of the IBPO, \ngoes on to say: The Centers for Disease Control estimates that nearly \n1.2 million unsupervised children have access to\n\n[[Page S8624]]\n\nloaded and unlocked firearms in the home.\n  Let me repeat what he writes to us: ``1.2 million unsupervised \nchildren have access to loaded and unlocked firearms in the home.''\n\n       It is because of these numbers that this legislation is \n     needed.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      International Brotherhood of\n\n\n                                              Police Officers,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 21, 1998.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: The International Brotherhood of Police \n     Officers (IBPO) is an affiliate of the Service Employees \n     International Union, the third largest union in the AFL-CIO. \n     The IBPO is the largest police union in the AFL-CIO \n     representing over 50,000 police officers nationwide.\n       On behalf of the entire membership of the IBPO, I want to \n     thank you for amendment that will require that all licensed \n     manufacturer, importer or dealer must include a separate \n     child safety or locking device with each handgun purchase. \n     The IBPO strongly endorses your legislation and looks forward \n     to working with you on this important matter.\n       The IBPO represents street cops. Police officers who are \n     out in the community every day. By far, the most difficult \n     part of their job is to arrive at home where a gun is left \n     out, unsecured and tragedy has occurred. This legislation \n     simply put will save lives. Each day in America, 16 children, \n     age 19 and under are killed with firearms. Many of these \n     deaths could have been avoided with a simple trigger lock \n     attached to the gun.\n       I must note for those opponents of child safety locks that \n     the Center for Disease Control estimate that nearly 1.2 \n     million unsupervised children have access to loaded and \n     unlocked firearms in the home. It is because of these numbers \n     that this legislation is needed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kenneth T. Lyons,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Another letter comes to us from a heroine of mine, Sarah \nBrady, whose husband Jim, as you remember, was gunned down when he was \nthe press secretary to President Reagan. She is the head of Handgun \nControl and writes us a letter today.\n\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing to commend you for all \n     your efforts to ensure that every handgun sold in the United \n     States be sold with a child safety lock or other safety \n     device designed to prevent unauthorized use. Jim and I urge \n     all Senators to support this amendment to the Commerce, \n     State, Justice Appropriations.\n\n  And she reiterates the facts that we have gone over today.\n\n       Every day in America, 14 children, age 19 and under, are \n     killed with firearms. Many of those deaths--accidents, \n     suicides, and homicides--are preventable. One of the best \n     ways of preventing these tragedies is to keep children from \n     gaining access to a gun in the home. Public opinion surveys \n     reveal that almost half of all households own firearms. \n     Regrettably, a substantial number of gun owners improperly \n     store their weapons, leaving them loaded, unlocked or both. A \n     National Institute of Justice survey showed that 55% of all \n     handgun owners keep their handguns loaded, and 34% keep a \n     handgun that is loaded and unlocked.\n\n  As Senator Kohl has said--this is recipe for disaster. Unfortunately, \nwe know this isn't a disaster just waiting to happen at some time in \nthe future. If you look at this collage of headlines, this is a \ndisaster that is happening in every city in every town in every suburb. \nThere isn't a day that goes by that I do not get something in a clip \nfrom California. And these are from around the country. So this is a \ndisaster that is happening now. Sarah Brady quite understands this. She \ngoes on to write:\n\n       . . . the rate of firearm deaths among children 0 to 14 \n     years of age is nearly twelve times higher in the U.S. than \n     in 25 other industrialized countries combined.\n\n  So let us look at the other chart one more time, because you can see \nthese numbers: Zero children killed in Japan; 19 in Great Britain; 57 \nin Germany; 109 in France; 153 in Canada; and 5,285 children killed by \nhandguns in a year in the United States.\n  We can sit back and say, ``So what.'' We could sit back and say, \n``Oh, we just have to give another piece of paper that talks about \nit.'' Or we can vote for this important amendment and make sure that \nwhen the parents buy the gun, it includes a child safety lock.\n  Now, I think it is important to laud some of the gun companies that \nhave decided to volunteer to put these locks on guns and sell them with \nthose locks without a law. I think it is wonderful that they have done \nit. They came to the White House and they reached an agreement with the \nPresident, and we are going to see more handguns sold with these locks.\n  However, the problem we have is that about 25 percent of handguns \nwill not have these locks because the companies, including several in \nmy state, have not agreed to this voluntary agreement. This means that \nabout 350,000 guns every year will not be covered--350,000 guns--will \nnot be covered by the voluntary agreement. So we are saying, good for \nthe companies that volunteered to do this. Now let us make sure that \neverybody does it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Sarah Brady's letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Handgun Control, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 1998.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing to commend you for all \n     your efforts to ensure that every handgun sold in the United \n     States be sold with a child safety lock or other safety \n     device designed to prevent unauthorized use. Jim and I urge \n     all Senators to support the Boxer Amendment to. S.2260, the \n     Fiscal Year 1999 Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations.\n       Every day in America, 14 children, age 19 and under, are \n     killed with firearms. Many of those deaths--accidents, \n     suicides, and homicides--are preventable. One of the best \n     ways of preventing them is to keep children from gaining \n     access to a gun in the home. Public opinion surveys reveal \n     that almost half of all households own firearms and that, \n     regrettably, a substantial number of gun owners improperly \n     store their weapons, leaving them loaded, unlocked or both. A \n     May 1997 study sponsored by the National Institute of Justice \n     showed that 55% of all handgun owners keep their handguns \n     loaded, and 34% keep a handgun that is loaded and unlocked.\n       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \n     estimate that nearly 1.2 million latch key children have \n     access to loaded and unlocked firearms. It is no surprise, \n     therefore, that children and teenagers cause over 10,000 \n     unintentional shootings each year in which at least 800 \n     people die.\n       According to a February 1997 CDC study, the rate of firearm \n     deaths among children 0 to 14 years of age is nearly twelve \n     times higher in the U.S. than in 25 other industrialized \n     countries combined. Mandating the sale of trigger locks or \n     other safety devices with each handgun purchase is an \n     important first step toward preventing these senseless \n     tragedies.\n       Yes, great progress has been made. As you know, in October, \n     President Clinton reached agreement with most, but not all, \n     handgun manufacturers that they would voluntarily include a \n     child safety lock with the weapon that they manufacture and \n     sell. Your legislation will ensure that all handguns sold in \n     the United States include this important safety device.\n       Again, thank you for your efforts to ensure that our \n     children are safe from unintentional gun violence.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Sarah Brady,\n                                                            Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what we have here is a very \nstraightforward amendment. It simply says, when a handgun is sold, \ninclude a lock. If a customer prefers a lockbox, that is acceptable to \nus, that is fine. And it is endorsed by the police, one of the largest \norganizations of cops on the beat, Handgun Control, and Sarah \nBrady. This is something that we can do.\n\n  We don't want to wake up in the morning and see these headlines \nanymore, we don't: ``6-year-old Boy Shot at Friend's House.'' That is \nin Allentown, Pennsylvania. In New Orleans: ``Boy, 6, Shot by his \nBrother.'' ``Boy Accidentally Shot by Cousin.'' ``17-month-old Shot \nAccidentally by Boy.'' ``9-year-old Oasis Boy Accidentally Shot.'' That \nis in California. ``Boy Paralyzed in a Gun Accident.''\n  There is something I want to point out. When we look at the \nstatistics, we don't show the wounded, we show only the fatalities. For \nevery death, up to eight victims are wounded and often live their lives \nnursing chronic injuries. So what we do here just doesn't deal with \npreventing deaths, but also with preventing debilitating injuries.\n  I think I have stated the case as best as I can. I don't know if my \ncolleague from New Hampshire is going to take to the floor, but I do \nknow that Senator Biden will be here at 4 o'clock, I say to the \nchairman. He would like to have an opportunity to speak. If Chairman \nGregg would like to enter into unanimous consent that we can set this \naside until Senator Biden comes, I am happy to do that. That would be, \nI think, a good way.\n\n[[Page S8625]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. That is up to other Members who wish to take the floor. I \nhave no objection.\n  Mrs. BOXER. There are no other colleagues here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Smith be recognized for 20 \nminutes, and at that time Senator Biden immediately follow.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I just noticed the Senator \nfrom Idaho. Did the Senator desire further time? There is a unanimous \nconsent request by the Senator from California. The essence of the \nrequest was that this amendment be set aside, that Senator Smith from \nNew Hampshire go forward for 20 minutes, then Senator Biden would be \nnext, and we would be back on your amendment, with Senator Biden \nspeaking at the conclusion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And if Senator Craig wants to come in at that point, that \nis fine, and Senator Kohl has some time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I have no objection.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I could amend the request, Senator Kohl wanted 2 \nminutes, and then Senator Smith for 20 minutes, and then Senator Biden, \nand then go back on the bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Reserving the right to object, just to \nclarify. I have remarks that would not be more than 15 or 20 minutes. \nThe only thing is, I don't know if there are others who may wish to \nspeak for or against the amendment. I didn't want to preclude that \nopportunity. I certainly have no objection to going back to your \namendment. That is perfectly appropriate, and I appreciate your offer--\nif we could somehow get the timeframe to make my remarks but not to \npreclude other people coming back to speak for or against my amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Does the Senator have a different amendment he is about \nto offer? Is that what this is about?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I have a separate amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am trying to accommodate my friend because I thought he \nhad a statement to make, a 20-minute statement to make.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. No; I have an amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is it an amendment that would be accepted?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. No.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was trying to accommodate my colleague, but I think it \nis better to go with the flow of this amendment. I know Senator Kohl \nwants to speak, Senator Durbin, Senator Craig, so I suggest we stay on \nthis amendment.\n  I am trying to accommodate my colleague.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator has the floor. When the Senator yields the \nfloor, it will be up to the Chair as to who gets recognized. At this \ntime there doesn't seem to be a unanimous consent that is agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Could I suggest a unanimous consent \nrequest. Let me make one and see if it is acceptable.\n  I make a unanimous consent request that I be allowed to offer my \namendment to speak not more than 20 minutes, after which time we would \ngo back to the amendment of the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have no objection, but I would ask my friend if he \ncould give just one minute to Senator Kohl, then set aside the Boxer \namendment, go to the Smith amendment, and then return for Senator \nBiden's discussion of the Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. But not to preclude additional time after \nyour amendment is completed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from California withdraw the \nunanimous consent?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will go along with Senator Smith's unanimous consent \nrequest, as I modified, so Senator Kohl can speak for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator withdraws.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I withdraw.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest of the Senator from New Hampshire?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. KOHL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Just a couple of brief points. Even though Senator Craig and those of \nus on the other side differ on this amendment, I have no doubt that \nSenator Craig is committed to ensuring gun safety. In fact, he was \ninstrumental in passing our 1994 law, the Youth Handgun Safety Act that \nprohibits kids from having handguns.\n  Second, we have really come a long way in the last few years. Today \neverybody, from the NRA to the gun manufacturers to police advocates, \nis advocating for handgun control because all believe that trigger \nlocks, child safety locks, are helpful in preventing gun-related harm.\n  No matter what the outcome is on this vote, I am sure we will \ncontinue to work for a consensus. Someday, I believe we will reach one \non the issue of kids and guns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3233\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3233.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       ``Sec.   . None of the funds appropriated pursuant to this \n     Act or any other provision of law may be used for (1) any \n     system to implement 18 U.S.C. 922(t) that does not require \n     and result in the immediate destruction of all information, \n     in any form whatsoever, submitted by or on behalf of any \n     person who has been determined not to be prohibited from \n     owning a firearm; (2) the implementation of any tax or fee in \n     connection with the implementation of 18 U.S.C. 922(t); \n     provided, that any person aggrieved by a violation of this \n     provision may bring an action in the federal district court \n     for the district in which the person resides; provided, \n     further, that any person who is successful with respect to \n     any such action shall receive damages, punitive damages, and \n     such other remedies as the court may determine to be \n     appropriate, including a reasonable attorney's fee. The \n     provisions of this section shall become effective one day \n     after enactment.''\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and \nnays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3234 to Amendment No. 3233\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I send a second-degree to \nmy own amendment and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3234 to amendment No. 3233.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  In the pending amendment, strike all after the word ``SEC.'' and \ninsert in lieu thereof the following:\n  ``Sec.  .None of the funds appropriated pursuant to this Act or any \nother provision of law may be used for (1) any system to implement 18 \nU.S.C. 922(t) that does not require and result in the immediate \ndestruction of all information, in any form whatsoever, submitted by or \non behalf of any person who has been determined not to be prohibited \nfrom owning a firearm; (2) the implementation of any tax or fee in \nconnection with the implementation of 18 U.S.C. 922(t); provided, that \nany person aggrieved by a violation of this provision may bring an \naction in the federal district court for the district in which the \nperson resides; provided, further, that any person who is successful \nwith respect to any such action shall receive damages, punitive \ndamages, and such other remedies as the court may determine to be \nappropriate, including a reasonable attorney's fee. The provisions of \nthis section shall become effective upon enactment.''\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this amendment relates to\n\n[[Page S8626]]\n\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation's new National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System, otherwise known as the NICS, which is \nscheduled to take effect on December 1 of this year.\n  The so-called Brady Act had two provisions. One of those provisions \nwas an interim provision, and the other was a permanent provision. In \nthe interim provision is the waiting period for gun purchases that is \nnow in effect but which will expire on November 29 of this year.\n  Now, the permanent provision, which takes effect on December 1, \nmandates--I emphasize the word ``mandate''--mandates the establishment \nof a National Instant Criminal Background Check System, known as the \nNICS, which is to be operated by the Department of Justice.\n  The purpose of this National Instant Criminal Background Check is to \nprevent the purchase of guns by persons with criminal backgrounds who \nare prohibited otherwise from owning firearms. Under this new system, \npersons seeking to buy guns will be required to submit certain \nidentifying information for clearance through this NICS.\n  Now, this raises serious concerns. I have concerns here that the FBI \nhas stated that in cases where the NICS background check does not \nlocate a disqualifying record, information about that individual, \naccording to the language, will only be retained temporarily for audit \npurposes and will be destroyed after 18 months.\n  My question to my colleagues is this: Why hold on to this information \nfor 18 months? These are innocent people who have no disqualifying \nrecord. They are entitled, under the second amendment, to own their \nfirearms. I don't think any records ought to be kept for 18 minutes, \nlet alone 18 months. There is simply no reason that the FBI needs to \nretain private information on law-abiding American citizens--in this \ncase, gun owners--for any time at all, let alone for 18 months.\n  There are no legitimate audit purposes for retaining private \ninformation on law-abiding gun owners in the FBI. Now, we have seen \nabuses. We have seen files turning up from the FBI on individuals who \nhappen to appear in the White House, and on and on and on. This is an \nopportunity to abuse the privacy rights of millions of American gun \nowners. It is simply wrong if you didn't do anything. If your record is \nclear and there is no disqualifying information, then there should be \nno record kept, period.\n\n  I have heard a lot from law-abiding gun owners in the country who \nview this FBI gun owners ID record retention scheme as an ominous step \ntoward national gun registration, which I believe is probably the \nultimate goal here. Justifiably, in my view, they see this plan as a \nthreat to their second amendment right under the Constitution of the \nUnited States. I agree with them. I feel deeply about this. I emphasize \nagain that FBI files have been abused, and to keep, for any period of \ntime--especially as long as 18 months--files on people who have done \nnothing wrong, in the FBI, is wrong.\n  Stated simply, my legislation will put a stop to the FBI's plan to \nkeep records of private identifying information on law-abiding citizens \nwho buy guns. My amendment will require the immediate destruction of \nall information submitted by or on behalf of any person who has been \ndetermined not to be prohibited from owning a firearm.\n  Mr. President, my amendment has another purpose as well. The \nDepartment of Justice has proposed to charge fees--a gun tax, if you \nwill--for the NICS, using the authority of a provision in the 1991 \nCommerce, Justice, State Appropriations Act.\n  As Appropriations Committee Chairman Stevens noted when he introduced \nthe No Gun Tax Act of 1998 earlier this year, the 1991 Appropriations \nAct was passed 2 years before the law establishing the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System.\n  Moreover, as Chairman Stevens properly observed, the 1991 act ``was \nnever intended to allow fees under the NICS program.'' ``This limited \n1991 authority,'' Senator Stevens noted, ``allowed fees only `to \nprocess fingerprint identification records and name checks for \nnoncriminal justice * * * and licensing purposes.' '' ``It was not \nintended,'' concluded Senator Stevens, ``to apply to programs like the \nNICS program, which checks the criminal background of purchasers and \nhas nothing to do with licensing.''\n  In introducing his No Gun Tax Act of 1998, which I was honored to \ncosponsor, Senator Stevens also aptly observed that, ``The imposition \nof a fee would encourage some to try to obtain firearms on the black \nmarket.'' ``No matter how you feel about gun control,'' Senator Stevens \nsaid, ``we should all do what we can to make sure that the new \nbackground check system works.''\n  My amendment would prevent the use of funds by the Department of \nJustice for the ``implementation of any tax or fee'' in connection with \nthe implementation of this new National Instant Criminal Background \nCheck System.\n  Under the second amendment, law-abiding American citizens have the \nright to own a firearm. And if the Congress, in its wisdom, decides \nthat we are going to have this background check and a person is not \ndisqualified, he or she should not have to pay for it. It is their \nconstitutional right to have a weapon if they are honest, law-abiding \ncitizens, and they should not have to pay a fee because somebody said \nthey needed to check to find out if they were honest people or not. It \nis wrong. This is ``big brother,'' Mr. President, and it is wrong.\n  So my amendment would create a civil cause of action, as well, on \nbehalf of any person who is aggrieved by a violation of this act, which \ncan be brought in the Federal district court for the district in which \nthe person resides. So if your rights are violated, then you have a \nright to take this matter to court, as any citizen would. If \nsuccessful, such a lawsuit would entitle the gun owner wronged by a \nviolation of the provisions of my amendment to an award of damages and \nany other remedies deemed to be appropriate by the court, including \nattorney's fees.\n\n  We must not allow a trampling of the second amendment. We must not \nallow fees to be charged to people who have done nothing except own a \nfirearm and be legal, law-abiding citizens. They should not have to pay \na fee. I hope this amendment will have broad support. The sound \noperation of the new National Instant Criminal Background Check \nrequires neither the retention of ID records on law-abiding gun \npurchasers nor the imposition of a user-fee gun tax.\n  So, in conclusion, let me just say, No. 1, my amendment says if the \nbackground check is conducted, no record is kept if you have done \nnothing wrong, you are a law-abiding person, and you are entitled to \nthat gun. No record is kept, period. Secondly, no fee is charged. \nThirdly, if records are kept in violation of this act, then you have a \nremedy in court.\n  That is the amendment, Mr. President. So I say to my colleagues, if \nyou support the second amendment and the rights of law-abiding people \nnot to be harassed, you will support my amendment. We have seen \nharassment by the IRS, and this will invite harassment by the FBI if we \ndo not stop this process. How many files will be retained? What \ninformation will be used on these people in these files? When I think \nof the FBI and I think of a file held in the FBI on somebody, I think \nof someone perhaps doing something wrong or being accused of doing \nsomething wrong. These people have done nothing wrong, except own a \ngun. That is not wrong; that is legal under the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, is the Senator asking for the yeas and nays \non the second-degree amendment?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. You are going to want yeas and nays on both?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The second-degree amendment will be the \nfirst one voted on. I would be happy to vitiate them on the second \nvote, but I need to have a vote on the second-degree amendment.\n  Again, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, we will go back to \nthe Boxer amendment.\n\n[[Page S8627]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Biden has sent word over that his \ntime can be taken by Senator Kohl and myself. Senator Biden was going \nto talk for 15 minutes. I ask that that time be divided between Senator \nKohl and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order to that effect.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to give some time to Senator Kohl. I have no need \nto talk on and on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Wisconsin seek \nrecognition?\n  Mr. KOHL. Yes, I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment for two reasons. \nFirst, while I have a great deal of respect for Senator Smith--I was in \nthe room when we wrote the Brady Act--along with Senators Dole, \nMitchell and Metzenbaum. Certainly no one in that room believed that \nyou couldn't charge fees under Brady. If anything, we expected that \nfees would be charged for doing checks. Nothing in Brady's legislative \nhistory leads me to change my mind.\n  Fees for background checks are nothing new. In fact, when we \nnegotiated Brady, all of us were aware that the FBI charged fees for \nother background checks. And no one was surprised that, once Brady \nbecame law, 39 States authorized fees for State-run Brady checks. No \none is questioning these other fees.\n  Second, prohibiting fees--without otherwise providing the funding \nnecessary to support the instant check system--would endanger the Brady \nAct. The instant check system, which was originally proposed by the NRA \nitself, is an essential part of Brady that is scheduled to replace the \nState-run system at the end of this year.\n  Of course, these instant checks will cost money. The FBI believes it \nwill need about $75 million to pay for additional staff and resources. \nUnless the instant check system gets funded, these checks will not \nhappen. No funding, no checks. And no checks means more criminals with \nguns and more violence.\n  Now, in my opinion, it doesn't matter whether the funding for instant \nchecks comes from fees or from a separate appropriation, but we need \nfunding from somewhere, and we should not make the FBI choose between \ncracking down on violent gangs and doing instant checks. But this \namendment provides no alternative funding.\n  Mr. President, the real issue before us is this. We can pay for \ninstant checks and build on the Brady Act's record of stopping nearly \n150,000 criminals from buying guns, or we can leave Brady's future up \nin the air and risk putting more guns in the hands of dangerous felons. \nIn my view, the choice is easy. I do not want to see the FBI make a \n``profit'' on these fees, but we need to make sure that background \nchecks continue saving lives by defeating this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield for the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3231\n\n  I assume we are getting close to a vote on this amendment. I want to \nmake a point here. I do not believe that this child safety lock \namendment is a panacea--the cure-all, which will stop all kids from \ndying. But it will help. And I believe we must do whatever we can to \nhelp.\n  I want to talk to you about a survey that was done by the Violence \nPolicy Center called ``Kids Shooting Kids.'' These are stories from \nacross the Nation of unintentional shootings among children and youth. \nThis is a 9-month period in 1996. You read a story and you think, \n``This is horrible,'' and you don't realize the extent to which this is \naffecting our families and hurting our children.\n  So what I would like to do is read a number of these cases with this \npoint in mind, to show you how widespread this crisis truly is. It is \nnot a panacea, but I believe it will save children's lives--maybe 100, \nmaybe 200, a year.\n  As you hear these stories, what I want you to do is ask yourself a \nquestion, I say to my colleagues: If there was a lock on that gun, \nwould this accident have happened? That is what I am asking you to do. \nPut the commonsense test to it.\n  ``Two boys hurt when pistol fires.'' This one is in Mobile, AL.\n  Two boys looking under a mattress for loose change found a pistol \ninstead. When the weapon discharged, Jacob Lewis, 7, lost a finger. His \nfriend, Michael Moore, was hit in the face, the neck and the abdomen. \nJacob's grandfather, Art Lewis, kept spare change under his mattress, \nalong with a handgun. ``They knew I kept some change there, but they \nhad no business going back into that bedroom,'' Jacob's grandfather \nsaid.\n  Jacob was treated and released. Michael was still in the hospital \nlisted in stable condition. Lewis said his son gave him the gun two \nweeks ago for protection because he was alone. He said, ``I have never \nhad a pistol.'' He kept the handgun loaded. He says, ``I don't want a \npistol. I don't want anything like this in my life.''\n  That is what happened after the accident.\n  Valdez, AK. This is a picture of this little child, 8 years old. \nFront page story:\n\n       An 8-year-old Valdez boy died Saturday of a gun shot wound \n     after he and his 10-year-old brother had been playing with a \n     handgun in their Aleutian village home. Steven Lind Johanson \n     was pronounced dead at Valdez Community Hospital of a single \n     shot to the head.\n\n  They said the results would be known later. ``All we know at this \npoint is they were playing with guns.'' For whatever reason, the little \nboy got shot.\n  So here you have this cute little boy with a little space in between \nhis teeth. He hadn't even gotten all of his teeth yet. He is dead:\n\n       Boy 15, shot in the face with a .357 in stable condition.\n\n  This is in Alaska. He was playing with a gun.\n  My understanding is he may lose some of his hearing. The boy thought \nthe chamber was empty and happened to pull the trigger. The gun was \nstolen.\n  It goes on: A 14-year-old Amber Valley boy shot in the head and \nkilled while he and his best friend were handling a handgun.\n  These are not kids in gangs. These are not kids who are vicious. \nThese are ordinary children who are doing what ordinary children do, \nwhich is to be curious, which is to imitate what they see in the \nmovies. Had there been a safety lock, these little children might be \nalive today.\n  These stories go on and on:\n\n       Glendale boy finds gun. Accidentally shot, .22 caliber \n     revolver.\n       9-year-old Oasis boy accidentally shot. Victim in serious \n     condition.\n       3-year-old finds gun, kills sister.\n\n  Unbelievable.\n\n       Boy paralyzed in gun accident.\n\n  That is in Atlanta, GA.\n\n       17-month-old shot accidentally by boy, 3.\n\n  Accidentally shot by a playmate.\n\n       Boy, 11, dies in a gun mishap.\n\n  It just goes on and on.\n  So we can say there is nothing we can do, and we could say let's pass \na sense-of-the-Senate that parents should be shown all of this. That is \nfine. I don't have any problem with that. But we have to do something \nreal, and that thing is to put locks on guns.\n  So I was hoping against hope that we could, Senator Craig and I, join \nhands on this one, that we could agree on this one, because I know we \nhave certainly argued on other issues. I am quite surprised that we \ncan't reach agreement on this. I think it is common sense. I think it \nis good law.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can have a vote on this. I hope we will \nsucceed on this. It is not my hope to speak much longer, only to \nrespond if there is something that is put out that I think is merits a \nresponse.

Mr. President, I will be happy to withdraw this action just \ntaken if the Senator from California would be willing to agree to the \nfollowing consent, which I will now propound. This consent would allow \nfor a vote in relation to the Craig gun safety issue as well as the \nBoxer trigger lock issue. I hope the Senator would consider and would \nagree to the consent.\n  I ask unanimous consent, then, that the pending Boxer second-degree \namendment be withdrawn and the motion to commit be withdrawn and the \nfirst-degree amendment be laid aside and Senator Craig be immediately \nrecognized to offer a first-degree amendment relative to gun safety.\n  I further ask that there be 90 minutes for debate on both the Boxer \nand the Craig amendments combined, to be equally divided between \nSenators Craig and Boxer, with no second-degree amendments in order to \neither amendment, and following the conclusion or yielding back of \ntime, the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Craig \namendment, to be followed immediately by a vote on or in relation to \nthe Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this may \nwork out fine, I say to the majority leader. We just want a little time \nto share it with a few Senators here who are very involved in this \namendment. So at the moment I will object, keeping the door wide open \nto eventual agreement, but we would like to have about 15 minutes to \nlook it over.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I might say to the Senator's objection, I think this is \na fair way to consider this issue. The Senators have time to state \ntheir position on both sides of the issue and we could then come to a \nvote on both of them. My effort here is to try to get it set up in that \nway where each side gets a fair vote, each side gets a fair time to \ndebate it. I hope the Senator will give consideration to that. If the \nSenator likes, until we can decide exactly how we might proceed, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nmajority leader.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nBoxer second-degree amendment be withdrawn and the motion to commit be \nwithdrawn and the first-degree amendment be laid aside and Senator \nCraig be immediately recognized to offer a first-degree amendment \nrelative to gun safety.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be time between now and \n4:45 for debate on both the Boxer and the Craig amendments combined, to \nbe equally divided between Senators Craig and Boxer, with no second-\ndegree amendments in order to either amendment; that following the \nconclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote on, \nor in relation to, the Craig amendment, to be followed immediately by a \nvote on, or in relation to, the Boxer amendment; further, that there be \n2 minutes of debate prior to the vote in relation to the Boxer \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, I \nask the majority leader if he will be willing to allow a straight up-\nor-down vote on both measures and rule out the tabling motion. Will he \nbe willing to incorporate that in the UC?\n  Mr. LOTT. First of all, I thank the Senator for working with us to \nget what I believe to be a fair amount of time and a vote on each \nissue. We will not be able to amend it to allow for that vote. We have \nto have the option for a motion to table.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am disappointed, because I think it is a very clear \nvote: Either you are for child safety locks or not. I would have \npreferred that, but in the interest of moving this bill forward, I do \nnot object to the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be offering a first-degree amendment in a few \nmoments if this is accepted. I think for the sake of all Senators \nunderstanding what is in that amendment, I will require an additional 5 \nminutes of time for the explanation of that amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, can we amend the unanimous consent request \nto take it then to 4:50 p.m.?\n  Mrs. BOXER. As long as it is equally divided--you get the extra time, \nand we get the extra time--that is fine with us.\n  Mr. LOTT. I make that request then.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  (Amendment No. 3231, Lott motion to commit with amendment No. 3235, \nAmendment Nos. 3236 and 3237 were withdrawn.)\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FIREARM SAFETY EDUCATION GRANTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 510 of the Omnibus Crime Control \n     and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3760) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking paragraph (1) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(1) undertaking educational and training programs for--\n       ``(A) criminal justice personnel; and\n       ``(B) the general public, with respect to the lawful and \n     safe ownership, storage, carriage, or use of firearms, \n     including the provision of secure gun storage or safety \n     devices;'';\n       (2) in the first sentence of subsection (b), by inserting \n     before the period the following: ``and is authorized to make \n     grants to, or enter into contracts with, those persons and \n     entities to carry out the purposes specified in subsection \n     (a)(1)(B) in accordance with subsection (c)''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c)(1) In accordance with this subsection, the Director \n     may make a grant to, or enter into a contract with, any \n     person or entity referred to in subsection (b) to provide for \n     a firearm safety program that, in a manner consistent with \n     subsection (a)(1)(B), provides for general public training \n     and dissemination of information concerning firearm safety, \n     secure gun storage, and the lawful ownership, carriage, or \n     use of firearms, including the provision of secure gun \n     storage or safety devices.\n       ``(2) Funds made available under a grant under paragraph \n     (1) may not be used (either directly or by supplanting non-\n     Federal funds) for advocating or promoting gun control, \n     including making communications that are intended to directly \n     or indirectly affect the passage of Federal, State, or local \n     legislation intended to restrict or control the purchase or \n     use of firearms.\n       ``(3) Except as provided in paragraph (4), each firearm \n     safety program that receives funding under this subsection \n     shall provide for evaluations that shall be developed \n     pursuant to guidelines that the Director of the National \n     Institute of Justice of the Department of Justice, in \n     consultation with the Director of the Bureau of Justice \n     Assistance and recognized private entities that have \n     expertise in firearms safety, education and training, shall \n     establish.\n       ``(4) With respect to a firearm safety program that \n     receives funding under this section, the Director may waive \n     the evaluation requirement described in paragraph (3) if the \n     Director determines that the program--\n       ``(A) is not of a sufficient size to justify an evaluation; \n     or\n       ``(B) is designed primarily to provide material resources \n     and supplies, and that activity would not justify an \n     evaluation.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on the earlier of--\n       (1) October 1, 1998; or\n       (2) the date of enactment of this Act.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have sent the amendment to the desk. I \nthank my colleagues from California and Illinois for raising the issue \nof firearms safety. All of us are concerned about it. We should be. \nThere is no question that this Senate should express itself. But I \nthink it is wrong to suggest that one size fits all and that Washington \nhas the right answer. Even as the Senator from California was speaking, \nshe was talking about local community and State law that was changing \nthe character of gun ownership and the management or the safe handling \nof guns. And that is exactly what my amendment offers.\n  It recognizes that there is no quick fix to the tragedy of juvenile \ncrime and firearm accidents. But it does recognize the importance of \nmaking available safety devices of all kinds to fit all circumstances, \nnot just a trigger lock but a safe, a box, a lockbox, all of those \nkinds of things that should be required and made available to gun \npurchasers by the community of interests that sells guns and small \nbusiness people who offer those types of firearms to the public.\n  First, it expands the definition of ``safety devices'' to include, as \nI have mentioned, a variety of devices besides just trigger locks. I \nthink it is important that we do that.\n  My amendment requires that vendors have these safety devices \navailable for sale, but it does not require that a vendor sell a safety \ndevice along with every firearm. It certainly does say that a vendor \nmust make these available and that the purchasing public become aware \nof it.\n  It is also important that my amendment helps to ensure that this new \nrequirement is entirely tort neutral. The amendment provides that it \ndoes not establish a standard of care or it further states that \nevidence regarding compliance or noncompliance with this requirement is \ninadmissible in court. The amendment, therefore, does not hurt nor help \na plaintiff or a defendant.\n  Finally, my amendment helps to ensure that State and local \nauthorities are prepared to train members of the public in the safe \npossession, carrying, and use of firearms. As you know, 34 States have \nnow passed and empowered our citizens to carry concealed weapons for \nprotection. Therefore, it is critical that we as a citizenry advance \nthe cause of education.\n  My amendment allows for Byrne grant funds to be used by State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies to train the public in the safe handling \nof firearms and to make a positive contribution in that education. The \nstatistics that are real that I have spoken to this afternoon and that \nthe Senator from California has spoken to can be dramatically reduced \nby education, by training, and by understanding. It is evident because \nwe see the decline in gun accidents today.\n  We also know that there are a variety of organizations out there that \nare actively involved in working to train our citizens as it relates to \nthe safe use of firearms. So my amendment is much broader. It is not a \nmandate, but it certainly requires the full complement of gun safety \nequipment and necessary attributes to be sold and made available to gun \nowners, and it provides education and educational moneys for local and \nState law enforcement agencies to begin to train and educate our \ncitizenry as it relates to this important issue.\n\n  More and more States are moving to the right of citizens to carry \nguns. Thirty-four States have now said, by their action, that the \ncitizen is empowered to carry a weapon for the purpose of protection; \nyet there is a decline in the number of accidental deaths by guns. That \ncan come, as it is coming, by education. We are empowering, by this \namendment, our State and local governments to do just that.\n  Let me close by saying this: The provision that I offer is an \namendment that was offered and adopted by the Judiciary Committee last \nyear during its markup on S. 10, the juvenile crime bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to agree with the consideration and the judgment of the \nJudiciary Committee. Senator Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, is a cosponsor with me of this amendment. It has had full \nconsideration and acceptance by that committee.\n  So it is not something that is quick to judge. It is something to \nrecognize that as we debate the safety of the use of firearms, that we \nassure the public the availability of equipment and devices to ensure \nand broaden that safety and, most importantly, it provide the necessary \neducational components to offer that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I will be \ncontrolling 5 minutes at this time, correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five-and-a-half minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Five-and-a-half minutes.\n\n[[Page S8633]]\n\n  It is my intention to yield most of my time to my colleague from \nIllinois. When I first heard about the Craig amendment and looked it \nover, without getting into the details, I thought this looked like \nsomething I could support. Now I am having doubts about it due to the \nenforcement provisions.\n  I am going to turn it over to my friend and colleague from Illinois.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California.\n  For those who missed a few innings and would like to know what the \nscore is, what happened, the Senator from California offered an \namendment which requires a trigger lock be sold with each handgun in \nAmerica. And she does a few things procedurally so we are going to have \nan up-or-down vote. And, of course, there are people who do not want to \nvote on that. They are afraid of--well, let us not say that. There are \npeople who disagree with her. There are people who don't want to vote \non it.\n  The Senator from Idaho, who openly opposes her amendment, comes in \nwith what he considers to be a substitute amendment. That is what we \nare debating now. The good part is, when it is all over, we get to vote \non both of them: The proposal of the Senator from Idaho, which I have \nin my hand, that he just described, and then the proposal of the \nSenator from California, which says, ``Sell a handgun in America, sell \nwith it a trigger lock.''\n  Originally, the Senator from California and I thought: No harm, no \nfoul; we will take the Craig amendment and get a vote on her important \ntrigger lock amendment. And then we took a closer look. Do you know \nwhat this says? This says to comply with the law in America, a \nfederally licensed firearm dealer must have available on the premises \nfor sale a trigger lock or safety device--available on the premises.\n  Then it has some words, some escape-hatch words in there that says, \n``unless it is tough for you to buy them.'' If you cannot get them on \nthe market, and such, then you do not have to have them on the \npremises. Do you have to sell them with the handguns? No; you just have \nto have them on the premises. I have to tell you, quite frankly, most \nof them probably have them on the premises now, but if people aren't \nbuying them, then there is no safety aspect to this. We aren't \nprotecting anybody.\n  So what it boils down to is, we are putting a requirement in the law \nthat really does nothing. Then there is an interesting provision in \nhere--and I do not know why the Senator from Idaho included it--but I \nmight call him to reference page 4 of his amendment, section (2). It \nsays, incidentally, if the federally licensed firearm dealer does not \nlive up to the requirements of this law and keep trigger locks on the \npremises for sale, and you find evidence of that and want to use it \nagainst him to remove his license--guess what?--under section (2) you \ncan't--you can't. ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, [any] \nevidence regarding compliance or noncompliance with the amendments . . \n. [none of it is] admissible as evidence in [the court or any \nagency.]''\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield when I have completed. I thank the Senator.\n  I think that really tells the story. First, there is no requirement, \nand if there were, it is unenforceable. So this really is eyewash. This \nis an opportunity to have something to vote for, but the real something \nis coming. It is the amendment by the Senator from California.\n  Basically, what we are talking about now is whether or not we are for \ntrigger locks to protect children. I am in favor of firearms safety and \neducation. But the bottom line is that little trigger lock put on a \nrevolver or a handgun keeps it from destroying another child's life.\n  We can vote for or against the amendment of the Senator from Idaho, \nbut after it is all said and done, the real deal here is the amendment \nby the Senator from California, Senator Boxer. She is the one who says, \nyou do not just have to have trigger locks on the premises, you have to \nsell them with the gun. You have to make sure the gun owner walks out \nwith a trigger lock, not just a nod and a shelf with a trigger lock on \nit. I am afraid that nod is all we get from the Senator from Idaho. It \nis not good enough. It will not save a life. It is, in fact, an effort \nby some to find something for which to vote. I hope they will find in \ntheir hearts enough empathy for the real problems facing America to \nsupport the Senator from California.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this amendment offered by \nthe Senator from California, and to join Senator Craig in offering our \nown amendment on this issue. I want to commend my colleague for raising \nthe issue of firearms safety, but I believe that there is a better \napproach to this issue than the one size fits all, Washington knows \nbest proposal offered by the Senator from California.\n  At the outset, let me say that I understand the strongly held views \nof my colleagues. My colleagues who are offering this amendment are \nsearching for easy answers and quick fixes to the tragedies of juvenile \ncrime and firearms accidents. I would tell them this: there are no easy \nanswers, and there are no quick fixes. In the face of difficult \nproblems, it is always tempting to look for easy answers. I do not \nbelieve that we should succumb to this temptation.\n  We can pass another federal law adding this gun control measure or \nthat, but the problem won't go away. Because, Mr. President, the \nproblem isn't guns, or a lack of safety devices, or the lack of any \nother gun control measure.\n  We are faced, I believe, with a problem which cannot be solved by the \nenactment of more federal gun control laws. It is at its core a moral \nproblem. Somehow, in too many instances, we have failed as a society to \npass along to the next generation the moral compass that differentiates \nright from wrong. This cannot be legislated. It will not be restored by \nthe enactment of a new law or the implementation of a new program. But \nit can be achieved by communities working together to teach \naccountability by example and by early intervention when the signs \nclearly point to violent and antisocial behavior, as seems to be the \ncase in some of these tragedies.\n  Now, I would like to debate this issue. I think the Senate should be \ndebating juvenile crime legislation. The Judiciary Committee spent \neight weeks last summer marking up the most comprehensive reform of the \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act in that law's twenty-\nfive year history. We could debate how to restore accountability to a \nbroken juvenile justice system. We could debate how to fix a broken \nsystem that fails too many of our young people, so that it protects \nsociety. But we are not doing that. Instead, we will debate more gun \ncontrol.\n  I should note for my colleagues that this particular provision has \nalready been debated. The Judiciary Committee considered it last \nsummer, and defeated it. Well, here it is again. So, we will debate it \nyet again.\n  This amendment would require a particular safety device to be sold \nwith every firearm. My colleagues who are considering supporting this \namendment should understand that no safety device is a substitute for \nfirearm safety training and responsible firearm handling. Relying on a \ntrigger lock as a panacea for firearm safety is irresponsible and \nshort-sighted.\n\n  As an initial matter, there is no locking device that can be placed \non a loaded firearm which can render it failsafe. Most locking device \nmanufacturers specifically advise against the use of locking devices on \na loaded gun. Requiring firearm manufacturers and licensed gun dealers \nto provide locking devices may send a dangerous message to the American \npublic that it is ``OK'' to use the locking device on a loaded firearm. \nIn fact, tests show that a loaded firearm affixed with a locking device \ncan still fire. Requiring manufacturers to provide trigger locks with \neach firearm, therefore, takes a ``one size fits all'' approach to \nfirearm safety. Because of firearm design differences, not all firearms \ncan be properly safeguarded with a trigger lock.\n  Firearms safety training emphasizes personal responsibility in \nhandling a firearm. Education and safety training has been instrumental \nin lowering firearm accidents and accidental deaths to its lowest point \nsince 1904 (National Safety Council, Accidental Facts, 1996).\n\n[[Page S8634]]\n\nIn 1995 alone, accidental firearm fatalities fell 7%. Due in large part \nto firearms education, promoted by organizations like the National \nRifle Association, the Hunter Education Association, and other \nvolunteer groups, firearms were involved in 1.5% of all accidental \ndeaths nationwide. This percentage is lower than deaths due to motor \nvehicle accidents (47%), falling (13.5%), poisoning (11.4%), fire \n4.4%), and choking (3%) (National Safety Council, National Center for \nHealth Statistics).\n  Additionally, different circumstances dictate how an individual \nstores his firearm. While some people may choose to lock their firearms \nin a safe, someone else may choose to keep their firearm readily \naccessible for self-protection. Thus, locking devices may or may not be \ncompatible with a person's lifestyle and reason for owning a firearm.\n  Mr. President, safety locks are already widely available, as are a \nwide range of other firearms safety devices. Industry is already making \nstrides in offering these devices for sale. We do not need yet another \nfederal mandate imposing a one size fits all safety ``solution'' on \nAmerica's law abiding gun owners.\n  Instead, I offer my colleagues an alternative. My proposal will do \nfar more to promote true firearms safety, and it is far more respectful \nof the common sense of the American people, than my friend's proposal. \nMy amendment does three things. First, it expands the definition of \nsafety devices to include not only devices that render a \nfirearm temporarily unusable, but also temporarily inaccessible. As a \nresult, my second degree amendment includes safety devices, such as \nsafes and lock boxes, that do not disable a firearm, but make it at \nleast temporarily inaccessible to a person.\n\n  Second, my amendment requires that vendors have safety devices \navailable for sale, but it does not require that a vendor sell a safety \ndevice along with every firearm. Having them available for sale will \nhelp to ensure that purchasers will obtain, and thereafter will use, a \nsafety device, without necessarily increasing the cost of the purchase. \nThe Administration's provision embodied in my colleague's proposal \nwould increase the cost of purchasing a firearm, which is unnecessary. \nSome safety devices, such as a safe or lock box, can hold more than one \nfirearm, so there is no need to require that a person buy a new safety \ndevice if buying a second firearm.\n  Third, my amendment helps to ensure that this new requirement is \nentirely tort neutral. The amendment provides that it does not \nestablish a standard of care, and it further states that evidence \nregarding compliance or noncompliance with this requirement is \ninadmissible in court. The amendment therefore does not help or hurt a \nplaintiff or a defendant.\n  Finally, my amendment helps to ensure that state and local law \nenforcement authorities can train members of the public in the safe \npossession, carry, and use of firearms. This is valuable. Training is \nthe best way to ensure that firearms are treated with respect, but not \nwith fear. Firearms handling is an important part of the training \nprocess for every soldier and every law enforcement officer, and it can \nbe a valuable tool for private citizens. After all, about 34 States--\nincluding my home state of Utah--now empower citizens to carry \nconcealed firearms for protection. Allowing Byrne grant funds to be \nused by state and local law enforcement agencies to train the public in \nthe safe handling of firearms will make a positive contribution to \nsafety and to crime prevention.\n  Taken together, all of these provisions deal with the issue of \nfirearms safety in a far better manner than the amendment offered by my \ncolleague. Moreover, this is the provision adopted by the Judiciary \nCommittee last year, during the mark-up of S. 10, the Juvenile crime \nbill. I urge my colleagues to agree with the considered judgment of the \nJudiciary Committee, and support my alternative to this amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is very hard for me to vote for \nsomething that has so many loopholes in it. Maybe during the time in \nthe well the Senator from Idaho can convince me of this, but basically \nyou can't use evidence as evidence. That is what the words say. Here it \nis:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, evidence \n     regarding compliance or noncompliance with the amendments \n     made by this section shall not be admissible as evidence.\n\n  So you can't use evidence as evidence. I don't know--this is \nconfusing.\n  I just say to my friends and colleagues, there is only one reason we \nhave taken so much time on this. I was wondering what was going on \nhere, because I came to the floor very early this morning and said \nlet's vote up or down to require that child safety locks be put on \nhandguns, because 5,000 kids are dying in America in a year and no kids \nare dying in Japan of gunshots. As you look at this chart, you can see \nthat.\n  This is a figleaf, a cover. I don't think it does anything. People \ncan vote the way they want. The next vote is the key vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Under the previous \norder, the question is on agreeing to the Craig amendment.

Look at this collage of headlines. How many \nmore deaths do we need to see before we act?\n\n[[Page S8635]]\n\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Biden.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let's stop being hypocritical. We just \npassed an amendment saying safety is important; the NRA is eligible for \nFederal funds to teach safety. If the ultimate safety of children is \nwhat we are concerned about, why are we so upset about the idea that \ntrigger locks will be placed on guns? How can you vote, as I will and \nhave, to give the NRA eligibility to teach gun safety, which I want \nthem to do, and say that is important, but it is not important to take \nthe one step we can that will at least incrementally increase safety of \nchildren in the United States of America?\n  Please vote no on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, 72 of you have just said that gun safety is \nimportant, and that we ought to educate, and we ought to use Byrne \nfunds to do so--local law enforcement, State law enforcement, and \nprivate entities that teach licensed gun safety.\n  We have also said that gun dealers ought to have safety devices \navailable. But we have also said there is a States rights issue here. \nThirty-four States now have consent to carry. Safety is an issue. And \nguess what. Accidental deaths are declining, and they are declining \nbecause of education, not because of Federal mandates. Even \nmanufacturers say you put a trigger lock on a loaded gun and it is \ndangerous.\n  Trigger locks I agree with. They are for empty guns. They are for \nstored guns. They are not called child locks, they are called safety \nlocks. We believe in that. But why should it be a Federal mandate? It \nshould not be.\n  The vote you just cast is the right vote. It mandates certain \nrequirements at the local level be provided, and it allows education, \nand, more importantly, it says train and educate, don't control from \nthe Federal level. Do the right thing. Vote to table. You have cast a \nsound vote; 72 Senators have said that the right action was the action \nyou have just taken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the last couple of weeks we have all \nbeen on the floor trying to get appropriations bills completed. I would \njust like to submit to the U.S. Senate that we ought not be doing this \nevery year.\n  Don't we have enough knowledge and wisdom and information to \nappropriate every 2 years instead of every year? Don't we have enough \ninformation about budgets and estimating that we could do a budget that \nlasted for 2 years and make automatic economic adjustments? Of course \nwe do.\n  Mr. President, if the authorizing committees are wondering why they \ndo not have a chance to do things around here, this is one reason. \nBecause we hardly have enough time to do the appropriations bills. \nBecause they are up every year as if we were in constant motion. In \nfact, I defy even Senators with the best recollection to recall one \nappropriations bill from another year by year. They are so often that \nthey are all one big glob of votes.\n  Frankly, the Senator from New Mexico had made a mistake this year, \nbecause there is a bill at the desk saying we ought to do this every 2 \nyears. We would get our job done better and we would have oversight \ntime and the Senate would be a better place to work in and could do its \nbusiness better. I should have started 4 months ago insisting that that \nbill for 2-year budgets and 2-year appropriations be voted on by the \nU.S. Senate.\n  But I can tell the Senate, it will be voted on the next opportunity \nwhen our leader has some time, and it may be early next year. We are \ngoing to get that bill out of committee, and we are going to vote on \nthis issue of whether we have to do this every single year.\n  Frankly, we now have evidence that these bills are 90 to 95 percent \nsimilar one year over another. I know chairmen feel they have made \ndramatic changes year over year; and, yes, they may have. They also \npassed the appropriated money for bills that have not been authorized, \nand they know that. And their response is, ``Nobody's doing it, so we \nhave to do it.'' Well, nobody is doing it because there is no time for \nanybody to do it.\n  Mr. President, I believe many Senators agree with this. I have talked \nto them at length on it. Frankly, we are going to decide in the Senate \npretty soon whether we are going to keep on doing this. I am not sure \nwe will win, but surely we are going to present this issue.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/21/senate-section/article/S8635-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8635-S8638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED \n                   AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3234\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Could I have a clarification? I want to make sure the \nSenator from New Hampshire and I have an understanding about the \npending amendment. It is my understanding--I hope the Senator from New \nHampshire would follow me in this--that we have some 20 minutes left in \ndebate, equally divided between the Senator from New Hampshire and \nmyself, at which point at the end of that debate there will be a vote. \nIs that the Chair's understanding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair and ask the Senator from New \nHampshire----\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand the vote is to occur at 6 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was the order, but Senator Domenici took \n2\n\n[[Page S8636]]\n\nminutes as in morning business which will push back the vote.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would be willing to have \nthe 2 minutes that Senator Domenici used come off of my 10 minutes in \norder to keep the vote at 6 o'clock. I ask unanimous consent to do \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, thank you. I will take a portion of the 10 \nminutes to start with and then allow my colleague from New Hampshire to \nstate his side of the case on behalf of this amendment.\n  Let me try to explain where we are in terms of what this amendment is \ndoing. We are trying to set up a computer check across the United \nStates, so if you purchase a firearm, there is a way for States or the \nFederal Government to check and see whether you have a history of \nhaving committed a felony or a history of mental illness, and in that \nsituation States are saying, ``Of course we do not want to sell a gun \nto you.'' And that is the basic Brady law.\n  Most people support it because it is eminently sensible that we want \nto keep guns out of the hands of people who are likely to misuse them. \nI think everybody supports that. The NRA and the people on the other \nside of the issue even support it.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire comes before us, though, with a very \ninteresting proposition. The Federal Bureau of Investigation does these \nbackground checks by computer. They have said that, ``When we do these \nbackground checks, we will charge the prospective gun purchaser, the \none who wants to buy the gun, for our cost in doing the background \ncheck.'' And of course that sounds reasonable to me.\n  If I want to purchase a gun, and I want to have a background check to \nqualify me for a gun, it is not unreasonable for me to expect to pay \nfor what it costs for that to happen. Why should this be the burden of \nevery taxpayer in America, those who do not own guns and those who are \nnot purchasing guns? It really is a decision that I want to buy a gun; \nand, therefore, I am going into the system to prove that I am eligible \nto own a gun.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire says: Wait a minute. Why do we want to \ncharge the prospective gun purchaser for this background check? \nShouldn't the Treasury pay for that? Shouldn't all the taxpayers pay \nfor these people who want to buy guns?\n  I do not think so. And the practical result of the amendment of the \nSenator from New Hampshire is to take from the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation the amount of money they would have collected to do these \nbackground checks. And you know what that means? It means basically the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation will have anywhere from $50 to $75 \nmillion less in their appropriation to do their job.\n  Well, can they absorb a $50 to $75 million hit? I think we can all \nanswer that question, because we all come to this floor and come up \nwith wonderful ideas for the FBI to get involved. We want the FBI to \nfight terrorism. Of course we do. We want to make sure that they are \nfighting it around the world and protecting people across the United \nStates. And so we say, ``We're assigning that responsibility to you.'' \nThe Senator from New Hampshire says, ``Yes, we give you the \nresponsibility. We're not going to give you the money you need to do \nthe job.''\n  We also say we want the FBI to go after some serious issues. Let me \ngive you an example--crimes against children, to enhance the FBI's \ncapabilities to combat child abductions, and serial killings. This is \nthe responsibility we give to the FBI. The Senator from New Hampshire \nsays: It is a great responsibility, but take the money away from them--\n$50 to $75 million less each year.\n  How about narcotics? Is there a more serious criminal problem in \nAmerica? What is filling our prisons? What is tempting our children? \nWhat is leading to the kinds of degradation in lifestyle that we see \naround this country, but basically the war on drugs, the war on \nnarcotics?\n  So the Senator from New Hampshire says: Let us take some money away \nfrom that, too, because we want people who apply for a gun not to have \nto pay for it. We want the Treasury to pay for it. We want the FBI to \ntake this money from other sources. I do not think that is fair.\n  I do not think it is fair for an agency with this sort of \nresponsibility. And I do not think it is fair for those who want to \npurchase a gun to say, ``We want a free ride.'' For goodness' sakes, it \nis their decision to purchase a gun. They are going forward in the \nsystem to purchase it. Shouldn't they pay their own freight?\n  Would you think twice about buying a car and trying to get a license \nand say, ``I just decided to buy a car, but as far as the cost of the \nlicense for my car, why should I have to pay for that? Taxpayers ought \nto pay for that. I just want to drive the car''? That is what the \nSenator from New Hampshire is arguing.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Isn't it true that there are a number of background \nchecks. Years ago I drafted a law which became law that requires \ncertain background checks, for example, for people who wish to work in \nday-care centers with young children, to try to figure out and ferret \nout child predators.\n  Now, the way it works now is if, in fact, you are going to be hired \nat a boys' club, a girls' club or a day care center, and they--the day \ncare center--say they want a background check, and you have to go \nthrough the FBI, the FBI now charges the person seeking employment the \ncost to run the background check.\n  I don't understand why, if we are going to say on a background check \nfor an employee--where the employee is seeking a job but is required by \nthat agency to have a background check to prove, in effect, they are \nnot a child predator or do not have any sex crime history--why it is \nappropriate to charge the prospective employee and it is not \nappropriate to charge a person purchasing a gun. There is nothing \nexceptional about this.\n  My question to my friend is, Isn't this all about reneging on a \ncommitment everyone said they are for, which was to have an instant \nbackground check, so there is no 7-day, 5-day or 1-day waiting period, \nso every single gun seller in America, when they go to sell you a gun, \ncan push a button, tap into a computer, and have the computer say you \ncan or cannot sell it? It seems to me this is about doing away with the \ninstant check.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Delaware is correct. The instant check \nsystem was proposed by the National Rifle Association as a way of \navoiding the Brady law. They said, ``We will do this by computer; we \nwill punch it in.''\n  The fellow who is selling the gun, the dealer, will punch in the \ninformation and find out if you are a dangerous person; if not, they \ncan sell it to you.\n  Now they have decided they want the computer check but they don't \nwant to pay for it, they want the taxpayers to pay for it, and take the \nmoney out of the FBI.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk recently \nabout more and more gun laws, more and more complicated and esoteric, \nhaving less and less ability to protect the safety of the American \npeople.\n  Let me tell you we have some outstanding, effective gun laws on the \nbooks now that allow people who are felons to be prosecuted for \npossessing a gun, that allow the prosecution of people who carry a gun \nduring a felony to receive 5 years without parole, consecutive to any \nother offense.\n  Look at what this administration that is always talking about gun \nprosecutions has done. In 1992, when they took office, there were 7,048 \n``triggerlock prosecutions'' of serious gun offenders in this country; \nnow, 1997, 3,765. It has plummeted that percent.\n  What they need to do is enforce the laws they have and quit worrying \nabout passing laws that are not very relevant and not going to have any \nimpact on crime in America. I think the American people need to \nunderstand that.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n\n[[Page S8637]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Let's talk money. The program has been fully funded. Some $37.5 \nmillion in the last 4 years has been provided. The FBI budget has been \nalmost tripled in the last 10 years.\n  Let me talk about Janet Reno. Here is what Attorney General Janet \nReno said, on May 26, 1994: She does not intend to charge for such \naccess, provided that there is sufficient appropriations.\n  Guess what? We have given them every dime they requested and many, \nmany millions more. Sorry, Janet Reno. Why don't you stay with your \nword? That is what you told us. That is what we believed when we passed \nthe Brady bill.\n  What is this? This is a gun tax. Let's talk about it for what it is. \nThe FBI asked for money and we gave them money. In fact, we tripled \ntheir budget in the last 10 years. Why? Because we are interested in \nlaw enforcement. We want criminals caught. Most importantly, we want \ncriminals prosecuted. We do not want law-abiding citizens taxed.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 14 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, let me explain this \namendment. I have heard some very interesting remarks on the other side \nabout Brady and registration. That is not what my amendment is--very \neloquent, but that is not what my amendment is.\n  My amendment does three things. First, it prevents the FBI from \nkeeping a file on a law-abiding citizen who, after he had the gun \nchecked, came up fine, clear. Why would we want the FBI to maintain a \nfile on a law-abiding gun owner who did nothing wrong except exercise \nhis constitutional right to own a gun? They want 18 months to keep \nthese files. I don't want 18 seconds. I want these files destroyed \nimmediately. That is point one in my amendment.\n  Second, my amendment prevents the FBI from imposing a tax on people \nwho use this national instant criminal background check system because \nthey want simply to exercise their right to own a gun. That is the \nsecond point. Why should they be taxed for that? Why should they pay \nthis fee? It could be up to $20 to $25 just to do this--maybe more. \nThat is to start. There is no reason why anybody should pay a fee. You \nare an individual who has a constitutional right to own a gun. Somebody \nin the Government decides that they want to check you out, fine. You \ncheck out clear. Why should you have to pay for that? You didn't ask \nfor it; it is your right. The person who is a criminal or a person who \nis not entitled to have that gun because of something they did, fine, \nthey can pay for it, and they should pay for it and they shouldn't get \nthe gun. But that is not the people about whom we are talking.\n  Third, if the Government, in violation of the law, holds these files, \nyou have the right to pursue this matter in court, which is the proper \nprocedure.\n  I simply ask my colleagues, Why would you keep a file in the FBI on \nan innocent person who did nothing except own a gun, which is his \nconstitutional right to do so? That is what this amendment is about. If \nyou want those files maintained, then you would vote against this \namendment. This is Big Brother at its worst. It is Big Brother at its \nworst.\n  It is coming in and taking privacy--your privacy; you have the right \nnot to have that file in the FBI, and they don't have the right to put \nit there, because you did nothing wrong. That is what this amendment is \nabout.\n  Secondly, it is about a tax. If you want to charge these fees, so be \nit. But then you can vote against my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I understand the argument of the Senator from New \nHampshire, because we have a constitutional right to bear arms, all of \nthe Federal taxpayers have to subsidize that right.\n  I suppose since we have a constitutional right to exercise our \nreligious belief, then it is the responsibility of taxpayers to pay for \nmy priest or minister. I don't think so. I don't think so.\n  In this situation, the American people are coming forward and saying, \n``We want to exercise our right to own a gun.'' We are saying, ``Fine, \nso long as you don't misuse it and you are not a person with a \nbackground where you are likely to misuse it.'' And if you are going to \nsubmit yourself to this background check, be prepared to pay for it.\n  The Senator from Delaware makes a good point. If we are going to hire \npeople to work in nursing homes and child care facilities that need \nbackground checks--and that is not a bad idea--why shouldn't they, as a \ncondition of employment, pay for the background check? Why should this \nbe the responsibility of every taxpayer?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire wants to say to the prospective gun \nowners they have the right to come to the Government and say, ``I want \nit for nothing.'' When you get it for nothing, someone will pay for it. \nIn this situation, the FBI pays for it.\n  Do you know why the FBI appropriation has gone up, as the Senator \nfrom Idaho has said? Because we keep giving them more \nresponsibilities--do fingerprint checks on anybody who wants to be a \nnew citizen in the United States; get serious about dealing with drugs \nacross borders, make certain that you have the wherewithal to do it; \nfight terrorism. We tell them to do all of these things and now the \nSenator from Idaho says they should have enough money to absorb this \n$50 to $75 million loss. I think they are wrong.\n  I think those who are for law and order and for law enforcement have \nto vote against this amendment offered by the Senator from New \nHampshire. Let those who want to purchase a gun and exercise their \nright, exercise their responsibility to pay for this check, to make \ncertain that those people who worry about gun violence have less to \nworry about.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this amendment from the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 1 minute 22 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I respond to my friend by repeating what \nSenator Craig said a moment ago. There is $100 million in the law to do \nthis, so we don't need to be charging additional fees. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, it is interesting how we pick out certain constitutional \nrights and say we are going to tax them and not others. Maybe we should \ntax everybody for having free speech. Or maybe we should tax everybody \nfor reading the newspaper. Maybe we should tax everybody for going to \nchurch.\n  It doesn't make sense. It is our constitutional right.\n  Let me repeat, again. No. 1, this amendment prevents the FBI from \nkeeping files on innocent people who simply had a background check done \non them who did nothing wrong and were perfectly entitled to own a gun.\n  Secondly, the amendment prevents the FBI from imposing a tax on these \npeople. Thirdly, it allows a person to go to court if the FBI does \nthat. We have seen abuses by the FBI. We have seen files held in the \nWhite House. Do you want this to go on? That is what this issue is \nabout. That is what my amendment is about. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport me on this amendment because this is more than a gun issue--\nthis is a privacy issue.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Illinois has \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the $100 million we have invested is for \nthe hardware for the computers. It now costs $13 to $16 every time they \ndo a background check. I think the people should pay for it. The \nSenator from New Hampshire would take the money out of FBI for other \nlaw enforcement. I think the FBI needs these funds to do important \ntasks. I hope the Senator will agree that the FBI is an agency that we \nneed to be strong in the United States.

Mr. President, while we are waiting for someone to come \nover with an amendment, I want to say something about health care and \nabout the health care debate. As long as I have been in the Senate, the \nminority party has always sought to have the opportunity to have an up-\nor-down vote on their alternatives. Senator Kennedy has now for months \ndemanded that he have an opportunity to offer his proposal to remake \nthe American health care system.\n  We on the majority side of the aisle have spent tremendous amounts of \ntime putting together our proposal to strengthen patients' rights to \nempower consumers----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from Texas \ndeserves to be heard. Will Members please take their conversations off \nthe floor?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator from West Virginia, and I thank the \nChair.\n  Mr. President, on this side of the aisle, we have spent a tremendous \namount of time, individual Members' time--not just the time of our \nstaffs--in putting together our bill to promote patients' rights, to \nget the gatekeepers of Health Maintenance Organizations out of the \nexamining rooms where medical care is being provided in America.\n  We now have a situation where we have Senator Kennedy's proposal, \nwhich is strongly supported by our Democratic colleagues, and we have \nour proposal, which is strongly supported by our Republican colleagues. \nWhat we have sought to do since we have a limited number of legislative \ndays--we have many appropriations bills to pass--is to try to reach an \nagreement where we would allow something that majorities normally do \nnot do under the Senate rules, and that is to allow the minority to \nhave an up-or-down vote on their so-called Patients' Bill of Rights. \nThen, if they are unsuccessful, to have an up-or-down vote on our bill, \nand if we are successful, that would be the bill.\n  We now find that our colleagues say, ``No; we want 20 amendments,'' \nor, ``We want 10 amendments.'' I wanted to explain to my colleagues why \nI am going to object to any unanimous consent request that does not \nallow us to simply have the two choices. It is unusual in the sense \nthat someone would object to narrowing down amendments, so I would like \nto explain my concern.\n  First of all, I don't think it is unreasonable, given our legislative \nschedule, to say to those who have a health care bill that we are going \nto give them an up-or-down vote on their bill. I don't think that is \nunreasonable. Obviously, a unanimous consent request alters the basic \nprocedures of the Senate, and any Senator has the right to object to \ndoing that.\n  Secondly, I am not interested in amending Senator Kennedy's bill. I \ndon't want to try to change his bill. I want him to write the best bill \nhe can write to try to improve our health care system and enhance the \nrights of health care consumers, and I don't have any interest in \namending his bill.\n  Now, let me tell you why I don't have any interest in Senator Kennedy \nand others amending our bill. I have not forgotten that the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and many of the supporters of the Kennedy bill 5 \nyears ago were for a Government-run HMO, the Clinton health care bill. \nI have not forgotten that the President was not only in favor of the \nGovernment taking over and running the health care system 5 years ago; \nwithin the past year he has said that he had not changed his objective \nin having a Government-run system but that he was now simply trying to \nimplement it piece by piece.\n  Here is the problem this late in the legislative session of getting \ninto endless amendments on the two bills: Not only do we not have time \nto do it, but we have a very unequal situation. Let me explain, and I \nwill try to do it briefly so we can get on with this bill.\n  I am not interested, and I don't believe anyone on our side of the \naisle is interested, in amending the Kennedy bill. I believe that we \nhave a better bill. I think he ought to write the best bill he can, we \nwill write the best bill we can, and then, with the limited time we \nhave, give people a choice. But there is an additional problem here, \nand the problem is the unequal situation we are in.\n  I desperately do not want to do anything to destroy the private \npractice of medicine in America. I don't believe that a Government-run \nsystem is the best system. In offering amendments and writing our bill, \nwe are constrained in that we don't want to do anything that is going \nto drive up costs, cost millions of American families their health \ninsurance, and ultimately force people into a Government-run HMO.\n  It appears that many of our colleagues, including the author of the \nDemocratic alternative, support a Government-run HMO, support a \nGovernment takeover, so that while we are constrained in amendments \nthat we can offer by our desire to be certain that we don't end up \nkilling off private medicine, many on the other side of the aisle seem \nto believe that private medicine should be killed off so that we can \nhave a system that they sincerely believe will work better, and that is \na system where the Government would run health care in America.\n  The best analogy, interestingly enough, is biblical. Some of my \ncolleagues will remember the story in the Bible about the two women who \nhad infants. While they slept, one infant died, and the lady whose \nchild had died got up and took the dead baby and put the dead baby by \nthe mother of the living baby and took the living baby herself. When \nthe mother woke up and saw the dead child, she realized it was not her \nchild.\n  To make a long biblical story short, the women appeared before King \nSolomon. Solomon, being wise, asked that a sword be brought. He \nsuggested that since there was no way that anybody other than the two \nmothers would know whose child was really alive, that he would take the \nsword and divide the child. When he proposed that this be done, the \nreal mother, of course, as all of us remember from our schooldays and \nreading the story in the Bible, the real mother said, ``No; give her \nthe\n\n[[Page S8639]]\n\nchild.'' The woman who was not the real mother said, ``No; divide the \nchild.'' Solomon, of course, then knew who the real mother was, gave \nher the child, and the people were awed by his wisdom.\n  Here is our problem. We are debating over a child on the health care \nbill, and the child is the private practice of medicine in America. The \nchild is a viable system run in the private sector by doctors and \nnurses and hospitals that are not run by the Government, but we are in \nan unequal debate because many on the other side seem to want that \nsystem to die so that we can have a Government-run system.\n  Under those circumstances, to simply have endless amendments would \nnot serve any purpose, given not only the limited amount of time we \nhave, but also because, more importantly, it puts us at a disadvantage \nbecause we have no interest in offering amendments that would drive up \ncost, kill off private health insurance, and leave people uninsured, \nwhereas those who really believe that you first have to prove that the \nprivate health care sector cannot work and therefore you must have a \nGovernment-run system would view such an amendment exercise potentially \nas a step toward improving the health care system.\n  I simply state to my colleagues while this negotiating is going on, I \nwill certainly support, and do support, a unanimous consent request \nwhere Senator Kennedy and those who support him write the very best \nproposal they can write to strengthen patients' rights. We have \nwritten--and if we come up with better ideas, we will incorporate \nthem--the best bill we can write that we believe achieves those \nobjectives. Let's give Senator Kennedy and those who support him an up-\nor-down, freestanding vote, unamended, to put before the Senate his \nbest proposal, and let us vote yea or nay. Then give us an opportunity \nto put our bill--our best proposal--in front of the Senate and vote yea \nor nay.\n\n  But I am not interested in allowing amendments where one side of the \ndebate can view it as positive to kill off the private sector of \nmedicine in America and whereas those of us who believe that its \nsurvival is critical to quality medicine in America would be forever \ndisadvantaged in that debate.\n  So I want to call on those who have for 6 months said to us: ``The \nNo. 1 issue in the country is patients' rights. Give us an opportunity \nto vote on our bill.'' I want to call on them to bring their bill to \nthe floor of the Senate and let us vote on it. Let us vote up or down. \nWe will not amend Senator Kennedy's bill. If he has reached legislative \nperfection, at least in terms of what he thinks he can pass, then let \nus vote on it. And then let us vote on our bill.\n  But I intend to object to any unanimous consent request that would \nhave the effect I've described. I hope that reason will prevail and we \nwill have an up-or-down vote on the two alternatives. Those who want a \nbill, I do not see how they could view that as being an unfair \nproposal. It is a proposal that 6 months ago I would think that the \nminority would have jumped at.\n  Today, they want the ability to have 20 amendments. They do not want \nto set a calendar time limit. That process could go on and on and on. I \ndo not have any desire to amend their bill. We want an opportunity to \nvote on ours. Let the Senate choose. I think it would be the right way \nto go about it, and the only way we can be successful in the end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are going to have a lot of time to \ndebate health care. I suspect the Senator from Kentucky may want to \nrespond to the Senator.\n  Mr. FORD. Thirty seconds.\n  The Senator from Texas said time and time again that we were \ndestroying the medical system. With the AMA and 170 medical \norganizations in this country for our particular bill, I do not believe \nthere is any indication that we are trying to destroy the medical \nprofession in this country.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reclaiming my time.\n  Mr. FORD. I said 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. Did the Senator from Kentucky get his 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky used 18 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield----\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like to move on with the bill, to be quite honest \nwith you. I will yield the floor, but I hope we can move to the \ncompletion of this bill.\n  The Senator from Arizona has been waiting, along with the Senator \nfrom Utah, to get an amendment completed that we worked on for a few \nhours here. It would be nice if we could wrap that up. Then, if you \nwant to come back to the health care debate, that is great.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the next Member to be recognized be the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I ask the distinguished Senator from Texas to \nwithhold his objection? This should not----\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I withhold. I withhold my suggestion of the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has asked for \nunanimous consent. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. I withdraw the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Hampshire yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield 30 seconds to me?\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be 20 seconds. If the Senator has support, if he \nhas a good bill, let us bring it before the Senate and vote on it.\n  Mr. FORD. In my strategy and not yours.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If we are going to have a unanimous consent request, we \nhave to have the agreement of the Members. And I am not going to agree \nto that particular process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAINN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I certainly was entertained by the \nexchange. And I know that the Senator from Utah is going to speak right \nafter me. I hope he will have some biblical stories as well. The \nbiblical lesson that I am about to propound has to do with the fact \nthat two well-meaning and well-intentioned Americans can join together \nand resolve our problems and differences.\n  Mr. President, earlier today an amendment of mine was accepted that \nunintentionally the Senator from Utah, the distinguished chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, was unaware of. After vigorous discussion, the \nSenator from Utah and I have agreed, along with the Senator from \nVermont, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, that we would \nmodify that amendment and that basically what this means is that the \ncable rates would be held in moratorium until March 31, 1999.\n  Mr. President, this is a serious issue. The chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and I also know that it is serious, and we intend to work \ntogether and get this issue resolved so that there is meaningful \ncompetition to the rising cable rates in America which have gone up 9 \npercent last year and 8 percent again this year.\n  I think we reached an agreement that makes both of us slightly \nunhappy but I think will move this process along. I look forward to \nworking with him in the weeks ahead, and hopefully by perhaps September \nwe can get an agreement and move forward on this issue.\n\n\n                 Vitiation Of Vote--Amendment No. 3229\n\n  Mr. President, before the Senator from Utah speaks, I ask unanimous\n\n[[Page S8640]]\n\nconsent that the vote on amendment No. 3229 be vitiated.\n  The vote on amendment (No. 3229) was vitiated.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3229, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN further ask unanimous consent that a modification of the \namendment which is at the desk be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3229), as modified, was agreed to as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my friend and colleague from Arizona for being \nwilling to work out this difficulty. There was, I think, a \nmisunderstanding on this matter. We have reached an acceptable \ncompromise that will encourage us to work together on these issues for \nthe benefit of all of our constituents and the affected industries with \ndeliberate speed. I hope that we can work together to fashion a \ncomprehensive reform of the relevant laws and regulations that will \nincrease the range of options that television viewers will have.\n  The rates will be rolled back until early next year; that is, until \nMarch 31, when we would hope and expect Congress to be able to adopt \nmeaningful comprehensive reform of the issues affecting the satellite \nindustries and their customers.\n  So, again, I want to thank my colleague for being willing to vitiate \nthe prior vote, being willing to work out this compromise, and I \nexpress my desire to work together with him as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, and I believe my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee will as well with him, as chairman of the Commerce Committee, \nand hopefully we can resolve the matters in the best interests of all \nAmericans--both individuals and affected industries.

Mr. President, I would like to explain this amendment. It \nis rather simple, straightforward. It is, again, on the issue of guns. \nI am hoping now, for the first time today, that we can find some \nconsensus on that issue. And I have spoken to some of my former \nadversaries, and there may be a chance. But I would like to explain \nwhat this amendment does.\n  Earlier today, we have said in our votes on this floor--this body has \nsaid--that when it comes to requiring people who purchase guns in the \nUnited States when they purchase a handgun to buy a trigger lock, we \nvoted no, they should not be required to buy a trigger lock. Then we \nsaid, if you are going to have a criminal background check when you buy \na gun in this country, you do not have to pay for it; other taxpayers \nhave to pay for it; it is free. Those are the two votes so far.\n  I hope that I am going to broach a subject here where we can find \nsome common ground on the issue of owning guns. Remember with me, for a \nmoment, last year when there was a terrible killing at the Empire State \nBuilding. Gun violence in America, unfortunately, is not novel. We read \nabout it every day, and we see it on the news.\n  But it struck me as odd when I heard about this case because, if you \nwill remember--and I think I have the sequence correctly--a resident of \nthe Nation of Lebanon came to the United States on a nonimmigrant visa, \nsuch as a tourist visa. When he arrived in the United States, he \nvisited the State of\n\n[[Page S8641]]\n\nFlorida, which has relatively lax laws in terms of the purchase of \nfirearms. He bought a firearm in Florida, took it up to the Empire \nState Building, and gunned down several innocent people, other tourists \nat the Empire State Building.\n  It struck me as odd that while we enshrine the right of American \ncitizens to own firearms, we apparently have few, if any, ways to check \nwhen people come into this country to buy a gun as to whether or not \nthey are citizens of this country.\n  So in this case, a man from another nation, a tourist, bought a gun \nand killed innocent Americans. I think that goes too far. I think, \nfrankly, we ought to say that if you come into this country as our \nguest, not as a citizen of the United States, that we are going to \nrestrict your right to purchase a firearm. You are not a citizen of our \ncountry; we have a right to impose such restrictions on you.\n  So here is what we do: We say to the Immigration and Naturalization \nService, send over, through your computers, the names of those who are \nin this country legally on these visas; we will put them into our \nbackground check. If this individual had shown up at a gun store and \nsaid, ``I want to purchase a gun,'' they would put his name in the \ncomputer. And if he came up as a nonimmigrant visa holder, not a \ncitizen of the United States, they would have said, ``No''; and had \nthey said no to this man, several Americans might be alive today.\n  I don't think that is an unreasonable requirement. In considering \nthis amendment, I should think that people might question whether or \nnot it is our obligation in this Nation, under the Constitution or \notherwise, to arm people who come to visit us. I am not sure it is.\n  Now, we do make exceptions, and I want to make certain that those who \nread this amendment understand the exceptions. We tried to imagine the \nexceptions of those coming to the United States on nonimmigrant visas \nwho might need to own a gun for very real and legal purposes.\n  Here are the exceptions that we included: We said if you are someone \nwho has come to the United States for lawful hunting or sporting \nhunts--so you have someone who enjoys hunting and can legally do so in \nthe United States, who comes here for that purpose, goes to the far \nwest, wherever it might be, that person is exempt. That person may \npurchase a gun while here for that purpose.\n  An official representative of foreign governments--certainly, any \nhead of state brings a security contingent with him and that person may \npossess a gun.\n  Those who are credited with the U.S. Government's mission to an \ninternational organization; those en route from one country to another; \nan official of a foreign government or a distinguished foreign visitor, \na foreign law enforcement officer.\n  We try to say these are categories of people which might in the \nordinary course of events have a gun, need to purchase a gun, for very \nlegitimate purposes.\n  Now, what about those who are there on a nonimmigrant visa for a \nlonger period of time? I am willing to concede that some are here for \nmaybe even years legally on nonimmigrant visas and may need a gun at \nsome point. We even put a provision in for that.\n  A waiver of this requirement--if a person has resided in the United \nStates for 180 days and can provide a statement to our Government from \nhis Embassy or consulate that says he is authorized to acquire a \nfirearm and he doesn't have a criminal record in his home country.\n  So I think we have created exceptions which will allow those people \nwho are here on nonimmigrant visas, who are not here to commit a crime, \nan opportunity to purchase or own a firearm. Yet we have said that \ntourists from any nation who comes in, buys a firearm, commits an act \nof terrorism or murder, is not welcome. We are not going to make it \neasy for them.\n  That is the amendment which I have offered. I hope that those who are \nmulling over its provisions will come to the conclusion that it is not \nan unreasonable suggestion. I hope those who visit our country \nunderstand they are welcome. When it comes to purchasing a gun, which \nmay lead to a violent crime, we are at least going to ask some \nquestions. I think the people of America expect us to ask those \nquestions.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Has there been a unanimous consent agreement in terms of \nthis pending amendment or any others considered this evening?\n  Mr. GREGG. No.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3240, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have sent a modification of my amendment \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3240), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I of the bill, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. ____. FIREARMS.\n\n       Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (d), by striking paragraph (5) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(5) who, being an alien--\n       ``(A) is illegally or unlawfully in the United States; or\n       ``(B) except as provided in subsection (y)(2), has been \n     admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa (as \n     that term is defined in section 101(a)(26) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(26)));'';\n       (2) in subsection (g), by striking paragraph (5) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(5) who, being an alien--\n       ``(A) is illegally or unlawfully in the United States; or\n       ``(B) except as provided in subsection (y)(2), has been \n     admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa (as \n     that term is defined in section 101(a)(26) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(26)));'';\n       (3) in subsection (s)(3)(B), by striking clause (v) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(v) is not an alien who--\n\n       ``(I) is illegally or unlawfully in the United States; or\n       ``(II) subject to subsection (y)(2), has been admitted to \n     the United States under a nonimmigrant visa (as that term is \n     defined in section 101(a)(26) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(26)));''; and\n\n       (4) by inserting after subsection (x) the following:\n       ``(y) Provisions Relating to Aliens Admitted Under \n     Nonimmigrant Visas.--\n       ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection--\n       ``(A) the term `alien' has the same meaning as in section \n     101(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1101(a)(3)); and\n       ``(B) the term `nonimmigrant visa' has the same meaning as \n     in section 101(a)(26) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(26)).\n       ``(2) Exceptions.--Subsections (d)(5)(B), (g)(5)(B), and \n     (s)(3)(B)(v)(II) do not apply to any alien who has been \n     lawfully admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant \n     visa, if that alien is--\n       ``(A) admitted to the United States for lawful hunting or \n     sporting purposes or is in possession of a hunting license or \n     permit lawfully issued in the United States;\n       ``(B) an official representative of a foreign government \n     who is--\n       ``(i) accredited to the United States Government or the \n     Government's mission to an international organization having \n     its headquarters in the United States; or\n       ``(ii) en route to or from another country to which that \n     alien is accredited;\n       ``(C) an official of a foreign government or a \n     distinguished foreign visitor who has been so designated by \n     the Department of State; or\n       ``(D) a foreign law enforcement officer of a friendly \n     foreign government entering the United States on official law \n     enforcement business.\n       ``(3) Waiver.--\n       ``(A) Conditions for waiver.--Any individual who has been \n     admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa may \n     receive a waiver from the requirements of subsection (g)(5), \n     if--\n       ``(i) the individual submits to the Attorney General a \n     petition that meets the requirements of subparagraph (C); and\n       ``(ii) the Attorney General approves the petition.\n       ``(B) Petition.--Each petition under subparagraph (B) \n     shall--\n       ``(i) demonstrate that the petitioner has resided in the \n     United States for a continuous period of not less than 180 \n     days before the date on which the petition is submitted under \n     this paragraph; and\n\n[[Page S8642]]\n\n       ``(ii) include a written statement from the embassy or \n     consulate of the petitioner, authorizing the petitioner to \n     acquire a firearm or ammunition and certifying that the alien \n     would not, absent the application of subsection (g)(5)(B), \n     otherwise be prohibited from such acquisition under \n     subsection (g).\n       ``(C) Approval of petition.--The Attorney General shall \n     approve a petition submitted in accordance with this \n     paragraph, if the Attorney General determines that waiving \n     the requirements of subsection (g)(5)(B) with respect to the \n     petitioner--\n       ``(i) would be in the interests of justice; and\n       ``(ii) would not jeopardize the public safety.''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have been working with the Senator from \nIdaho, and I think we have reached an agreement on this, in which we \nprovide language that says if a person who comes to the United States \non a non-immigrant visa is in possession of a hunting license or permit \nlawfully issued within the United States, they then would not be \ncovered by the provisions of this law. That is consistent with the \noriginal language of the amendment.\n  At this point, I yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I appreciate the willingness of the Senator \nfrom Illinois to modify his amendment. I think it is necessary and \nappropriate, and certainly the public understands that hunting is a \nlawful right and opportunity in this country. Certainly, foreign \ncitizens who are here that go through the legal and necessary steps \nshould be allowed that opportunity, and to acquire a gun for that \npurpose while here is necessary and fitting.\n  I agree with the Senator from Illinois that he deals with a very \nimportant area of the law. We have seen it misused by aliens in this \ncountry. Our second amendment is something that we honor, that many of \nus feel is a very important right of our citizens under the \nConstitution. It should not be abused by those who are guests in our \ncountry, legally or illegally. I think the Senator from Illinois speaks \nclearly to that in the amendment. I appreciate his offering it.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Illinois has \nproposed a strong amendment here, and it has been strengthened further \nby the Senator from Idaho.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3240), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                         border patrol aviation\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would ask to engage the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Gregg, in a brief colloquy regarding a portion of the \nreport which accompanies the bill, calling on the Border Patrol to \nexamine the potential cost savings and border surveillance capabilities \nof a variety of types of aircraft. I support the committee's effort to \nseek more information to improve the cost effectiveness and efficiency \nof our border surveillance effort--against both illegal immigration and \ndrugs. But, I also believe that we must review all types of aircraft, \nincluding both manned and unmanned airships. Is it the Committee's \nintent that such airships also be considered in the study and report?\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Senator's concerns on this subject. The \ncommittee believes that the full range of aircraft options, including \nairships, should be examined by the Border Patrol to assist our efforts \nto ensure the most cost-effective and efficient ways to protect our \nborders from both illegal immigration and the flow of drugs.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator for his interest in this matter and \nfor his clarification of the committee report.\n\n\n               congress-bundestag youth exchange program\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the subcommittee in a brief colloquy on the Congress-\nBundestag Youth Exchange Program (CBYX). I would like to hear his \nthoughts about German-American student exchanges and the reasons why \nthe bill before us does not include any appropriation for these \nimportant exchanges.\n  Let me assert first of all that I am a strong and enthusiastic \nsupporter of the CBYX program that has been in existence now for 15 \nyears. I recall the enthusiasm in the Senate when, in 1983, the late \nSenator Heinz introduced the bill authorizing this exchange program. \nMany of us rose to endorse it and the legislation received unanimous \nsupport.\n  The legislation was inspired by the events surrounding the critical \ndecision by the German Government to deploy United States Pershing-II \nmissiles in Germany--a decision which, in my judgment accelerated the \nend of the Cold War. At the time, it became evident that there were \nfundamental misunderstandings within Germany of United States \nintentions and equally shallow perceptions about Germany in the United \nStates.\n  The German Government felt the need for correcting misperceptions \nabout the United States most acutely and initiated a process to \nestablish and fund a youth exchange program with the United States. The \nCongress-Bundestag exchange program that emerged from those efforts was \nnot just another bilateral exchange program. Rather, it has become an \nessential component of American foreign policy. With the imminent \nexpansion of NATO eastward, it takes on an even more important role in \npromoting understanding between our two countries.\n  The Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange program was launched jointly in \n1983 by the U.S. Congress and the German Bundestag and has been funded \nby both governments in roughly equal amounts ever since.\n  Many of us on both sides of the aisle who were in Congress in 1983 \nspoke passionately in support of these exchanges. Those of us who \nfollow the program closely and meet with the exchange students believe \nit is an essential component of American foreign policy.\n\n  Apart from expanding awareness of German and American institutions \nand culture, the international experiences and increased proficiency in \nlanguage have become valuable assets in the students' continuing \neducation and community life.\n  One of the unique features of the Congress Bundestag Youth Exchange \nProgram is that the German Government virtually matches our \ncontributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis. They try to match the \nnumber of students they send to the United States to those we send \nGermany. They would like to send many more students. When we increase \nor decrease our funding, they tend to increase or decrease their \nfunding. Thus, if we zero out or decrease funding for this program, the \nGerman Government may do the same. In effect, that would be a double \nhit and a double calamity for United States-German relations.\n  Thousands of young people from Germany and from the United States are \nable to spend a year in the other country, live with host families and \nlearn about one another. Thousands have become young Ambassadors for \ntheir country. They have strengthened our mutual interests.\n  Germany's strategic importance in Europe is self-evident. It enjoys \nthe strongest economy in Europe and has cooperated in expanding both \nthe European Union and NATO toward the East. It is poised to play an \neven greater role in international peacekeeping, international \ncommerce, and the global economy. Moreover, there are more than 60 \nmillion Americans who trace their heritage to German origins, one of \nthe largest, if not the largest, ethnic groups in the United States.\n  Could I ask the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee what has \nbeen the recent funding levels for the Congress-Bundestag Program and \nif the bill before us eliminates or reduces funding for the Congress-\nBundestag program for fiscal year 1999?\n  Mr. GREGG. Funding for this program was at $2.75 million for several \nyears in the past but it declined to $2.4 million and has been at or \nbelow that level in recent years. The current bill does not include any \nfunding for the Congress-Bundestag Program but it does not prohibit any \nfunding either. We suggest in the report language that there are other \ncompeting priorities which make it difficult to fund all requests for \ncultural and educational exchanges.\n\n[[Page S8643]]\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. It is my understanding that this program is a very high \npriority of the administration and that the President has publicly \nstated that he wants to increase funding for the Congress-Bundestag \nProgram in fiscal year 2000 to a level at least $2.8 million--an amount \nsubstantially above recent levels.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes. The President has announced his intention to request \nan increase for this program in the year following the current fiscal \nyear. I will look forward to that request.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I understand the companion House bill includes funding for \nthis exchange program at about $2 million. Therefore, funding for the \nCongress-Bundestag Youth Exchange program for fiscal year 1999 will be \nan issue in conference. Is it the chairman's intention to restore funds \nfor the CBYX program in conference?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like very much to restore funding for this \nprogram--and for other exchanges as well. Unfortunately we are \noperating under tight budgetary constraints. As the senior Senator from \nIndiana knows, the number of international exchange programs have grown \nover the years and that is a reflection of their popularity and \nimportance. Overall appropriations have not kept pace with the growth \nin the number of programs. The regrettable result of this shrinkage of \nfunds and growth in demand for them means that some programs must be \nreduced.\n  But, I very much appreciate the Senator's strong argument in support \nof the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange program, particularly the \nforeign policy role it plays in strengthening our ties with an \nimportant European ally, Germany. I will keep your arguments very much \nbefore me when we negotiate with our House counterparts in conference.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the chairman and appreciate his explanation. My \noriginal intention was to introduce an amendment to restore funding for \nthe CBYX program but do not want to burden the managers with a specific \nearmark. Could the chairman give assurance that he will do all he can \nto restore funding for these exchanges. If he does, I will withdraw my \namendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. You have made a strong argument on behalf of the program. \nAnd I will do my best to adjust existing programs to provide funding \nfor the United States-German exchange program.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I appreciate your assurances. Mr. President, I would like \nto made a few additional comments on the Congress-Bundestag Youth \nExchange Program.\n  For the past 15 years, some 11,000 young students from Germany and \nthe United States have participated in these exchanges. German and \nAmerican families have hosted these students in their homes and \ncommunities and formed enduring friendships and nurturing the ability \nto see each other through the other's eyes. The earliest of these \nparticipants are mature adults now and have assumed responsible \npositions in their communities. I'm impressed that senior members of \nthe German Government, including Chancellor Kohl and the President of \nthe German Bundestag, Rita Sussmuth are personally involved in the \nprogram. Many others have invited American students to work in their \noffices, invited them into their homes and arranged for specific events \non their behalf. Our German counterparts value this program very highly \nand promote it with enthusiasm.\n  In the end, we should support this program because it is in our \ninterests to do so. It is one of our smallest international exchange \nprograms but it reaps substantial foreign policy benefits. We should be \nsending more American students to Germany on this program. The German \nGovernment wants to increase the number of students they send here.\n  I should add that most of the American students selected for this \nexchange program are juniors or sophomores in high school. The \nstandards are high. To be eligible, a student must have a 3.0 grade \npoint or better and be a citizen or permanent resident of the United \nStates.\n  Once again, I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee. He has a difficult task of balancing growing and \ncompeting demands with increasingly sparse resources. I appreciate his \nunderstanding and courtesy and look forward to working with him and the \ncommittee to restore funding for the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange \nProgram (CBYX).\n\n\n           improving school safety and fighting school crime\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues are aware, support \nfor education has been at the top of my priorities since I began my \ncareer as a public servant.\n  I've worked for many years, and on several fronts, to strengthen our \npublic schools and universities, and I've focused as well on an \nessential prerequisite for improving educational opportunities--a safe \nlearning environment. Unfortunately, not all students share the \nprivilege of attending a safe school.\n  Over the past year, tragic murders at schools across the Nation have \nchilled parents' hearts. Perhaps even more chilling are figures from a \nspring 1998 Department of Justice study, which indicates just how many \nschools, and schoolchildren, are at risk. In the past year, nearly 60 \npercent of all elementary and secondary schools reported at least one \nincident of criminal activity to the police. Roughly 20 percent of \nschools reported six crimes or more. One out of every ten schools \nreported a serious violent crime during the past year.\n  Mr. President, crime in school is a double threat--a threat not just \nto safety and property, but to our entire educational system. Parents \nshould worry about their children dodging homework, not dodging \nbullets. Teachers should be able to devote their energy to promoting \nacademic achievement, not counseling victims. And students should be \nfocused on their next exam, not on making it safely to the next class.\n  While the States have the primary responsibility for both education \nand criminal justice, and the Federal Government cannot give every \nneighborhood crime-free schools, I believe the Congress should do more. \nThe Federal Government can help by supporting innovative efforts by \nlocal communities and law enforcement to improve safety, by sharing \ninsights gained from these efforts with communities across the Nation, \nand simply by focusing attention on this problem.\n  During past Congresses, I supported prevention programs to assist \nlocal communities, including drug resistance education, school security \ngrants, and the Gun Free School Zones Act. In 1993, I worked to create \na Commission on Violence in Schools to study school safety. I've also \nvoted for additional deterrence measures, including adult prosecution \nof armed juveniles who commit violent crimes, and increased funding for \njuvenile prisons.\n  Last fall, I proposed an amendment to permit funds available under \nthe Community Oriented Policing Services Program (COPS) to go to school \nsafety initiatives. COPS funding has been restricted in the past to \nhiring new police officers. The amendment I proposed, and the Senate \nadopted, expanded the use of COPS funding to reward innovative crime-\nreduction efforts by communities and law enforcement, to share \nknowledge about successful school-safety programs, and to raise public \nawareness about school crime. Thanks to the support of Senators Gregg \nand Hollings, $17.5 million in grants were made available in fiscal \nyear 1998. The grants will be awarded later this fall to communities \nacross the Nation.\n\n  This spring, I spoke with Senators Hollings and Gregg and urged them \nto continue and expand this program in fiscal year 1999, and I am \ngrateful for their generosity and their commitment to the cause. The \nchair and ranking member provided more than $210 million for a Schools \nSafety Initiative. Under this initiative, $10 million will support \nresearch in technology to improve school safety, such as weapons \ndetection equipment. Another $25 million will fund community efforts to \npromote nonviolent dispute resolution, to train teachers and parents to \nrecognize troubled children, and to strengthen families.\n  The bulk of the School Safety Initiative, $175 million, will be \nadministered under the COPS school safety program that I initiated last \nfall. I believe this funding level is a strong statement to students, \nparents, teachers, and law enforcement. This program indicates that \nschool safety is a national priority, and\n\n[[Page S8644]]\n\nI hope schools and communities across the Nation will respond.\n  A number of schools in Virginia have already taken action. Some have \nset up anonymous crime tip lines for their students. Police in Richmond \nwork with students to promote peaceful conflict resolution and drug \nresistance education. Other communities, such as Pulaski County, have \nactually placed police officers in schools.\n  One remaining concern I have is the attention to this issue will \nreceive from future Congresses. In my view, the matter of school safety \ndeserves sustained attention, and continuing support from the this \nbody. There are several juvenile justice reform bills pending before \nthe Senate, and I'd like to move forward on legislation in this area \nthis year. Unfortunately, that appears unlikely.\n  Therefore, I look forward to working with my colleagues next year to \nschedule a full debate on juvenile justice issues, as a well as to \nprovide continued support for school safety through the appropriations \nprocess during conference with the House this year and next.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3243\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, relating to \n    counsel for witnesses in grand jury proceedings, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3243.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II of the bill, insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. 2____. GRAND JURY RIGHT TO COUNSEL.\n\n       (a) In General.--Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal \n     Procedure is amended--\n       (1) in subdivision (d), by inserting ``and counsel for that \n     witness (as provided in subdivision (h))'' after ``under \n     examination''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) Counsel for Grand Jury Witnesses.--\n       ``(1) In general.--\n       ``(A) Right of assistance.--Each witness subpoenaed to \n     appear and testify before a grand jury in a district court, \n     or to produce books, papers, documents, or other objects \n     before that grand jury, shall be allowed the assistance of \n     counsel during such time as the witness is questioned in the \n     grand jury room.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. We were working on a unanimous consent agreement that \nwould allow a second degree to be offered to the Senator's amendment, \nwhich would be reserved to the majority. Does the Senator object to \nsuch an option? It would be a relative second degree.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I don't know. I need to meditate on that.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is why we are meditating on the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I noticed there was no prompt response on that side of \nthe aisle to a request for the yeas and nays, so I assumed some sort of \ncabal was in the works.\n  Mr. GREGG. We would look forward to a vote on the Senator's \namendment, but we do want to reserve the right to a second degree.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am not sure I look forward to voting on a second-\ndegree amendment, but then it may be, if we are going to have a \nunanimous consent agreement of any kind, it might preclude a second-\ndegree amendment.\n  Let me think about it.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I want to suggest to each Senator that they meditate on \nthis proposition.\n  The doorbell rings and the Senator's wife answers the door. There is \na nicely dressed person, in a suit and tie, standing at the door. He \nhands her a paper, and she says, ``What is this?''\n  He says, ``That's a subpoena.''\n  She says, ``What does that mean?''\n  He says, ``That means that the district attorney, the United States \nattorney wants to question you.''\n  ``Well, about what?''\n  ``I don't know.''\n  ``What does this paper mean?''\n  ``It means that you don't have any choice. You must go down and \nappear before the grand jury.''\n  ``Well, how long will that take?''\n  ``Well, as a matter of fact, sometimes it takes several days. Some \nwitnesses have been known to have to appear for 5 and 6 and 7 days, \ndifferent times.''\n  ``But I don't know anything. What can I testify to?''\n  ``Ma'am, I'm just a functionary. I have been requested, and it is my \nofficial duty to present you with this subpoena. Incidentally, the U.S. \nattorney also wants you to bring all of your telephone calls and also \nany other documents or letters you may have in your possession that \nwould relate to anything.''\n  ``Well,'' she says, ``Do I get to bring a lawyer with me?''\n  ``Oh, yes, ma'am, you can bring a lawyer.''\n  Then she says, ``Well, can my lawyer sit in the grand jury room with \nme?''\n  ``No, ma'am, I'm afraid not. Your lawyer can sit outside the grand \njury room but he can't come in the room with you.''\n  Now, to a lot of people, this is a real story. This is not an \nOrwellian bad dream. This is what happens to a lot of innocent people \nin this country on a daily basis. She doesn't have any choice but to \nshow up.\n  If she had been arrested and charged with a crime, and she was a \npossible criminal who was about to go on trial and serve jail time if \nconvicted, she would have a constitutional right to a lawyer, or to \nremain silent. She would not have to tell the U.S. attorney anything. \nShe could remain silent. She could not only remain silent; she would be \nprovided a lawyer if she could not afford one.\n  How many times has every person in the Senate stood on this floor and \nsaid criminals have more rights than ordinary citizens?\n  In this case, it is true. I just gave you a classic illustration of \nwhy it is true. If this woman were arrested by the police, or charged \nwith a crime, they couldn't treat her in such a way. But, because she \nis an ordinary witness, an innocent citizen, she can be made to go and \ntestify. She can be made to bring any documents the U.S. attorney \nchooses to make her bring. She can be required to walk in the grand \njury room and sit alone on the stand in abject terror because her \nlawyer is not permitted in the room with her; he must sit outside.\n  It is true that she can ask for a recess, leave the witness stand and \nsay to the court, say to the U.S. attorney:\n  ``Before I answer that question, I would like to talk to my lawyer.''\n  He says, ``OK.''\n  So she goes outside and she asks her lawyer, to whom she has just \npaid a $5,000 retainer because she is terrified--not because she has \ndone anything wrong--she has just paid this lawyer $5,000. They are \npeople of very modest means. He cannot go in the grand jury room, but \nshe can go out and ask him a question. She is not a lawyer and she is \nnot sophisticated enough to know on what questions should she defer to \nher lawyer. She could answer the most incriminating question in the \nworld, in all of her legal ignorance, and not know she had just \nimplicated herself.\n  What if she says to the man who appeared at her door with a subpoena:\n  ``You say you don't know what they want to talk to me about?''\n  He says, ``Well, it's about the parking meter scandal.''\n  ``I don't know anything about any parking meter scandal.''\n  ``Well, I'm sorry, ma'am.''\n  She says, ``If they asked me something and I can't remember it, or if \nI try to remember and I give them an answer and it turns out to be \nwrong, then what happens?''\n  ``Oh, then in that case, ma'am, they may charge you with perjury.''\n\n[[Page S8645]]\n\n  Here is a classic case of a criminal justice system that is not \nworking. I heard all these lamentations about human rights in China, \nbut you tell me, how much worse can a situation get, when innocent \npeople every day in this country are called to testify--and, frankly, \nas good citizens they should be willing to testify--but when they get \nin the grand jury room with the U.S. attorney, they are subject to his \nmercy. He can ask them--he can ask this woman, first crack out of the \nbat, in this investigation of a parking meter scandal:\n  ``Have you been faithful to your husband ever since you got \nmarried?'' He can do this because there is no requirement of relevancy \nin the grand jury.\n  ``Well, as a matter of fact, I think that's personal.''\n  ``Ma'am, I'm asking you a question. I want an answer. I understand \nthat one of your children is gay; is that true?''\n  ``Well, what's that got to do with anything?''\n  ``Ma'am, I'm asking you the questions. I'm the U.S. attorney here, \nand I can ask anything I want. Is it true one of your children got \npicked up one time on a pot charge when he was a senior in high \nschool?''\n  ``What is that relevant to?''\n  ``Ma'am, as I said, I'm asking the questions here. Now, I'm asking \nyou, and you are legally required to answer truthfully.''\n  Senators, I'm going to tell you something. You think this is \nfarfetched? Believe me, believe me, it is not. It happens all the time.\n  You ask yourself this question: How would you like to be in the grand \njury room without a lawyer--nobody--and you ask the U.S. attorney:\n  ``Look, I would like to go outside the room. My lawyer is sitting \njust outside the door. I would like to talk to him and ask him whether \nI should answer this question or not.''\n  ``You have a right to do that, ma'am. Go right ahead.''\n  She goes out. After awhile, he asks her another one of those silly \nquestions. And she says, ``You know, I don't know how to answer that. I \nneed to talk to my lawyer again.''\n\n  The third time she does that, these grand jurors start nudging each \nother. ``This woman is hiding something. She knows a lot more than she \nis willing to talk about. Why is she going outside to talk to that \nlawyer so much if she doesn't have something to hide?''\n  That is the psychological part of trying lawsuits. I am telling you, \nI was a trial attorney for 18 years before I became Governor. I have \nseen prosecuting attorneys, I have seen local district attorneys, I \nhave seen U.S. attorneys, eaten up with political ambition. And when \nthey are eaten up with political ambition, do you know what they want? \nAll the notches in their belt they can get. They want to be able to \nboast, ``I never failed to get an indictment I asked for.''\n  The chief judge of the State of New York once said, ``You can get a \ngrand jury to indict a ham sandwich if you ask them to.'' I had a U.S. \nattorney tell me one time, ``I have never failed to get an indictment \nfrom a grand jury.'' I can tell you, if he had ever failed to get one, \nthat would be one of the most abysmal failures I have ever heard of, \nbecause I know all kinds of U.S. attorneys and DA's all over this \ncountry who have been able to get an indictment every time they ask for \none. Do you know why? Because there are 23 grand jurors sitting there \nwho know nothing except what the U.S. attorney proposes to tell them, \nonly what the witnesses he decides to call will tell them.\n  Mr. President, I am not talking as any bleeding-heart liberal. I have \ndefended a few criminals in my life. A couple of them I felt pretty \nsure were guilty, but the first thing I learned in law school is that \nthis is a nation of laws; everybody is entitled to a lawyer, and to a \nfair trial.\n  The grand jury system has gotten so bad that 27 States in this Nation \nhave abolished grand juries. You think about that. The States are \nalways ahead of us in Congress. Mr. President, 27 States have abolished \nthe grand jury system, and 18 States have laws that allow the attorney \nfor a witness to sit in the grand jury room with the witness. Now, what \ndo these states know that we don't know?\n  My amendment is just about as simple as you can make it. It says one \nthing, that a witness who has an attorney and wishes that attorney to \nsit in the grand jury room with them may do so. What is wrong with \nthat? You tell me. Anybody, tell me.\n  If a U.S. attorney is afraid to ask questions because he doesn't want \nher attorney to hear, what is objectionable about it? And why should \nhe? Why should a U.S. attorney fear asking any question that he is \ngoing to ask later, perhaps, in the courtroom anyway? This is supposed \nto be a fair fight. Is he afraid of the truth?\n  Do you know why we have a grand jury system? Because the Federal \nGovernment was not to be trusted and the Founding Fathers put the \nrequirement in the Fifth Amendment: We will have a grand jury system. \nAnd the reason we cannot abolish it is because it is in the \nConstitution, and I would not change that. The States are not so \nfettered, and they are abolishing it right and left because they know \nthat grand jury system is often not fair. It is just short of a Star \nChamber proceeding because only one side of the case is heard.\n  In medieval England people were tried by ordeal--they were thrown \ninto the lake or had their hand dunked in boiling water. If they \nsurvived the ordeal, they were innocent. If they didn't, it didn't make \nany difference. That is what was called a Star Chamber proceeding. That \nis what people used to go through when they missed church. They were \nput in the stocks or they were subjected to boiling water or a whole \nhost of other things.\n  So that is the reason that many of the Founding Fathers came here \nafter being abused and abused and abused in England. Because they were \nmostly a poor class, and they didn't trust Government. Because they had \nnot trusted the King, they knew the King had all the cards, and they \nwanted to level the playing field and they wanted it to be a fair \nfight. I can tell you, we do not have a fair fight now in the grand \njury.\n  So, isn't this just simple justice, to allow a witness to have a \nlawyer? Is this complicated for anybody listening, that a witness who \nis not charged with anything should have a right to a lawyer in the \ncourtroom, not sitting outside? Do you think a U.S. attorney would \nstart off asking a Senator's wife if she had been faithful to him all \nof her life if her attorney was sitting there? I promise you he \nwouldn't. Do you think he would ask if her children were gay or had \never smoked pot if her lawyer was sitting in the room? Of course, he \nwouldn't. This is about simple deterrence of misconduct.\n\n  I ask those who will oppose this amendment, What is the prohibition \nnow under existing law to keep a U.S. attorney from asking those kinds \nof abusive questions, and worse? There is none.\n  I remember one time talking with Senator McGovern when he was a \nSenator. One of these questions came up about charging everybody with \neverything and vetting everybody who came through. If you get nominated \nto an executive position, you have to go through a kind of inquisition. \nGeorge McGovern said, ``I want it on the record right now: I stole a \nwatermelon when I was 12 years old.''\n  I can tell you, what we have right now in the grand jury system is \nnot fair, and every Member of this body knows it. I am not defending \ncriminals. I am not saying give criminals an upper hand. What I am \nsaying is give witnesses the same choices you give a defendant, the \ncriminal, which is the right to the assistance of counsel, as \nguaranteed in the Sixth Amendment.\n  Mr. President, I hope everybody understands this issue. I don't want \nto belabor it. It is the kind of amendment that doesn't need a lot of \ndiscussion. But you think about this, I say to Senators, your wife or \nfamily member who is as innocent as a newly ordained nun, who never did \nanything wrong in her life, is going before the grand jury system \nhardly knowing why she has been called and then subjected to day after \nday after day of testimony, or even 2 hours of testimony--whatever it \nis. At least put her on a par with the criminal defendants who are \narrested and have to be placed on trial, who have a right to an \nattorney.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from Arkansas yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I will be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n[[Page S8646]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to debate the following amendments--one which we are now \ndebating--with votes in relation to the issues to be postponed to occur \non Wednesday, July 22, at 9:40 a.m.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that no second-degree amendments be \nin order, and that all debate be concluded this evening; that there be \n2 minutes for debate for closing remarks prior to each vote in the \nstacked sequence, with the exception of the vote in relation to the \nBumpers amendment, on which there will be 10 minutes for closing \nremarks. The amendments to be debated are as follows: Moseley-Braun, an \nInternet prevention amendment; Graham of Florida, sheriff's auction; \nand Bumpers amendment on grand juries, which we are presently debating.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. In light of this agreement, there will be no further votes \nthis evening, and the next votes will be in a stacked sequence \nbeginning at 9:40 a.m.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, that is a perfectly fair, legitimate \nundertaking, and I will not be much longer. Senator Levin is here and \nwishes to speak on the amendment, and any other cosponsors of the \namendment who are listening should feel free to come over and speak, if \nthey choose.\n  The point I was about to make, and I will close on this--is this: The \nAmerican people are fairly happy right now because the economy is going \nwell. But I can tell you, there is one underlying sentiment in this \ncountry that is undeniable, and it is that the vast majority of the \npeople in this country don't think we, who live in this rarefied \natmosphere, know what their everyday lives are like, and they are \nright. They are right.\n  Here is an opportunity to restore people's confidence in the system. \nIt doesn't happen often. One of the reasons this amendment may not \nprevail is because in the scheme of things, with 268 million people in \nthis country and probably no more than, what should I say, 10,000, \n20,000 at most will appear before grand juries in any given year and \nanswer questions, who cares about 10,000 people out of 268 million? I \ncare. If I didn't, I wouldn't be staying here tonight to offer this \namendment.\n  I first started to object to voting on this in the morning, but the \nmore I thought about it, the more I thought that it might be good. It \nmight be good for Senators to reflect on this overnight and to think \nabout the fact that justice denied to one single soul is an aberration \nto a free nation.\n  I sincerely hope people will think about this and think about it in \nterms of their own personal lives--not some obscure thing you read in \nthe Washington Post every morning or the New York Times--but you think \nabout some of these things happening to people, and ask yourself: How \nwould I feel about that? And, if a member of your family were involved, \nwouldn't you wish that this amendment was in place as a matter of law?\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been listening to my distinguished \ncolleague from Arkansas and his very literal discussion of the grand \njury process. It isn't quite as simple as my colleague is explaining.\n  The reason we have a grand jury process and the reason we don't allow \nattorneys in there is because that process is to remain secret. Under \nrule 6(e) of the Federal rules, people are not allowed to talk about \nwhat happens within the grand jury--certainly the prosecutors are not \nallowed to talk about it. That doesn't mean they have to be totally, \nmeticulously unable to talk about the cases that they are handling. But \nbasic 6(e) grand jury testimony is not permitted to be talked about, \nand there is a reason for that. There is a reason for not allowing \nattorneys into the grand jury proceedings.\n  The distinguished Senator from Arkansas seems to have the opinion \nthat in almost every case, or at least in many cases, prosecutors will \nact irresponsibly, improperly, will take advantage of witnesses, will \nabuse the law. And I do not believe that is the case.\n  But one reason why grand jury proceedings have been basically \nsecretive is because, let us say the prosecution was doing a major \ninvestigation of organized crime. You can bet your bottom dollar with \nevery witness who goes before that grand jury they would have the same \norganized crime attorney or attorney representing organized crime or \nthose organized criminals in that grand jury proceeding. Every one of \nthem would want that attorney there, except those who are blowing the \nwhistle on the criminals for whom the grand jury is being held to begin \nwith.\n  In other words, it would be almost impossible to ever get a witness \nto come forward in grand jury proceedings of any consequence involving \norganized crime, and sometimes not so organized crime, because the \nminute that person appeared, it would be known who literally was \ntestifying against the people whom the prosecutors were trying to bring \nthe actions against.\n  So it isn't quite as simple as the distinguished Senator has said, \nalthough I share some of his concerns. If there is any evidence that \ngrand jury proceedings have been used to abuse witnesses or have been \nused to seduce witnesses into incriminating themselves, or have been \nused to ask questions that are irrelevant, such as some of those \nsuggested by my distinguished colleague, then, yes, I agree with him, \nsomething ought to be done to prevent those types of things from \nhappening, and perhaps we should look at this whole area.\n  On the other hand, we have suggested to him that the way to do this \nwould be, of course, to let the judicial conference look at this and \nmake recommendations and really look at all sides of this issue so we \ndo not go into this half cocked and throw out a system that has served \nthis country well over 200 years just because there are some alleged \noccasional prosecutors who might abuse the process.\n  It is not quite as simple as people try to make it seem. The grand \njury proceeding has served this country well for well over 200 years. \nAnd, yes, some of these issues that are raised are ones that trouble me \nas well. But before we throw this out and before we decide to allow \nattorneys in the room, then it seems to me we ought to at least have a \nthorough study to determine whether throwing it out is the thing to do, \nwhether that is going to really be a better process than what we have \ntoday. I don't think it will be.\n  But it does not take many brains to realize the current grand jury \nprocess is one-sided. The prosecutor can present whatever the \nprosecutor wants. And unscrupulous prosecutors can bring an indictment \nagainst almost anybody by just basically asking the grand jury to do \nit, because there is nobody in there to represent the rights of the \naccused.\n  The distinguished Senator does raise some very important issues, but \nI would prefer that we look at this in a very broad-based study that \nreally looks at the pros, the cons, the good, the bad, and helps us to \nmake a determination here. If, after a study like that, we find that \nthe distinguished Senator is primarily right, and that there are many \ninjustices that occur through grand jury proceedings, then I would be \nthe first to join him in making the changes that he would request here \nthis evening.\n  But frankly, I think that is the type of thing that should be done, \nthat should be done carefully and deliberately. And we should not throw \nout 200 years of history and 200 years of grand jury proceedings that \nhave served this country at least ostensibly very well because we are \nconcerned that there may be some abuses of this particular process in \nsome instances.\n  My experience has been that there are very seldom abuses, that the \nsystem works well, that it is a system that can bring indictments \nagainst those who deserve indictments brought against them; and \nespecially in the area of organized crime, it is a very useful and \nworthwhile system.\n  Having said that, that does not mean that I am ignoring what my \ndistinguished friend and colleague has said or what he believes, \nbecause I myself\n\n[[Page S8647]]\n\nhave some concerns, as he does. Personally, I believe that in most \ninstances it is a good thing to give people the right to have their \ncounsel there. And remember, grand jury proceedings can bring down \nindictments but they cannot convict people.\n  On the other hand, once the indictment is brought down, that amounts \nto a criminal defense that must be waged in almost every case. So I \nhope that I can talk my colleague into having a major, major review and \nstudy of this rather than doing something that literally throws out the \nsystem or at least changes the system dramatically in such a way that \nmight have very detrimental effects in our getting to the bottom of \norganized crime, to the bottom of organized criminal conduct with \nregard to drugs, to the bottom of criminal activity in general where \nwitnesses might be intimidated or afraid to even appear before grand \njuries.\n  The more we do this, I think the more we are going to find that some \nof those concerns may outweigh some of the concerns that the \ndistinguished Senator has, because I do not believe that you can point \nto many instances as a whole--as a whole--where the feelings or \ncomplaints of the distinguished Senator from Arkansas are actually \nfulfilled.\n  Currently, all witnesses may leave the grand jury proceeding or grand \njury room to consult with their attorneys anytime they want. Now the \nSenator makes a good point when he says, How is that person going to \nknow whether they are incriminating themselves if they are not skilled \nin the law, if you have a skillful grand jury prosecutor in there \nasking questions? And that is a tough question to answer.\n  But the fact of the matter is that if they have an attorney to begin \nwith, that attorney is going to say, ``Don't answer anything unless you \ntalk to me, so tell them after each question you want to come out and \ntalk to me.'' That has been my experience where you have attorneys who \nare concerned about their clients going in before the grand jury. And \nthere is a way to be represented by an attorney to not say one word or \nto answer one question without continuously going out and discussing it \nwith your attorney. So there is a protection.\n  The difference is that, if I am correct--and I believe I am--there \nare instances where the grand jury proceeding works better than any \nother system we have ever had, especially in the area of organized \ncrime. I would be very hesitant to throw out that system without the \nstudy by those who are experts in this field and those who really can \nmake a difference in determining just what is right and what is wrong \nhere.\n  But having said that, I have raised these concerns. I hope my \ncolleague will consider having a study. I would join with him in that. \nWe can place a limited period of time on it, and if that study proves \nto augment his feelings and proves his thesis here, then I may very \nwell join with him in making the changes that he would like to make \nhere today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3243, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to send a \nmodification to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in title II of the bill, insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. 2____. GRAND JURY DUE PROCESS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal \n     Procedure is amended--\n       (1) in subdivision (d), by inserting ``and counsel for that \n     witness (as provided in subdivision (h))'' after ``under \n     examination''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) Counsel for Grand Jury Witnesses.--\n       ``(1) In general.--\n       ``(A) Right of assistance.--Each witness subpoenaed to \n     appear and testify before a grand jury in a district court, \n     or to produce books, papers, documents, or other objects \n     before that grand jury, shall be allowed the assistance of \n     counsel during such time as the witness is questioned in the \n     grand jury room.\n       ``(2) Powers and duties of counsel.--A counsel retained by \n     or appointed for a witness under paragraph (1)--\n       ``(A) shall be allowed to be present in the grand jury room \n     only during the questioning of the witness and only to advise \n     the witness;\n       ``(B) shall not be permitted to address the attorney for \n     the government or any grand juror, or otherwise participate \n     in the proceedings before the grand jury; and\n       ``(C) shall not represent more than 1 client in a grand \n     jury proceeding, if the exercise of the independent judgment \n     of the counsel on behalf of 1 or both clients will be, or is \n     likely to be, adversely affected by the representation of \n     another client.''\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to say a few things about \ngrand juries. I spent 15 years as a Federal prosecutor working with \ngrand juries on a regular basis. And people say, ``Oh, it's a secret \nproceeding.'' Well, would you rather have your witnesses have to go and \ntestify in open court?\n  You see, the purpose of a grand jury is simply to determine whether \nthere is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed and \nwhether the defendant probably committed it, to set that case for \ntrial. It is a protection. Some say, ``Well, just let the prosecutors \nindict and eliminate the grand jury because the grand jury will indict \na ham sandwich.'' I heard that here today. Grand juries will not indict \na ham sandwich.\n  You have to present evidence to them sufficient for them to \nunderstand the charge; and the evidence that is presented is before \nthey will return an indictment and set the case for trial. At trial, \nthe burden of proof is not ``probably committed a crime''; at trial the \nburden of proof is ``beyond a reasonable doubt''; to a moral certainty \nsometimes the judge charges the jury. So that is where the trial takes \nplace.\n  Now, I recall a line by Justice Macklin Fleming in California. He \nsaid, ``Perfect justice is not achievable in this life. In the pursuit \nof perfect justice, we destroy what justice is achievable.''\n  Well, I just say that an obsession with everything becoming more and \nmore complicated is not the history of our Nation and its criminal law. \nThe founders of our country realized you needed a trial and that people \nwho are accused of crimes ought to have a chance to present their \ndefense fully before a jury of 12 citizens, with their lawyer there to \nargue, debate, object, and do everything possible to defend that client \nin that trial, but there ought to be a vehicle to decide whether a case \nshould go forward. They decided it was better for the defendant and for \nthe witnesses when a charge is brought by virtue of a grand jury \ninvestigation before citizens of the community, if the testimony is \ntaken in secret, so that if the evidence is not sufficient, the public \nmay never even know that the individual was under investigation and his \nreputation would not be stained.\n  I submit to you that sometimes grand juries will not indict. And \nalso, in the course of an investigation, a prosecutor may discover, as \nhis witnesses are called and put under oath, that the good case he \nthought he might have had was not sufficient. Many times I have pulled \na case after presenting evidence before a grand jury because I was not \nconfident, and the grand jury wasn't confident, that there was enough \nevidence to proceed to indictment. Sometimes I presented grand jury \nindictments to a grand jury and thought there was evidence to indict \nand a grand jury declined to do so. That is the power and privilege \nthey have been given under our laws in this country.\n  Based on my experience, the grand jury system certainly is working. \nIt has served us well for 200 years. I think we ought not to, this late \nnight, without any debate or without any analysis or without any \nhearings, alter this historic principle, which I believe protects \ncitizens from embarrassment as well as unfounded charges.\n  I have to suggest and note for the Record, Mr. President, that the \nDepartment of Justice strongly opposes this Bumpers amendment. They \ndon't think it is the way we ought to be going now. I share that \nfeeling, and that shows that both I, as a Republican Senator, and the \nDepartment of Justice agree on this. I think we are making a big \nmistake to go forward at this time without having considered precisely \nwhat we are doing.\n  There are a number of important reasons. The chairman of the \nJudiciary\n\n[[Page S8648]]\n\nCommittee has stated quite a number of those in his excellent legal \nway, demonstrating his legal skill and analysis of important issues \nthat come before us. He has made that point. I will not take any more \ntime on it. I feel very, very strongly about this issue. I think it \nwould be a colossal error for this body, without any hearings, to \nchange this historic principle, because I will tell you, it will tie \nthe grand jury in knots. You will have another adversarial hearing. You \nwill have two trials instead of one. It will not further the \nascertainment of truth, which is the purpose and nature of a grand \njury.\n  I know others need to talk, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment of the Senator from \nArkansas. It embodies a historical principle that has been embedded in \nmost of our psyches and consciousness, which is that an individual has \na right to counsel--particularly an individual involved in the criminal \njustice system has a right to counsel.\n\n  Our good friend from Utah says, well, someone appearing before a \ngrand jury can leave the room and get counsel. Indeed, he knows of \ncases, as do I, where somebody who is in front of a grand jury leaves \nthe room after every question to go outside the door and talk to an \nattorney.\n  What is the common sense of requiring somebody who is entitled to \ncounsel not to be able to get that counsel inside the grand jury room? \nWhat is the common sense of forcing somebody in front of the jury to \nleave at the end of each question--leave the grand jury room to go talk \nto his or her attorney? How does that meet the ends of either common \nsense or justice--to force that rigmarole, that process, when we come \nto something as fundamental and basic as the right to counsel?\n  I don't think anyone here questions that there is a right to counsel \nunder our Constitution. The question is, Why not then permit that right \nto be exercised inside the grand jury room? Why not permit the advice \nto be given to somebody inside the grand jury room, rather than to \nforce that person at the end of each question to say, ``Excuse me, I \nwant to go outside the grand jury room to consult with my counsel''?\n  The only argument that I have heard against permitting that is that, \nsomehow or other, that would tie a grand jury in knots, as our good \nfriend from Alabama just said. But under this amendment, that is not \npossible, because under this amendment, as modified, it carries out the \noriginal language of this amendment, which says that, ``A counsel for a \nwitness shall be allowed to be present in the grand jury room only \nduring the questioning of the witness and only to advise the witness, \nand shall not be permitted to address the attorney for the government, \nor any grand juror, or otherwise participate in the proceedings before \nthe grand jury.''\n  That is it. This amendment would only permit the attorney, which \nevery person under this Constitution has a right to at least hire, to \ngive advice to a citizen inside the grand jury room instead of forcing \nthat person to leave each time. I think it is a modest amendment. It is \na modest amendment because it makes sure that we will not tie up a \ngrand jury in knots. It is a modest amendment because it only says that \nwhat we know is right, that someone ought to have a right to counsel \nwhen they become involved in the criminal justice system--something \nthat we know is right and something that we know is guaranteed, which \nis the right to counsel, to be exercised in a sensible way, in a way \nthat doesn't undercut and diminish that very right.\n  To be forced to leave the grand jury room after each question, in \nfront of that grand jury, it seems to me, undermines the very right to \ncounsel which is guaranteed in the Constitution. But, at a minimum, we, \nit seems to me, as people who want to defend this Constitution, should \nsay, if there is a right--and there is one--that it ought to be \nexercisable in a commonsense way.\n  In 90 percent of the grand jury proceedings, the witnesses are law \nenforcement officers or other governmental officials who are not likely \neven to have an attorney or want an attorney. But in those other 10 \npercent of the cases, it seems to me only fair, only common sense, to \navoid the absurdity of making a witness leave the grand jury room after \nevery question in order to exercise a constitutional right to the \nadvice of counsel.\n  I want to close by emphasizing the words of this amendment, because I \nthink they are very important: ``The counsel that a witness is allowed \nto have in the grand jury room under this amendment is present only \nduring the questioning of the witness and''--these are the key words--\n``only to advise the witness and not to address the attorney for the \ngovernment or address any grand juror, or to otherwise participate in \nthe proceedings before the grand jury.''\n  Many of our States allow the attorney to be inside of the grand jury \nroom. Some States do, some States don't. But we have to make up our own \nminds as to what makes the most sense in this Federal system. It seems \nto me the most fundamental form of common sense. Forcing a person to \nget up, walk through the door, and leave the room to talk to someone, I \nbelieve, diminishes and undermines the very fundamental right that \npeople have to the advice of counsel.\n  So there is no tying up in knots in this amendment.\n  This amendment precludes any possibility that an attorney inside the \ngrand jury room will address the court, will address the grand jurors, \nwill address the prosecutor. All that is permitted under this \namendment, and all that is required under this amendment, is that the \ncounsel for the witness be allowed to be present in the grand jury \nroom, and only to advise his or her client.\n  I want to commend the Senator from Arkansas for his extraordinary \ncourage and, as always, his eloquence in presenting a case.\n  I think that if we will all think about this basic right overnight, \nhopefully the majority of this body will do what at least a number of \nStates have done, and that is to permit the attorney to be inside the \ngrand jury room solely for the purpose of advising the witness.\n  I thank the good Senator for his leadership.\n\n\n                      technical assistance funding\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, one of the most significant economic \nproblems facing Alaska is the underdevelopment of the business sector \nin our rural areas. Alaska's vast size, lack of highway infrastructure, \nand numerous small, remote communities present unique problems \nrequiring unique solutions. If we want to empower people to move from \nassistance to self-sufficiency we have to grow small businesses in \nrural Alaska. During the conference on the Commerce, Justice and State \nappropriations bill, I will ask the conferees to address these issues.\n  Specifically, my State is suffering from an acute shortage of \ntechnical assistance funding to provide training and other services \nspecific to rural needs. This is a need that can be satisfied under \nSBA's 7(j) program. Additionally, I am informed that regulations \npromulgated in 1995 have virtually eliminated all small business \nlending by banks and other financial institutions in Alaska under SBA's \n7(a) lending program. Before 1995, the 7(a) program provided critical \nfinancing in rural Alaska, and I intend to explore ways to make the \nprogram viable once again in Alaska. Finally, Alaska's size and \nremoteness will require SBA to adopt high-tech solutions to facilitate \nservice delivery. I will seek to create an electronic assistance center \nwithin the SBA specifically designed to provide Internet connectivity, \noutreach and training to rural areas specifically in Alaska.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Gregg and his staff and others \non this issue. It will be within the scope of the conference, I \nbelieve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/21/senate-section/article/S8639-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8648-S8652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IDAHO'S VERY HIGH PERFORMANCE BACKBONE NETWORK SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss Idaho's Very \nHigh Performance Backbone Network system (vBNS).\n  The State of Idaho is in a strategic position to increase its \neconomic base by strengthening collaboration on research and \ndevelopment projects between the state's universities, state government \nand business and industry.\n\n[[Page S8649]]\n\nThe U of I was approved, pursuant to a July 31, 1997, submission, for \nconnection to the National Science Foundation's very high performance \nBackbone Network Service (vBNS). The proposed statewide network would \nconnect the University of Idaho with Idaho State University, Boise \nState University, state government and industrial partners such as \nMicron and Hewlett-Packard. For appropriate research purposes, this \nIntranet could connect through the UI to the vBNS. The Intranet could \nalso be used for distance learning, conferencing, collaborative and \nother related purposes.\n  With an Idaho Intranet, Idaho educators will have access to the next \ngeneration of teaching/learning tools and materials available under \nInternet2 (I2), to be used for K-12 and higher education. It will \nsupport continuing professorial education, as well as industry \nworkforce development, training and re-training.\n  With the Idaho Intranet, Idaho businesses will be able to take \nadvantage of the advanced networking capabilities that is the goal of \nthe I2 program. The Intranet would provide a tremendous opportunity to \nstrengthen Idaho's rural economic base. The state's businesses will \nhave access to ground floor participation in the next level of internet \ncommerce. Abilene and vBNS will provide access to early product \ndevelopment, testing and market entry. Access to virtual conferencing \nwould give businesses like Jerome Cheese Company in Jerome, Idaho, the \nopportunity to be in ``real-time'' video contact with its customers in \nTokyo, Japan.\n  Also, the Idaho Intranet will help telemedicine become a reality, \nimproving rural healthcare and helping to address the shortage of \ndoctors in rural Idaho. Idaho ranks last in the nation in numbers of \ndoctors serving rural population healthcare needs--the national average \nis 93 physicians per 100,000 people. Idaho stands at 63 per 100,000, a \nthird less than the national average, according to a recent study. We \nmust change that and the Intranet will help.\n  With this funding, the state's schools, colleges and businesses will \nhave access to the I2 to test new products and materials. The UI WWAMI \nprogram, for example, is developing an advanced web site with videos of \nanimal anatomy that will allow students to learn about anatomy without \nusing live animals. Current internet technology is not adequate to \nhandle the amount of information placed on the site, but I2 access will \nmake it a viable educational tool available around the state.\n  The result of an Idaho Intranet will be not only research and \nlearning opportunities, but job creation and business competitiveness \nfor the state of Idaho, and improved quality of life for the people of \nIdaho. It is for this reason, Mr. President, that I ask for the \nSenate's support for this project.\n\n\n                             idaho intranet\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nfloor manager of the bill a question. Potentially, one of the most \nimportant programs funded under the Commerce, State and Justice \nappropriations bill is the Information Infrastructure Grants program. \nThis grants program recognizes the need for assistance to ensure that \nthe American public has full access to and benefits from the \ntechnological advances that are taking place in telecommunications and \nnetworking. Certainly, the new universal service provisions will make \nmany contributions to the K-12 education community, the library \ncommunity and the health care community. But, there are also a number \nof other telecommunications and networking activities which could be of \nparticular benefit, especially in some of the more rural states, such \nas mine.\n  In my home State of Idaho, for example, the University of Idaho \nrecently was awarded a vBNS high speed connections grant by the \nNational Science Foundation and accepted an invitation to participate \nin the Internet2 program. This will give our university researchers \naccess to databases throughout the nation and world, allow for remote \nuse of scientific instruments and set the stage for many new \ncollaborations. The UI has proposed establishing an Idaho Intranet to \nensure that the people of rural Idaho will be able to benefit from the \nresulting access to education, medical information, and business \nopportunities, which are anticipated as a result of the advanced \nnetworking capacity.\n  I believe the distinguished floor manager and his subcommittee have \nreviewed the information infrastructure grants program in some detail \nand believe it has a particular role to play in our telecommunications \nand networking efforts.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, that is true. In fact, in the report, the Committee \nidentified several projects in rural states around the country and \nencouraged the NTIA to give particular attention to these requests for \nfunding assistance under the IIG program.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. Speaker, the UI's proposal would give rural \nIdahoans, who must deal with the lowest physician to patient ratio in \nthe nation, access to better health care. It would give my state's \nrural economy a boost with real-time access to its customers. It would \nprovide key communications links between the state's education \ninstitutions, businesses and state governments. Would you agree that \nthe University of Idaho's proposal, to establish an Idaho Intranet and \nprovide access to the benefits of the information and technology to be \navailable under programs such as the vBNS and Abilene, is consistent \nwith the Committee's proposals under the Information Infrastructure \nGrants program?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, I would agree that the NTIA should give the same \nconsideration to the UI's proposal as to the listed proposals.\n\n\n                       coordinated drug strategy\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would ask to engage the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Gregg, and the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, in a \nbrief colloquy regarding a portion of the report which accompanies the \nbill, directing the Attorney General to develop a 5-year \ninterdepartmental drug control strategy. Both Senator Biden and I \nbelieve that this provision may be misinterpreted, and I request the \nSenator's assistance in providing some clarification. As a general \nmatter, I have long believed that an effective national drug strategy \ncan best be developed and implemented if we have one responsible \nofficial charged with that duty.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I agree. And, as both my colleagues know, the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was established by Congress in \n1988 for precisely the purpose of coordinating the federal government's \nanti-drug program.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is true, but the report language seems to suggest \nthat the Attorney General assume some of these responsibilities. Is \nthis how the Committee meant for its guidance to be interpreted?\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate both Senators' concerns on this subject. \nAlthough I see how it might be possible to read this into the \nCommittee's Report, this is not the Committee's intent. The Department \nof Justice, like all Executive Agencies, is to develop a meaningful \nstrategic plan and performance measures under the Government \nPerformance and Results Act (GPRA). In so doing, the Committee wants to \nbe certain that these GPRA efforts are consistent with the National \nDrug Control Strategy and the ONDCP's Performance Measures of \nEffectiveness System (PME). The Department of Justice must demonstrate \nhow its own drug programs contribute to the achievement of outcomes \narticulated in the ONDCP's PME system. To ensure this, the Attorney \nGeneral must work closely with ONDCP on the further implementation of \nthe National Drug Control Strategy and PME system, particularly by \nlinking its drug control budget resources to the outcomes articulated \nby the PME system. The Justice Department should also consult with \nother departments with expertise in particular drug control areas, to \nthe extent that it needs assistance in meeting PME system goals.\n  Mr. HATCH. As the sponsor, along with the Senator from Delaware, of \nlegislation pending on the floor which would reauthorize the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy, and maintain its duty to formulate and \nimplement the National Drug Control Strategy and Performance Measures \nof Effectiveness System, I agree that the Department of Justice should \nassist ONDCP in these important tasks.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I concur.\n  Mr. HATCH. So, if I correctly understand the Senator from New \nHampshire, it is not then the Committee's\n\n[[Page S8650]]\n\nintent to place the Attorney General in charge of formulating the \nNational Drug Control Strategy?\n  Mr. GREGG. No, quite the contrary. ONDCP is to continue in its \nimportant work, and the Department of Justice is to provide ONDCP with \nsuch assistance as it may need to develop and implement the National \nDrug Control Strategy and the Performance Measures of Effectiveness \nSystem.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator for clarifying the Committee's intent \non this important issue.\n  Mr. HATCH. I also thank the Senator from New Hampshire for addressing \nmy concerns on this issue.\n\n\n                    graveyard of the atlantic museum\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I wish to enter into a colloquy with Senator Gregg in \norder to clarify a spending item in the pending Commerce, Justice, \nState Appropriations bill.\n  I commend the Chairman on this bill, and for his attention to \nproviding funding to the Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum, a public, \nnonprofit, educational institution, designed for Hatteras Island, one \nof North Carolina's Outer Bank islands. The Museum is dedicated to the \npreservation, advancement and presentation of the maritime history and \nshipwrecks of the Outer Banks, from 1524 until the present.\n  Over three million tourists visit the Outer Banks each year, the vast \nmajority of them interstate visitors. It is expected that approximately \n100,000 tourists would visit the Museum, thus paying the full cost of \nrunning it, since a modest fee would be charged.\n  The Museum has received federal, state, local and private funding in \nthe past. Earlier this decade, Congress appropriated $800,000 from \nNOAA's construction budget towards this project.\n  I wish to clarify that the bill's provision of $1,500,000 from NOAA's \nfacilities budget to the ``Outer Banks Community Foundation on the \ncondition that these funds are matched by a non-Federal source'' is \nintended solely to be passed through to the Museum.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct, and I appreciate my colleague from North \nCarolina bringing this matter to my attention. I look forward to \nworking with him until this worthy project is completed.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the distinguished Chairman is aware of \nthe importance of weather forecasting support for the 2002 Winter \nOlympics in Salt Lake City. I appreciate the continued support of the \nCommittee with these important preparations for the 2002 Winter \nOlympics. Millions of spectators will gather in mountain venues. \nObviously, accurate and timely weather forecasting support is critical \nto ensure the safety of both the spectators and the athletes. As you \nknow, the Committee directs the National Weather Service to provide \nsupport to the NOAA Cooperative Institute at the University of Utah. It \nis my understanding that the committee expects the National Weather \nService to work with the Cooperative Institute to develop a plan and \nbudget which will help ensure public safety and assist with the \noperations of the Games. The 2002 Winter Games represents an excellent \nopportunity for the National Weather Service and the Cooperative \nInstitute to work with private meteorological firms and federal, state, \nand local agencies to provide accurate weather forecasting for the \nGames.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Utah is correct in his understanding. The \nCommittee appreciates the importance of the involvement of the National \nWeather Service in preparing for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3244\n\n (Purpose: To amend section 40102 of title 49, United States Code, to \n        modify the definition of the term ``public aircraft.'')\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Bumpers amendment will \nbe set aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] for himself and Mr. \n     DeWine, proposes an amendment numbered 3244.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2  . PUBLIC AIRCRAFT.\n\n       The flush sentence following subparagraph (B)(ii) of \n     section 40102(37) of title 49, United States Code, is amended \n     by striking ``if the unit of government on whose behalf the \n     operation is conducted certifies to the Administrator of the \n     Federal Aviation Administration that the operation was \n     necessary to respond to a significant and imminent threat to \n     life or property (including natural resources) and that no \n     service by a private operator was reasonably available to \n     meet the threat'' and inserting ``if the operation is \n     conducted for law enforcement, search and rescue, or \n     responding to an imminent threat to property or natural \n     resources''.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this evening I rise to offer an amendment \nwith my distinguished colleague, Senator DeWine. This amendment is \nintended to assist law enforcement in doing a better job of protecting \nour citizens and the public safety.\n  The background of this amendment goes back to 1994. Congress made \nwhat I think was an error when it passed Public Law 103-411. Under this \nlaw, aircraft belonging to law enforcement agencies are considered to \nbe ``commercial'' if costs incurred from flying missions to support \nneighboring jurisdictions are reimbursed.\n  Unfortunately, this law has placed unnecessary restrictions and \ncostly burdens on Government agencies which operate public aircraft, \nparticularly law enforcement agencies. The law restricts those agencies \nfrom using their aircraft resources in assistance of Government \nagencies and severely limits their ability to recover costs from those \nagencies which they are assisting. This law even limits the ability of \nneighboring jurisdictions to enter into mutual aid agreements.\n  Let me give a typical example of how the current law is operating. In \nmy State of Florida, it is not uncommon to have one medium-sized county \nwhich is surrounded by a number of smaller jurisdictions. That medium-\nsized county has the capability to make an application and secure \nsurplus Government property, frequently a helicopter. That helicopter \nis used in a variety of public safety and law enforcement activities, \noften under the jurisdiction of the local sheriff. It may be that one \nof those smaller counties has a need for a helicopter or other aviation \nsupport.\n  An example of that is, in the northern part of our State we have had \ninstances in which locally grown marijuana has become a serious law \nenforcement problem. In order to identify that marijuana and \neffectively eradicate it, the helicopter is an enormous law enforcement \nasset. Yet, under the current law, if the sheriff from that smaller \ncommunity wishes to contract, either on an individual case basis or \nthrough a mutual aid agreement, with that medium-sized county to get a \ncertain number of hours of utilization of the helicopter and they agree \nto reimburse the medium-sized county for the cost of that operation, \nthey are in violation of the conditions under which the medium-sized \ncounty secured the helicopter in the first place and sanctions might be \nimposed upon the medium-sized county's sheriff and their capacity to \nprovide effective law enforcement for their smaller neighboring \ncommunities.\n  At the very time when law enforcement faces the growing \nsophistication and organization of criminals, the Federal Government \nshould not be placing increased mandates on our law enforcement \nofficials. Today, law enforcement officials are forced to call around \nand check the availability of a private pilot and commercial aircraft \nbefore sending out the helicopter of that medium-sized county. Only if \nno one is available can law enforcement officials respond to the scene.\n  Under this amendment, public agencies would be permitted to recover \ncosts incurred by operating aircraft to assist other jurisdictions for \nthe purposes of law enforcement, search and rescue, or imminent threat \nto property or natural resources.\n  I might say, we just have had a dramatic example of that threat to \nproperty or natural resources in the number of wildfires we have \nexperienced across our State, many of them occurring in precisely these \nsmaller counties that are limited in their capability to respond.\n  Mr. President, law enforcement organizations are strongly supporting \nthis amendment. This legislation has been endorsed by the National \nSheriffs Association, the Airborne Law Enforcement\n\n[[Page S8651]]\n\nAssociation, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the \nFlorida Sheriffs Association, and the California State Sheriffs \nAssociation.\n  Some months ago, sheriffs from throughout the country contacted my \noffice seeking help. From my home State of Florida, I have heard from \nSheriff Stephen M. Oelrich of Alachua County. Sheriff Oelrich stated, \n``Public Law 103-411 restricts the ability of a law enforcement \naviation unit to assist Government jurisdictions or other governmental \nagencies. Instead, it mandates that a local government must first turn \nto a costly private operator for air service.''\n  This is by no means a problem in my State of Florida alone. I have \nheard this from sheriffs across the country. Specifically, we have a \nresolution from the sheriffs of California.\n  In the words of Sheriff Larry Carpenter of Ventura County CA, Public \nLaw 103-411 has had ``a chilling effect on the ability of local \ngovernments to provide safe, cost-effective and professional air \nsupport capabilities to the very citizens we serve.'' Let me further \nquote from an article that Sheriff Carpenter wrote in the Summer 1996 \nissue of California Sheriff:\n\n       The issue of ``compensation'' fuels this issue to a large \n     degree. According to the FAA interpretation of this law, a \n     sheriff cannot simply recover costs for flying a governmental \n     mission . . . which is ``outside a common treasury.'' This \n     flies in the face of mutual aid agreements between public \n     safety agencies. For example, let's say the Santa Barbara \n     Sheriff's Department, which has no aviation unit, contacts my \n     aviation unit and requests our helicopter fly an observation \n     and surveillance flight of a suspected drug lab which their \n     narcotics and SWAT teams plan to raid in a few days. We fly \n     the mission, undoubtedly with the Santa Barbara deputy \n     sheriff on board, and charge Santa Barbara County only our \n     cost. There is no profit involved. Obviously, this is a \n     sensitive law enforcement mission. Public Law 103-411 says we \n     can no longer do this. Instead, a private operator would need \n     to be contracted at a higher cost to taxpayers.\n\n  This is only common sense that instead of restricting the ability of \nlocal law enforcement agencies to assist each other, we should be \nfacilitating their ability to serve the public good in as efficient and \neconomical manner as possible.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that support from the \nCalifornia State Sheriffs' Association, from the Western States \nSheriffs' Association, from the Airborne Law Enforcement Association, \nfrom the National Sheriffs' Association, and from the Florida Sheriffs \nAssociation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the California State Sheriffs' Association has \n     many members who manage public service aviation operations; \n     and\n       Whereas, Sheriffs' Aviation operations are critical to \n     their ability to provide life-saving service to their \n     constituents; and\n       Whereas, in 1994 Congress passed and the President signed \n     Public Law 103-411, which severely restricted Sheriffs' \n     ability to effectively utilize their aircraft in their \n     mission; and\n       Whereas, the ostensible purpose for enactment of Public Law \n     103-411 was the promotion of aviation safety and that Public \n     Law 103-411 accomplished no appreciable aviation safety \n     purpose; and\n       Whereas, restrictions on the sharing of aviation resources \n     result in reduced public safety and are poor fiscal and \n     public policy; and\n       Whereas, the California State Sheriffs' Association, in \n     cooperation with the National Sheriffs' Association, the \n     International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Western \n     State Sheriffs' Association, the National Association of \n     State Foresters, the Airborne Law Enforcement Association, \n     and many other State Sheriffs' Associations support \n     amendments to Public Law 103-411 to correct the law's \n     deficiencies; and\n       Whereas, Representative Elton Gallegly of California has \n     sponsored a bill in Congress and that bill is H.R. 1521, the \n     Public Services Aviation Act of 1997, now therefore; be it\n       Resolved, That the California State Sheriffs' Association \n     supports the passage and enactment of H.R. 1521, the Public \n     Services Aviation Act of 1997 or its equivalent; and be it \n     also further\n       Resolved, That the California State Sheriffs' Association \n     executive director or her designee be authorized to transmit \n     a copy of this resolution to all interested parties \n     including, but not limited to California's congressional \n     delegation, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senate Leader Trent \n     Lott and the Members of the House Committee on Transportation \n     and Infrastructure.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       The Western States Sheriffs' Association represents over \n     200 Sheriffs of the eleven western states. This association \n     exists to promote the professionalism and dedication of law \n     enforcement and works to ensure that the public we serve \n     receives the best in public safety services.\n       Public Law 103-311 became law in April of 1995. This \n     measure has negatively impacted may publicly operated \n     aviation units around the United States. For years, these \n     units have provided safe, effective and life-saving services \n     to the public.\n       Public Law 103-411 sought to increase the level of \n     regulation among aviation units which operate surplus \n     military aircraft. Public Law 103-411 fails to enhance safety \n     regulations in any significant way. The regulations now in \n     place serve only to increase the marketplace of commercial \n     aviation operators who have chosen to conduct government \n     business. Profit has been prioritized over public safety.\n       The Western States Sheriff's Association (WSSA) has \n     recognized that Public Law 103-411, and the interpretation of \n     this law by the Federal Aviation Administration, are not in \n     the best interests of the American public. Further, it is \n     recognized that several public safety aviation associations \n     have formed task groups, networked, and made all efforts at \n     initiating regulatory reform that is effective and meets the \n     needs of the FAA in safety reporting and regulation.\n       The Western States Sheriffs' Association resolves that \n     Public Law 103-411 is in need of serious review and/or \n     immediate repeal. It is the view of the WSSA that the \n     specific legislative relief suggested by the Aviation \n     Committee of the National Sheriff's Association provides the \n     most realistic solution to this issue.\n       Aviation public safety members and representatives remain \n     eager to work with any group to enhance the fair regulation \n     and safety of publicly operated aviation units, while at the \n     same time ensuring the legitimate duties of government to \n     provide the most effective, cost efficient and professional \n     aviation services to the public.\n       Therefore be it resolved, This 30th day of November, 1995, \n     that the Western States Sheriffs' Association at their annual \n     meeting in Mesquite, Nevada go on record in support of \n     legislation that would modify Public Law 183-411 as set forth \n     in this Resolution or to repeal the law in its entirety.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the Airborne Law Enforcement Association has as a \n     majority of its members persons who are employed in all \n     aspects of law enforcement aviation operations; and\n       Whereas, those law enforcement aviation operations are a \n     critically essential component of modern law enforcement, \n     especially as they relate to reducing crime, protecting and \n     saving lives, and apprehending dangerous criminals; and\n       Whereas, in 1994 the United States Congress passed and the \n     President signed Public Law 103-411, severely restricting \n     United States law enforcement's ability to effectively \n     utilize aircraft in legitimate law enforcement missions; and\n       Whereas, the stated purpose for enactment of P.L. 103-411 \n     was the promotion of aviation safety and P.L. 103-411 \n     accomplished no appreciable aviation safety purpose; and\n       Whereas, restrictions on the sharing of aviation resources \n     imposed by P.L. 103-411 has resulted in reduced public safety \n     and is poor fiscal and public policy; and\n       Whereas, the Airborne Law Enforcement Association, in \n     cooperation with the International Association of Chiefs of \n     Police, the National Sheriffs' Association and many other \n     similar associations, supports legislation which would \n     correct the deficiencies of P.L. 103-411; and\n       Whereas, Representative Elton Gallegly of California has \n     sponsored a bill in Congress and that bill is H.R. 1521, the \n     Public Services Aviation Act of 1997; and\n       Whereas, at its Annual Meeting on July 19, 1997, the ALEA \n     general membership by unanimous vote authorized the Board of \n     Directors to issue a Resolution in support of H.R. 1521: \n     Therefore be it:\n       Resolved, That the Airborne Law Enforcement Association \n     supports passage and enactment of H.R. 1521, the Public \n     Services Aviation Act of 1997; and be it:\n       Resolved, That the Airborne Law Enforcement Association, \n     failing passage and enactment of H.R. 1521, the Public \n     Service Aviation Act of 1997, supports passage and enactment \n     of legislation equivalent to H.R. 1521, the Public Services \n     Aviation Act of 1997;

Mr. President, the Senate-reported Commerce, Justice, \nState, and the Judiciary Appropriations bill, S. 2260, represents the \nexcellent work of my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, \nSubcommittee Chairman Gregg. It is a difficult task to balance the \ncompeting program requirements funded in this bill, and he and his \nstaff are to be commended for their efforts to present a sound and \nequitable measure for the Senate's consideration.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill totals $33.2 billion in budget \nauthority and $31.8 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1999.\n  The bill is within the revised Senate Subcommittee's Section 302(b) \nallocation for both budget authority and outlays. It is $10 million in \nbudget authority and $6 million in outlays below the 302(b) allocation. \nIt is $1.4 billion in budget authority and $2.6 billion in outlays \nabove the 1998 level.\n  I today submit a table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of \nthis bill.\n  It is a pleasure serving on the Appropriations Subcommittee with \nChairman Gregg.

Mr. President, in my most recent statements before this \nChamber about the Social Security system, I have taken time to discuss \nits history and the looming crisis, that it will shatter the retirement \ndreams of our hard-working Americans.\n  Mr. President, in my most recent statements before this chamber about \nthe Social Security system, I discussed its history and the looming \ncrisis that will shatter the retirement dreams of hard-working \nAmericans. Tonight, I would like to discuss Social Security from a \ndifferent perspective, by turning our focus away from the coming crisis \nto look at the steps other nations have taken to improve their own \nretirement systems. I realize that it may be hard to look outside \nourselves for possible solutions to the problems our Social Security \nsystem is facing--after all, we are a nation that is typically at the \nforefront of innovation. But if we set aside our pride, we can learn \nvolumes about the viable international options before us.\n  Retirement security programs throughout the world will face a serious \nchallenge in the 21st century due to a massive demographic change that \nis now taking place. The World Bank recently warned that, across the \nglobe, ``old-age systems are in serious financial trouble and are not \nsustainable in their present form.'' Europe, Japan, and the U.S. share \nthe identical problem of postwar demographic shifts that cannot sustain \nmassively expensive social welfare programs. How to meet this challenge \nis critical to providing retirement security while maintaining \nsustainable, global, economic growth.\n  The crisis awaiting our Social Security system is nearly as serious \nas that faced by the European Union and Japan. What is equally serious \nis that, while many other countries have moved far ahead of us in \ntaking steps to reform their old-age retirement systems, Congress has \nyet to focus on this problem. Some of the international efforts are \nextremely successful; those reforms may offer useful models as we \nexplore solutions to our Social Security system.\n  Currently, there are three basic models being implemented abroad that \ndeserve our attention. The ``Latin American'' model primarily follows \nChile's experience. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment model, or ``OECD,'' is underway in the United Kingdom, \nAustralia, Switzerland, and Denmark. There is even a third model--the \n``Notional Account\" model--that has been adopted in countries such as \nSweden, Italy, Latvia, China, and is on the verge of adoption in \nPoland.\n  These models have differences, and the nations implementing them have \ndifferences as well--economic, political, and demographic. But they all \nshare a common theme and were born out of the same fiscal crisis that \nis facing the United States within the next decade. Like the U.S., each \nof these countries has an aging population, and--before the reforms--\nhad an inability to meet the future retirement needs of their \nworkforce. So in an effort to avoid economic devastation for their \npeople and their nation as a whole, they undertook various reforms that \nare proving to be a win-win for both current and future retirees.\n  How did they do it? And what lessons can we--as policy leaders--take \nfrom their experiences and apply here at home as we grapple with the \nshortcomings of our own retirement system? These are some of the \nquestions I will address today in my remarks. The bottom line is that \neach nation faced the key challenges of taking care of those already \nretired or about to reach retirement age, ensuring that future retirees \nbenefitted from the changes, and finding an affordable means of funding \nthe transition from a pay-as-you-go government retirement system to a \nfuture financing mechanism.\n  Mr. President, I'll begin with the Latin American model and in \nparticular, focus on Chile's experiences. Back in the late 1970s, Chile \nrealized that its publicly financed pay-as-you-go retirement system \nwould soon be unable to meet its retirement promises. After a national \ndebate and extensive outreach, the Chilean government approved a law to \nfully replace its system with a system of personalized Pension Savings \nAccounts by 1980. Nearly two decades later, pensions in Chile are \nbetween 50 to 100 percent higher than they were under the old \ngovernment system. Real wages have increased, personal savings rates \nhave nearly tripled, and the economy has grown at a rate nearly double \nwhat it had prior to the change.\n  Under the Chilean plan, Pension Savings Accounts, or PSAs, were \ncreated to replace the old system and operate much like a mutual fund. \nLike the old government plan, PSAs were to provide workers with \napproximately 70 percent of their lifetime working income. That is \nwhere the similarities between Chile's old and improved retirement \nprograms ends.\n  When Chile created the PSA system, the existing system of having \nworkers and employers pay social security taxes to the government was \ncompletely eliminated. Instead, workers began to make a mandatory \ncontribution in the amount of 10 percent of their income to their own \nPSA. The old employer taxes were then available to workers in the form \nof higher wages. Through this evolution from the old, hidden labor tax \non workers to the new PSA system, workers saw real gross wages increase \nby five percent. Furthermore, it reduced the cost of labor--and the \neconomy prospered.\n  Under the PSA system, a worker has great control over his or her \nretirement savings account. First, the worker has the ability to choose \nwho will manage their fund from a pool of government-regulated \ncompanies known as ``AFPs.'' This provides the worker with the ability \nto move between managers, while maintaining protections from serious \nlosses resulting from undiversified risk portfolios, theft, or fraud. \nThe resulting competition between AFPs results in lower fees for \nworkers, higher returns averaging 12 percent annually, and better \nservice --something that rarely occurs with government plans.\n  Second, each worker is empowered to ensure the level of retirement \nincome they desire. Armed with a passbook and account statements, these \nworkers have the information necessary to follow their earnings growth \nand decide how to adjust their tax-free voluntary contributions in \norder to yield a specific annual income upon their retirement. For \nexample, the Chilean system was established to provide an annual income \nequivalent to 70 percent of lifetime income. However, under the PSA \nsystem, income is averaging 78 percent.\n  Third, workers can choose from two payout options upon retirement. A \nworker can leave his or her funds in the PSA and take programmed \nwithdrawals from the account with the only limitation based upon \nprojected lifetime expectancy. Should the retiree die prior to \nexhausting the PSA fund, any excess amount is transferred to his or her \nestate. The other scenario allows a worker to use the PSA funds to \npurchase an annuity from a private insurance company. These annuities \nguarantee a monthly income as well, and is indexed for inflation. In \nthe event of death, survivor benefits are provided to the workers' \ndependents. They build an estate for their heirs.\n  And finally, PSA accounts are not automatically forfeited to the \ngovernment in the case of premature death or\n\n[[Page S8654]]\n\ndisability of a worker. Under the Chilean system, the fund managers \nprovide an insurance protection through private insurance companies. \nThe fee is in addition to the 10 percent mandatory savings \ncontribution, and ensures the PSA funds are not lost should a worker \nnot reach full retirement age.\n  Personal accounts have brought personal freedom to Chile's retirement \nsystem. Today, more than 93 percent of the workforce participates in \nthe PSAs, which boast an accumulated investment fund of $30 billion. \nThis is remarkable when you consider Chile is a developing nation of 14 \nmillion people with a GDP of $70 billion. Chile's success has paved the \nway for other Latin American countries such as Argentina, Peru, and \nColumbia and has sparked the momentum for reform in Mexico, Bolivia, \nand El Salvador.\n  While individual accounts are proving successful in Latin America, \nthe OECD model utilizes a ``group'' choice approach as a key element. \nRather than allowing an individual to choose his or her own fund \nmanager, the employer or union trustee chooses for the company or \noccupational group as a whole. This approach most likely developed from \nthe fact that these reforms were politically easier to ``add-on'' to \nthe existing government pay-as-you-go pension tier. Furthermore, reform \nleaders worked closely with union leaders when they began to implement \nthe next tier of private plans, and then moved the reform sector by \nsector.\n  The movement began during the 1980s in the United Kingdom. Since the \nend of World War II, the British had a basic, flat rate, non-means \ntested government pension for all who paid into the national insurance \nplan. By the 1970s, a new tier was added to bridge a gap between those \ncovered by private pensions and those without them. This State Earnings \nRelated Pension Scheme, or SERPS, promised--in exchange for a payroll \ntax--an earnings-based pension of 25 percent of the best 20 years of \nearnings, in addition to the Basic State Pension.\n  However, like other nations, the government pension plan was facing \nbankruptcy and reform was critical to the future security of its \nworkers and of the nation as a whole. Under the leadership of Social \nSecurity Secretary Peter Lilley, the British system evolved and began \nto enable individuals to choose the option of a new, self-financing \nprivate pension plan.\n\n  Under the British plan, current retirees were protected, but current \nworkers were given a choice of pension plans. Those workers had the \noption of either staying in the SERPS program or contracting out to a \nprivate fund. If a worker chose to remain within SERPS, they would \nreceive a reduced pension amounting to 20 percent of their best 20 \nyears of earnings. However, if a worker contracted out of the SERPS, \nthey were given the opportunity to participate in an occupational \npension plan, and were eventually allowed to take part in a new \nprivate, portable pension plan much like a 401(k).\n  To pay for the plan, a worker who chooses to contract out receives a \nrebate equivalent to a portion of their payroll taxes. This rebate \namounts to about 4.6 percent of earnings and must be invested in an \napproved plan. Additional contributions can be made--tax free--by \nemployers and employees up to a combined total limit of 17.5 percent of \nthe individual's income. As a safety net, companies are required to \nguarantee that workers who contract out will receive a pension at least \nequivalent to what they would have under SERPS, and are limited as to \nthe amount that can be invested in the employer's own company.\n  To address changing workforce trends and not hold workers captive to \nemployer plans, the British government created the ``appropriate \npersonal pension,'' or APP, plan which would be available to workers, \nas well as to the self-employed or unemployed. These fully portable \nplans are much like the employer plans, funded by the 4.6 percent \nrebate in payroll taxes, and are an alternative to the occupational \nplan or the SERPS. As an incentive, the British government offered an \nadditional ``payroll tax rebate'' above the standard rebate during the \nAPPs infancy. This made these fully portable APPs attractive options \nfor younger workers.\n  While there are many safeguards--including the ability for former \nSERPS workers to opt back into the government-run program--the success \nof the English system has been overwhelming. When the transformation \nbegan, analysts expected a participation rate of a half million \nworkers, growing to 1.75 million over time. Today, nearly 73 percent of \nthe workforce participates in private plans, boasting a total pool \nworth more than $1 trillion. The resulting economic growth and ability \nto control entitlement spending has analysts predicting the United \nKingdom will pay off its national debt by 2030. In case any of my \ncolleagues have forgotten, that is about the same time our Social \nSecurity trust fund is anticipated to go bankrupt.\n\n  Similarly, Australia has found much success in transforming its \ngovernment pay-as-you-go pension plan to a more self-directed plan. By \nthe 1980s, its existing retirement plan offered a full pension for all \nAustralians over age 69, although most qualified to begin drawing \nbenefits by age 60 for women and 65 for men. Like its international \nneighbors, Australia was facing a future financial situation that \nthreatened worker retirement security and Australia's standing in the \nglobal economy.\n  As Australia began to review its options, three goals emerged. \nWhatever changes were made, the new system had to provide more benefits \nfor future retirees than they would receive under the current plan; it \nhad to increase national savings, and any new plan had to reduce \nbudgetary pressures facing the system. By the mid-1980s, the Australian \ngovernment instituted a mandatory savings plan called ``superannuation \nfunds.'' In 1992, the program matured into a new Superannuation \nGuarantee that is still a work in progress.\n  During the transformation process, the Australian government took key \nsteps to change its course. First, it strengthened the income means-\ntesting for the old age pension. In doing so, the government also added \nan asset test in the calculations process. This was critical since the \ndependence on Social Security had contributed to the decline in \nnational savings. Second, the government made the new superannuation \nsavings portable, and instituted a penalty for withdrawals before age \n55. This provided new incentives for savings since workers could take \ntheir funds with them, and disincentives for spending one's nest egg \nprior to retirement. Third, the government took steps to build union \ninvestment into the savings program. Rather than giving workers wage \nincreases, negotiators reached an agreement to provide a 3-percent \ncontribution into a superannuation fund for all employees and called \nfor such guarantees to be built into all future labor contracts. \nFourth, the government expanded coverage of the superannuation fund to \nvirtually all workers, and every employer is required to contribute a \nset amount to the fund on the employees' behalf. The required amount is \ncurrently 3 percent and will grow to 9 percent by 2002.\n\n  Since the beginning of the Australian reform, additional changes have \noccurred. Today, workers have more choices between which superannuation \nfund their mandatory savings can be invested in. Additional tax relief \nhas been provided for voluntary savings, but savings are not tax-free \nwhen invested. As Australia reviews its overall tax structure, however, \nthere have been discussions about making contributions tax-free and \ndeferring taxation until the funds are withdrawn. Another key issue was \nthe total elimination of early withdrawal. Because a retirement safety \nnet remains in place, the goal here was to eliminate a worker from \n``double dipping''--collecting from the savings fund, then coming back \nto the government for a pension at age 65.\n  The Australian reforms are considered a successful example of the \nOECD model. And as more initiatives are implemented, it will likely \ncontinue to prove profitable for future retirees ``down under.''\n  The final example I would like to touch upon is the ``notional \naccount'' model--like the system in Sweden. Under this plan, workers \nreceive a passbook that reflects their defined contributions and the \ninterest being accumulated over time, but there are no real assets in \nthe account. The fund is just a ``notion'' of what it would be if it \nwere funded. In some respects, it\n\n[[Page S8655]]\n\nmight be compared to the Personal Earnings Benefit Statements U.S. \nworkers receive from the Social Security Administration. The up-side is \nthere is no transition cost for a nation to move from a government-run, \npay-as-you-go system to a notional pay-as-you-go system. The downside \nis that the funds remain at risk, as do future retirees. The bottom \nline here is that reforms have to be real if we are going to see any \nlong-term benefit for workers.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that whatever the specifics, reforms are \nbeing implemented abroad that are proving to be a great success for \nboth today's retirees and tomorrow's. I hope we have learned that we \nare not operating in a vacuum here--that there are real models out \nthere for us to review and consider.\n  For the United States to be successful in the reforms it undertakes \nto ensure retirement security, there are four key principles we must \nuphold. First, we must protect all current and near-term retirees. Our \ngovernment made a promise to them, and we must ensure any \ntransformation we pursue does not impact the decisions they have made \nfor their golden years.\n\n  Second, we must ensure that any proposal holds the promise of \nimproved benefits--and greater retirement security--for future \nretirees.\n  Today's younger generations have every right to be skeptical about \ngovernment promises to revamp a system they expect to go bankrupt. They \nneed to know there is a solution that provides retirement security for \nthem.\n  Third, any proposal should encourage personal choice by allowing \nindividuals to establish personal retirement accounts.\n  Fourth, the government must not turn to tax increases to fund our \npursuit of retirement security.\n  Finally, we must recognize that any change will require courage. We \nmust admit to ourselves we have a system that is fine today but is a \ntime bomb waiting to explode. The decisions ahead will not be easy; if \nthey were, they would have been made already. But the debate must begin \nsomewhere.\n  On August 14, this nation will recognize the 63rd anniversary of \nCongress' approval of the Social Security system. It is my hope that we \nwill mark the occasion by engaging in a national debate over how we can \ntransform our ailing system into a vibrant retirement program for \ngenerations to come.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, even though it has nothing to do with this \nbill, I would like to congratulate the Senator from Minnesota for his \ntruly superb analysis of the Social Security issue and especially the \ninformation he brings to this Senate relative to other countries that \nhave pursued reform of their pension programs.\n  There is no question but if there is a single issue of fiscal policy \nwhich most threatens this country's economic well-being in the future \nand, as a result, threatens our well-being today, it is the Social \nSecurity crisis. That occurs as a function of demographics; beginning \nin the year 2008, the Social Security system in this country pays more \nout than it is taking in. It begins that cost expansion dramatically as \nit moves into the period 2015, and by the year 2029-2030 the system is \nbankrupt and the Nation is unable to afford the costs of it.\n  It is absolutely essential that we guarantee our children and the \npostwar baby-boom generation which is about to go into the system a \nchance to have a viable Social Security system.\n  Some of the ideas the Senator from Minnesota has outlined are \nexcellent approaches to this. I congratulate him, obviously, for the \nintensity of thought and energy he has put into this issue. I hope he \nwill take an opportunity to review a bill which I have cosponsored \nalong with Senator Breaux from Louisiana to try to address this, which \nbill provides long-term solvency for the next 100 years. I include some \nof the ideas outlined by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  In any event, the thoughts of the Senator from Minnesota were \nextremely insightful and very appropriate, and I hope people have a \nchance to read them and review them as we go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/21/senate-section/article/S8653-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

This report is submitted pursuant to section \n401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section \n204(c) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 \nU.S.C. 1703(c).\n  1. On January 23, 1995, I signed Executive Order 12947, ``Prohibiting \nTransactions with Terrorists Who Threaten To Disrupt the Middle East \nPeace Process'' (the ``Order'') (60 Fed. Reg. 5079, January 25, 1995). \nThe Order blocks all property subject to U.S. jurisdiction in which \nthere is any interest of 12 terrorists organizations that threaten the \nMiddle East peace process as identified in an Annex to the Order. The \nOrder also blocks the property and interests in property subject to \nU.S. jurisdiction of persons designated by the Secretary of State, in \ncoordination with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney \nGeneral, who are found (1) to have committed, or to pose a significant \nrisk of committing, acts of violence that have the purpose or effect of \ndisrupting the Middle East peace process, or (2) to assist in, sponsor, \nor provide financial, material, or technological support for, or \nservices in support of, such acts of violence. In addition, the Order \nblocks all property and interests in property subject to U.S. \njurisdiction in which there is any interest of persons determined by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with the Secretary of \nState and the Attorney General, to be owned or controlled by, or to act \nfor or on behalf of, any other person designated pursuant to the Order \n(collectively ``Specially Designated Terrorists'' or ``SDTs'').\n  The Order further prohibits any transaction or dealing by a United \nStates person or within the United States in property or interests in \nproperty of SDTs, including the making or receiving of any contribution \nof funds, goods, or services to or for the benefit of such persons. \nThis prohibition includes donations that are intended to relieve human \nsuffering.\n\n  Designations of persons blocked pursuant to the Order are effective \nupon the date of determination by the Secretary of State or her \ndelegate, or the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control \n(OFAC) acting under authority delegated by the Secretary of the \nTreasury. Public notice of blocking is effective upon the date of \nfiling with the Federal Register, or upon prior actual notice.\n  Because terrorist activities continue to threaten the Middle East \npeace process and vital interests of the United States in the Middle \nEast, on January 21, 1998, I continued for another year the national \nemergency declared on January 23, 1995, and the measures that took \neffect on January 24, 1995, to deal with that emergency. This action \nwas taken in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies \nAct (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)).\n  2. On January 25, 1995, the Department of the Treasury issued a \nnotice listing persons blocked pursuant to Executive Order 12947 who \nhave been designated by the President as terrorist organizations \nthreatening the Middle East peace process or who have been found to be \nowned or controlled by, or to be acting for or on behalf of, these \nterrorist organizations (60 Fed. Reg. 5084, January 25, 1995). The \nnotice identified 31 entities that act for or on behalf of the 12 \nMiddle East terrorist organizations listed in the Annex to Executive \nOrder 12947, as well as 18 individuals who are leaders or \nrepresentatives of these groups. In addition, the notice provided 9 \nname variations or pseudonyms used by the 18 individuals identified. \nThe list identifies blocked persons who have been found to have \ncommitted, or to pose a significant risk of committing, acts of \nviolence that have the purpose or effect of disrupting the Middle East \npeace process or to have assisted in, sponsored, or provided financial, \nmaterial or technological support for, or services in support of, such \nacts of violence, or are owned or controlled by, or act for or on \nbehalf of other blocked persons. The Department of the Treasury issued \nthree additional notices adding the names of three individuals, as well \nas their pseudonyms, to the List of SDTs (60 Fed. Reg. 41152, August \n11, 1995; 60 Fed. Reg. 44932, August 29, 1995; and 60 Fed. Reg. 58435, \nNovember 27, 1995).\n  3. On February 2, 1996, OFAC issued the Terrorism Sanctions \nRegulations (the ``TSRs'' or the ``Regulations'') (61 Fed. Reg. 3805, \nFebruary 2, 1996). The TSRs implement the President's declaration of a \nnational emergency and imposition of sanctions against certain persons \nwhose acts of violence have the purpose or effect of disrupting the \nMiddle East peace process. There have been no amendments to the TSRs, \n21 C.F.R. Part 595, administered by the Office of Foreign Assets \nControl of the Department of the Treasury, since my report of January \n28, 1998.\n  4. Since January 25, 1995, OFAC has issued six licenses pursuant to \nthe Regulations. These licenses authorize payment of legal expenses and \nthe disbursement of funds for normal expenditures for the maintenance \nof family members, the employment and payment of salary and educational \nexpenses, payment for secure storage of tangible assets, and payment of \ncertain administrative transactions, to or for individuals designated \npursuant to Executive Order 12947.\n  5. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from January 23 through July 22, 1998, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of the national emergency with respect to organizations \nthat disrupt the Middle East peace process, are estimated at \napproximately $165,000. These data do not reflect certain costs of \noperations by the intelligence and law enforcement communities.\n  6. Executive Order 12947 provides this Administration with a tool for \ncombating fundraising in this country on behalf of organizations that \nuse terror to undermine the Middle East peace process. The Order makes \nit harder for such groups to finance these criminal activities by \ncutting off their access to sources of support in the United States and \nto U.S. financial facilities.

A bill to limit the ability of prisoners to challenge prison \nconditions; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                      crime doesn't pay prison act\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Crime \nDoesn't Pay Prison Act, a bill to curb the flood of frivolous prisoner \nlawsuits over prison conditions.\n  The primary purpose of this act is to articulate an objective \nnational standard for measuring the minimum decency of prison \nconditions. The Constitution does not dictate a minimum standard of \nliving for inmates, much less an enjoyable comfortable level of living. \nThis should be Congress' job.\n  In addition to the initial goal of a national prison standard, this \nbill has other purposes. It would ensure that State governments are \nrequired to spend only that amount necessary to achieve the minimum \nstandard for conditions of confinement mandated by the Constitution. It \nwould further ensure that the Federal courts require only that prison \nconditions do not constitute the unnecessary infliction of pain or \nneglect upon inmates, such that they are deprived of the minimum \ncivilized measure of life's basic necessities.\n  Absent a national standard, convicted criminals enjoy a standard of \nliving higher than that of the law-abiding, working poor. According to \nthe federal government, the standard of living for the law-abiding poor \nis $8,000 a year. Yet for a convicted criminal, the average expenditure \nper prisoner amounts to an unbelievably high $23,000 a year.\n  Absent a national standard, the standard of living in prison will \ncontinue to escalate. Since 1960, the average total state expenditure \nper inmate has increased almost twice as fast as median income, and \nmore than twice as fast as the poverty threshold. This is unacceptable.\n  Many unnecessary amenities, such as regulation softball fields, video \ngames, and premium pay cable channels are provided to criminals, \ncontribute to the increasing standard of living in prisons. Other \namenities include expensive musical instruments for traveling \n``choirs,'' not to mention martial arts training and boxing. Perhaps \nhere is a primary cause of prison violence. How can one counter the \nviolence if taxpayers' dollars are being spent on the very classes \nwhich teach and encourage it?\n  Absent a national standard, criminals will continue to fight for \ntheir ``right'' to amenities in prison, claiming that denial of same \n``violates'' their Eighth Amendment right against ``cruel and unusual \npunishment.'' Any violation of our Bill of Rights is, most assuredly, a \nvital concern and should not be tolerated.\n  Nor, however, should frivolous claims which do nothing but clog our \ncourt systems and deny our citizens speedy access to justice for \nlegitimate cases. Several actual cases demonstrate this. One includes a \nUtah criminal who claimed that his Eighth Amendment rights were \nviolated when he was provided with Converse tennis shoes, rather than \nL.A. Gear or Reebok. Another case dealt with an Arkansas criminal who \nwas appalled that he was given paper napkins during meals instead of \ncloth napkins. Yet another ludicrous example involves a Missouri \ncriminal, who claimed cruel and unusual punishment when he was not \nprovided with salad bars or brunches on weekends. This is absolutely \npreposterous.\n  The benefits of this ``Crime Doesn't Pay Prison'' Act are extensive. \nAs of right now, 25% of the state and federal courts' civil dockets are \ncomprised of inmate challenges to conditions of confinement. This bill \nwould reduce this number considerably. It also frees state Attorneys \nGeneral to pursue litigation on behalf of the citizenry.\n  The bill would drastically reduce the increasing cost of \nincarceration, allowing the money saved thereby to be used instead for \nthe expansion of existing prisons.\n  It puts an end to the injustice of convicted criminals enjoying a \nhigher standard of living, by mere virtue of their imprisonment, than \nthe law-abiding working poor.\n  In addition to giving the prison administrators the flexibility to \nfind that medium of good order and discipline within the prisons, \nperhaps most importantly, this bill would demonstrate to prisoners that \ncriminal behavior will not be rewarded with luxuries beyond the reach \nof law-abiding, poor Americans.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n\n                MEDICARE WASTE TAX REDUCTION ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing with my \ncolleague from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, an important piece of \nlegislation that will help to protect and preserve Medicare. The bill \nis entitled the Medicare Waste Tax Reduction Act of 1998.\n  For nearly ten years now, I have worked to combat fraud, waste and \nabuse in the Medicare program. As Chairman and now Ranking Member of \nthe Senate Appropriations Subcommittee with oversight of the \nadministration of Medicare, I've held hearing after hearing and \nreleased report after report documenting the extent of this problem. \nWhile virtually no one was paying attention to our effort for many \nyears, we've succeeded in bringing greater attention and focus to this \nproblem in the past several years.\n  Part of our effort has been to try to quantify the scope of the \nproblem. Several years ago, the General Accounting Office reported that \nup to 10 percent of Medicare funds could be lost to fraud, waste and \nabuse each year.\n\n[[Page S8659]]\n\n  Many questioned that estimate as too large. They said the problem \nexisted, but it wasn't nearly as big as 10 percent. Then, as you know, \nlast year the Inspector General conducted the first-ever detailed audit \nof Medicare payments. That Chief Financial Officer Act audit found that \nfully 14 percent of Medicare payments in 1996, or $23 billion, had been \nmade improperly.\n  That's a $23 billion ``waste tax'' on the American people. And the \npurpose of today's summit to figure out the best way to cut that tax. \nSo, how do you cut this tax? I know there are no ``magic-wand'' \nsolutions--this is a complex problem with many components. But \nbasically, you need four things: well thought out laws, adequate \nresources, effective implementation and the help of seniors and health \nproviders. We've made progress on each of these fronts over the last \ncouple of years, but much more remains to be done.\n  First, the reforms embodied in the Health Insurance Portability Act \nand the Balanced Budget Act must be effectively implemented. Effective \nimplementation of these new reforms are vital and must be given high \npriority. And, Medicare, the Inspector General and the Justice \nDepartment must continue to aggressively use new authority to crack \ndown on Medicare fraud.\n  The Medicare Waste Tax Reduction Act I am introducing today will take \na number of important steps to stop the ravaging of Medicare.\n  This Bill for example, would direct HCFA to double and better target \naudits and reviews to detect and discourage mispayments. Currently only \na tiny fraction of Medicare claims are reviewed before being paid and \nless than 2 percent of providers receive a comprehensive audit \nannually. We must have the ability to separate needed care from bill \npadding and abuse.\n  It would also require Medicare to aggressively use it's newly \nimproved ``inherent reasonableness'' authority. It is vitally important \nthat Medicare carriers be held accountable for their performance in \nprotecting the program from abuse. Preventing abuse and other \ninappropriate payments should be the most important performance \ncriteria these entities are measured by.\n  Our bill would also expand the Medicare Senior Waste Patrol \nNationwide. Seniors are our front line of defense against Medicare \nfraud, waste and abuse. However, too often, seniors don't have the \ninformation they need to detect and report suspected mistakes and \nfraud. By moving the Waste Patrol nationwide, implementing important \nBBA provisions and assuring seniors have access to itemized bills we \nwill strike an important blow to Medicare waste.\n  The bill would also give Medicare the authority to be a more prudent \npurchaser. As passed by the Senate, the Balanced Budget Act gave \nMedicare the authority to quickly reduce Part B payment rates (except \nthose made for physician services) it finds to be grossly excessive \nwhen compared to rates paid by other government programs and the \nprivate sector. In conference, the provision was limited to reductions \nof no more than 15 percent. This bill would restore the original Senate \nlanguage. In addition, to assure that Medicare gets the price it \ndeserves given its status as by far the largest purchaser of medical \nsupplies and equipment, Medicare would pay no more than any other \ngovernment program for these items. Finally, overpayments for \nprescription drugs and biologicals would be eliminated by lowering \nMedicare's rate to the lowest of either the actual acquisition cost or \n95% of the wholesale cost.\n  The Medicare Waste Tax reduction Act of 1998 would also ensure that \nMedicare does not pay for claims owed by other plans. Too often, \nMedicare pays claims that are owed by private insurers because it has \nknow way of knowing a beneficiary is working and has private insurance \nthat should pay first. This provision would reduce Medicare losses by \nrequiring insurers to report any Medicare beneficiaries they insure. \nAlso, Medicare would be given the authority to recover double the \namount owed by insurers who purposely let Medicare pay claims they \nshould have paid.\n  Additionally, coordination between Medicare and private insurers \nwould be strengthened. Often, those ripping off Medicare are also \ndefrauding private health plans. Yet, too little information on fraud \ncases is shared between Medicare and private plans. In order to \nencourage better coordination, health plans and their employees could \nnot be held liable for sharing information with Medicare regarding \nhealth care fraud as long as the information is not false, or the \nperson providing the information had no reason to believe the \ninformation was false.\n  Another critical component of any successful comprehensive plan to \ncut the Medicare waste tax is to focus on prevention. Most of our \nefforts now look at finding and correcting the problem after they \noccur. While this is important and we need to do even more of it, we \nall know that prevention is much more cost effective. The old adage ``A \nstitch in time saves nine'' was never more true. A major component of \nan enhanced prevention effort would be the provision of increased \nassistance and education for providers to comply with Medicare rules.\n  A good deal of the mis-payments made by Medicare are the result not \nof fraud or abuse, but of simple misunderstanding of Medicare billing \nrules by providers. Therefore, this bill provides $10 million a year to \nfund a major expansion of assistance and education for providers on \nprogram integrity requirements. This bill would also ensure the \nreduction of paperwork and administrative hassle that could prove \ndaunting to providers. Health professionals have to spend too much time \ncompleting paperwork and dealing with administrative hassles associated \nwith Medicare and private health plans. In order to reduce this hassle \nand provide more time for patient care, the Institute of Medicine would \nbe charged with developing a comprehensive plan by no later than June \n1, 1999. Their recommendations are to include the streamlining of \nvariations between Medicare and other payers.\n  Mr. President, while we have made changes to medicare in attempts to \nextend its solvency thru the next decade, we urgently need to take \nother steps to protect and preserve the program for the long-term. We \nshould enact the reforms in this bill to weed out waste, fraud and \nabuse as a first priority in this effort. I urge all my colleagues to \nreview this proposal and hope that they will join me in working to pass \nit yet this year.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent a summary of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 2335. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove efforts to combat Medicare fraud, waste, and abuse; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/21/senate-section/article/S8658-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8659-S8676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           Medicare Waste Tax Reduction Act of 1998--Summary\n\n       Doubling and Better Targeting Audits and Reviews To Detect \n     and Discourage Abuse. Only a tiny fraction of Medicare claims \n     are reviewed before being paid and less than 2 percent of \n     providers receive a comprehensive audit annually. In order to \n     better detect mistakes and abuses and to provide a more \n     significant deterrent to abuse, the number of medical, \n     utilization and fraud reviews would be doubled. In addition, \n     at least 15% of provider cost reports submitted by home \n     health agencies, skilled nursing facilities and durable \n     medical equipment would be subject to annual audits. The \n     increased reviews would be targeted at services and providers \n     most likely to be subject to abuse.\n       Expanding Medicare Senior Waste Patrol Nationwide--Seniors \n     are our front line of defense against Medicare fraud, waste \n     and abuse. However, too often, seniors don't have the \n     information they need to detect and report suspected mistakes \n     and fraud. A program to recruit and train retired nurses, \n     doctors, accountants and others to serve as volunteer \n     resources to meet this need at the local level was \n     established as part of the FY 97 Labor-HHS appropriations \n     bill. This 12 state program has proven successful and would \n     be expanded nationwide.\n       Increased Assistance and Education for Providers to Comply \n     with Medicare Rules--A good deal of the mispayments made by \n     Medicare are the result not of fraud or abuse, but of simple \n     misunderstanding of Medicare billing rules by providers. \n     Therefore, this bill provides $10 million a year to fund a \n     major expansion of assistance and education for providers on \n     program integrity requirements.\n       Reducing Paperwork and Administrative Hassle for \n     Providers--Health professionals have to spend too much time \n     completing paperwork and dealing with administrative hassles \n     associated with Medicare and private health plans. In order \n     to reduce this hassle and provide more time for patient care, \n     the\n\n[[Page S8660]]\n\n     Institute of Medicine would be charged with developing a \n     comprehensive plan by no later than June 1, 1999. Their \n     recommendations are to include the streamlining of variations \n     between Medicare and other payers.\n       Making Medicare a More Prudent Purchaser--As passed by the \n     Senate, the Balanced Budget Act gave Medicare the authority \n     to quickly reduce Part B payment rates (except those made for \n     physician services) it finds to be grossly excessive when \n     compared to rates paid by other government programs and the \n     private sector. In conference, the provision was limited to \n     reductions of no more than 15 percent. This bill would \n     restore the original Senate language. In addition, to assure \n     that Medicare gets the price it deserves given its status as \n     by far the largest purchaser of medical supplies and \n     equipment, Medicare would pay no more than any other \n     government program for these items. Finally, overpayments for \n     prescription drugs and biologicals would be eliminated by \n     lowering Medicare's rate to the lowest of either the actual \n     acquisition cost or 95% of the wholesale cost.\n       Using State of the Art Private Sector Technology to Reduce \n     Billing Errors and Abuse--The GAO and Medicare agree that \n     taxpayers could save over $400 million a year simply by \n     employing up to date computer software developed by the \n     private sector to detect and stop billing errors and abuse. \n     This bill would require Medicare to promptly employ private \n     sector edits determined compatible with Medicare payment \n     policy.\n       Improving Oversight of Home Health Agencies--Medicare \n     oversight of home health care services would be strengthened. \n     The Secretary would be required to conduct validation surveys \n     of at least 5 percent of the agencies surveyed by every \n     state. This would provide greater assurance that problem \n     agencies are identified and help to reduce variation among \n     states in inspection and enforcement.\n       Closing Loophole in Anti-Kickback Law for Managed Care--\n     Provisions of HIPAA created a broadened exception from \n     Medicare's anti-kickback rules for any arrangement where a \n     medical provider is at ``substantial financial risk'' through \n     ``any risk arrangement.'' This broad exception may be serving \n     as a loophole to get around important anti-kickback \n     protections. It would be eliminated, returning to pre-HIPAA \n     law.\n       Expanding Criminal Penalties For Kickbacks--Criminal \n     penalties upon persons violating the federal anti-kickback \n     provisions with respect to private health care benefit \n     programs. It will also authorize the Attorney General to \n     bring civil actions in U.S. District Courts to impose civil \n     penalties and treble damages on violators. There will be no \n     diminution of the existing authority of any agency of the \n     U.S. Government to administer and enforce the criminal laws \n     of the United States.\n       Extending Subpoena And Injunction Authority--Medicare's \n     ability to gather evidence in fraud and abuse cases would be \n     strengthened by extending the Secretary's testimonial \n     subpoena power and injunctive authority for civil monetary \n     penalties to other administrative sanctions such as \n     exclusions from the program.\n       Stopping Abusive Billings for Services Ordered by Excluded \n     Providers--While current law provides for penalties against \n     billing for services directly rendered by a provider who has \n     been excluded from Medicare for criminal or other serious \n     violations, no such authority exists for services or items \n     prescribed or ordered by these providers. This provision \n     would close the loophole by establishing civil monetary \n     penalties for anyone who knows or should know that they are \n     submitting claims for services ordered or prescribed by an \n     excluded provider.\n       Combating Abuse of Hospice and Partial Hospitalization \n     Benefits--Recent reviews have identified significant waste \n     and abuse in the new Medicare partial hospitalizatio benefit. \n     Abuse would be deterred by making a number of reforms to this \n     benefit and authorize the Secretary to begin a prospective \n     payment system. A new civil monetary penalty against doctors \n     who knowingly provide false certification that an individual \n     meets Medicare requirements to receive these services would \n     also be established. A similar provision already exists for \n     false certification of home health services.\n       Protecting Medicare Against Bankruptcy Abuses--Under \n     current law it is possible for providers to use bankruptcy as \n     a shield against Medicare and Medicaid penalties and \n     overpayment recoveries. This provision would protect Medicare \n     in a number of ways, including: A provider would still be \n     liable to refund overpayments and pay penalties and fines \n     even if he or she filed for bankruptcy. If Medicare law and \n     bankruptcy law conflict, Medicare law would prevail. \n     Bankruptcy courts would not be able to re-adjudicate Medicare \n     coverage or payment decisions.\n       Ensuring Medicare Does Not Pay for Claims Owed by Other \n     Plans--Too often, Medicare pays claims that are owed by \n     private insurers because it has no way of knowing a \n     beneficiary is working and has private insurance that should \n     pay first. This provision would reduce Medicare losses by \n     requiring insurers to report any Medicare beneficiaries they \n     insure. Also, Medicare would be given the authority to \n     recover double the amount owed by insurers who purposely let \n     Medicare pay claims they should have paid.\n       Improving Coordination with Private Sector in Combating \n     Medicare Fraud--Often, those ripping off Medicare are also \n     defrauding private health plans. Yet, too little information \n     on fraud cases is shared between Medicare and private plans. \n     In order to encourage better coordination, health plans and \n     their employees could not be held liable for sharing \n     information with Medicare regarding health care fraud as long \n     as the information is not false, or the person providing the \n     information had no reason to believe the information was \n     false.\n       Self-Funding Plan for Medicare Provider and Supplier \n     Agreements--In order to provide the resources necessary to \n     stop bogus or unqualified providers from billing Medicare, \n     the Secretary may impose fees for the initial and or renewal \n     of provider agreements. This will allow for more on-site \n     visits of those seeking provider numbers to assure that the \n     provider or supplier actually exists and is legitimate.\n       Balanced Budget Act Technical Changes--Several technical \n     changes to Balanced Budget Act provisions relating to health \n     care fraud are made.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 2336. A bill to amend chapter 5 of title 28, United States Code, \nto transfer Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, from the Eastern Judicial \nDistrict of Pennsylvania to the Middle Judicial District of \nPennsylvania; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                united states district court legislation\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation \ntransferring Schuylkill County from the Eastern Judicial District of \nPennsylvania to the Middle District. I am pleased to work on this \nneeded effort with the senior Senator from Pennsylvania Senator \nSpector, who has signed on as an original cosponsor.\n  Many of the residents of Schuylkill County have voiced concern about \nthe hardship they face in performing jury duty as they are often forced \nto travel as far as Philadelphia. Most of the counties adjacent to \nSchuylkill County are in the Middle District, where courtrooms are \ngenerally twice as close as those in Philadelphia. In addition, \ntransferring Schuylkill County will help relieve the Eastern District \nof its much larger caseload.\n  Both the Chief Judge of the Eastern District, Edward Cahn, and of the \nMiddle District, Sylvia Rambo, have raised no objections with this \ntransfer. The Schuylkill County Bar Association, the Schuylkill County \nDistrict Attorney, and numerous judges and attorneys have expressed \nstrong support.\n  This legislation serves as a companion bill to H.R. 2123, a bill \nintroduced by my esteemed colleague in the House of Representatives, \nRepresentative Tim Holden, whose district includes Schuylkill County. \nRepresentative Holden has worked diligently on passage of his bill or \nover a year, including a successful effort at incorporating its \nprovisions into the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1998. H.R. 2294, \nwhich passed the House on March 18, 1998. I congratulate my colleague \non his success. Now, it is the responsibility of myself and Senator \nSpecter to shepherd this legislation through the Senate.\n  I look forward to working with the Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch, and the Ranking Member, Senator Leahy, and \nthe rests of my colleagues in securing passage of much needed \nlegislation.\n  Mr. PRESIDENT, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2336\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TRANSFER OF COUNTY.\n\n       Section 118 of title 28, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a) by striking ``Philadelphia, and \n     Schuylkill'' and inserting ``and Philadelphia''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b) by inserting ``Schuylkill,'' after \n     ``Potter,''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--This Act and the amendments made by this \n     Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Pending Cases Not Affected.--This Act and the \n     amendments made by this Act shall not affect any action \n     commenced before the effective date of this Act and pending \n     on such date in the United States District Court for the \n     Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n       (c) Juries Not Affected.--This Act and the amendments made \n     by this Act shall not affect the composition, or preclude the \n     service, of any grand or petit jury summoned, impaneled, or \n     actually serving on the effective date of this Act.\n\n[[Page S8661]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        Graham, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. Hatch, Mr. McConnell, and \n        Mr. Mack):\n  S. 2337. A bill to establish a system of registries of temporary \nagricultural workers to provide for a sufficient supply of such workers \nand to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to streamline \nprocedures for the admission and extension of stay of nonimmigrant \nagricultural workers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n     agriculture job opportunity benefits and security act of 1998\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today legislation is being introduced by my \ncolleague from Oregon, Gordon Smith, along with Senators Wyden, Graham \nof Florida, Gorton, Bumpers, and McConnell. This bill would deal with a \nsituation that is a problem today and could well be a crisis tomorrow. \nThe Senate now has an opportunity to do what our Federal Government \ndoes all too rarely, and that is fix a problem in a timely and \ncommonsense fashion before it inflicts great hurt on millions of \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I am talking about agricultural growers and their need \nfor a stable, predictable, legal workforce that would receive good, \nfair, market-based compensation.\n  I am talking about unemployed workers and those hoping to move from \nwelfare to work, who want and need to be matched up with agricultural \njobs, if possible. American citizens should have first claim to \nAmerican jobs. All workers would rather be working legally and know \nthey can claim full legal protections only when their employment \nsituation is open and lawful.\n  Farm employers need to be provided with a secure work force. Workers \nneed to be assured of basic legal and labor standard protections.\n  These goals are not being met today. In fact, current federal law, \nand its bureaucratic implementation, are hurting growers and workers.\n  In fact, current Federal laws and their bureaucratic implementation \nare hurting both growers and workers. This is why I am pleased to join \nwith my colleagues in the introduction of what we will call AgJOBS. \nThis stands for the Agricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits and Security \nAct.\n  This bill will represent the culmination of work that has been going \non for years amongst our colleagues, to resolve the issue of the \nnecessary labor force for American agriculture. We have examined all of \nthe issues involved with trying to ensure a supply of legal temporary \nand seasonal labor. We understand that that employers in many cases \nneed guest workers and that employees, domestic and guest workers, need \nmore and better jobs. We have looked at all sides. The result is a \nconsensus bill that we think is nothing less than remarkable, and I \ncommend my colleagues on this very important bipartisan effort.\n  The key elements of our bipartisan proposal would include the \nfollowing: The creation of a new, voluntary, national registry of \nmigrant farm workers to which growers can turn for workers they know \nare legal. If enough domestic workers could not be supplied through the \nregistry, growers could apply for legal guest workers through an \nexpedited, reformed H-2A program. The new program would resemble the \ncurrent H-2A program, but it would have much, much faster turnaround, \nless red tape, and greater certainty for employers, continued \nprotections for workers, and greater flexibility for employers, related \nto conditions of employment such as housing, transportation, and \nmarket-based wages.\n  The crisis is at hand not only on the farm but with the worker who is \nattempting to get across our borders today. With the tremendous heat in \nthe South right now, there are warnings out to workers hoping for a job \nopportunity in this country: Do not try to traffic the area or you \ncould die--simply by using the transportation methods in which so many \nworkers are travelling today. Current law has created a phenomenal \nsituation that is most inhumane.\n  Two years ago, Senators Wyden, Gorton, and others joined with me in \nrequiring the General Accounting Office to study the current H-2A Guest \nWorker Program.\n  As a result, the GAO has estimated that at least 37 percent of all \nfarm workers in the United States are not here legally, not legally \nqualified to work. How they got the figure is amazing: They went out \nand asked, and the workers, by self-disclosure, admitted that they were \nhere illegally.\n  The current H-2A program has been a red tape nightmare.\n  Too often, when growers need a timely response to their needs, with \nproduce in the field, it cannot be done.\n  Even when growers meet all the deadlines the Government sets for \nthem, then the Government fails to meet its own deadlines. In fact, \nGAO's study found that, when growers made timely applications, the \nDepartment of Labor still missed statutory deadlines 40 percent of the \ntime.\n  The bureaucracy grinds to a halt sometimes because it doesn't \nunderstand the needs in the field, and sometimes because it doesn't \nwant to supply the workforce.\n  Current H-2A has been completely ineffective as a means of obtaining \ntemporary and seasonal workers, supplying only about 24,000 out of the \n1.6 million farm workers necessary on an annual basis.\n  In the 1996 immigration law, and in appropriations over recent years, \nCongress has made it a priority to secure our borders and crack down on \nillegal immigrants.\n  That is exactly what we want and what our citizens want.\n  But as a result, serious spot shortages of farm labor are multiplying \nfrom Florida to New England, Kentucky to Colorado--to California and \nIdaho, and across the Nation.\n  For example, California growers and local officials have made a real \neffort to address the shortfall with welfare-to-work efforts. But it is \nnot happening. We are at near full employment in our economy. People \nare simply not available to do agricultural-style work. And sometimes \nthe needs of agriculture are uniquely not matched to the needs or \ncapabilities of available domestic workers.\n  Because of the robust counterfeit ID industry and current Federal \nlaws, we have many of these illegals moving into our country who are, \nin fact, carrying what appear to be legal credentials. Employers do not \nwant that to happen, but the law actually punishes them if they are too \ndiligent in inquiring about the legal status of job applicants. Current \nlaw has created an unwinnable Catch-22 for employers. Most have no \nrealistic way of ensuring their work force is entirely legal.\n  A single Immigration and Naturalization Service raid, netting a \nhandful of illegal workers, can scare and clean out thousands of \nworkers in surrounding counties. It happened just a few weeks ago in \nthe Georgia onion fields. The employers in such cases typically have \ncomplied with the law. But, of course, the crops were left rotting in \nthe fields. That is not what the American farmer needs. It is certainly \nnot what the American consumers need.\n  As workers disappear from U.S. fields, and crops stay there instead \nof moving to the stores, not only are the farmers hurt, as I mentioned, \nbut consumers are hurt. And then we have to reach inevitably toward an \neffort to import foods, much of which may not meet our health and \nsafety standards. This means a mainstay of our economy, the U.S. \nagriculture industry, is threatened with a major breakdown. This means \nthat our families are threatened with the increased risk of exposure to \nfood-borne illnesses on imported, foreign foods. And it happens simply \nbecause the current H-2A system won't supply the kind of labor that is \nnecessary.\n  Let's be humane and let's be responsible. Let's move the AgJOBS bill \nintroduced today, so it can be signed on the President's desk and \nbecome law this year. It is critically necessary that we do this.\n  We have reached out to the Department of Labor to work with them and \nbe sensitive to their concerns in the crafting of this legislation to \nstreamline the H-2A program. We have tried to anticipate and answer \nevery objection that might be raised to this kind of reform. We have \ntried to solve problems before bringing this bill to the floor.\n  I thank my colleagues for this tremendous effort, especially Senator \nGordon Smith of Oregon, Senator Wyden, Senator Graham of Florida, and \nSenator Gorton, who have worked\n\n[[Page S8662]]\n\nvery closely, to make this legislation a reality.\n  We think this bill will create a win-win situation so those who wish \nto enter our country to work at our agricultural jobs can enter \nlegally, so they can enter in a safe way instead of in the backs of \ntrucks or almost literally in tin cans where, as a result of tragic \naccidents, they oftentimes lose their lives. We saw another tragic \nexample of this in recent days.\n  We can do better. We can pass the AgJOBS reforms. I am pleased to be \na part of the introduction of this legislation today.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Wyden, \nCraig, Graham of Florida, Gorton, Bumpers, Hatch, McConnell, and Mack \nto introduce the Agricultural Job Opportunity Benefits and Security Act \nof 1998, also known as AgJOBS. Our bill will create a streamlined guest \nworker program to allow for a reliable supply of legal, temporary, \nagricultural workers.\n  Mr. President, we are facing a crisis in agriculture--a crisis born \nof an inadequate labor supply. For many years, farmers and nurserymen \nhave struggled to hire enough legal agricultural workers to harvest \ntheir produce and plants. The labor pool is competitive, especially in \nmy state of Oregon, where jobs are many and domestic workers willing to \ndo farm work are few. The General Accounting Office even confirmed that \nthere have been local, regional and crop-based labor shortages and \nlosses.\n  Labor intensive agriculture is the most rapidly growing area of \nagricultural production in this country and we can only expect the \ndemand for agricultural labor jobs to continue to rise. When coupled \nwith the lowest unemployment rates in decades and a crackdown on \nillegal immigration, the agriculture industry--and ultimately its \nconsumers--face a crisis.\n  Currently, the H-2A program is the only legal, temporary, foreign \nagricultural worker program in the United States. This program is not \npracticable for the agriculture and horticulture industries because it \nis loaded with burdensome regulations, excessive paperwork, a \nbureaucratic certification process and untimely and inconsistent \ndecision-making by the U.S. Department of Labor. Also, as reported by \nthe recent Department of Labor Inspector General, the H-2A program does \nnot meet the interests of domestic workers because it does a poor job \nof placing domestic workers in agricultural jobs.\n  I am proud to announce legislation that is the product of a \nbipartisan effort put forth today by several of my colleagues. With \ntheir help, we have been able to develop a consensus solution that will \ncreate a workable system for recruiting workers domestically and \npreventing crops from rotting in the fields. The bipartisan support for \nthis bill reflects months of hard work by members of both parties.\n  Mr. President, as we introduce this balanced bill, we have two goals \nin mind--to make it easier for employers to hire legal workers to \nharvest their crops, and to ensure that workers are treated fairly in \nthe process. These workers deserve the dignity of legal status when \nthey are here doing work that benefits all of us.\n  I'm very concerned that workers are protected, but let's not forget \nthat growers have been victimized by this process too. In order to feed \ntheir families--and ours--the growers need to harvest their crops on \ntime, meet payroll, and ultimately maintain their bottom line. Without \nachieving those things, farms go out of business and the jobs they \ncreate are lost along with them. So it is in all of our best \ninterests--workers, growers, and consumers alike--that growers have the \nmeans by which to hire needed workers. I believe our legislation will \nhelp achieve that goal.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly summarize the improvements our bill \nmakes over the current H-2A program.\n  First and foremost, all of the labor protections currently in place \nfor workers have been preserved. In fact, they have been improved \nsubstantially. Domestic workers under the new program will now receive \nunemployment insurance and all complaints filed by workers will be \ninvestigated by the Department of Labor. Also, foreign workers under \nthe new program will retain their ability to transfer to other H-2A \nfarms once they've completed work with their current employer. These \nprovisions will ensure that the rights of workers--both foreign and \ndomestic--continue to be protected.\n  We've also improved the housing provision in the existing H-2A \nprogram, currently another barrier for many farmers. For instance, in \nmy state of Oregon, our strict land use laws prohibit building on farm \nland. This means that many farms do not have housing to offer and \ntherefore cannot use the H-2A program. Under our new bill, we allow \nemployers the option of providing a housing allowance to workers if \nhousing cannot be provided. This change will make it possible for many \nmore farmers to use the guest worker program, and guest workers will \nstill receive housing benefits.\n  To be fair to domestic workers, we also created a process that would \nmake agriculture jobs available to them first. The bureaucratic and \nuntimely labor certification process of the H-2A program will be \nreplaced by a registry which uses existing DOL job bank computers to \nmatch domestic workers seeking jobs with employers seeking workers. If \njob openings still exist, then employers will be allowed to bring in \ntemporary foreign workers to fill the open jobs.\n  In order for employers to offer these and other protections, the \nprogram has to be more practical to use. In our bill, we have \nstreamlined the impractical time-frame requirements for applying to the \nprogram. Currently, farmers must apply for H-2A workers 60 days before \nthey think they will need workers. In a very unpredictable industry, \nthis requirement is a barrier for many farmers. In our bill, we have \nreduced this time period to 21 days, making the program much more \nresponsive to the unpredictable nature of agriculture crops and much \nmore practical for use by farmers.\n  Our legislation makes many other improvements to the existing H-2A \nprogram--for both employers and workers. As a result, we can expect \nmore growers to use it, and consequently, we can expect more domestic \nand foreign workers to benefit from the ample wage and labor \nprotections afforded by it.\n  Let's not make fugitives out of farmworkers and felons out of \nfarmers. That is the effect of our current guest worker program.\n  I urge my fellow colleagues to join Senators Wyden, Craig, Graham, \nGorton, Bumpers, Hatch, Feinstein, McConnell, Mack and me as we \nintroduce this important bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this legislation, along \nwith the list of over 100 agriculture-related associations that endorse \nthis bill, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2337\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Required Wages.--\n       (1) In general.--An employer applying under section 4(a) \n     for workers shall offer to pay, and shall pay, all workers in \n     the occupation or occupations for which the employer has \n     applied for workers from the registry, not less (and is not \n     required to pay more) than the greater of the prevailing wage \n     in the occupation in the area of intended employment or the \n     adverse effect wage rate.\n       (2) Payment of prevailing wage determined by a state \n     employment security agency sufficient.--In complying with \n     paragraph (1), an employer may request and obtain a \n     prevailing wage determination from the State employment \n     security agency. If the employer requests such a \n     determination, and pays the wage required by paragraph (1) \n     based upon such a determination, such payment shall be \n     considered sufficient to meet the requirement of paragraph \n     (1).\n       (3) Reliance on wage survey.--In lieu of the procedure of \n     paragraph (2), an employer may rely on other information, \n     such as an employer-generated prevailing wage survey and \n     determination that meets criteria specified by the Secretary.\n       (4) Alternative methods of payment permitted.--\n       (A) In general.--A prevailing wage may be expressed as an \n     hourly wage, a piece rate, a task rate, or other incentive \n     payment method, including a group rate. The requirement to \n     pay at least the prevailing wage in the occupation and area \n     of intended employment does not require an employer to pay by \n     the method of pay in which the prevailing rate is expressed, \n     except that, if the employer adopts a method of pay other \n     than the prevailing rate, the burden of proof is on the \n     employer to demonstrate that the employer's method of pay is \n     designed to produce earnings equivalent to the earnings that \n     would result from payment of the prevailing rate.\n       (B) Compliance when paying an incentive rate.--In the case \n     of an employer that pays a piece rate or task rate or uses \n     any other incentive payment method, including a group rate, \n     the employer shall be considered to be in compliance with any \n     applicable hourly wage requirement if the average of the \n     hourly earnings of the workers, taken as a group, the \n     activity for which a piece rate, task rate, or other \n     incentive payment, including a group rate, is paid, for the \n     pay period, is at least equal to the required hourly wage.\n       (C) Task rate.--For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     ``task rate'' means an incentive payment method based on a \n     unit of work performed such that the incentive rate varies \n     with the level of effort required to perform individual units \n     of work.\n       (D) Group rate.--For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     ``group rate'' means an incentive payment method in which the \n     payment is shared among a group of workers working together \n     to perform the task.\n       (b) Requirement To Provide Housing.--\n       (1) In general.--An employer applying under section 4(a) \n     for registered workers shall offer to provide housing at no \n     cost (except for charges permitted by paragraph (5)) to all \n     workers employed in job opportunities to which the employer \n     has applied under that section, and to all other workers in \n     the same occupation at the place of employment, whose \n     permanent place of residence is beyond normal commuting \n     distance.\n       (2) Type of housing.--In complying with paragraph (1), an \n     employer may, at the employer's election, provide housing \n     that meets applicable Federal standards for temporary labor \n     camps or secure housing that meets applicable local standards \n     for rental or public accommodation housing or other \n     substantially similar class of habitation, or, in the absence \n     of applicable local standards, State standards for rental or \n     public accommodation housing or other substantially similar \n     class of habitation.\n       (3) Workers engaged in the range production of livestock.--\n     The Secretary shall issue regulations that address the \n     specific requirements for the provision of housing to workers \n     engaged in the range production of livestock.\n       (4) Limitation.--Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to require an employer to provide or secure housing \n     for persons who were not entitled to such housing under the \n     temporary labor certification regulations in effect on June \n     1, 1986.\n       (5) Charges for housing.--\n       (A) Utilities and maintenance.--An employer who provides \n     housing to a worker pursuant to paragraph (1) may charge an \n     amount equal to the fair market value (but not greater than \n     the employer's actual cost) for maintenance and utilities, or \n     such lesser amount as permitted by law.\n       (B) Security deposit.--An employer who provides housing to \n     workers pursuant to paragraph (1) may require, as a condition \n     for providing such housing, a deposit not to exceed $50 from \n     workers occupying such housing to protect against gross \n     negligence or willful destruction of property.\n       (C) Damages.--An employer who provides housing to workers \n     pursuant to paragraph (1) may require a worker found to have \n     been responsible for damage to such housing which is not the \n     result of normal wear and tear related to habitation to \n     reimburse the employer for the reasonable cost of repair of \n     such damage.\n       (6) Reduced user fee for workers provided housing.--An \n     employer shall receive a credit of 40 percent of the payment \n     otherwise due pursuant to section 218(b) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act on the earnings of alien workers to whom \n     the employer provides housing pursuant to paragraph (1).\n       (7) Housing allowance as alternative.--\n       (A) In general.--In lieu of offering housing pursuant to \n     paragraph (1), subject to subparagraphs (B) through (D), the \n     employer may on a case-by-case basis provide a reasonable \n     housing allowance. An employer who offers a housing allowance \n     to a worker pursuant to this subparagraph shall not be deemed \n     to be a housing provider under section 203 of the Migrant and \n     Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (29 U.S.C. 1823) \n     solely by virtue of providing such housing allowance.\n       (B) Limitation.--At any time after the date that is 3 years \n     after the effective date of this Act, the governor of the \n     State may certify to the Secretary that there is not \n     sufficient housing available in an area of intended \n     employment of migrant farm workers or aliens provided status \n     pursuant to this Act who are seeking temporary housing while \n     employed at farm work. Such certification may be canceled by \n     the governor of the State at any time, and shall expire after \n     5 years unless renewed by the governor of the State.\n       (C) Effect of certification.--If the governor of the State \n     makes the certification of insufficient housing described in \n     subparagraph (A) with respect to an area of employment, \n     employers of workers in that area of employment may not offer \n     the housing allowance described in subparagraph (A) after the \n     date that is 5 years after such certification of insufficient \n     housing for such area, unless the certification has expired \n     or been canceled pursuant to subparagraph (B).\n       (D) Amount of allowance.--The amount of a housing allowance \n     under this paragraph shall be equal to the statewide average \n     fair market rental for existing housing for nonmetropolitan \n     counties for the State in which the employment occurs, as \n     established by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     pursuant to section 8(c) of the United States Housing Act of \n     1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(c)), based on a 2-bedroom dwelling unit \n     and an assumption of 2 persons per bedroom.\n       (c) Reimbursement of Transportation.--\n       (1) To place of employment.--A worker who is referred to a \n     job opportunity under section 5(a), or an alien employed \n     pursuant to this Act, who completes 50 percent of the period \n     of employment of the job opportunity for which the worker was \n     hired, may apply to the Secretary for reimbursement of the \n     cost of the worker's transportation and subsistence from the \n     worker's permanent place of residence (or place of last \n     employment, if the worker traveled from such place) to the \n     place of employment to which the worker was referred under \n     section 5(a).\n       (2) From place of employment.--A worker who is referred to \n     a job opportunity under section 5(a), or an alien employed \n     pursuant to this Act, who completes the period of employment \n     for the job opportunity involved, may apply to the Secretary \n     for reimbursement of the cost of the worker's transportation \n     and subsistence from the place of employment to the worker's \n     permanent place of residence (or place of next employment, if \n     the worker travels from the place of current employment to a \n     subsequent place of employment and is otherwise ineligible \n     for reimbursement under paragraph (1) with respect to such \n     subsequent place of employment).\n       (3) Limitation.--\n       (A) Amount of reimbursement.--Except as provided in \n     subparagraph (B), the amount of reimbursement provided under \n     paragraph (1) or (2) to a worker or alien shall not exceed \n     the lesser of--\n\n[[Page S8666]]\n\n       (i) the actual cost to the worker or alien of the \n     transportation and subsistence involved; or\n       (ii) the most economical and reasonable transportation and \n     subsistence costs that would have been incurred had the \n     worker or alien used an appropriate common carrier, as \n     determined by the Secretary.\n       (B) Distance traveled.--No reimbursement under paragraph \n     (1) or (2) shall be required if the distance traveled is 100 \n     miles or less.\n       (4) Use of trust fund.--Reimbursements made by the \n     Secretary to workers or aliens under this subsection shall be \n     considered to be administrative expenses for purposes of \n     section 218A(b)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as \n     added by this Act.\n       (d) Establishment of Pilot Program for Advancing \n     Transportation Costs.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a pilot \n     program for the issuance of vouchers to United States workers \n     who are referred to job opportunities under section 5(a) for \n     the purpose of enabling such workers to purchase common \n     carrier transportation to the place of employment.\n       (2) Limitation.--A voucher may only be provided to a worker \n     under paragraph (1) if the job opportunity involved requires \n     that the worker temporarily relocate to a place of employment \n     that is more than 100 miles from the worker's permanent place \n     of residence or last place of employment, and the worker \n     attests that the worker cannot travel to the place of \n     employment without such assistance from the Secretary.\n       (3) Number of vouchers.--The Secretary shall award vouchers \n     under the pilot program under paragraph (1) to workers \n     referred from each registry in proportion to the number of \n     workers registered with each such registry.\n       (4) Reimbursement.--\n       (A) Use of trust fund.--Reimbursements for the cost of \n     vouchers provided by the Secretary under this subsection for \n     workers who complete at least 50 percent of the period of \n     employment of the job opportunity for which the worker was \n     hired shall be considered to be administrative expenses for \n     purposes of section 218A(b)(4) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act, as added by this Act.\n       (B) Of secretary.--A worker who receives a voucher under \n     this subsection who fails to complete at least 50 percent of \n     the period of employment of the job opportunity for which the \n     worker was hired under the job opportunity involved shall \n     reimburse the Secretary for the cost of the voucher.\n       (5) Report and continuation of program.--\n       (A) Collection of data.--The Secretary shall collect data \n     on--\n       (i) the extent to which workers receiving vouchers under \n     this subsection report, in a timely manner, to the jobs to \n     which such workers have been referred;\n       (ii) whether such workers complete the job opportunities \n     involved; and\n       (iii) the extent to which such workers do not complete at \n     least 50 percent of the period of employment the job \n     opportunities for which the workers were hired.\n       (B) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the expiration \n     of the second fiscal year during which the program under this \n     subsection is in operation, the Secretary, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of Agriculture, shall prepare and submit \n     to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the \n     Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, a \n     report, based on the data collected under subparagraph (A), \n     concerning the results of the program established under this \n     section.

In \n     determining the amount of civil money penalty to be assessed, \n     or whether to recommend disqualification of the employer, the \n     Secretary shall consider the seriousness of the violation, \n     the good faith of the employer, the size of the business of \n     the employer being charged, the history of previous \n     violations by the employer, whether the employer obtained a \n     financial gain from the violation, whether the violation was \n     willful, and other relevant factors.\n       (4) Program disqualification.--\n       (A) 3 years for second violation.--Upon a second final \n     determination that an employer has failed to pay the wages \n     required under this Act or committed other substantial \n     violations under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall report \n     such determination to the Attorney General and the Attorney \n     General shall disqualify the employer from the employment of \n     aliens described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act for a period of 3 years.\n       (B) Permanent for third violation.--Upon a third final \n     determination that an employer has failed to pay the wages \n     required under this section, or committed other substantial \n     violations under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall report \n     such determination to the Attorney General, and the Attorney \n     General shall disqualify the employer from any subsequent \n     employment of aliens described in section \n     101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\n[[Page S8667]]\n\n       (c) Role of Associations.--\n       (1) Violation by a member of an association.--An employer \n     on whose behalf an application is filed by an association \n     acting as its agent is fully responsible for such \n     application, and for complying with the terms and conditions \n     of this Act, as though the employer had filed the application \n     itself. If such an employer is determined to have violated a \n     requirement of this section, the penalty for such violation \n     shall be assessed against the employer who committed the \n     violation and not against the association or other members of \n     the association.\n       (2) Violation by an association acting as an employer.--If \n     an association filing an application on its own behalf as an \n     employer is determined to have committed a violation under \n     this subsection which results in disqualification from the \n     program under subsection (b), no individual member of such \n     association may be the beneficiary of the services of an \n     alien described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act in an occupation in which \n     such alien was employed by the association during the period \n     such disqualification is in effect, unless such member files \n     an application as an individual employer or such application \n     is filed on the employer's behalf by an association with \n     which the employer has an agreement that the employer will \n     comply with the requirements of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 9.

Mr. President, a recent GAO report concluded that \napproximately one-third of the U.S. agricultural labor force in the \nUnited States is illegal. Many estimate that the percentage is in fact \nmuch higher. For too long, Congress has failed to respond to the lack \nof legal agricultural workers, and simply left on the books, and \nlargely unused, a guestworker program that is too administratively \ncomplex and expensive to be workable. With recent crackdowns by INS, \nour farmers and growers face a labor shortage crisis. Congress must \nact, and it must act now.\n  I rise today, and join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in \nintroducing the Agricultural Job Opportunity Benefits and Security Act \nof 1998, a bill to address this problem. This legislation is long past \ndue and urgently needed. As the Senator from Florida described earlier \ntoday, the bill is a win-win-win proposition. It is a win for farmers \nand growers because it provides them a method of obtaining a legal, \nreliable workforce. It is a win for workers both domestic and foreign. \nFor domestic workers, the bill, through a work registry, gives them \nfirst preference on jobs, benefits above those they are currently \nreceiving, and continued employment by ensuring that American farms \nremain economically viable and that production is not lost to other \ncountries. For foreign workers, the bill provides the dignity, freedom \nfrom fear, and mobility that attends a legal status, as well as \nsignificant worker protection and benefits. Finally, the bill is a win \nfor consumers because it ensures them a ready, affordable supply of \nAmerican agricultural products. I applaud this carefully considered, \nbalanced legislation and will work actively for its quick enactment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Kentucky Farm Bureau and the \nhundreds of farmers that I met with on my recent farm belt tour \nconvinced me that one of the most pressing issues facing Kentucky \nfarmers is the problem of finding legal, migrant farm workers.\n  Kentucky farmers depend heavily on migrant agricultural workers that \ncome to Kentucky under H-2A visas to help harvest tobacco and other \ncrops. Kentucky depends on the H-2A visa program more than every other \nstate, except North Carolina and Virginia.\n  The current H-2A process is slow, tedious and complex. It subjects \nfarmers to unreasonable costs, excessive bureaucracy, and mountains of \npaperwork.\n  To add to the injustice, farmers are faced with frivolous lawsuits \nand IRS raids--often at the peak time of the harvest.\n  The Agriculture Job Opportunity Benefits and Security Act would lift \nthe unfair burdens placed on farmers by reforming the H-2A visa program \nand reducing: the mountains of paperwork, the excessive bureaucracy, \nand the unfair threats of frivolous litigation.\n  In order to get migrant workers, a Kentucky farmer has to find his \nway through the Kentucky Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of \nLabor, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service--paying fees and \nfilling out cumbersome, confusing paperwork all along the way.\n  Most farmers will tell you that it's easier to wade through the tax \ncode and file a 1040 tax form every year than it is to slog through \nmultiple government agencies and mountains of paperwork just to hire a \nmigrant farm worker to help bale hay.\n  In fact, the Department of Labor needs a 325-page handbook to help \nfarmers find their way to migrant farm workers. The Government \nAccounting Office managed to get through this handbook and found it to \nbe outdated, incomplete and very confusing.\n  You shouldn't have to hire a lawyer just to hire a migrant farmer.\n  I'd like to take a couple of minutes to walk through some of the \ncommon problems faced by farmers and the common sense solutions offered \nby the bill we are introducing today.\n  Problem: Farmers are hesitant to use the process because it is too \nslow and complicated.\n  Solution: A simplified, streamlined H-2A visa program would encourage \nmore farmers to go through the system to hire legal migrant farm \nworkers.\n  Problem: Farmers must pay multiple fees, go through multiple \nagencies, and fill-out multiple documents.\n  Solution: A Department of Labor computer registry would be \nestablished to replace the current cumbersome and bureaucratic process. \nFarmers would submit a simple form asking for a certain number of \nworkers at a specified\n\n[[Page S8670]]\n\ntime. If there is an insufficient number of domestic workers available, \nthen the DOL would contact the INS to initiate an expedited visa \napproval process for migrant farm workers. (All program costs would be \npaid for by employer user fees.)\n  Problem: Farmers must apply for workers 60 days in advance--even \nthough they may not know exactly how many workers they will need or \nexactly when they will need them.\n  Solution: Farmers do not have to begin process two months in advance. \nThey may apply any time prior to actually hiring foreign workers. The \ntotal process from initial application to actual hiring should take no \nmore than 21 days.\n  Problem: DOL slows the process by failing to timely process \napplications. A GAO study found that DOL missed statutory deadlines in \nat least 40 percent of the cases.\n  Solution: Farmers do not have to wait for DOL. If the DOL does not \neither meet the deadline or issue a specific objection, then the INS is \nauthorized to go ahead and issue visas for migrant workers.\n  Problem: Farmers have to spend hundreds of dollars advertising in the \nnewspaper or on the radio to prove what they already know--that is, \nthere is a shortage of domestic workers who will labor in the fields.\n  Solution: Farmers will not be required to engage in costly radio and \nnewspaper advertising, but may recruit domestic workers by simply using \nthe existing DOL job bank for available domestic workers. DOL will \nmatch domestic workers with jobs.\n  Problem: Farmers are required to pay wages that are often higher than \nboth the minimum wage and the prevailing wage because the legal wage is \ncalculated based on wages paid for all farming jobs, not the specific \njob in which the migrant worker employed.\n  Solution: Farmers would not have to pay exorbitant wages to migrant \nfarm workers. They would be required to pay wages only up to the \nprevailing wage for the type of occupation in which the grower is \nactually employed. The wage would not be based on the wages earned by \nall persons in all farming jobs.\n  Problem: Farmers are faced with the threat of frivolous litigation \nfor failing to meet vague and open-ended statutory and regulatory \nrequirements.\n  Solution: The threat of litigation would be reduced by removing \nunfair burdens on farmers and by clearly spelling out statutory \nrequirements.\n  Finally, let me respond to the critics of this compromise bill.\n  Critics wrongly claim the new alternative program has no labor \nprotections.\n  The alternative program provides foreign and domestic workers with \nall the labor protections of federal and state labor laws. In addition, \nit imposes special obligations on participating employers such as \npayment of at least the prevailing wage.\n  The pilot program is modeled after the existing H-lB program for \nspecialty and high-tech occupations. It requires employers to recruit \ndomestic workers, and assures that domestic workers receive first \npreference for jobs.\n  Finally, the new program provides strict penalties for employers who \nfail to meet labor standards, including fines, back wages, and \ndebarment from future program participation.\n  I wanted to commend the bipartisan group of Senators, led by Gordon \nSmith, who have worked together to craft a comprehensive and meaningful \nsolution for our nation's farmers.\n  I was proud to be a cosponsor of Senator Smith's original bill, S. \n1563, and am equally pleased to be a part of this compromise bill.\n  I look forward to working with the American Farm Bureau and the \nKentucky Farm Bureau to move this bill in the Senate as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nintroducing legislation that will simplify and streamline one of the \nmost frustrating aspects in the life of a farmer: Finding qualified, \nlegal farmworkers.\n  There are two large issues that cause this problem: (1) According to \nthe December 1997 GAO report, there are at least 600,000 farm workers \nin the United States illegally--and most have false, but realistic-\nlooking, documents.\n  The farmer can go to extreme lengths to verify his workforce, and \nstill be vulnerable to INS enforcement action.\n  Our bill, through an Agricultural Registry of workers, ensures that a \nfarmer is able to get a legal, reliable workforce, and our bill ensures \nthat these American workers are paid a premium wage and receive the \nbenefits that they deserve.\n  (2) Under the current system, if a farmer cannot find available \nAmerican workers and does need to find temporary foreign help through \nH-2A visas, he or she must navigate a maze of complex regulations, so \nmuch so that it takes a 300-page guidebook to explain the process.\n  He or she also has little assurance that, even after successfully \ncompleting the forms and initiating the process, that the Department of \nLabor will approve or deny the petitions in a timely manner.\n  It may seem notable that we are all here together, in a bipartisan \nmanner, from every geographic region of our great Nation.\n  In the past, discussion of the H-2A program has broken down into a \npartisan, polarized, gridlocked debate, and no one wins. Wages are \nstill low for workers, and growers still need legal reliable help.\n  I commend my colleagues, Senator Wyden, Senator Bumpers, Senators \nSmith, Craig, and Gorton for helping bring common sense reality to the \ntable, and together, crafting a bill that helps all sides.\n  I thank Senator Abraham for holding a fair, educational and timely \nhearing on this issue, and for bringing all sides together to discuss \nwhat works and what doesn't work under the current system.\n  We, as a bipartisan group, want to accomplish several goals, and I \nask my colleagues in the Senate to support what we feel will bring \norder to the current chaos, bring honor to the farming community, and \nbring needed benefits to hard working farmworkers. Our goals are \nsimple:\n  1. Make the H-2A system simple. With our agricultural registry, \nanyone can start the process by picking up the phone.\n  Turnaround time can be counted in minutes and hours instead of weeks \nor months. Give our farmers the chance to choose between legal domestic \nworkers, and legal foreign workers, with the domestic workers getting \nthe first choice at all jobs. But the choice can be made to have a \nlegal workforce.\n  2. Ensure that American workers get the first choice of every job \nopening. Under the Registry system--not a single foreign worker will \ncome to the United States until every domestic worker on the Registry \nis employed in the area he or she has requested.\n  American farmworkers will be able to easily link together a year's \nworth of work--moving from Florida to Kentucky to New England, if that \nis what they want.\n  3. Ensure that American workers receive premium wages and benefits. \nUnder the Registry program, every legal domestic worker is guaranteed \nat least prevailing wage, plus a 5 percent premium.\n  The growers will pay a higher price than they may be paying \ncurrently, but they have the added value of knowing with certainty that \nthey are not vulnerable to INS enforcement action. Registry workers \nalso will receive housing benefits, either on-site housing, or a \nhousing allowance.\n\n  4. Put a stop to the horrible practice of smuggling human lives. \nUnder the current state of affairs, every day, human beings are dying--\ncrammed into the back of vans, dehydrating in the California deserts, \nor murdered for the thousand dollars they are willing to pay for a \nsecretive trip across the border and a set of false documents.\n  They are drawn here by the jobs, many of them farmwork jobs. They put \ntheir lives on the line to work in an underground economy. They keep \nfood on our table, and our economy growing.\n  Let us take this underground system above ground. Offer a simple, \nreliable way to bring temporary, legal foreign workers here, paid at \nwages that will not disadvantage any American workers and protected by \nall labor laws and standards.\n  5. Don't hurt any other immigration category. All of this can be \naccomplished without taking away from any current immigration numbers.\n  H-2A workers workers, by definition, are in our country for \ntemporary, seasonal work--and they return home\n\n[[Page S8671]]\n\nwhen the job is done. They will not swell the population of the United \nStates, or become a burden on our social safety net.\n  They will work side by side with the domestic workforce in one of the \nmost important, but difficult, jobs in our society: putting fresh \nfruit, fresh vegetables, perishable delicacies on our plates each and \nevery meal.\n  Please join me in this bipartisan effort to simplify this complex \nsystem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. D'Amato, and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 2338. A bill to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \nStates to provide for equitable duty treatment for certain wool used in \nmaking suits; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n   legislation to provide equitable treatment for certain wool fabric\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to \ncorrect a glaring competitive imbalance that has arisen because of an \nanomaly in our tariff schedule. Hickey-Freeman has produced fine \ntailored suits in Rochester, New York since 1899. Nearly a century. \nHowever, the U.S. tariff schedule currently makes it difficult for \nHickey-Freeman to continue producing such suits in the United States.\n  The facts are straight-forward. Companies like Hickey-Freeman that \nmust import the very high quality wool fabric used to make men's and \nboys' suits pay a tariff of 31.7 percent. They compete with companies \nthat import finished wool suits from a number of countries. If these \nimported suits are from Canada, the importers pay no tariff whatever. \nIf the suits are imported from Mexico, the tariff is 11 percent. From \nother countries, the importers pay a duty of 20.2 percent. Clearly, \ndomestic manufacturers of wool suits are put at a significant price \ndisadvantage. Indeed, the tariff structure provides an incentive to \nimport finished suits from abroad, rather than manufacture them in the \nUnited States.\n  The bill I am introducing today, along with Senators D'Amato and \nSpecter, would correct this problem, at least temporarily. It suspends \nthrough December 31, 2004 the duty on the finest wool fabrics (known in \nthe trade as Super 90s or higher grade--fabrics that are produced in \nonly very limited quantities in the United States. And it would reduce \nthe duty for slightly lower grade but still very fine wool fabric \n(Super 70's and Super 80's) to 20.2 percent--the same duty as on \nfinished wool suits. The bill also provides that, in the event the \nPresident proclaim a duty reduction on wool suits, corresponding \nchanges would be made to the tariffs applicable to `Super 70's' and \n`Super 80's' grade wool fabric.\n  This bill would correct a troublesome tariff inversion that puts U.S. \nwool suit producers at a serious competitive disadvantage. It is a \nsmall step toward modifying a tariff schedule that favors foreign \nproducers of wools suits at the expense of U.S. suit makers. I \ntherefore urge my colleagues to join me in supporting its adoption, and \nask for unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2338\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DUTY TREATMENT OF CERTAIN FABRICS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 99 of the \n     Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States is amended--\n       (1) by adding at the end of the U.S. notes the following \n     new note:\n       ``13.

Mr. President, today I support this important \nlegislation to eliminate tariff duties on certain wool fabrics. \nCurrently, there exists a disparity in the tariff schedule which forces \ncompanies like Hickey-Freeman, in Rochester, New York and Learbury in \nSyracuse, New York, who import very high quality wool fabric, to pay a \ntariff of 31.7 percent.\n  These same finished suits imported from Canada come into the United \nStates tariff free. If the suits are imported from Mexico, there is an \n11 percent tariff and from other countries, the tariff rate is 20.2 \npercent. This inverted tariff schedule actually provides an incentive \nto import suits rather than produce them here in the United States with \ndomestic labor and domestic wool.\n  This straightforward, clear legislation would suspend through \nDecember 31, 2004 the duty on the finest wool fabrics (known \nspecifically as Super 90s weight or higher grade wool). These higher \nquality fabrics are produced in very limited quantities in the United \nStates, so this tariff reduction would have no negative impact on \ndomestic producers.\n  Clearly, if there were enough of this wool fabric produced \ndomestically, there would be no need for this legislation since \nsuitmakers would not need to import wool and pay the extortionately \nhigh rate of 31.7 percent. Indeed, if the U.S. suit manufacturing \nindustry is allowed to compete fairly with imported suits, and not \nforced to reduce costs just to pay for inverted tariff rates, domestic \nwool use will actually increase with the additional suits that will be \nmanufactured in the United States.\n  Additionally, the provision would reduce the duty for slightly lower \ngrade, fine wool fabric (Super 70s and 80s) to 20.2 percent--the same \nduty as on finished wool suits.\n  Mr. President, under current law, if two fabric buyers, one American \nand the other Canadian, purchase fabric from a foreign country, say \nItaly, they each pay the exact same price. Yet when they bring the \nfabric back to their country to be made into suits that is where the \nproblem occurs.\n  The American is forced to pay a tariff of 31.7 percent on the \nimported fabric, which then must be absorbed into the cost of the suit, \nor eaten by the manufacturer. The Canadian buyer pays no tariff. \nAdditionally, the Canadian suit maker can then export to the U.S., and \nbecause of the NAFTA agreement, they pay no tariff. As a result, \nCanadian shipments of men's suits into the United States has gone from \n0 to 1.5 million in only ten years.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely concerned with the current wool tariff \nbecause this inverted tariff policy has negatively impacted U.S. jobs. \nU.S. production has fallen by 40 percent and jobs by 50 percent. And, \nMr. President, this additional tariff raises the costs for consumers as \nwell.\n  I am proud to join with Senators Moynihan and Specter in this \nimportant legislation, and look forward to its early passage and \nenactment into law.\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues, \nSenators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alfonso\n\n[[Page S8672]]\n\nD'Amato, to introduce a bill that will keep high paying jobs in the \ndomestic tailored wool apparel industry in America. This bill will \nsuspend the duty on certain high quality wool fabrics used in American \ngarment manufacturing.\n  The duty rates on imported wool fabrics continued to be among the \nhighest rates imposed on products in the U.S. tariff schedules. Because \nthe duty on these fabrics exceeds the duty on imported garments by \nabout 20 percent, the duty schedule penalizes those American companies \nwhich keep their production here in the U.S.\n  A special ``finished product'' concession made in the Canada Free \nTrade Agreement (and later NAFTA) has greatly exacerbated the problem. \nThe concession allows Canadian companies to use imported, duty-free \nwool fabric to manufacture men's suits, which are in turn shipped duty-\nfree into the U.S. As a result, over the past decade Canadian shipments \nof suits into the U.S. have surged from nearly zero to approximately \none and a half million units shipped annually.\n  During the same time frame, production by the U.S. tailored clothing \nindustry has dropped 40 percent and the number of employees has been \ncut in almost half, from 58,000 to 30,000 employees. In my home state \nof Pennsylvania, the high-end tailored men's clothing industry provides \nhigh paying jobs in the cities of Reading, Ashland, Easton, \nShippensberg and Philadelphia, but since 1991, Pennsylvania has lost \nover 3000 jobs due to plant closings.\n  This duty has a real, direct and substantial effect on American jobs. \nSuspension of the duty on these fabrics will level the playing field \nwith foreign manufacturers and allow the U.S. industry to compete, \nsaving American jobs. I therefore urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting its adoption.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, earlier today a group of my colleagues \nrepresenting both sides of the aisle joined together to announce that \nwe would be introducing legislation to increase the security in the \nretirement of Americans. I want to especially recognize my colleague, \nSenator Grassley, who has put a tremendous amount of effort into this \nlegislation and, through his position as Chair of the Aging Committee, \nhas demonstrated his commitment to the well-being of older Americans. \nSenator Grassley and I recognize that for our Nation to solve what \nwould be one of this generation's greatest challenges, building a \nretirement security for today's workers, we need to move in a \ncommonsense, bipartisan fashion.\n  Many of the original cosponsors of this bill were key in crafting the \nsections of this legislation. Senator Grassley's efforts have expanded \nfairness for women and families and focused on the benefits of \nretirement education. Senator Baucus has brought the ideas that \nexpanded pension coverage and eased administration burdens on America's \nsmall businesses. Portability, so important as we become a more mobile \nsociety, received the specific attention of Senator Jeffords. All \nbusinesses will have the hard work of Senator Hatch to thank for many \nof the regulatory relief and administrative simplification elements of \nthis bill. And Senator Breaux, who focused on the big picture of \nretirement security leading the CSIS task force, has incorporated some \nof his ideas and the ideas of that task force into the legislation that \nwe introduced this evening.\n  Throughout this process of putting the bill together, our principal \ntask has been one to listen and attempt to understand what we were \nhearing. We listened at the recent SAVER Summit, which was held here in \nWashington, DC, held at the direction of this Congress. We listened at \ntown hall meetings throughout our States. We have listened at the \nRetirement Security Summit, which I held in January of this year in \nTampa, FL, and the Women's Summit, which I held in Orlando in April.\n  The ideas have come from pension actuaries, tax attorneys, Cabinet \nleaders, and some of the best ideas from everyday Americans. I want to \nthank those who have endorsed our proposal.\n  Mr. President, with reason, much of the public debate has now focused \non President Clinton's call to ``Save Social Security first.'' I wish \nto say, as the Senator from New Hampshire has just commented, I, too, \nbenefited by the remarks that were made this evening by the Senator \nfrom Minnesota on what is happening on a global basis, in terms of \nmeeting the type of problems which we face in providing retirement \nsecurity for Americans. We all agree, on both sides of the aisle, that \nwe need to assure that Social Security is as viable for my nine \ngrandchildren and all of their peers, as it was for my parents and will \nbe for me. However, Social Security is only one part of the picture. \nPensions and personal savings will make up an ever-increasing part of \nretirement security. So, when Congress takes action to assure the \nfuture of Social Security, we are only addressing one-third of the \nproblem. Our bill addresses the other two-thirds of the problem.\n  Social Security will play less of a role for each succeeding \ngeneration of Americans. We must develop personal savings. We must \nassure that years of work pay off in reliable pensions. Our bill will \nhelp hard-working Americans build personal retirement savings through \ntheir employers, through 401(k)s, through payroll deduction IRAs, \nthrough higher limits on savings. The employers and workers both will \nwin. Employers get simpler pension systems with less administrative \nburden and more loyal employees, and workers build a secure retirement \nand watch savings accumulate over their years of work.\n  How, specifically, will our bill help? The first focus of our bill is \nsmall business. The reason for this primary focus is because this is \nwhere the greatest difficulties in achieving retirement security are \nlodged.\n  Fifty-one million American workers have no retirement plan at work--\n51 million Americans without any retirement plan at the place of their \nemployment; 21 million of these employees work in small businesses. The \nproblem: Statistics indicate that only a small percentage of workers in \nfirms of less than 100 employees have access to a retirement plan.\n  This chart indicates that there is a direct correlation between the \nnumber of employees in a business and the likelihood that there will be \na pension retirement plan. Firms with less than 25 employees have a \nretirement plan of 20.2 percent. Firms of 100 or more have a proportion \nof retirement plans of almost 85 percent.\n  We are particularly focusing our attention on these smallest firms \nwhich are the least likely to have retirement plans, but which are the \nfastest growing segment of our economy. In the State of Florida, these \nfirms of less than 25 have represented well over 70 percent of the job \ngrowth in our State in the last 5 years.\n  We take a step forward in eliminating one of the principal hurdles \nthat small businesses face when establishing a pension plan.\n  What is that problem? It is the Federal Government having two hands: \nOn the one hand, the Federal Government is encouraging these businesses \nto start pension plans, but when they hand out the second hand, they \nfind that the Federal Government wants a palm turned up because the \nFederal Government is asking for up to $1,000 for a small business to \nregister its plan with the Internal Revenue Service.\n  We eliminate this fee for small businesses. We need to encourage \nsmall businesses to start plans, not discourage them with high \nregistration fees.\n  Mr. President, the second target of our legislation is women and \nfamilies. Historically speaking, women live longer than men. Therefore, \nthey need greater savings for retirement because they will have to \nstretch those savings over more years of life. Yet, our pension and \nretirement laws do not reflect this fundamental reality. Women are more \nmobile than men, moving in and out of the workforce due to family \nresponsibilities. Thus, they are less likely to vest in a retirement \nsystem. Most retirement systems require a minimum period of time before \nthe employee becomes eligible and has a legal entitlement to the \nretirement funds. Women are the least likely to meet those minimum \nyears of employment.\n  As this chart indicates, of women retirees today, 68 percent of women \nwho retire have no retirement benefits; fewer than 32 percent have a \npension for their retirement.\n  Currently, two-thirds of working women are employed in sectors of the \neconomy that are unlikely to offer a retirement plan--service and \nretail and small businesses.\n\n[[Page S8673]]\n\n  What is the solution? In an effort to address one of the problems of \npreparing for a longer life expectancy, we realistically adjust upward \nthe age at which you must start withdrawing funds from your own 401(k) \nor other similar pension instrument.\n  Under the current law, you must, you are obligated to start \nwithdrawing money from your retirement plan once you reach the age of \n70\\1/2\\, 70 years and 6 months. At the age of 70 years and 6 months, \nyou are obligated to commence the process of withdrawing funds from \nyour retirement plan. However, a woman at the age of 70 can still have \nthree decades to look forward to in retirement. I know this because I \nrepresent many of these wonderful people in my State of Florida.\n\n  At the retirement summit I hosted in Tampa, several retirees \nmentioned that they wanted to keep their money in retirement savings \nfor as long as possible. We propose to raise the 70 years and 6 months \nage to 75 for mandatory distribution. We do this for both genders, \nbecause I am happy to say that men are also living longer. It just \nhappens that women will be the most affected group of Americans by this \nproposal.\n  We go beyond raising the age from 70 years and 6 months to 75 years \nby also providing that $300,000 of any defined benefit contribution \nplan will be exempt from minimum distribution rules.\n  This accomplishes several important objectives: Simplifying the \nbureaucracy for thousands of Americans who have less than $300,000 in \ntheir retirement fund, and protecting a vital nest egg for the last \nyears of retirement so that items such as long-term care and other \nexpenses that are part of the aging process can be covered.\n  Next, Mr. President, we deal with the issue of increasing \nportability. Over an average 40-year career, the current U.S. worker \nwill have seven different employers. This represents a dramatic shift \nfrom the current worker's employment pattern from that of their \ngrandparents where it was common for a person to commence their career \nand end their career with the same employer.\n  We have the possibility of a generation of American workers who \nretire with many small retirement accounts, creating a complex maze of \nstatements and features different for each account.\n  The solution that we propose includes addressing one element of this \nby allowing employees, such as teachers, who happen to move from one \nState to another, to buy into their current locality's defined benefit \npension system through the purchase of service credits so that when \nthey retire, they will have one retirement account. It is easier to \nmonitor, less complicated to maintain records about and builds a more \nsecure retirement for the worker.\n  The next issue that our legislation confronts is that of reducing red \ntape and administrative complexities. As I mentioned earlier, 51 \nmillion Americans have no pensions. The main obstacle that companies \nface in establishing a retirement program is often bureaucratic \nadministrative burden.\n  For example, for a small plan, the plan that would deal with \ncompanies that have 25 or fewer employees--in this case, the specific \nexample is for a plan with 15 employees--it costs $228 per employee per \nyear just to comply with all the forms, tests and regulations required \nto maintain a pension plan.\n  We have a commonsense remedy to one of the most vexing problems in \npension administration: figuring out how much money to contribute to \nthe company's plan. It is a complex formula of facts, statistics and \nassumptions under the current law. We want to be able to say to plans \nthat you have no problem with underfunding. To help make these \ncalculations, you can use the prior year's data to make the proper \ncontribution, and if you do so, you will not be subject to any after-\nthe-fact sanctions. You don't have to re-sort through the numbers each \nand every year. If your plan is sound, use reliable data from the \nprevious year and then verify when all the final details are available. \nCompanies will be able to calculate and then budget, not wait until \nfigures and rates out of their control are released by external \nsources.\n  Another issue is pension security. Under current law, companies \ncannot fully fund their pension determination liability; that is, \nprovide for a sufficient amount of funding in their pension retirement \ntrust fund to be able to fund that particular pension to its full \nactuarial amount.\n  The inability to do so puts workers at risk that the appropriate \nfunds will not be available when their workforce retires. Solution? It \nmakes little sense for the Federal Government to discourage companies \nfrom fully funding their pension plans. We propose to repeal this \nlimit, the limit that keeps companies from fully funding their plan. In \nlast year's tax bill we phased this limit up. Now we have a chance to \ntake the final step and allow companies the flexibility to put more \nmoney in their pension plans when their economic circumstances allow.\n  The next provision in our legislation, Mr. President, encourages \nretirement education. The unfortunate reality is that many Americans do \nnot prepare for retirement because they just do not know that they need \nto. It has been said in jest, but unfortunately it happens in too many \ncases--it is true--that Americans spend more time planning a 2-week \nsummer vacation than they do 20 or 30 or more years of retirement.\n  Studies show that with education, participation rates in retirement \nsavings vehicles jump dramatically. Eighty-one percent of Americans say \nretirement education has encouraged them to earmark more money for the \nfuture. So as Americans have a better understanding of what is involved \nin retirement--the financial aspects of retirement, the issues of \npersonal health, issues of utilization of leisure time, and all of the \nother challenges that come in retirement--Americans respond as we would \nexpect, with intelligence and appropriate steps to protect their and \ntheir families' interests.\n  Our solution is to let the Federal Government serve as a role model. \nPrograms already in place to educate our own Federal employees about \nthe need to prepare for retirement should be broadly shared with other \nfirms, both private and public. We ask that the paradigm for these \ndiscussions be made available to the general public so that they can be \nused by American workers who are employed by organizations beyond the \nFederal Government.\n  We also ask that the Small Business Administration, which is so \nhelpful to America's entrepreneurs in getting ventures off the ground \nand expanding when times are right, be involved in outreach in the \nretirement arena. Through web sites, brochures, whatever means they \nfeel best, the Small Business Administration can help spread the word \non what has already been accomplished--simple accounts, payroll \ndeduction IRAs, and more--and keep businesses up to date with each \nopportunity to save for a secure retirement.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who have worked so hard on this \nmeasure. I ask for the support of those in this Chamber on this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues, Senator \nGraham, Senator Hatch, Senator Breaux, Senator Baucus, and Senator \nJeffords to introduce bipartisan pension reform legislation. This \nlegislation, the Pension Coverage and Portability Act of 1998, will go \na long way toward improving the pension system in this country.\n  Promoting retirement income security seems to be on everyone's mind \nthese days if the number of pension bills now pending in Congress is \nany indication. But I think that our leaders need to understand that \npension legislation should be a priority for prompt action by Congress \nand the President.\n  Let me try to explain: For better or worse, the most important \ncomponent of retirement income is the Social Security program. But our \nnation is about to experience a demographic shift of very large \nproportions that will have a very negative impact on Social Security. \nMy state is already feeling the impact of this shift.\n  The state of Iowa has the most people over the age of 85 as a percent \nof the population. Iowa has the third highest percentage of people over \nthe age of 65. There is a popular statistic relating to the incomes of \nelderly households we hear a lot--that Social Security is the most \nimportant source of income for more than 80 percent of elderly \nAmericans. Knowing the demographics of my state, you can imagine\n\n[[Page S8674]]\n\nhow often I hear about Social Security and the feeling that Social \nSecurity isn't enough.\n  It's hard to tell an 82 year old widow that Social Security was never \nsupposed to be enough. Future retirees seem to understand this, as we \nhave seen a number of surveys indicating that Gen Xers do not believe \nSocial Security will be the most important source of income once they \nretire.\n  But their income will have to come from somewhere. Many workers will \nbe able to rely on increased income from pensions. Unfortunately, right \nnow, one half of our workforce is not participating in a pension plan.\n  Mr. President, you know the statistics just as well as I do. Coverage \nlevels have been consistent over the last decade but among small \nemployers, coverage is low.\n  In June, the Employee Benefit Research Institute released the Small \nEmployer Retirement Survey. This survey is very instructive for \nlegislators.\n  Small employers identified three main reasons for not offering a \nplan. The first reason is that small employers believe their employees \nprefer increased wages or other types of benefits. The second reason \nemployers don't offer plans is the administrative costs. And the third \nmost important reason for not offering a plan: uncertain revenue, which \nmakes it difficult to commit to a plan.\n  Combine these barriers with the responsibilities of a small employer, \nand we can understand why coverage among small employers has not \nincreased. Small employers who may just be starting out in business are \nalready squeezing every penny. These employers are also people who open \nup the business in the morning, talk to customers, do the marketing, \npay the bills, and just do not know how they can take on the additional \nduties, responsibilities, and liabilities of sponsoring a pension plan.\n  I firmly believe that an increase in the number of people covered by \npension plans will occur only when small employers have more \nsubstantial incentives to establish pension plans.\n  The Pension Coverage and Portability Act contains provisions which \nwill provide more flexibility for small employers, relief from \nburdensome rules and regulations, and a tax incentive to start new \nplans for their employees. One of the new top heavy provisions we have \nendorsed is an exemption from top heavy rules for employers who adopt \nthe 401(k) safe harbor. This safe harbor will take effect in 1999. When \nthe Treasury Department wrote the regulations and considered whether \nsafe harbor plans should also have to satisfy the top heavy rules, they \nanswered in the affirmative. As a result, a small employer would have \nto make a contribution of 7 percent of pay for each employee, a very \ncostly proposition.\n  My colleagues and I also have included a provision which repeals user \nfees for new plan sponsors seeking determination letters from the IRS. \nThese fees can run from $100 to more than $1,000, depending on the type \nof plan. Given the need to promote retirement plan formation, we \nbelieve this ``rob Peter to pay Paul'' approach needs to be eliminated.\n  We have also looked at the lack of success of SIMPLE 401(k) plans. A \nsurvey by the Investment Company Institute found that SIMPLE IRAs have \nproven successful, with almost 100,000 participants. However, SIMPLE \n401(k)s just haven't taken off. A couple of the reasons may be that the \nlimits on SIMPLE 401(k)s are tighter than for the IRAs.\n  Our bill equalizes the compensation limits for these plans; in \naddition, we have also increased the annual limit on both SIMPLEs to \n$8,000.\n  One of the more revolutionary proposals is the creation of a Salary \nReduction SIMPLE with a limit of $4,000. Unlike other SIMPLEs, the \nemployer makes no match or automatic contributions. The employer match \nis usually a strong incentive for a low-income employee to participate \nin a savings plan. We hope that small employers will look at this \nSIMPLE as a transition plan, in place for just a couple of years during \nthe initial stages of business operation--then adopt a more expansive \nplan when the business is profitable.\n  The other targeted areas in the legislation include: Enhancing \npension coverage for women.\n  Women are more at risk of living in poverty as they age. They need \nmore ways to save because of periodic departures from the workforce. To \nincrease their saving capacity, we have also included a proposal \nsimilar to legislation I sponsored earlier this year, S. 1856, the \nEnhanced Savings Opportunities Act. Like S. 1856, the proposal repeals \nthe 25% of salary contribution limit on defined contribution plans. \nThis limit has seriously impeded savings by women, as well as low- and \nmid-salary employees.\n  I prefer this approach to a catch-up provision. Catch-ups would most \nlikely be voluntary on the part of the employer, do not encourage \nsavings over working life, and do not necessarily help low and mid-\nsalary people. Repealing 415(c) is a simplifier, and will allow anyone \ncovered by a defined contribution plan to benefit.\n  The bill also contains proposals which promote new opportunities to \nrollover accounts from an old employer to a new employer. The lack of \nportability among plans is one of the weak links in our current pension \nsystem. This new bill contains technical improvements which will help \nease the implementation of portability among the different types of \ndefined contribution plans.\n  Finally, I would like to point out a couple of other provisions in \nthe bill. The first is the new requirement that plan sponsors \nautomatically provide benefit statements to their participants on a \nperiodic basis. For defined contribution plans, the statement would be \nrequired annually. For defined benefit plans, a statement would be \nrequired every three years. There is a very strong lack of \nunderstanding among participants about how their pensions work. There \nis also a high percentage of people who have done nothing to plan for \ntheir retirement.\n  Providing clear and understandable benefit statements to pension plan \nparticipants would encourage people to think about how much money they \ncan expect to receive in retirement. Further, a benefit statement will \nhelp people ensure that the information their employer maintains about \nthem is accurate. Almost 80 percent of employers who sponsor defined \nbenefit plans are providing some type of benefit statement \nautomatically. All participants need these statements.\n  This provision joins other proposals in a new section targeted at \nencouraging retirement education. Education can make a difference to \nworkers. In fact, in companies which provide investment education, we \nknow workers benefitted because many of them changed their investment \nallocations to more accurately reflect their investment horizons.\n  A new provision that I encourage my colleagues to carefully consider \ntargets the problem of participation by proposing an incentive for \nnegative enrollment or ``opt-out'' plans. My staff and I were familiar \nwith the example set by McDonald's Corp. which utilizes opt-out plans \nfor their employees. But McDonald's was concerned that they might get \nin trouble with government regulators for operating their plan as an \nopt-out. President Clinton announced that McDonald's plan was legal--\nand encouraged other employers to try opt-out plans. This bill includes \nan incentive for employers to create opt-out plans that we hope will \nincrease participation among low-salary workers.\n  This legislation joins a number of other strong proposals now pending \nin the House and here in the Senate. This legislation includes \nprovisions which reflect some of those same proposals. I want to \ncommend the sponsors of those bills. Our legislation has a lot in \ncommon with these other pension bills and we need to push for fast and \nfavorable consideration of, at a minimum, the similar provisions in our \nlegislation.\n  We have a window of opportunity to act. The Baby Boomers are coming. \nThe letters from AARP are starting to arrive in their mailboxes. The \nSocial Security Administration is starting to stagger the delivery of \nbenefit checks in preparation for their retirement. Many elderly \nhouseholds rely too heavily on Social Security. Future retirees will \nnot be able to rely on all of the benefits now provided by Social \nSecurity. We can look to the pension system to pick up where Social \nSecurity leaves off, but we need to act.\n\n[[Page S8675]]\n\n  I thank the other co-sponsors of this legislation for all of their \nwork, and I encourage our colleagues to give strong consideration to \nco-sponsoring this bill. With concerted, bipartisan action, we can \nimprove the pension system. Pensions for today's workers will \nsubstantially improve the retirement outlook for millions of Americans. \nBut we have some work to do if pensions are going to fulfill their \npromise.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, most people my age have known the \nheartache of having to watch their parents grow old. It is a sad day in \na person's life when they see their father get his first gray hair. Or \nthe day you notice lines in your mother's face where previously, there \nwere none.\n  This aging process is made worse by the scary and very real \npossibility that too many people who will become senior citizens in the \nnext several years are not at all prepared for the transition from work \nto retirement.\n  To be honest, it isn't our parents who we need to worry about so \nmuch. They survived the Depression. They know what it takes to get by \nduring the lean years--it takes planning and saving. Putting money \naside, when it might be easier to spend it in the moment.\n  Those are the values that our parents live by. They are the values we \nwould do well to heed. And even better to teach those who will follow \nus.\n  We as a nation have lost our imperative to save. Personal savings \nrates have dropped to 3.8 percent of our Gross Domestic Product, the \nlowest in 58 years.\n  Fifty-one million Americans in our nation's workforce have no pension \ncoverage. But statistics like those don't tell the whole story. They \ndon't do justice to the hardscrabble struggles that real people go \nthrough every day. Struggles that involve agonizing questions like: \n``Should I eat today or take my medication?'' or ``Will I be able to \nheat my house this winter?''\n  Make no mistake, our nation's lack of saving for retirement is a \ntragedy in the making.\n  That is why I am so proud to join my colleagues in introducing this \nlegislation.\n  A bill that will make it easier for Americans to put money aside, and \na bill that will help move pension issues to the forefront of \nAmericans' minds. A bill that will:\n  Expand coverage for small businesses because they have a harder time \naffording health care and retirement plans;\n  Enhance pension fairness for women because they fall into categories \nthat have a harder time saving;\n  Increase the portability of pension plans so that when you change \njobs you don't have to worry about where your savings will go;\n  Strengthen pension security and enforcement so you can rest easy at \nnight, knowing your money is safe;\n  Reduce red tape so it's easier for employers to give their workers \nretirement options;\n  And encourage retirement education so that husbands and wives, \nparents and children, talk to each other--make plans for their future. \nAnd know what to expect tomorrow and down the road.\n  One aspect of the bill I am particularly proud of are the small \nbusiness provisions. Thirty-eight million of the people in this country \nwho do not have a pension plan work at small businesses. Eighty percent \nof all small business employees have no pension coverage.\n  In my state of Montana, more than 95 percent of our businesses are \nsmall businesses. And almost 9 out of 10 offer no pension plans. We \ncannot let these hard-working Americans down.\n  Currently, most small businesses can't afford pension plans. They \nwould like to, but they just can't make ends meet.\n  Our bill makes it a smart business decision for small business owners \nto offer retirement plans.\n  I have made it my priority to work with members of the small business \ncommunity, both back in Montana and nationally, to identify legislative \nsolutions that will most readily enable small businesses to offer \npension plans to their employees. While this bill does not include \nevery recommendation we received, it does represent a collection of \nhigh-priority proposals which we believe could be supported by a bi-\npartisan majority of Congress.\n  The major provisions in this bill which would help small businesses \nstart and maintain pension plans include the following:\n  To help make pension plans more affordable we have included two new \ntax credits: one to help defray start-up costs and the other to defray \nthe cost of employer contributions to pension plans;\n  In addition, we provide for the elimination of some fees.\n  To address the problems the small business community has identified \nas a major impediment to establishing pension plans, we make \nsignificant changes in the top-heavy rules that limit employer \ncontributions to plans.\n  To address concerns of our smallest businesses, who want to provide \npensions but can only afford `start-up' plans at first, we provide \nincreases in income limits that apply to SIMPLE pension plans, along \nwith a new, salary-reduction SIMPLE plan;\n  And for those employers that want to provide the security of a \ndefined benefit plan for their employees but cannot because of the \nincreased regulatory burden, we create a simplified defined benefit \nplan for small business.\n  These provisions are designed to address the problems of cost and \ncomplexity that are a barrier to so many small businesses. They will \nhelp small employers establish a pattern of saving for themselves and \ntheir employees.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Pension Coverage and Portability Act will \nspearhead a national debate on how to improve employer-provide pensions \nin this country.\n  This debate is essential if we are to achieve our goal of making \nAmerica in the next century, not only strong as a nation, but strong as \na community of individuals confident in the security of their financial \nfutures.\n  This is a good, bi-partisan bill. It takes the positive steps we as a \nnation need to put our future in safe hands.\n  I am eager for the coming debate on this bill.\n  I hope it sparks a debate in the coffee shops and kitchen tables all \nacross the country. Working together, and with this bill, we can turn a \nnation of spenders, into a nation of savers.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record letters from the Profit Sharing 401(k) Council of America, \nthe American Society of Pension Actuaries, the Association of Private \nPension and Welfare Plans, and the National Association of State \nRetirement Administrators, all of whom endorse this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Profit Sharing 401(K)\n\n\n                                           Council of America,\n\n                                       Chicago, IL, July 21, 1998.\n\n            The Pension Coverage and Portability Act of 1998\n\n       The Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America commends \n     Senators Graham, Grassley, Baucus, Breaux, Jeffords, D'Amato, \n     Hatch, and Kerrey for this comprehensive reform and updating \n     of the regulation of private pensions. We believe that this \n     legislation identifies and removes many barriers to \n     increasing retirement security for working Americans. Areas \n     of particular interest to our members include the \n     modification of top-heavy rules, the elimination of the \n     percentage of salary limit, and the removal of elective \n     deferrals from the employer deduction calculation.\n       The Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America (PSCA) is a \n     non-profit association that for the past fifty years has \n     represented companies that sponsor profit sharing and 401(k) \n     plans for their employees. PSCA has approximately 1200 \n     company-members who employ approximately 3 million plan \n     participants throughout the United States. PSCA's members \n     range in size from a six employee parts distributor to firms \n     with hundreds of thousands of employees.\n       We look forward to working together to achieve \n     implementation of this important bill.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               American Society of\n\n\n                                            Pension Actuaries,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 21, 1998.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the American Society of \n     Pension Actuaries, I am writing to express our strong support \n     for the Pension Coverage and Portability Act of 1998. This \n     comprehensive legislation recognizes the important role \n     played by the private pension system in providing retirement \n     savings for Americans.\n       By simplifying the complicated tax laws governing \n     retirement plans, your legislation is a significant step in \n     the right direction that will encourage retirement plan \n     formation and expansion. Current law, and the thousands of \n     pages of accompanying regulations, have gone too far. Though \n     intended to\n\n[[Page S8676]]\n\n     increase access to private pension savings, these laws and \n     regulations have actually had an opposite effect, leaving \n     millions of American workers without an easy way to save \n     adequately for retirement.\n       ASPA represents over 3,000 pension professionals who \n     provide services to approximately one-third of the qualified \n     retirement plans in the United States. The vast majority of \n     these plans are maintained by small businesses. Our members \n     have first-hand knowledge of the existing regulatory barriers \n     preventing retirement plan formation and retention by \n     employers. We believe the provisions in your legislation, \n     including the new simplified defined benefit plan for small \n     business called the SAFE plan, the elimination of the 25 \n     percent of compensation limit on plan contributions, and the \n     relaxation of the top-heavy rules, will encourage employers \n     to offer pension plans for their employees, and will make it \n     easier for employees to increase their own retirement \n     savings.\n       Again, ASPA thanks you for your work on retirement issues. \n     The Pension Coverage and Portability Act sends a strong \n     message that current regulations have gone too far. We look \n     forward to working with you to move this bill through the \n     legislative process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Brian Graff,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Association of Private Pension\n\n\n                                             and Welfare Plans\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 1998.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am writing on behalf of the \n     Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans (APPWP) to \n     express our support for the Pension Coverage and Portability \n     Act. We commend you for your leadership in addressing the \n     need to strengthen the employer-sponsored retirement system. \n     The APPWP is the national trade association for companies \n     concerned about federal legislation and regulations affecting \n     all aspects of the employee benefits community. APPWP members \n     either sponsor directly or provide to employee benefit plans \n     covering more than 100 million Americans.\n       Your legislation represents a significant step towards \n     improving the rules governing the employer sponsored \n     retirement system upon which millions of Americans rely for a \n     majority of their retirement income. More specifically, we \n     believe that passage of this legislation will expand \n     coverage, particularly among small businesses, allow \n     employers to design their plans to more effectively meet \n     their workers' needs and increase portability and \n     preservation of retirement income.\n       In particular, we are pleased that you recognize the need \n     to include provisions that reduce the complexity and improve \n     the incentives for maintaining a retirement plan such as \n     repeal of the ``same desk rule,'' relief from the overly \n     restrictive ``anti-cut back rules,'' modification of the top-\n     heavy and minimum distribution rules, simplification of the \n     ESOP dividend reinvestment rules and relief from the \n     anomalies of the mechanical nondiscrimination rules.\n       However, as you continue your work on an improved employer-\n     sponsored retirement system, we urge you to consider two \n     major savings incentives that regrettably have not been \n     included in the bill. As we discussed with you when you spoke \n     to our Board of Directors last September, increasing the \n     contribution limits and adding a ``catch-up'' contribution \n     provision would encourage plan participants to save more for \n     retirement. The need for American workers to save more \n     effectively was recently highlighted at the National Summit \n     on Retirement Savings and we believe it is critical that \n     Congress acknowledge its importance by providing increased \n     incentives. As you have recognized by the Pension Coverage \n     and Portability Act, the employer-sponsored retirement system \n     plays a vital role in assuring that Americans have adequate \n     retirement incomes. We look forward to working with you to \n     improve the savings incentives in employer-sponsored \n     retirement plans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James A. Klein,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Association of State Retirement Administrators,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 1998.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       RE: Support Public Pension Portability Provisions the \n     Senate Bipartisan Pension Tax Package\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of our nation's State \n     retirement plans and the millions of public employees, \n     retirees and beneficiaries who they cover, the National \n     Association of State Retirement Administrators (NASRA) \n     supports public pension provisions contained in the Senate \n     Bipartisan Pension Tax Package.\n       In particular, we support provisions in your legislation \n     that promote portability between various defined contribution \n     and deferred compensation plans, and that allow funds from \n     all of these plans to be used to purchase permissive service \n     credits in public defined benefit plans. We also applaud \n     provisions that would remove certain pension limitations.\n       All of these provisions would help employees build and \n     strengthen their retirement savings, especially those who \n     have worked among various public, non-profit and private \n     institutions. Our organization is very grateful for your \n     leadership on former public pension legislation, and commends \n     you on your continued work in this area.\n           Sincerely,\n     M. Dee Williams,\n       President.\n     Richard E. Schumacher,\n       Immediate Past President, Chair, Legislative Committee.\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am glad to cosponsor the \nPension Coverage and Portability Act of 1998, (PCPA). I cosponsored the \npredecessor bill, S. 889 with senators Graham, Hatch, and others, and \nPCPA is a natural follow-on to S. 889.\n  This bill will encourage pension plan sponsorship among small \nbusinesses and make it easier for the small business man or woman to \nhave greater confidence in government oversight of their plan and that \nthey will not have to constantly hire services of actuaries, \naccountants and tax attorneys and investment advisers once they \nestablish it. The bill makes it easier to implement a payroll deduction \nIRA, it provides for a simplified defined benefit pension plan, it \nallows a payroll deduction SIMPLE plan with limits twice as high as \nthose currently available to IRAs, it eliminates IRS registration fees \nfor new plans and provides a tax credit for plan start up, as well as \nmany other things.\n  The bill also eases the top-heavy rules. In the days when the only \nsmall pension plans belonged to doctor's and lawyer's offices, the top \nheavy rules were needed to assure non-discrimination in provision of \nbenefits. But instead of expanding coverage, the top heavy rules now \ntend to impose harsh requirements on the small business owner which \ndeters him or her from even offering a plan. This bill makes changes to \nthe top heavy rules in constructive and thoughtful ways, such as by \nchanging the family aggregation rules, taking employee elective \ncontributions into account for purposes of meeting the standards and \nsimplifying the definition of `key employee'.\n  The bill makes pension plans more portable, a feature that is \ndesperately needed in today's highly mobile workforce. Senator Graham \nhas incorporated the body of S. 2329, the bill that he, Senator \nBingaman and I introduced recently, as Title III of PCPA. Our bill \neases rollovers, allows rollovers of after-tax contributions, waives \nthe 60-day rule under certain circumstances, modifies the ``same-desk'' \nrule, rationalizes distribution rules and allows governmental workers \nto purchase service credit with defined contribution plan money to \nincrease their benefits in their defined benefit plans. This bill makes \nessentially the same changes.\n  In addition to encouraging plan sponsorship among small businesses \nand facilitating pension portability, the bill encourages retirement \nsavings education. It also reduces the regulatory burdens associated \nwith maintaining a plan, such as providing coverage test flexibility \nand freedom from the requirement to use mechanical nondiscrimination \ntesting rules.\n  Although I believe the vast majority of this measure takes positive \nsteps forward, I do have some misgivings about the staffing firms \nprovision included in section 108. I am cosponsoring PCPA despite the \ninclusion of section 108 in the bill, but I hope that Senator Graham \nand the other cosponsors will work with me to air the issues and try to \naddress the concerns of those who oppose this provision in as \nconstructive a manner as is appropriate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

MULTICHANNEL VIDEO PROGRAMMING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) The Congress finds that:\n       (A) Signal theft represents a serious threat to direct-to-\n     home satellite television. In the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996, Congress confirmed the applicability of penalties for \n     unauthorized decryption of direct-to-home satellite services. \n     Nevertheless, concerns remain about civil liability for such \n     unauthorized decryption.\n       (B) In view of the desire to establish competition to the \n     cable television industry, Congress authorized consumers to \n     utilize direct-to-home satellite systems for viewing video \n     programming through the Cable Communications Policy Act of \n     1984.\n       (C) Congress found in the Cable Television Consumer \n     Protection and Competition Act of 1992 that without the \n     presence of another multichannel video programming \n     distributor, a cable television operator faces no local \n     competition and that the result is undue market power for the \n     cable operator as compared to that of consumers and other \n     video programmers.\n       (D) The Federal Communications Commission, under the Cable \n     Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, \n     has the responsibility for reporting annually to the Congress \n     on the state of competition in the market for delivery of \n     multichannel video programming.\n       (E) In the Cable Television Consumer Protection and \n     Competition Act of 1992, Congress stated its policy of \n     promoting the availability to the public of a diversity of \n     views and information through cable television and other \n     video distribution media.\n       (F) Direct-to-home satellite television service is the \n     fastest growing multichannel video programming service with \n     approximately 8 million households subscribing to video \n     programming delivered by satellite carriers.\n       (G) Direct-to-home satellite television service is the \n     service that most likely can provide effective competition to \n     cable television service.\n       (H) Through the compulsory copyright license created by \n     section 119 of the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1988, \n     satellite carriers have paid a royalty fee per subscriber, \n     per month to retransmit network and superstation signals by \n     satellite to subscribers for private home viewing.\n       (I) Congress set the 1988 fees to equal the average fees \n     paid by cable television operators for the same superstation \n     and network signals.\n       (J) Effective May 1, 1992, the royalty fees payable by \n     satellite carriers were increased through compulsory \n     arbitration to $0.06 per subscriber per month for \n     retransmission of network signals and $0.175 per subscriber \n     per month for retransmission of superstation signals, \n     unless all of the programming contained in the \n     superstation signal is free from syndicated exclusivity \n     protection under the rules of the Federal Communications \n     Commission, in which case the fee was decreased to $0.14 \n     per subscriber per month. These fees were 40-70 percent \n     higher than the royalty fees paid by cable television \n     operators to retransmit the same signals.\n       (K) On October 27, 1997, the Librarian of Congress adopted \n     the recommendation of the copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel \n     and approved raising the royalty fees of satellite carriers \n     to $0.27 per subscriber per month for both superstation and \n     network signals, effective January 1, 1998.\n       (L) The fees adopted by the Librarian are 270 percent \n     higher for superstations and 900 percent higher for network \n     signals than the royalty fees paid by cable television \n     operators for the exact same signals.\n       (M) To be an effective competitive to cable, direct-to-home \n     satellite television must have access to the same programming \n     carried by its competitors and at comparable rates. In \n     addition, consumers living in areas where over-the-air \n     network signals are not available rely upon satellite \n     carriers for access to important news and entertainment.\n       (N) The Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel did not \n     adequately consider the adverse competitive effect of the \n     differential in satellite and cable royalty fees on promoting \n     competition among multichannel video programming providers \n     and the importance of evaluating the fees satellite carriers \n     pay in the context of the competitive nature of the \n     multichannel video programming marketplace.\n       (O) If the recommendation of the Copyright Arbitration \n     Royalty Panel is allowed to stand, the direct-to-home \n     satellite industry, whose total subscriber base is equivalent \n     in size to approximately 11 percent of all cable households, \n     will be paying royalties that equal half the size of the \n     cable royalty pool, thus giving satellite subscribers a \n     disproportionate burden for paying copyright royalties when \n     compared to cable television subscribers.\n       (b) DBS Signal Security.--Section 605(d) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 605) is amended by \n     adding after ``satellite\n\n[[Page S8679]]\n\n     cable programming,'' the following: ``or direct-to-home \n     satellite services,''.\n       (c) Notice of Inquiry; Report.--Section 628 of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 548) is amended by \n     adding at the end of subsection (g): ``The Commission shall, \n     within 180 days after enactment of the Act making \n     appropriations for the Department of Commerce, Justice, and \n     State, the Judiciary and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     evolving September 30, 1998, initiate a notice of inquiry to \n     determine that best way in which to facilitate the \n     retransmission of distant broadcast signals such that it is \n     more consistent with the 1992 Cable Act's goal of promoting \n     competition in the market for delivery of multichannel video \n     programming and the public interest. The Commission also \n     shall within 180 days after such date of enactment report to \n     Congress on the effect of the increase in royalty fees paid \n     by satellite carriers pursuant to the decision by the \n     Librarian of Congress on competition in the market for \n     delivery of multichannel video programming and the ability of \n     the direct-to-home satellite industry to compete.''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Copyright Office is prohibited from implementing, \n     enforcing, collecting or awarding copyright royalty fees, and \n     no obligation or liability for copyright royalty fees shall \n     accrue pursuant to the decision of the Librarian of Congress \n     on October 27, 1997, which established a royalty fee of $0.27 \n     per subscriber per month for the retransmission of distant \n     broadcast signals by satellite carriers, before January 1, \n     2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 BOXER (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3230\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Lautenberg, \nMr. Moynihan, and Ms. Landrieu) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. \n2260, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I of the bill, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1____.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize and \nremember the importance of the previous two days in American history. \nJuly nineteenth and twentieth, 1998, mark the one hundred and fiftieth \nanniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention in Seneca Falls, New York. \nThis gathering of American women and men began a movement in our nation \nthat changed the role of women in this country and, ultimately, around \nthe world. Because of the convention's tremendous impact on the \nAmerican way of life, I joined Senator Torricelli and several other \nSenate colleagues in recently introducing a Senate resolution honoring \nthe women's rights movement and saluting those who made it all happen. \nToday I speak in honor of this occasion.\n  Women's struggle for equality had very humble beginnings. Elizabeth \nCady Stanton, a housewife and mother of three sons, and Lucretia Mott, \na Quaker teacher and staunch abolitionist, were ejected from the 1840 \nWorld Anti-Slavery Convention in London simply because they were women. \nOutraged at such an injustice, they were compelled to call attention to \nthe many freedoms denied to women, including the right to vote or hold \nelective office, the right to own property if married, the right to \nobtain a professional education and the basic right to protect oneself \nfrom an abusive spouse.\n  Mrs. Stanton and Miss Mott, along with Jane Hunt, Martha Coffin \nWright and Mary Ann McClintock, called for a public convention to \ndiscuss the social, civil and religious rights of women. The first \nmeeting of the women's rights movement convened at the Wesleyan \nMethodist Chapel in Seneca Falls, New York. Over 300 men and women \nattended the two day conference, including Susan B. Anthony and \nFrederick Douglass.\n  The highlight of the convention was the reading of the Declaration of \nSentiments, a document composed on Mrs. McClintock's kitchen table. The \nstatement was based on the words of our Declaration of Independence, \napplying its self-evident truths to both males and females and \ndeclaring all men and women equal. The document even called for a \nwoman's right to vote, a revolutionary idea at the time. In fact, while \n68 women and 32 men signed the Declaration of Sentiments, more than 200 \nattendees refused to endorse such an outrageous notion. Today, it is \ndifficult to imagine a democratic society that would not permit women \nto hold elective office, sign legal documents or attend the church of \ntheir choice, much less exercise the basic right to vote.\n  Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and the other founders of the \nwomen's rights movement epitomized the strength of the American woman \nand exhibited the courage necessary to put an end to a great injustice. \nThey understood the road before them would be long and hard. Little did \nthey know, however, that it would be more than 70 years before women \nwould be granted suffrage in the United States. Today the movement is \nsymbolized by the unfinished marble carving of the Suffrage advocates \nnow displayed in the Capitol Rotunda.\n  The calling of the Seneca Falls Convention and the passion of those \ninvolved forever changed the course of American history. All Americans \nshould honor the efforts of these intrepid women and learn from their \ncommitment to a cause in which they so deeply believed. Without the \nfortitude shown throughout this arduous struggle for equality, I could \nnot be standing before you on the Senate floor today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/21/senate-section/article/S8684-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8684-S8685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL YOUTH CRIME PREVENTION DEMONSTRATION ACT\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Coats \nin introducing this important bill. We have become accustomed in the \npast couple of years to hearing a great deal of positive news about \ncrime trends in this country. Thanks to many factors, including a \nnumber of innovative crime-fighting strategies and the return of \ncommunity policing, most of our cities are experiencing a decrease in \nviolent crime. But the news on the crime front is far from all good. \nIndeed, as my colleague from Indiana already has noted, there still is \nfar too much violence--and desensitization to violence--among our \nnation's youth. And, if what demographers tell us about the future is \ncorrect, we all should begin now to brace ourselves for what is to come \nas this group grows in both size and age.\n  We can attribute much of the problem of youth crime to the \nenvironment--both local and national--in which many of our children are \nnow being reared. For too many children, the things on which previous \ngenerations relied to support and teach them simply no longer exist. \nFrom the family unit to the local neighborhood to the surrounding \ncommunity, many children have no where to turn for the support \nstructure necessary to help bring them into adulthood with proper \nvalues, commitment to society and, most importantly of all, hope for \nthe future. Without that support, they too often accept a falsely \nappealing invitation to break their bonds with society\n\n[[Page S8685]]\n\nand enter a childhood of crime. If we are to combat all of this, if we \nare to stop youth crime, we must come up with a way to revitalize \ntraditional support structures and to reconnect our nation's youth to \nour nation's communities.\n  The bill Senator Coats and I are introducing today will, we hope, \noffer one step in that direction. The National Youth Crime Prevention \nAct would authorize $5 million for the National Center for Youth \nEnterprise to establish demonstration projects in eight cities, \nincluding the city of Hartford in my home state of Connecticut. In \nthese projects, the National Center will build on success it already \nhas had in doing precisely what I just described: working on a \ngrassroots basis within communities to help heal those communities, and \nwith them, their children.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that with the funding provided by this \nbill, the National Center's demonstration projects can create model \nprograms that can be replicated across the nation in our war against \nyouth crime. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/21/senate-section/article/S8684-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNITION OF OZANAM IN KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Ozanam in \nKansas City, Missouri for its service to the community. For fifty \nyears, Ozanam has been helping children and families in turmoil. Ozanam \nfacility and staff help children reach their full potential and become \nproductive members of society.\n  Ozanam began in the home of Mr. Al Allen, a Catholic Welfare Staff \nmember, who after noticing the lack of help for emotionally disturbed \nadolescents, took it upon himself to bring six boys into his own home \nto give them long-term care, education and guidance. However, in just a \nyear's short time, the need for a larger facility became apparent. \nPresently, the agency occupies 95 acres including two dormitories, a \ncampus group home, a special education center that contains vocational \ntraining classrooms, indoor and outdoor recreation facilities and a \nspiritual life center.\n  During its existence, Ozanam has had some outstanding staff and \nadministration to help the more than 4,000 children who have stayed \nthere. Paul Gemeinhardt, President, Judith Hart, Senior Vice President \nof Development and Doug Zimmerman, Senior Vice President of Agency \nOperations, deserve special recognition for their undying commitment \nand service to Ozanam.\n  I commend the staff of Ozanam for their untiring dedication to \nhelping children and their families in their time of need.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to a pillar of American history, a symbol of \nthe proud sacrifices that forced the birth of a nation, and which makes \nits home in Massachusetts. I speak of course of the vessel that carried \ninto battle the hopes of the early republic for freedom and a lasting \nindependence, the ship that generation upon generation of \nschoolchildren have come to know as ``Old Ironsides''--the U.S.S. \nConstitution.\n  Two hundred and four years ago, six frigates were constructed for the \nUnited States Navy. One ship remains to this day to symbolize the \nstrength and endurance that lies at the heart of this country's \nexperiment in democratic ideals. The U.S.S. Constitution--docked in \nhistoric Charlestown Navy Yard in Boston--is a living monument to our \nproud history and to the values which endure in this country.\n  Like the Constitution written in Philadelphia that unified so many \nvoices bound by a common spirit, this frigate itself carries in its \nmighty structure materials from all the original states of the union. \nBuilt by Colonel George Claghorn at Edmond Hartt's shipyard in Boston's \nNorth End, its hull of live oak, red cedar, white oak and pitch pine \ncome from as far north as the deep woods of Maine and as far south as \nthe forests of South Carolina and Georgia. The masts come from Maine. \nSouth Carolina pine gave the Constitution its decks, and canvas from \nRhode Island formed the sails that pushed it on its historic journey. \nNew Jersey contributed its keel and cannon balls, and the gun carriages \nand anchors came from Massachusetts tradespeople. We must never forget \nthat it was Boston's Paul Revere, among the strongest voices in the \nchorus of revolution, who provided the spikes and copper sheathing that \nfortified the ship in battle. The U.S.S. Constitution belongs to all of \nus, from every state--and it belongs to every one around the world who \nbelieves in freedom.\n  Although this mighty ship was officially retired from naval duty in \n1881, it continues to remind us of the work ahead of us in making the \nworld safe for those who dare to dream, who dare to give voice to new \nideas. The U.S.S. Constitution is launched into a new battle each time \nit reminds us of the full measure of sacrifice that our love of freedom \ndemand for its protection. For hundreds of thousands of visitors each \nyear, the U.S.S. Constitution is an inspiration--reminding us not just \nof where America has been, but where America is going. With its sails \nfilled with the winds of freedom, I know the Constitution will take us \nall on endless journeys towards a new horizon, with our only boundaries \nlying in the limits of mankind's hopes for a better world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/21/senate-section/article/S8685-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8685-S8687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A NEW APPROACH FOR SOUTH ASIA\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President. With the recent nuclear tests in \nSouth Asia, we are closer to nuclear war than we have been at any time \nsince the Cuban Missile Crisis. This is a challenge which will compel \nthe highest attention and the most subtle diplomacy. It requires \nextensive discussion with India and Pakistan. Deputy Secretary of State \nStrobe Talbott has begun such a dialogue. He is a gifted diplomat; \nhowever, I must emphasize that despite the considerable talents of the \nDeputy Secretary, this is an issue which requires the President's close \ninvolvement.\n  Congress must also be involved in addressing the issues which arise \nfrom the nuclear tests in South Asia. Legislation is required to lift \nthe sanctions which these actions triggered. As such, I was pleased \nthat my friend from Delaware, the ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, has set out a very sensible approach to South \nAsia. In a recent speech to the Carnegie Endowment for International \nPeace, Senator Biden challenges us to think anew about South Asia and \ncalls on Congress to provide the President with the flexibility to \nnegotiate in South Asia. This must entail providing him with broad \nauthority to waive the present sanctions.\n  Most importantly, Senator Biden calls on the President to make \n``arrangements to go to India.'' This is paramount and I hope that the \nPresident will note this wise counsel. The actions which we take to \naddress this volatile situation will have profound repercussion on the \nfuture of the subcontinent and the world. Such stakes require the \nPresident's active participation. We must talk with them as a matter \nnot just of their survival, but of our own as well. And we must stop \nsupposing that sanctions are the answer. They are not.\n  Mr. President, I commend the remarks of our colleague, Senator Biden, \nand ask that they be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n                     A New Approach for South Asia\n\n                       (By Joseph R. Biden, Jr.)\n\n       Two months ago, in the Rajasthan desert, the Government of \n     India claimed to have exploded five nuclear devices. Just 15 \n     days later, the Government of Pakistan followed suit.\n       These events, in a few short weeks, expanded the \n     acknowledged nuclear club by forty percent. They confront the \n     United States, as well as the rest of the international \n     community, with a monumental challenge, calling into question \n     decades of U.S. non-proliferation policy.\n       Addressing this challenge--devising a new approach toward \n     South Asia--is the subject of my remarks today. I thank you \n     for the kind invitation.\n       We can expect the policy community to dramatically increase \n     the time and attention it devotes to South Asia in the coming \n     months, but you at the Carnegie Endowment can credibly claim \n     that you were focusing on\n\n[[Page S8686]]\n\n     nuclear tensions long before it was even remotely \n     fashionable. If only more had listened.\n       Clearly the tests by India and Pakistan require us to \n     reexamine many aspects of our foreign and national security \n     policy. We need to jettison some long-held beliefs that have \n     acted as self-imposed constraints on U.S. policy.\n       Traditional approaches have not worked in the past in South \n     Asia and will not work in the present situation. We need to \n     think ``outside the box.'' Most of all, our national \n     interests throughout Asia dictate that we end our benign \n     neglect of South Asia. Let me outline the shortcomings of our \n     policy:\n       First, we have not acknowledged or addressed the \n     fundamental sense of insecurity felt by both India and \n     Pakistan since the end of the Cold War.\n       It is both facile and misleading to blame India's decision \n     to test solely on the election of the BJP government. While \n     the BJP certainly had a domestic political imperative to \n     test, there was already a consensus across the political \n     spectrum in India (except for the Communists) that India \n     needed to conduct tests.\n       Why? Because of India's underlying perception in the \n     aftermath of the Cold War that it was isolated, vulnerable, \n     and not taken seriously.\n       For much of the Cold War, but especially after the 1971 \n     Indo-Pakistan war, a measure of stability prevailed with \n     China and the United States as key supporters of Pakistan, \n     and the Soviet Union as the chief ally of India. This set of \n     power relationships, combined with the threat of U.S. \n     sanctions, restrained India and Pakistan from either testing \n     or deploying nuclear weapons.\n       With the end of the Cold War and the demise of the Soviet \n     Union, India could no longer rely on Moscow to balance China. \n     In addition, India perceives us--falsely, I believe--as \n     cultivating China as the regional hegemon that will preserve \n     Asian stability.\n       The perceived U.S. preoccupation with China generates deep \n     concern in New Delhi. Remember: China defeated India in the \n     1962 war and occupied several thousand square kilometers of \n     disputed territory, a humiliation from which India has yet to \n     recover. And a decade ago Indian and China massed several \n     hundred thousand troops along their disputed border.\n       India's sense of strategic encirclement was heightened by \n     reports of Chinese missile and nuclear transfers to Pakistan \n     and budding Chinese military and security ties to Burma \n     throughout the 1990s. Pakistan's test of a missile with a \n     1,000 kilometer range last April appeared to fit this pattern \n     even though U.S. officials pointed to North Korea as the real \n     source of the missile.\n       To put this in context, how would China feel if the tables \n     were turned? What if India transferred its missiles to \n     Vietnam, fighter planes to Mongolia, or a nuclear bomb design \n     to Taiwan?\n       In such an environment, India felt that it was on its own \n     and needed to demonstrate its capabilities, change the \n     strategic landscape, in order to be taken more seriously by \n     China, the United States, and other powers.\n       Pakistan's motives for testing are far less complicated \n     than India's, but no less serious. Its strategic aim has been \n     to resist Indian hegemony and guarantee its survival. Just as \n     India's drive for a nuclear device can be traced to the \n     defeat it suffered at the hands of China in 1962 and China's \n     subsequent nuclear test in 1964, Pakistan's nuclear program \n     can be traced to the role India played in splitting Pakistan \n     into two with the creation of Bangladesh in 1971.\n       Many in Pakistan believe that India has never accepted the \n     partition of the Indian subcontinent back in 1947. In \n     Pakistan, therefore, nuclear capability is seen as the \n     ultimate guarantor of its statehood.\n       It should come as no surprise, then, that Pakistan felt it \n     needed to test to reestablish the deterrence that was \n     disrupted by India's tests.\n       The end of the Cold War also made Pakistan feel abandoned \n     and isolated. The United States no longer needed Pakistan to \n     contain Soviet power. The Pressler amendment, invoked in \n     1990, banned aid to Pakistan and led directly to the erosion \n     of Pakistan's conventional arsenal. This was seen as a \n     betrayal, and has limited our influence with Pakistan ever \n     since.\n       Unfortunately, we failed to acknowledge or act upon these \n     fundamental shifts affecting Pakistan, just as we ignored the \n     changes in India's security perceptions.\n       The second shortcoming of our South Asia policy is that its \n     two chief elements--commerce and sanctions--are \n     contradictory. We use sanctions to punish proliferation at \n     the same time we are promoting commercial ties to take \n     advantage of long-overdue market openings in both countries.\n       This policy is half right. The expansion of trade and \n     investment ties with India and Pakistan will help these \n     countries realize their full potential as well as benefit our \n     own economic interests.\n       But the application of a one-size-fits-all non-\n     proliferation policy is not appropriate to the special \n     circumstances in South Asia. It lumps India and Pakistan with \n     the far more dangerous outlaw states such as Libya and Iraq. \n     It ignores the great lengths both countries have been \n     prepared to go in order to achieve a basic sense of security. \n     It presumes our influence is much greater than it actually \n     is. Finally, it has prevented us from developing creative \n     approaches to stabilize nuclear and missile development in \n     the region.\n       Legislation initiated by the Congress, and signed by \n     successive Presidents, is the basis for this rigid approach. \n     I voted for that legislation. But when viewed in the context \n     of Pakistan's and India's decision to test, I have to \n     conclude that while our approach worked for many years, it is \n     no longer working. It didn't stop them from testing, and it \n     provides no incentive for India and Pakistan to take positive \n     steps now.\n       To be sure, sanctions, when carefully calibrated, are a \n     valuable policy tool. But I think it is clear that \n     multilateral sanctions are more effective than unilateral \n     sanctions. For example, the recent decision by the Group of \n     Eight to delay indefinitely World Bank loans for India and \n     Pakistan is more likely to produce results than unilateral \n     U.S. action.\n       Given these defects in our policy, I believe we have no \n     choice but to construct a new conceptual framework. Here are \n     our options.\n       First, we could maintain the status quo. That is, we retain \n     sanctions on India and Pakistan indefinitely, not recognize \n     their nuclear status, and keep the fundamentals of our Asia \n     policy unchanged. That would ``keep the faith'' on non-\n     proliferation, but leave the underlying tensions in place and \n     set the stage for the next, perhaps more dangerous, crisis.\n       A second approach that has been suggested is bolder: why \n     not enlist India as a potential strategic ally against a \n     ``China threat?'' But this runs the risk of becoming a self-\n     fulfilling prophecy. China does not show signs of becoming \n     hostile, nor are china's interests necessarily in conflict \n     with our own. China prizes peace, stability, and economic \n     development above all else.\n       I suggest a third approach. First, we should abandon our \n     one-size-fits-all non-proliferation policy that we have \n     applied to South Asia. We need to make distinctions between \n     India, Israel, and Pakistan on the one hand, and nations that \n     flout international norms such as Iraq and Libya on the \n     other. The former should not concern us as much as the \n     latter.\n       We are better served by bringing India and Pakistan into \n     non-proliferation arrangements than by simply expecting them \n     to foreswear their nuclear programs. In practical terms, this \n     means that Congress should provide the President with the \n     flexibility to negotiate a package that would lift sanctions \n     in exchange for restraint by India and Pakistan in the areas \n     that matter most to us.\n       We should seek agreement on five items: Formal commitments, \n     preferably through adherence to the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty, to refrain from further nuclear testing; pledges to \n     enter negotiations for a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty; \n     Assurances that both countries will continue to refrain from \n     spreading nuclear and missile technology; verifiable \n     commitments not to deploy nuclear weapons on missiles, \n     submarines, or aircraft; and a resumption of comprehensive \n     bilateral discussions between India and Pakistan aimed at \n     reducing tensions.\n       Such a package would serve our twin objectives of repairing \n     the damage to the global non-proliferation regime, while not \n     indefinitely isolating one-fifth of humanity.\n       Second, we need to distinguish between the relative \n     importance of India and Pakistan to our interests over the \n     long-term. Pakistan has been a good friend in the past, and \n     we should not forget that. Moreover, a policy that dismisses \n     Pakistan's legitimate security needs is bound to fail.\n       In fact, I believe that when we eventually ease the \n     recently-imposed sanctions on India and Pakistan, we should \n     simultaneously waive the Pressler and Symington amendments, \n     which restrict military and economic aid to Pakistan. The \n     time has come to clear the decks in our relationship with \n     Pakistan and end a policy which is perceived as \n     discriminatory by Islamabad.\n       Nor should we overlook the important strategic role \n     Pakistan could play as a secure transit route for the vast \n     oil and gas reserves of the Caspian Basin, if, and this is a \n     big if, peace can be secured in Afghanistan.\n       But American national interests in the new multipolar world \n     dictate a different level of relations with India. Because of \n     its growing economic and political weight, India will become \n     a significant player in Asia and at the global level.\n       Already India has a middle class approaching 200 million \n     people. If Indian governments make policy decisions that \n     continue to unleash the latent potential of a talented \n     population, then India will in time achieve the great power \n     status to which it has long aspired.\n       Furthermore, if current trends hold, I believe that it is \n     only natural for some form of rivalry to persist, if not \n     intensify, between a growing India and China. Obviously, this \n     would diminish security and threaten U.S. interests across \n     Asia.\n       To prevent it, two things must be done. First, the Sino-\n     Indian rivalry must be channeled into a healthy and \n     constructive competition. Second, as both India and China \n     achieve great power status, they will need to ease the \n     anxieties of lesser powers.\n       To deal with this emerging regional picture we must move \n     away from a focus on discrete bilateral relationships in \n     Asia, and broaden our vision with a more integrated region-\n     wide approach that regards South Asia as an integral part of \n     Asia.\n       I propose a new framework that would give a ``seat at the \n     table'' to all of the major players in Asia--India, China, \n     Japan, Russia,\n\n[[Page S8687]]\n\n     and the United States. The emphasis should not be so much on \n     formal structures, but on substance. The goal of this new \n     framework would be to promote greater consultation and \n     transparency among the countries.\n       The two emerging powers in this group--India and China--\n     should be encouraged to set an example of cooperation for the \n     rest of Asia. Such a system would also help them to realize \n     that along with great power status comes responsibility. They \n     must convince smaller nations of their peaceful intentions; \n     they must act to strengthen, not weaken, international norms; \n     and they must be seen as supporting an international \n     environment that promotes peace and prosperity for all.\n       The ``Gujral doctrine'' demonstrates that India has the \n     potential to mature into a responsible great power. As \n     espoused by the previous Indian Prime Minister, this doctrine \n     called for India, as the dominant power in South Asia, to go \n     more than halfway in easing the fears of its smaller \n     neighbors. I hope that the new Indian government will not \n     stray from this far-sighted policy adopted by its \n     predecessor.\n       The United States will need to take the lead in setting \n     this regional security mechanism into motion. It could begin \n     today with the President picking up the phone and speaking to \n     the leaders of India, Russia, and Japan about the insights he \n     gained from his trip to China and making arrangements to go \n     to India.\n       Regular consultation among the key Asian countries could go \n     a long way toward dispelling anxieties and suspicions. It \n     would give everyone a stake in maintaining stability. It \n     would provide an incentive for regional powers to work toward \n     the settlement of long-standing disputes such as those over \n     the Sino-Indian border, the Kurile islands, the Korean \n     peninsula, and the South China Sea.\n       Key countries could be encouraged to share information \n     about their armaments and defense budgets. If the other side \n     does not have information, it will assume the worst. This \n     inevitably leads to decisions and potentially dangerous \n     cycles of action and reaction that are predicated upon \n     assumptions that may be false.\n       Let me conclude. Devising a new approach to South Asia will \n     not be easy, especially considering that it is being done in \n     response to actions we don't approve of--namely, the Pakistan \n     and Indian nuclear tests. But we have no choice, because the \n     status quo is not an option.\n       We must show India and Pakistan that while we condemn their \n     tests, we understand their security concerns and are willing \n     to deal with them. If we don't devise a new approach, \n     tensions will grow and South Asia's endemic security problems \n     will undermine our long-term interests. And one thing is \n     clear: South Asian security is becoming inseparable from \n     Asian security.\n       And, of course, Asia matters to the United States. Despite \n     recent economic setbacks, Asia will continue to be the most \n     dynamic region into the next century. Our economic links will \n     continue to grow. The regional balance of power and security \n     perceptions will also undergo dramatic changes. I believe \n     that we will need to find new mechanisms to preserve our \n     security interests.\n       An effort that begins today in enlisting the key Asian \n     powers in advancing our common objectives of peace, \n     stability, and prosperity is one that could pay dividends far \n     into the next century. Now is the time to begin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/21/senate-section/article/S8685-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 442\n\n  Mr. GREGG.
