Mr. President, I am making today one of those ``I did \nnot intend to make a speech, but here I am making a speech'' speeches. \nI think most would agree that opponents of so-called campaign reform--a \nterm, by the way, which should top the oxymoron list of the 1990's--the \nopponents of this ill-advised attack on free speech have just about \nworn everybody out, even in Washington where people actually talk about \nsuch topics over dinner.\n  Some months ago, thanks to the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, I \nspoke on this issue and made what I thought was a pretty fair defense \nof free political discourse when the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina proposed withdrawing first amendment protection from that same \npolitical discourse. Senator Hollings, by the way, was up front. He was \ncandid in his approach, as opposed to the current proposals of so-\ncalled reform.\n  Having been through at least three campaign reform efforts in the \nHouse of Representatives as a member of the then Administration \nCommittee and goodness knows how many campaign task forces, and having \npaid attention to the current debate, I have been hard pressed to \nfigure out what can be said that has not been said. However, it appears \nas if there is a sure bet in regard to this topic. It is that those who \ninsist that they propose reform, regardless of the consequences, and \nwave their reform banners from self-consecrated, high moral ground, \nthey never seem to suffer from arm fatigue. When it comes to campaign \nreform, the high road of humility is not bothered by heavy traffic in \nthis town.\n  Despite the fact there is no clear consensus or a majority in the \nSenate regarding alleged campaign reform, there is no mercy from the \nproponents of the effort to further federalize the American electoral \nsystem, and we will apparently debate and vote, debate and vote and say \nthe same things over and over and over and over again. I would surmise \nthis is going to get a little tiresome, if not painful. But apparently \nthe failure of past reforms does not deter or change the minds of \ncurrent reformers.\n  Well, when you know all the answers, you haven't asked all the \nquestions.\n\n[[Page S10720]]\n\n But in this debate, there is a new axiom: The fewer the facts, the \nstronger the opinions, and apparently the less a thing can be proven, \nthe angrier we get when we argue about it.\n  Nevertheless, I think we have an obligation to at least try to set \nthe record straight in regard to this issue and, in that regard, I \nwould like to make the following observations:\n  First, the distinguished Democratic leader of the Senate, Senator \nDaschle, a good friend, stated on the floor that there should be no \nconfusion--no confusion--that the question is, do you support \nmeaningful reform in response to the hearings regarding all of the \nillegal campaign activities apparently conducted in the last \nPresidential campaign.\n  The only problem with the Senator's statement is that the campaign \nfinance reform bill is not reform. Let me repeat that, it is a reform \nbill that is not reform. It will not work. It again leads us down the \nroad to a maze of election laws, rules, and regulations that favor \nincumbents, restricts desired political participation on the part of \nthe American people, and would tripwire honest candidates and citizens \ninto criminal acts. To make matters worse, the bill is fundamentally \nflawed and is what I hope--I hope--is an unintended attack on the most \nbasic right of individuals guaranteed by our Constitution, and that is \nthe right of free speech, the right written first, the right without \nwhich no other right can long exist.\n\n  Well, I know that people who think they know it all often annoy those \nof us who really do, but for the life of me, how this concoction can be \nlabeled or disguised as ``reform'' is beyond me.\n  Senator McConnell said it best when he stated:\n\n       My goal is to redefine reform, to move the debate away from \n     arbitrary limits and toward expanded citizen participation \n     and political discourse.\n\n  He said McCain-Feingold is a failed approach. It is. We already have \nit in the Presidential system. It is a failure.\n  So, for all the good press and good intentions, McCain-Feingold is a \nbad bill. Why? The basic premise of the bill is flawed, Mr. President. \nThat premise is that too much money is corrupting politics. No, it is \nnot.\n  Oh, now, now, I realize that our opponents and all of the so-called \nspecial interest groups--those groups who do not agree with us--they \nhave too much money, I know that. And I realize when they spend it on \nnegative ads opposing me or positions that I favor, that spending \nshould be banned or limited --boy, I'm for that--or at least capped.\n  Too much spending? Compared to what? The Citizens Research Foundation \nhas reported that campaign spending for all offices in 1996 added up to \nabout $4 billion. All offices of the United States, $4 billion. That is \na lot of money. But that compares to one-twentieth of 1 percent of the \ngross domestic product in our country of $7.6 trillion. One-twentieth \nof 1 percent is too much to set priorities on how those trillions will \naffect our daily lives and pocketbooks in the next generations of \nAmericans? Compared to what?\n  Americans spend $20 billion on dry cleaning and laundry. One 30-\nsecond Super Bowl ad could finance three campaigns for Congress. \nColumnist George Will points out that millions of Americans gave $2.6 \nbillion to 476 congressional campaigns and still had enough left over \nto spend $4.6 billion on potato chips. We can apply the same thing to \nyogurt or almost anything the American people will spend their hard-\nearned dollars on.\n  While having the privilege of presiding in this body, I remember well \nthe chart displayed by proponents of this bill. It showed the so-called \ndramatic increase in campaign spending since 1976. It did not show the \ncauses--the increase in postage, radio, TV, newspaper ads, printing, \nphone banks, campaign workers, all of that. It did not show virtually \neverything else that Americans must purchase in this country has also \nincreased--homes, education, automobiles, health care--not to mention \nthe purchasing power of the individual citizen.\n  Senator McConnell has pointed out that in 1996, we had a pretty high-\nstakes election, a very important election. There was a fierce \nideological battle over the future of this country. On a per eligible \nvoter basis, the congressional elections cost $3.89. Every voter in \nAmerica, dividing it up equally, is $3.89, about 4 bucks. The Senator \npointed out that that is roughly the cost of a McDonald's extra value \nmeal.\n  The second major flaw I think in McCain-Feingold is that no matter \nhow you try to regulate or cap the flow of money to campaigns, it \nreappears, most of the time in the murky and illegal shadows with \nlittle or no public disclosure. Witness the circumvention of current \ncampaign laws in regard to the money laundering scheme among certain \ninterest groups, the Democratic National Committee and the Teamsters \nUnion.\n  To make matters worse, McCain-Feingold compounds the felony. Instead \nof focusing on blatant violations of current law, the reformers want to \nplace limits on money spent to support or defeat candidates for \nelection.\n  And therein, Mr. President, lies the ``Aha!'' of this current debate, \nwhat is really going on. As Paul Harvey says, the rest of the story. It \nis pretty simple, really. Just take the interest groups who are pushing \nfor this so-called reform and then take a look at their legislative \nagenda. I wrote it down. I had a staff member go through it. All the \ninterest groups that are for campaign finance reform and then their \nlegislative agenda:\n  Nationalized health insurance; status quo on Medicare and Social \nSecurity--this is my version; increased Federal role in education; \nopposition to liability and tort reform; opposition to tax cuts; \nincreased Federal role in environmental protection. I might support \npart of that. Opposition to a balanced budget; reduced defense \nspending; opposition to current welfare reform.\n  I am not trying to perjure these positions. They are honest \npositions. The AARP, AFL-CIO, Common Cause, and the many so-called \nnonprofit consumer groups have every right to express their views, and \nthey do. These issues are bigtime stuff. How we decide these issues \nwill affect the daily lives, pocketbooks, and future of every member of \nthese organizations, every American.\n  Organized labor should weigh in. Boy, they sure as heck did in the \nlast election in my campaign. But so should the business community and \nfarmers and ranchers and small business Main Street America, and all of \nthe folks who might just disagree on how we get there from here on \nthese issues. The truth of it is this reform is skewed to a particular \npolitical point of view. It is called unilateral retreat from the \npolitical playing field for those who have a political view different \nfrom you, but we will continue our vote, our vote buying, really, \nthrough the Federal budget.\n  Take the proposal to ban so-called soft money. Ban soft money and all \nof the interest groups whose future is and will be decided in part by \nthe decisions of those who propose the ban will simply bypass the \nRepublican and Democratic Parties and will conduct their own campaigns, \nand we will have a further weakening of the two-party system. That is \nwrong. That is detrimental.\n  I know soft money has become a pejorative, but, in fact, it is the \nonly money spent today on campaigns by the American people that is not \nunder control of the Federal Government. We haven't got our fishhooks \ninto the regulations and redtape and all that goes with it.\n\n  Are we really saying, Mr. President, are we really saying that in \nAmerica citizens and various interests groups whose very economic \nfuture depends on the decisions we make in this Congress cannot support \nor oppose those candidates? Think about it. ``I'm sorry, you cannot \ninvest in good government, you cannot express your point of view \nindependent from the FEC.'' There are many countries in which that is \nthe case--China, Iraq, Iran, North Korea. I do not think we want to go \ndown that road.\n  ``I am sorry, Farmer Jones, you cannot run an ad or distribute a \nhandbill opposing Pat Roberts in his freedom-to-farm bill 60 days \nbefore the election. That's soft money. You can't do it.'' The same \nthing for farm organizations or commodity groups--unless, of course, \nyou are a newspaper or a labor union.\n  How do you define a newspaper, by the way? It used to be to be a \nnewspaper you had a hatrack, and then you had a typewriter, and you had \na letter press, and you had somebody run it. You had a list. You had \nadvertisers.\n\n[[Page S10721]]\n\n You had to get your printing equipment somewhere. You had the local \nprinting contract for the county.\n  Today, a newspaper is when you have a computer. You can manufacturer \nyour own newspaper--Pat Roberts Weekly News, published every day. I do \nnot know how you are going to define this. Who is going to be in \ncharge?\n  Finally, let me stress the most serious flaw in the McCain-Feingold \nbill, and that is money spent to express your views or the views of \nvoters cannot be regulated or banned without being at odds with the \nfirst amendment. We simply cannot improve the integrity of any \npolitical system by restricting the political speech under the banner \nof reform.\n  Speech controls in the last 60 days of a campaign envisioned in the \nbill represent the lawyer full-employment act. Just read the provisions \nexempting the voter guides and try to figure it out.\n  Well, finally, I must say, with all due respect--this may be viewed \nas a little partisan on my part--but with all due respect, that the \nadministration's position in regard to campaign finance represents a \nnew threshold for what is political chutzpah. Here we have evidence \npresented before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee itemizing \ncampaign malfeasance that includes everything from Buddhist nuns; \nunprecedented misuse of our Nation's intelligence agencies--let me \nrepeat, unprecedented misuse of the CIA for campaign activities--that \nis unprecedented; money laundering in exchange for taking sides in a \nTeamsters election; a fugitive influence peddler bribing his way to the \nPresident's side--he did not get his way, thank goodness--soft money \nturned to hard, circumventing existing campaign limits; and now missing \ntapes of the White House coffees or fundraisers.\n  In answer to all of this, Mr. President, the people who have been \ncaught with their hands in the campaign violation cookie jar say we \nneed a new cookie jar. President Clinton stating he will take the bully \npulpit for campaign finance reform is like somebody charged with drunk \ndriving insisting we lower the speed limit for everybody else.\n  Mr. President, in regard to President Clinton, the administration and \nthe proponents of reform that is not reform, the greatest of faults is \nto be conscious of none. In this regard, I do not mean to malign the \nPresident or my dear friends across the aisle, but this is not reform. \nI urge a ``no'' vote on cloture. Let us get on with the business of the \nSenate in the United States.\n\n  Oh, and real campaign reform? As stated by Robert Samuelson in his \ncolumn in Newsweek, ``The best defense against the undue influence of \nmoney is to let candidates raise it from as many sources as possible--\nand most important--'' most important, do not infringe upon the first \namendment, ``let the public see who is giving.'' They can figure it \nout. They are six jumps ahead of Washington and any proponent of reform \nwe have in this body. ``That would be genuine reform.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I want to take a moment to thank my good friend from \nKansas for really an excellent speech and important contribution in \nthis debate. Not only was he right on the mark, he was fun to listen \nto.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I, too, commend the Senator from Kansas \nfor his illuminating remarks and the Senator from Kentucky for enduring \nthis process for now years.\n  I want to come to the reference to the Constitution by the Senator \nfrom Kansas. The Constitution that says that: Congress shall enact no \nlaw to abridge speech.\n  It does not say there are no exemptions. It says the Congress shall \nenact no law to abridge speech.\n  Let us put this in context. This language is in the first amendment \nof the Bill of Rights which grants us the right to speak as we would, \nthe right to worship as we would, the right to assemble, which is also \npart of this debate, and the right to petition our Government without \nfear.\n  All of us would like to see the campaign process improved. There have \nbeen many who have mentioned transparency or disclosure, making sure \nthat the American people know what is happening and when it is \nhappening and trust in their judgment to make good decisions about \nwhether they like it or do not.\n  This legislation abridges the Constitution, begins to manage speech, \npicks winners and losers, and attacks the fundamental rights of \nassembly.\n  You have to go back. In the early days, particularly 1775, before you \ncould create a society or an association in the United Kingdom--which \nwas the genesis of all the secret societies. The forefathers here knew \nof all of this activity. So that is why they framed the language that \nCongress shall enact no law to abridge freedom of speech or the right \nto associate. They had vivid memories of governments that prohibited \nand managed speech and threatened and intimidated people who spoke \nfreely and forbid organizations from joining together for the purpose \nof petitioning or speaking out. The language in the Constitution is \nderived from the fear those people had of what goes on when governments \ntell people what they can say and when they can say it.\n  This legislation picks corporations that can say anything they want \nand picks other corporations and says they cannot say anything. People \nup here in the gallery are represented by corporations that would have \nno prohibition whatsoever. Cox Broadcasting, one of the largest \ncommunications institutions in the world, could say anything it chose \nthrough all of its affiliates, the Atlanta papers, their cable \ntelevision, whatever, could say anything they chose about any \ncandidate, their motives for or against any vote as often as they \nwanted at any time they chose under this legislation, but Georgia \nPacific, which grows trees, could not.\n  I want to know, what is the difference between corporation A that \nhappens to print a newspaper and corporation B that happens to grow \ntrees? The forefathers said there shall be no difference. But this \nlegislation says that we will manage the difference here. Cox \nCommunications, say anything you want. Georgia Pacific, you're out. \nShove off.\n  It picks certain kinds of corporations that are at liberty to \nparticipate and others that are removed from participation. That is an \nabridgement of the Constitution.\n  Let us come to this business of association, the right to associate, \nto say what you want, and what constitutes free speech.\n  In those days there were pamphlets. Now it is television and radio, \ntelecommunications and computers. This legislation says free speech is \nonly given to certain kinds of institutions and it is denied others. \nYou know, the basic right to assemble, it says to those people, you can \nassemble, but, boy, you cannot say anything about a campaign for the 2 \nmonths before it. You cannot mention a candidate's name. You cannot \nparticipate. You cannot express your view, if you are for or against a \ncandidate.\n  So it is not only a violation of the principle of freedom of speech, \nbut it is a violation of the principle of assembly. The forefathers \nenvisioned people--the Farm Bureau--people coming together to make a \ncase, to speak to an issue. This says, ``No; that's a deterrent in our \nsociety. We're going to have to manage you. And we're going to remove \nyou from the political process.''\n\n  The last point I will make, Mr. President, is this: After you have \ntried to manage these processes, and you have given some people freedom \nof speech and others not, some that can assemble and some that cannot, \nwhat have you ended up with, outside of abridging the Constitution? You \nhave reinforced the power of incumbents. Because if the money can only \nflow to candidates, which candidate is it going to flow to? The \nincumbent in power or the challenger? The person that is more known and \nhas access to the facilities of that power or the person that is on the \noutside?\n  Well, you do not have to be a rocket scientist to know the money will \nflow to the incumbent. You can call this the Incumbent Protection Act. \nIt will be a magnet. It will move money to power. And it intimidates \nand chills people\n\n[[Page S10722]]\n\nfrom speaking out, which has been--you know, the genesis of all \nAmerican glory is our freedom. The genesis of all American glory is \nthat we have been a free people, and it has made us behave in unique \nways. We are bold. We are visionary. We are builders. And we are not \nafraid. This kind of legislation chills and separates and is not \nhealthy to the Republic.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  This morning we have another opportunity to speak again about this \nissue, campaign finance reform, which many people wish would go away \nbut it is not going to. Again, it is a chance to review sort of the \nkaleidoscope of arguments that have been used to condemn our efforts on \nthe McCain-Feingold bill and other campaign finance reform proposals.\n  Listening to the Senator from Georgia, we hear again the claim that \nwhat is really wrong with this bill is that it violates the first \namendment--which, of course, we dispute and also find just a little \namusing when you consider, first of all, that if there is any problem \nwith this bill under the first amendment, we still do have nine people \nacross the street who know how to handle that.\n  But many of the same Senators who are condemning our bill from the \npoint of view of the first amendment are some of the first in line who \nare ready to amend the first amendment. That is part of the agenda of \nmany of the folks on the other side of the aisle.\n  There is no compunction at all on the part of some of these folks to \npass a flag-burning amendment to the first amendment, to make an \nexemption of free speech there. No concerns at all with regard to the \nfirst amendment and related rights in passing a school prayer \namendment, which many of our opponents believe would not be a violation \nof the first amendment and which I think would be.\n  Virtually every opponent of this bill had no problem at all coming \nout here on the floor of the Senate and voting for the Communications \nDecency Act, which to me was the most blatantly anticonstitutional \ncensorship bill we have seen in a very long time, and every single \nMember of the Supreme Court agreed; 9-0 they ruled that this bill, the \nCommunications Decency Act, was unconstitutional. Where were all the \nSenators out here talking about the first amendment when I came out \nhere in a rather lonely manner and said, ``By the way, this on its face \ncannot possibly pass muster''? Where was the concern for the first \namendment? It was not there.\n  So I am puzzled about what the fear is. If it is so easy to play with \nthe first amendment when it comes to school prayer and flag burning and \nthe Internet, what is the problem with sending up a bill that \nreasonable people disagree about with regard to one aspect of its \nconstitutionality? What is the threat to the Republic? Nothing, unless \nwe have somehow eliminated the third branch.\n  Then, of course, we have been treated again to my favorite argument \nin opposition to this bill, that there is not enough money in \npolitics. We heard it again today.\n\n  I have to tell you, that argument has proven to be the biggest loser \nof all with the American people. Does anyone really believe that the \nbest thing that can happen in this society is that more money gets \nspent on election?\n  Let's remember what Mr. Tamraz said before the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee on September 18, 1997. He is one who certainly understands \nwhat to do and what it means if we are going to keep expanding the role \nof money in politics. This is what he had to say in response to a \nquestion from our colleague, the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. \nLieberman].\n\n       Senator Lieberman. So, do you think you got your money's \n     worth? Do you feel badly about having given the $300,000?\n       Mr. Tamraz. I think next time I'll give $600,000.\n\n  Our colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, asked a very direct \nquestion:\n\n       Senator Levin. Was one of the reasons you made these \n     contributions because you believed it might get you access? \n     That's my question.\n       Mr. Tamraz. Senator, I'm going even further. It's the only \n     reason--to get access, but what I am saying is once you have \n     access what do you do with it? Is it something bad or is it \n     something good? That's what we have to see.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a picture, a portrayal of the vision that some \nof my colleagues have. The more money, the merrier. The more Mr. \nTamrazes, the more $300,000 contributions, the continuing buying of \naccess.\n  Their answer is to do absolutely nothing, to do nothing, to let this \ncampaign financing arms race continue. Another tactic is to somehow \npretend--this is the tactic of the majority leader--that the whole \nproblem is just one group of people, the working people of this country \nas represented through unions. As if anyone in the United States of \nAmerica honestly believes that the only group that has participated too \nmuch in the money aspect of the system is organized labor. As if it \ndoesn't involve corporate spending. As if it doesn't involve the \nspending of ideological groups. I have to tell you I have absolutely no \nconcern that even the most conservative antilabor person in America \ndoesn't believe that the whole campaign finance system problems have \nbeen caused by labor. Nobody believes that. Yet that has been the \nstrategy employed on the floor--to say unless you interfere with the \nbasic rights of people that join together in a union on a voluntarily \nbasis, that the whole issue isn't worth discussing.\n  Then of course we heard again from the Senator from Georgia, this \nnotion that our bill would protect incumbents. Well, it is rare I'm on \nthe floor and I just laugh out loud, but how can a system that already \nexists and has a 90-percent reelection rate for incumbents get much \nmore proincumbent? What are we going to do, force people to stay in \noffice? Are we going to have instead of term limits, term \nrequirements--you have to stay here? It is absurd to suggest that our \nbill would have any impact to protect incumbents. It is just the \nopposite.\n  If we had a fair chance to raise the issue, we would have brought up \nwhat Senator McCain and I like to call the challenger amendment to \nprovide incentives and opportunities for candidates who cannot afford a \ngreat deal to participate in the process by getting the benefit of \nreduced costs in their television time.\n  These are some of the arguments that have been used that I think are \npretty well worn. In fact, let me just illustrate how serious this \nratification of the current system is by going back to one example. \nThis is the example of the Federal Express Corp. This is what is being \nratified, by the attempt to kill campaign finance reform. We are doing \nnothing to prevent the episode that I'm about to describe. In fact, we \nare telling Corp.s in this country if you are going to protect your \nshareholders and fulfill your fiduciary duties, you better play this \nsoft money game and play it hard and fast or otherwise you will lose \nout in the competitive world.\n  In other words, it is the opposite of what I thought the other party \nwas about--free enterprise. This is the antithesis of free enterprise. \nThis encourages the purchasing of access and power in Washington, not \nthe fair, free-market competition that so many of us believe is the \nunderpinning of our economy. This is the polar opposite of that.\n  Now, the Federal Express Corp. wanted, for a very long time, to get a \nprovision into the law that would prevent their unions from organizing \nin a way that would be meaningful and allow them to get the benefits \nthat they need and the salaries they want from the Federal Express \nCorp. The record of FedEx with regard to employees and unionization is \nnot a good one, and the Federal Express Corp. tried repeatedly to get a \nrider attached to various bills that would do this. They never had a \nhearing on a rider in the House Aviation Subcommittee; they tried to \nattach it to the fiscal year 1996 omnibus appropriations bill and \nfailed; the House Republicans tried to attach it to the fiscal year \n1996 omnibus, another appropriations bill, and failed; they tried to \nattach it to the National Transportation Safety Board Authorization Act \nand failed; they tried to attach it to the Railroad Unemployment Act \nand failed; the Senate Republicans supported attaching the Labor-HHS \nAppropriations Act in the Appropriations Committee and failed; it was \nnot included when the FAA Reauthorization Act passed the House; it was \nnot included when it passed the Senate.\n\n[[Page S10723]]\n\n  And only at the end of the road, with no positive vote in favor of \nthis provision at any point, it was placed in conference committee and \nbrought out to the floor. We remember well last year the fact that we \nhad to actually keep the Senate a few days in session to make the point \non this. This was not a technical correction, as was argued. In fact, \nwhat happened here was that at the very same time this effort was being \nmade by FedEx Corp., some campaign contributions were being made.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. After I finish this.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. About getting speakers in before 1 o'clock.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will try to conclude quickly.\n  Mr. President, at this time, the Federal Express Corp., according to \nCongressional Quarterly on October 2, 1996, had contributed, between \nOctober 17 and November 25, $200,000 to the Democratic Senatorial \nCampaign Committee and $50,000 to the national Republican Senatorial \nCampaign Committee. Specifically, the company also gave $100,000 to the \nDemocratic National Committee and $100,000 to the Republican National \nCommittee right before this provision was stuffed into conference \ncommittee.\n  Now, this is the kind of democracy that we are ratifying.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nthe New York Times dated October 12, 1996, entitled ``This Mr. Smith \nGets His Way in Washington, Federal Express Chief Twists Some Big \nArms.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 12, 1996]\n\nThis Mr. Smith Get His Way in Washington--Federal Express Chief Twists \n                             Some Big Arms\n\n                           (By Neil A. Lewis)\n\n       Washington, Oct. 11.--As the Senate rushed to adjournment \n     earlier this month, one odd and seemingly inconsequential \n     item stood in the way: the insertion of a few words in a 1923 \n     law regulating railway express companies.\n       It was not the kind of thing that would ordinarily seize \n     the attention of senators eager to go home barely a month \n     before Election Day. But they stayed in session until the \n     language was enacted, because the beneficiary of the arcane \n     language was the Federal Express Corporation, which has \n     become one of the most formidable and successful corporation \n     lobbies in the capital.\n       Federal Express wanted the language change because it might \n     exempt its operations from the National Labor Relations Act \n     and, as a result, help it resist efforts by unions to \n     organize its workers. Despite passionate speeches by \n     opponents on behalf of organized labor, the company was able \n     to engineer a remarkable legislative victory, prevailing upon \n     the Senate to remain in session two extra days solely to \n     defeat a filibuster by its opponents.\n       ``I was stunned by the breadth and depth of their clout up \n     here,'' said Senator Russell D. Feingold, a first-term \n     Democrat from Wisconsin who had opposed the change. In the \n     end, Mr. Feingold was one of 31 senators who voted against \n     Federal Express.\n       Senators say the ingredients in Federal Express's success \n     are straightforward, distinguished from other corporate \n     lobbying by degree and skillful application: a generous \n     political action committee, the presence of popular former \n     Congressional leaders from both parties on its board, lavish \n     spending on lobbying, and a fleet of corporate jets that \n     ferry dozens of officeholders to political events around the \n     country.\n       Mr. Feingold said that as he tried to rally support against \n     the Federal Express legislation, he was frequently and \n     fervently rebuffed by colleagues who said they had acquired \n     obligations to the company.\n       ``The sense I got was that this company had made a real \n     strong effort to be friendly and helpful to Congress,'' Mr. \n     Feingold said.\n       He would not identify the lawmakers but said that as he \n     approached them about the legislation, he discovered that \n     many just wanted to talk about how Federal Express had helped \n     them. ``In these informal conversations, people mentioned \n     that they had flown in a Fedex plane or gotten other \n     favors,'' he said.\n       Senator Ernest F. Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat who \n     proposed the amendment to help Federal Express, said he did \n     so because he was grateful to the company for its willingness \n     to use its planes to fly hay to his state during droughts.\n       But others say lawmakers benefit more directly. Senator \n     Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat who is retiring this fall, \n     said that in a caucus of the Senate's Democrats just before \n     the recess, one senior senator refused to oppose the company, \n     bluntly telling his colleagues, ``I know who butters my \n     bread.''\n       Mr. Simon would not identify the lawmaker except to say he \n     was a longtime member of the Senate.\n       ``I know that I have ridden in their planes several \n     times,'' said Mr. Simon, who opposed Federal Express on this \n     bill. ``But what happened here was just a blatant example of \n     the power of their political efforts. If the John Smith \n     company came along and asked for the same thing, it wouldn't \n     have a prayer.''\n       Federal Express, Tennessee's biggest private employer, \n     makes no apologies either for the merits of the legislation \n     it sought or for its efforts to establish relationships with \n     members of Congress.\n       ``We play the game as fairly and aggressively as we can,'' \n     said Doyle Cloud, the vice president of regulatory and \n     government affairs for Federal Express. ``We have issues \n     constantly in Washington that affect our ability to deliver \n     the services our customers demand as efficiently as \n     possible.''\n       For example, Mr. Cloud said, Federal Express regularly \n     seeks to make clearances through customs easier to increase \n     efficiency. ``To do things like that, it's absolutely \n     necessary that we are involved politically as well as \n     regulatorily,'' he said.\n       In addition to its cargo fleet, Federal Express maintains \n     four corporate jets that when not used for company trips are \n     made available to members of Congress. Mr. Cloud said that \n     they were used mostly to ferry groups of lawmakers to a fund-\n     raising event and only rarely for an individual lawmaker.\n       Congressional regulations require that lawmakers using \n     corporate aircraft reimburse the company for the equivalent \n     of first-class air fare, and Mr. Cloud said that was always \n     done. Records maintained publicly by Congress do not show how \n     often members use corporate flights. Federal Express declined \n     to make the company's records available, but Mr. Cloud said \n     that during political seasons, Federal Express might fly a \n     group of lawmakers, about once a week.\n       Two popular former lawmakers, meanwhile, serve on the \n     Federal Express board: George J. Mitchell of Maine, the \n     former Democratic leader of the Senate, and Howard H. Baker \n     Jr., the former Republican leader of the Senate.\n       The company's political action committee is one of the top \n     five corporate PAC's in the nation. In the 1993-94 election \n     cycle it gave more than $800,000 to 224 candidates for the \n     House and Senate. According to the Federal Election \n     Commission, it gave $600,500 to candidates in this cycle \n     through August. The company has also donated more than \n     $260,000 this year to the Democratic and Republican parties.\n       In the first six months of 1996, Federal Express reported \n     spending $1,149,150 to influence legislation, an investment \n     that included the hiring of nine Washington lobbying firms. \n     Typically, a company hires a number of lobbying firms because \n     each one has a relationship with an individual lawmaker who \n     may be important on particular issues.\n       ``The sky's the limit for Federal Express when it wants to \n     get its own customized regulatory protection made into law,'' \n     said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizens, a \n     Washington-based government watchdog group.\n       During the legislative debate last week, it appeared that \n     the company also used a United States Ambassador to press its \n     case, but the diplomat and company have denied that.\n       When a lobbyist for organized labor sought to talk to \n     Senator J. Bennett Johnston about the Federal Express issue, \n     Mr. Johnston replied in the presence of several witnesses \n     that he already had made up his mind, because he had just \n     been successfully lobbied on the issue on behalf of Federal \n     Express by James R. Sasser, Mr. Sasser, a former Democratic \n     senator from Tennessee, is the current Ambassador to China \n     and would be prohibited from lobbying on behalf of Federal \n     Express.\n       Mr. Johnston, a retiring Democrat from Louisiana, said \n     through his spokeswoman that his comment was a ``terrible \n     slip of the tongue.'' The spokeswoman said that Mr. Johnston \n     had just been lobbied by Frederick Smith, the founder and \n     chairman of Federal Express, and that he had meant to use Mr. \n     Smith's name.\n       The spokeswoman, Audra McCardell, said that Senator \n     Johnston had lunch earlier in the week with Ambassador Sasser \n     and that the Federal Express matter had come up ``in \n     chitchat.'' She said that Mr. Johnston had merely told Mr. \n     Sasser how he was going to vote on the issue. For his part, \n     Mr. Sasser, who was retained as a consultant by Federal \n     Express before his confirmation as an ambassador, said in a \n     telephone interview that he did not lobby Mr. Johnston, \n     although they might have discussed the issue.\n       Mr. Smith spends considerable time in Washington, where he \n     is regarded as Federal Express's chief advocate. It was Mr. \n     Smith who hit a lobbying home run in 1977 when he persuaded \n     Congress to allow the fledgling company to use full-sized \n     jetliners to carry its cargo, rather than the small planes to \n     which it had been restricted. Mr. Cloud said that was the \n     watershed event that allowed the company to grow to its \n     present dominating position in the industry, with almost \n     $10.1 billion in annual business.\n       Federal Express has also been able to get other special \n     provisions written into the law. In 1995, for example, \n     Congress gave it an exemption from certain trucking \n     regulations. It has also won exemptions from noise abatement \n     requirements.\n       The provision that Federal Express successfully sought last \n     week was insertion of the words ``express company'' in \n     legislation that designates companies that can be organized \n     by unions only under the Railway Labor Act. Under that law, \n     unions are allowed to organize only in national units,\n\n[[Page S10724]]\n\n     rather than locally. Federal Express is fighting efforts by \n     the United Automobile Workers to unionize its drivers. Of the \n     130,000 domestic employees of the company, only its 3,000 \n     pilots are unionized.\n       Allen Reuther, the U.A.W.'s chief lobbyist, said that the \n     union found it ``especially outrageous for the Senate to \n     provide this special interest provision for just one \n     company.''\n       Federal Express and its supporters in the Senate attached \n     the legislative language as a rider to an airport bill that \n     promised dozens of local airport improvements and enhanced \n     security measures. Many lawmakers who usually vote with labor \n     decided the bill had to pass, even with the Federal Express \n     provision.\n       But the votes of 17 Democrats to help Federal Express by \n     ending a filibuster against the provision--including that of \n     Senator Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota, the minority \n     leader--angered labor officials, especially John J. Sweeney, \n     president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Some union leaders said they \n     might withhold future contributions to the Democratic Senate \n     Campaign Committee.\n       But after Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who \n     led the filibuster, visited Mr. Sweeney on Thursday with a \n     note of thanks for his support, the tension eased and union \n     officials relented. President Clinton signed the airport \n     measure into law on Wednesday.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent a related article a year later \nin the New York Times, August 25, 1997, entitled, ``Face Time for \nFederal Express'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times Aug. 25, 1997]\n\n                     Face Time for Federal Express\n\n       When a big corporate political donor is invited to press \n     his company's case at the White House before the President, \n     he is probably going to expect results. But the attempt by \n     Federal Express to buy influence with the Clinton \n     Administration over an economic dispute with Japan, which was \n     disclosed last week, has not helped anyone.\n       Instead of advancing his company's interests, Frederick \n     Smith, the Federal Express chairman, has probably set them \n     back. Thanks to the now well-documented tendency in this \n     White House to mix policy-making with insatiable political \n     fund-raising, a sensible objective for the United States has \n     been tainted and the 1996 Democratic fund-raising effort has \n     been revealed once again as structurally corrupt.\n       President Clinton says he is proud of the fund-raising he \n     and his party carried out in recent years, and that there \n     were no direct quid pro quos for donors. But the episode \n     involving Federal Express, first reported in the Washington \n     Post, provides a case study in why the system he embraces not \n     only has polluted American politics but has actually damaged \n     American interests abroad.\n       At issue is a long-running demand by Federal Express to fly \n     cargo through Japan to its new hub at Subic Bay, the former \n     American naval base in the Philippines. A 45-year-old \n     aviation agreement between the United States and Japan \n     clearly requires Tokyo to grant access to Federal Express, as \n     this page argued to years ago. Both the Bush and Clinton \n     Administrations have supported the company's cause, by \n     Federal Express wanted sterner action. Mr. Smith used his \n     meeting with Mr. Clinton to press for sanctions against \n     Japan. Federal Express also ponied up $506,000 in campaign \n     contributions to the Democrats last year, along with $540,000 \n     to the Republicans.\n       Federal Express has been a major success story in the \n     competitive global economy, and is worthy of American \n     support. Its gamble in setting up a hub at Subic Bay has \n     revitalized the area around the old naval base. It makes \n     sense in the new age of commercial diplomacy for the United \n     States to help American companies in their attempts to win \n     contracts and market access. But such an approach is simply \n     undercut in the eyes of the world when it looks like nothing \n     more than a payoff for a large political donation.\n       In addition, the United States needs to be sensitive to the \n     risks of favoring one company's interests over another's, \n     however plausible that company's case. The appearance of \n     evenhandedness was undermined by Mr. Clinton's ill-advised \n     meeting with Mr. Smith. Until now, the United States has \n     refrained from the tougher approach of the sanctions \n     demanded by Federal Express. Though sanctions might well \n     be justified and certainly would be legal, there was good \n     reason to hesitate. Sanctions could well invite Japanese \n     retaliation, which, in turn, would almost certainly damage \n     other American companies doing business in Japan. In \n     negotiating with Tokyo, the United States has to weigh the \n     interests of everyone, not just Federal Express.\n       The point is that the United States' bargaining position \n     with Japan has been weakened because of Mr. Smith's clumsy \n     intervention and the Administration's willingness to peddle \n     White House meetings. Even among those in the White House who \n     opposed the idea of sanctions, there was agreement that Mr. \n     Smith had a legitimate complaint. It will be understandable \n     now if Japan takes less seriously an American demand that \n     looks so obviously like a favor to a political contributor.\n       Other airlines have reason to fear that Federal Express \n     will gain an upper hand over them. The way to remove such \n     suspicions is obvious. Enacting legislation banning open-\n     ended contributions by individuals and corporations is the \n     only way to restore integrity to the process in Washington.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That article details a similar series of activities \nthat had to do with FedEx's desires with regard to trade and Japan. \nHere is the real conclusion of the story, and I want others to have a \nchance to speak, so let me continue by saying we all remember that the \nUnited Parcel Service had a strike not too long ago. It was the biggest \nnews in America. Who is their competitor? The Federal Express Corp. The \nFederal Express Corp. used this process, this fundraising process, this \naccess process, this soft money process, to get a special benefit so \nthey don't have that kind of union. They don't have that kind of strike \nbecause their folks can't get together to do that because of Federal \nlaw.\n  What happened? Apparently, as a result of the UPS strike, FedEx \nbenefited. The Federal Express Corp., according to one report, is \ngaining market share because of its adroit handling of additional \nbusiness during the recent UPS strike, analysts say. Some analysts \nestimate that the UPS market share slipped to about 70 percent of the \nU.S. package delivery market from 80 percent before the strike.\n  Mr. President, there is a difference between FedEx and UPS, and the \ndifference was the ability of campaign money to prevent FedEx employees \nfrom organizing the way they want. That is the kind of democracy and \neconomy that we will have if the filibusterers prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague from \nVermont to express my disappointment and regret that the Senate has \nmissed an opportunity today to coalesce around a middle ground that \nwould allow campaign finance reform to advance.\n  Together with Senator McCain, who deserves our gratitude for his \ncourage and tenacity in bringing this issue to the fore, along with \nSenator Jeffords and Senator Specter, I have worked over the past week \nto forge a compromise that would address the two concerns that have \nemerged as the chief stumbling blocks to Senate passage of campaign \nfiance reform. Namely, the objection of Republicans to a package that \ndoes not address the issue of protecting union members from having \ntheir dues used without their permission for political purposes with \nwhich they may disagree. And the objection of Democrats to singling out \nunions while not providing similar protections for members of other \norganizations, or for shareholders in corporations.\n  Last week, in response to concerns which had been raised by the \nminority leader, we proposed an alternative that would provide the same \nprotections to members of organizations across the board, and to \nshareholders of corporations. Together with Senator Jeffords, Senator \nSpecter and Senator McCain, we fine-tuned the proposal into a balanced \napproach with the potential to move this debate forward. It appeared \nour plan was the best hope of preventing a filibuster and advancing \ncampaign finance reform.\n  Unfortunately, our efforts to make the process work in this instance \nwill not succeed today. Despite our willingness to forge a compromise \nwhich would address the concerns of both sides--we have not been able \nto secure an agreement to ensure passage of the compromise.\n  The criticisms of our proposal from both sides are typical of the \nconcerns when a proposal strikes a balance between two dies. Nobody \nreally likes it. One side feels we go too far. The other side feels we \ndon't go far enough.\n  But in the legislative arena, when both sides are committed to moving \nforward and finding a solution, that is how we do it. Both sides give. \nWhile we have not been able to reach a conclusion today, given the \nartificially short time limits imposed by the nature of the \nparliamentary procedure under which we are forced to consider this \nissue, I believe if Senators are truly committed to campaign finance \nreform, then it is definitely dead in this session of Congress.\n\n[[Page S10725]]\n\n  I am saddened, because we have not only an obligation to provide \nlegislative solutions, but to restore the public's faith in the \nintegrity of the process. If we ultimately fail to coalesce around a \nmiddle ground, it would serve only to confirm the public's belief that \nwe lack the will to address this issue in a fair and bipartisan manner. \nAnd it will certainly point to the consequences of a shrinking middle \nin American public life.\n  Mr. President, I have worked hard over the last week with my \ncolleagues on this compromise because I earnestly believe that's what \npeople expect of us. They expect that the U.S. Senate will conduct \nitself as the deliberative body it was designed to be, and they have a \nright to that expectation.\n  We should be putting our heads together, not building walls between \nus with intractable rhetoric and all-or-nothing propositions.\n  I have been part of the legislative process in Congress for over 18 \nyears. I am here because I believe in finding solutions. That is our \njob, Mr. President: finding solutions. Now, I've been here long enough \nto know that that is not always possible. And I've been here long \nenough to know that it is always difficult. But then we were sent here \nto do a difficult job. So I say let's have the difficult conversations \nand really give thoughtful consideration to how we can hurdle our most \nchallenging obstacles. That's the way it should be--that's how we end \nup with better legislation.\n  The fact is, this issue will not go away. The public disillusionment \nwith our campaign finance system will not disappear absent meaningful \nreform. It will come back again and again and again.\n  I believe each and every time it will come down to the basic issue of \nenacting reform that does not unfairly disadvantage either party. As \nlong as we have two-party government, no reform will ever pass unless \nit truly levels the playing field.\n  This is an issue that need not be intractable, as we demonstrated \nwith the proposal we put forward in this debate. It is my belief that \neventually the basis for evenhanded reform is embodied in the middle \nground approach we proposed. Unfortunately, that day will not be today.\n  Finally, I want to issue a challenge to the majority leader and the \nminority leader. It is the duty of leaders to lead. I urge them to do \njust that by appointing a bipartisan working group of Senators who want \nto make the system work.\n  I entered public service to help make Government work. It is a task \nmade more daunting by the mounting chorus of partisanship that has \nengulfed our Nation's politics.\n  The status quo, Mr. President, is unacceptable to virtually everyone \nexcept apparently to many Members of this body. There are, however, \nthose of us on both sides who want to resolve this problem. What we \nneed is the leadership to bring this spirit to life.\n  We need to devote less energy to criticizing and judging each other \nand more to forging consensus and understanding. Only then can we come \ntogether and enact legislation that the majority of Americans feel is \nsensible and long overdue. Let's make, then, a historic statement that \nthe old ways of doing business must be relegated to the annals of \nhistory. Let's return elections to the American people and restore \nconfidence in our Government.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to yield to my colleague and friend, the \nSenator from Vermont, who has worked so hard on the compromise that we \ntry to put forward today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator for a very eloquent statement on \nwhere we are and where we ought to be.\n  I think it is incredibly important that those of us who are as \ndedicated as she is and as I am--perhaps those of us in the middle, as \nso often happens in this body--have to take a look at what we can do to \npull things together.\n  Now, I am personally convinced, having talked with a number of \nDemocratic Senators and a number of Republican Senators, that there are \nat least 60 Senators who want meaningful campaign reform. However, we \nhave postured ourselves at this time and particular moment in a \nsituation where that will not occur. I am pleased in a way that we are \ngoing into a brief period of recess. I am dedicated, as I know the \nSenator from Maine is, to using that period of time to try to find, if \nwe can, a common ground.\n  I think it is important for us to take a look at what we really need \nto do and where the real stumbling blocks are. We are two political \nparties, Republicans and Democrats. Some things advantage one and some \nthings advantage another. So we have to find ways to reform the \ncampaign finance system and do whatever is necessary to make sure that \nwe can find something that both sides can--not willingly, but certainly \nwith the public pressure out there now--do something. We can find a way \nto do that.\n  What needs to be done? The Senator from Maine has done superb work in \ntrying to find a middle ground on one issue with the Democratic Party, \nand that is how to handle the situation with unions--and we would say \nall groups--to make sure that the people that are involved, that have \nto contribute the money, or do contribute the money, have a say in how \nthat money is spent; first, so that they know how it has been spent in \nthe past so they can better judge what happens in the future, but also \nthat they have full disclosure and the ability to say no, or the \nability to at least say ``not my money,'' which is what our amendment \ndoes. I think that is a very big step forward.\n  Now, there have been all sorts of technical problems raised with \nthis, that, and the other thing. But the substance of it is one in \nwhich all America can agree. When you are in the situation where you \nhave money taken from you, you ought to have at least a say as to where \nit is going and, even more important, to say ``not my money.'' ``You \ncan spend your money and the rest of the money, but not mine.'' I think \nthat is a pretty simple philosophy with which many Americans would \nagree.\n  The next area we have to take a look at--and this is critical for the \nRepublicans and it is also the center of debate nationwide--is what \nhappened at the White House with all this money pouring in, hundreds of \nthousands over here, and all that so-called soft money. We have to do \nsomething about that. But to say that, especially under the \nConstitution, we can just ban it, or we can set up rules where you \ncan't use any of it, that is not going to work. It is not going to work \nbecause people have the right under our first amendment to be able to \nspend money on political campaigns, but how much and for what purposes, \nthat can be controlled, as we have found.\n  I will tell you, the money will find a way, some way, to be spent. If \nwe don't have it spent for ``party building'' as ``soft money,'' it \nwill be in ``issue advocacy'' or ``independent expenditures.'' So the \nbest thing to do is to make sure that there are limits placed on it, \nthat there is full disclosure, and that there are ways to make sure \nthat these funds are not abused or become dominant in the process. \nThere are ways to do that. They are not ones that everybody is going to \nreadily agree upon. But on the other hand, from a first amendment \nperspective, the way people want to help a political party ought to be \nsomething that we can find a solution for. So I hope now that we are in \nthis situation where it is obvious that no final decision can be made, \nno way will be found in the next few hours for us to solve this, that \nwe step back and work together. The Senator from Maine and I are both \ndedicated to finding those Senators in the middle that are willing to \nhelp us pull something together so that we can get at least 60 votes.\n  I hope now that we can move back to the regular legislative process \nin the interim, to move legislation along which is necessary to be \nmoved along, and, hopefully, as the Senator suggested, the leaders will \nget together and we can find a way to pull that middle together. There \nmay be kicking and screaming in order to do that, but possibly we can \nfind a way to let this Nation know that we want campaign finance \nreform, we want the process to be one we can be proud of, one which is \nacceptable to the American people, and one which allows everybody to \nknow what is going on. I thank the Senator for her statement. I am \nsorry that we are in this situation, but I think it is important that \nwe take a breath of fresh air and come back in the next week or so and, \nhopefully, make some progress.\n\n[[Page S10726]]\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine still has the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, under the regular order, the Senator from \nMaine cannot yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, for several days now the Senate has debated \ncampaign finance reform legislation. Advocates of the so-called McCain-\nFeingold proposal deserve credit for advancing the issue. \nUnfortunately, in the view of a majority, they have been unable to \nconstruct a bill that does not violate the first amendment to the \nConstitution. There are other proposals for reform that I believe can \naddress the problems without compromising the Constitution. Therefore, \nI will vote to bring at least one of those proposals--the Paycheck \nProtection Act--to a vote but not yet support consideration of McCain-\nFeingold.\n  Some have argued that details are less important than the general \nprinciple of reform. But reform to one is not necessarily reform to \nanother. For example, most Republicans believe that all contributions \nto politics should be voluntary. Most Democrats, on the other hand, say \nthey agree but they are unwilling to give up compulsory union dues that \nare then contributed to candidates. Thus, reform to us is not reform to \nthem.\n  Recognizing that we approach the need for reform from different \nperspectives, I have tried to evaluate the issue by applying some basic \nprinciples that I think most of us would agree with. For example, our \nlaws should be clear, simple, and enforceable. They should insist on \nfull and timely disclosure. They should place constituent interest over \nspecial interest. They should ensure voluntary participation for all. \nAnd, they should protect our right to free speech--unregulated by the \ngovernment. This last principle is significant because our \nconstitutional rights to free speech, free assembly, and the right to \npetition our Government were specifically established to protect our \npolitical expression. The Supreme Court has confirmed this, declaring \nthat political expression is ``at the core of our electoral process and \nof the first amendment freedoms.'' (Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 44 \n(citing Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23 (1968))).\n  The McCain-Feingold proposal incorporates some of these important \nprinciples. For example, the bill requires more timely and detailed \ndisclosure of campaign spending. This allows people to make more \ninformed decisions regarding contributions made to their elected \nleaders. The bill calls for tougher penalties for campaign violations. \nThis might make people think twice about breaking the law. The bill \nattempts to tighten the restrictions on fundraising on federal property \nand strengthen the restriction on foreign money ban. Both of these \nprovisions would address some of the Clinton-Gore campaign finance \nimproprieties. The bill prohibits those under 18 from contributing to \ncampaigns, ensuring that only those who vote can contribute, again \naddressing a problem with the Clinton-Gore campaign. The bill also \nextends the ban on mass mailing by House and Senate Members from 60 \ndays before an election to January 1 of an election year, thereby \nreducing an incumbent advantage.\n  I support the intent, if not the exact language, of each of these \nprovisions. I also believe that any reform legislation should include a \nrequirement that candidates raise a majority of their campaign \ncontributions from within their respective States and that all \npolitical activities be funded with voluntary contributions and not \nextracted in the form of compulsory union dues. The first of these \nproposals is not included in the McCain-Feingold legislation, and I \nbelieve it is necessary to meet the principles of putting constituent \ninterest over special interest. The second proposal is not adequately \ndealt with because of opposition from Senator McCain's Democratic \ncosponsor.\n\n  The most extensive provisions of the McCain-Feingold proposal address \nso-called soft money and issue/express advocacy. While these provisions \nare well intentioned, I believe they would dramatically restrict party \nbuilding activities and free speech for individuals, associations, and \ncitizens.\n  The McCain-Feingold approach to so-called soft money contributions is \nto completely prohibit them. These are contributions of citizens and \norganizations to political parties and cannot be spent for individual \ncandidates. Hard money, on the other hand, is contributed directly to \ncandidates to be spent by them.\n  Unlike hard money, soft money can be contributed in unlimited amounts \nto support political party organizations by helping them to engage in \ngrassroots volunteer activities. The bill's total ban on soft money \ncontributions would restrict State and local campaign committees from \nsupporting the following election activity: voter registration activity \nwithin 120 days before a Federal election; voter identification, get-\nout-the-vote activity, or general campaign activity conducted in \nconnection with any election that includes a candidate for Federal \noffices--generally referred to as party building activity; and a \ncommunication that refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal \noffice and that is made for the purpose of influencing a Federal \nelection. Thus, if the law were to completely ban soft money, it is not \nthe candidates, but the political parties that would suffer the most. \nIs this the type of political activity we really want to get rid of?\n  The McCain-Feingold proposal also explicitly forbids so-called issue \nads, ads that mention a candidate's name within 60 days of a Federal \nelection. Issue advocacy can best be defined as any speech relating to \nissues and the policy positions taken by candidates and elected \nofficials. It can be as simple as a statement such as, ``Senator \nSmith's position on school vouchers is dead wrong.'' Or it can be as \ninvolved as a multimillion dollar campaign of broadcast and print \nadvertisements that spreads the same message. The Constitution protects \nthe right of any group or individual to engage in issue advocacy. It is \nthe essence of free speech.\n  Attempts to regulate and require disclosure of issue advocacy \nexpenditure through statute and through FEC regulation have repeatedly \nbeen declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and lower Federal \ncourts. The Court has always viewed issue advocacy as a form of speech \nthat deserves the highest degree of protection under the first \namendment. Not only has the Court been supportive of issue advocacy, \nthe justices have affirmatively stated that they are untroubled by the \nfact that issue advertisements may influence the outcome of an \nelection. In fact, in Buckley versus Valeo, the court stated:\n\n       The distinction between discussion of issues and candidates \n     and advocacy of the election or defeat of candidates may \n     often dissolve in practical application. Candidates, \n     especially incumbents, are often intimately tied to public \n     issues involving legislative proposals and governmental \n     actions. Not only do candidates campaign on the basis of \n     their positions on various public issues, but campaigns \n     themselves generate issues of public interest. Buckley v. \n     Valeo, 424 U.S.1, 42 (1976).\n\n  Moreover, defenders of the first amendment know that the freedom to \nengage in robust political debate in our democracy will be at risk if \nthe Congress or the FEC is given the authority to ban issue ads close \nto an election, or evaluate the content of issue ads to determine if \nthey are really a form of express advocacy. The Supreme Court \nrecognized this danger long before Buckley versus Valeo. In 1945, in \nThomas versus Collins, the Court states:\n\n       . . . the supposedly clear-cut distinction between \n     discussion, laudation, general advocacy, and solicitation \n     puts the speaker in these circumstances wholly at the mercy \n     of the varied understanding of his hearers and consequently \n     of whatever inference may be drawn as to his intent and \n     meaning. Such a distinction offers no security for free \n     discussion. In these conditions it blankets with uncertainty \n     whatever may be said. It compels the speaker to hedge and \n     trim Thomas v. Collins 323 U.S. 516 (1945).\n\n  McCain-Feingold would impose regulations on issue advocacy in \nviolation of Court declarations. Advocacy groups such as the National \nRight to Life, Sierra Club, and National Taxpayers Union, to name just \na few, would be severely circumscribed in the exercise of their first \namendment rights. The FEC has a poor track record of trying to broadly \ninterpret current election statues to encompass issue advocacy speech.\n  In fact, as recently as October 6, 1997, the Supreme Court let stand \na circuit court decision striking FEC regulations because they \ninfringed upon a\n\n[[Page S10727]]\n\ngroup's right to characterize a candidate's position on abortion \nrights. Maine Right to Life v, FEC (1997WL274826, 65USWL3783) (October \n6, 1997) (Case number 96-1818).\n  The result of the McCain-Feingold 60-day ban on issue advocacy before \nan election will be that associations or groups of citizens could not \ncharacterize a candidate's record on radio and television during that \nperiod. It would, thus, severely limit citizen involvement and speech.\n  The only recourse would be for such associations--nonprofit 501(c)3 \nand 501(c)4 organizations--to create new institutional entities--\npolitical action committees [PAC's]--to legally speak within 60 days \nbefore an election. Such groups would, thereby, also be forced to \ndisclose all contributors to the new PAC.\n  Not all members of nonprofit organizations want to become members of \nPAC's. Separate accounting procedures, new legal costs, and separate \nadministrative processes would be imposed on these groups, merely so \nthat their members could preserve their first amendment rights.\n  It is noteworthy that none of these proposals seek to regulate the \nability of the media to exercise its enormous license to editorialize \nin favor or against candidates at any given time.\n  Finally, as noted, McCain-Feingold does not ensure that American \ncitizens have the right to voluntarily participate in the political \nprocess. I am specifically referring to the protection from mandatory \nwithdrawals of dues from a worker's paycheck for political activities \nwithout prior approval. Contrary to the claims of its supporters, \nMcCain-Feingold does not provide such protection.\n  As written, the McCain-Feingold legislation applies only to nonunion \nmember employees. These are workers who choose not to join a union, but \nwho under a collective bargaining agreement must pay dues--that is, \nagency fees--to support the costs of union representation. McCain-\nFeingold covers only 10 percent of the roughly 18 million dues-paying \nemployees nationwide. I support Senator Lott's Paycheck Protection Act, \nwhich covers all 18 million.\n  McCain-Feingold also requires labor unions to notify these nonunion \nmembers that they are entitled to request a refund of the portion of \ntheir dues or agency fees used for political purposes. The effect of \nthis proposal is to place the burden on the worker--after the fact--to \npetition for a refund of these automatically withdrawn dues. By \ncontrast, Senator Lott's Paycheck Protection Act requires unions to \nobtain union and nonunion employee's written permission first before \nusing any portion of his or her dues for political activities.\n  Simply put, I believe all contributions to political activities \nshould be voluntary. No one should have automatic political withdrawals \nfrom his or her paycheck unless consent is first given. The Paycheck \nProtection Act codifies this right. McCain-Feingold does not.\n  To conclude, I strongly believe certain aspects of our campaign \nfinance system need reform. But reform that is consistent with the \nprinciples I outlined earlier. Although well intentioned, McCain-\nFeingold layers more regulation on top of current regulation and also \ninfringes upon the constitutional rights to free speech and \nassociation. And it does not guarantee voluntary participation in the \npolitical process. For these reasons I cannot support it in its current \nform.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \ncampaign finance reform legislation sponsored by Senators McCain and \nFeingold.\n  The McCain/Feingold bill is a beginning, and is an important step \ntowards reforming how we finance campaigns. It ends soft money \ncontributions to national parties, expands disclosure requirements, and \nstrengthens election law. It puts guidelines on hard money \ncontributions and begins to address the problem of so-called ``issue \nadvocacy'' advertisements that may be designed to persuade the public \nabout a candidate instead of educating the public about an issue. It \nalso requires labor unions to notify non-union members that they are \nentitled to request a refund of the portion their agency fees used for \npolitical purposes. Make no mistake about it--one bill cannot end the \nspiraling cost of campaigns or stop the coercive influence of money in \nour government. But it is a beginning.\n  I am more convinced than ever that our current approach to funding \npolitical campaigns is broken and desperately in need of repair. My \ngood friend, Senator Ford from Kentucky, cited the great cost of \ncampaigns and the immense time needed to raise money as the reason for \nhis retirement from the United States Senate. He explained that to run \nfor re-election in 1998, he would need to spend the next two years \nraising $100,000 per week. Today, a run for the Senate may require over \n$5 million. On average, a Senator needs to raise $16,000 per week \nduring their six year term to accumulate the funds needed to run a \ncredible campaign.\n  Not only are distinguished elected officials leaving public service \ndue to the daunting cost of running for office, but many Americans have \ndecided not to seek office because it simply costs too much money. This \nrobs us of leaders with new ideas and diverse backgrounds, and it \nthreatens to undermine our country's participatory democracy.\n  Our democracy rests upon the fundamental principle that every \nperson's vote is equal. A citizen walks into a voting booth, casts his \nor her vote, and the majority rules. But only fifty percent of \nAmericans vote and only four percent of the population contribute to \ncampaigns.\n  The American people worry that those who wrote the checks now expect \nto write the laws. They see powerful lobbyists working to turn back the \nclock on 25 years of environmental protection, and to unravel laws that \nkeep our workplaces safe and protect the food we eat. This appearance \nof undue influence supports the public's cynicism.\n  Incredibly, those who defend politics as usual are not concerned \nabout the amount of money in our political process. These leaders \ninsist that the political process is fine, even though a record $765 \nmillion was consumed on House and Senate campaigns in 1996. In fact, \nSpeaker Gingrich and other leaders in his party complain that too \nlittle, not too much, money is spent today on political campaigns.\n  We all know that the Government Affairs Committee is, even as we \nspeak, holding extensive hearings on the campaign finance practices of \nthe last Presidential election. Yet, as we have seen here on the floor \nthis week, the Majority Leader and most of those in his party would do \nnothing. However, there are a few Republicans, including one of the \nleaders on this issue Senator McCain, who have voted the responsible \nway and I commend them. It is now time to come together in a bipartisan \nmanner and focus on the future of elections in America for all \nAmericans.\n  Since I was elected to Congress as part of ``Class of 1974,'' I have \nconsistently fought for campaign finance reform. Since 1985, I have \ncosponsored seven campaign finance reform bills to remove the influence \nof money in elections and bring democracy back to the people of this \ncountry. In an attempt to curb the threatening influence of money, I \nhave supported prohibitions in ``soft money'' in federal elections, and \nas the General Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, I \nchallenged my counterparts to do the same. In another effort to limited \nthe influence of money, I have supported caps on PAC contributions to \ncandidates and limits on the total amount Senate candidates can accept \nfrom PACs. To level the playing field, and help challengers gain \nexposure, I have agreed to proposals for free or reduced response \nadvertisement costs for candidates attacked by independent \nexpenditures. I have supported requirements that Senate candidates \nraise most of their money from their home states in an attempt to bring \nelections back home to the people. Finally, I voted for a \nConstitutional amendment allowing Congress to set campaign spending \nlimits. I know many of my fellow colleagues share my commitment to \nreform.\n  As we debate reform, I am concerned that we stand behind the Federal \nElection Commission, which is charged with monitoring and watching \ncampaign finance violations. The FEC must have the finances and \nresources it needs to promptly and effectively enforce the laws that \ngovern our campaigns. Between 1994 and November\n\n[[Page S10728]]\n\n1996, the FEC's caseload rose 36 percent, and because complaints \nrelated to the 1996 election are still being filed, the FEC expects the \ncaseload to ultimately rise by 52 percent. Of the 262 complaints filed \nwith the FEC in the latest election cycle, only 88 are currently under \nactive review.\n\n  To address the effectiveness of the FEC, earlier this year I authored \nthe FEC Improvement Act. I am pleased that most of the proposals from \nmy bill--including electronic filing, authorizing the FEC to conduct \nrandom audits, and stiffer penalties--have been incorporated into the \nMcCain/Feingold legislation.\n  Time after time, Congress has talked about reform but in the end done \nnothing. Over the past 10 years, Congress has produced over 6,742 pages \nof hearings, members have made over 3,361 speeches, committees have \nproduced more than 1,063 pages of reports, the Senate has recorded over \n113 votes and formed one bipartisan commission. Yet in the end, it's \njust been business as usual, while the voice of the average American in \nour democratic process grows fainter, quality candidates say no to \npublic service, and our democracy withers.\n  I regret that the Senate this week has again missed an opportunity to \npass comprehensive reform. The Senate missed another opportunity even \nthough 53 Senators voted to fully consider the bill. I am saddened that \nthe majority leader, along with the majority of his Republican \ncolleagues, deployed procedural tactics that thwarted real reform. I \nlament this maneuver.\n  It saddens me that the Republicans have chosen to sabotage this \nbipartisan bill. It saddens me even more that this procedural sabotage \noccurred after concerted efforts to accommodate Republican concerns. \nImportant provisions including voluntary spending limits, free or \ndiscounted television and advertising time, and curbs on contributions \nto PAC's have all been modified in the spirit of bipartisanship. \nHowever, the Senate now may not even have a clean vote on campaign \nfinance reform legislation this session.\n  I have voted against Senator Lott's amendment because it was not a \nbipartisan effort. The Lott amendment was a partisan maneuver to end \nefforts for comprehensive campaign finance reform. I will continue to \nvote against any amendments that lack solid bipartisan support and harm \na constructive effort for real reform. Conversely, I will consider \nsupporting any amendments to the current legislation that have \nbipartisan support and would improve this bill. I will also continue to \nsupport any positive efforts by both sides to have campaign finance \nreform considered by the Senate for a full and complete debate this \nsession.\n  I call on all my colleagues to chart a new course, to put aside our \ndifferences, and to put first and foremost in our deliberations the \ngood of the Nation. As leaders, we must not shirk our responsibility to \ndo all we can to the reform campaign finance system. The McCain-\nFeingold bill begins that process, and I believe that as a body we have \na solemn responsibility to embrace this legislation.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, S. 25, the Campaign Finance Reform \nAct of 1997 does not represent my ideal package of reform. In fact, S. \n25 is far from it. I believe, however, that this legislation does bring \nus one step closer to getting the kind of real, comprehensive campaign \nfinance reform we so desperately need.\n  We need to get Americans back into the system and get them involved \nin decisions that affect their lives. We need campaign finance reform \nto restore the American people's faith in the electoral process. \nAmericans are frustrated; many believe that the current system cuts \nthem off from their government. A League of Women Voters study found \nthat one of the top three reasons people do not vote is the belief that \ntheir vote will not make a difference. We saw the result of this \ncynicism in 1994 when just 38 percent of all registered voters headed \nto the polls. And we saw it again in 1996 when only 49 percent of the \nvoting age population turned out to vote--the lowest percentage of \nAmericans to go to the polls in 72 years.\n  I have noticed a difference in voter turnout since my own election. \nIn 1992, I won with 2.6 million votes, which was 53 percent of \nIllinois' total vote. In 1996, Senator Durbin won with a vote total of \n2.3 million, which was 55.8 percent of the total vote. Senator Durbin \nwon by a greater margin but with fewer total votes cast.\n  Unfortunately, the effort needed to raise the average of $4 million \nper Senate race decreases the time Senators need to meet their \nobligations to all of their constituents. According to recent Federal \nElection Commission figures, congressional candidates spent a total of \n$765.3 million in the 1996 elections, up 5.5 percent from the record-\nsetting 1994 level of $725.2 million. That figure does not include the \nhuge amounts of ``soft money'' spent by political parties.\n  Furthermore, when voters see that the average amount contributed by \nPACs to House and Senate candidates is up from $12.5 million in 1974 to \n$178.8 million in 1994--a 400 percent rise even after factoring in \ninflation over that period--there is a perception that lawmakers are \ntoo reliant on special interests to make public policy that serves the \nnational interest. More and more voters believe that Members of \nCongress only listen to these special interest contributors, while \nfailing to listen to the very constituents who put them into office.\n  That is part of the reason why there is overwhelming public support \nfor reform. And make no mistake, there is a real public consensus that \nreform is needed--now. Ordinary Americans want--and deserve--government \nthat is responsive to their needs and problems. The way to do that is \nthrough spending limits. Spending limits will make our system more open \nand more competitive. Spending limits can help focus elections more on \nthe issues, instead of on advertising.\n  We must be sure that we don't have a process that only further \nempowers political elites that are already empowered. We want campaign \nfinance reform that allows candidates more time to talk to voters. \nVoters want to know that the system works for ordinary Americans and \nnot just those few who can devote substantial time and money to \npolitics. They deserve better than the present system.\n  S. 25 addresses some of these needs. This bill prohibits soft money \ncontributions to national political parties, increases the amount of \n``hard'' money individuals may contribute to State parties for use in \nFederal elections, and increases the amount of ``hard'' money an \nindividual may contribute in aggregate to all Federal candidates and \nparties in a single year.\n  In addition, S. 25 expands disclosure requirements and strengthens \nelection law violations to lessen the influence of ``big money'' in \ncampaigns.\n  I believe that these are vital first steps toward addressing the \nproblems of the current system. Campaign finance reform cannot work for \nevery American, however, unless it also works for every candidate, \nincluding minority candidates and women. Minority and women candidates \ncurrently have less access to the large sums needed to run for office \nthan other candidates. That financial inequity is one of the primary \nreasons both women and minorities have long been under represented in \nboth the Senate and House. The increased occurrence of big money \ncandidates feeding their own campaigns and driving up the costs of \ncampaigns overall only adds to the barriers keeping women and \nminorities out of public office.\n  Unfortunately, S. 25 does little to stop or control these upward \nspiraling costs, and that is disappointing, because self-financing \ncandidates continue to be a rapidly growing phenomenon in our current \npolitical system. While it is true that these millionaires don't always \nwin, no one can honestly deny that these individuals contribute to the \nincreasing campaign costs that turn so many voters off. In 1994, for \nexample, one candidate for the Senate spent a record setting $29 \nmillion, 94 percent of which was his own money. And during the last \nelection cycle, a presidential candidate spent $30 million of his own \nmoney for just the primary elections.\n  Even more appalling is the fact that self-financing candidates do not \nhave to demonstrate broad financial support to either launch or support \ntheir candidacies. Allowing these self-financing candidates to avoid \nhaving to show a broad range of support is, I believe truly \nundemocratic. In fact, I believe\n\n[[Page S10729]]\n\nthat every candidate should be able to demonstrate that they have the \nsupport of a broad range of individuals and organizations, that their \ncandidacy has, in fact, come about as a true desire of the ``people.''\n  If we could prove that spending exorbitant amounts of money on \ncampaigns increased voter turnout, we would have an excuse for allowing \nthe costs of campaigns to continue escalating. But we cannot. While the \ntotal amount raised for the 1996 election by both Democrats and \nRepublicans increased by 70 percent over the same period during the \n1991-92 cycle, voter turnout has plummeted to its lowest point since \n1924. What's more, these funds are often used to finance negative, \nnongermane, and personally distasteful ads that do nothing more than \nturn off the voters and take attention away from issues of vital \nimportance to all Americans, such as retirement security, education, \nand children's health. If we continue this trend, the wealthiest \nAmericans will be the only ones who will be able to afford to \nparticipate in our political system, leaving the rest of us to only \ndream about contributing to this democracy.\n  If candidates were required to seek and demonstrate support from a \nbroad range of individuals--an important component of the democratic \nprocess--the Supreme Court might see the First Amendment issue somewhat \ndifferently. An appropriate analogy would be the laws that require \ncandidates to obtain a certain number of signatures as a requirement \nfor access to the ballot. In other words, the reason for this limit \nwould not be to equalize resources, but to ensure that the amounts \ncandidates spend have some relation to breadth of support. This \nproposal may be at least arguably consistent with Buckley, since the \nCourt in that case recognized that the government has ``important \ninterests in limiting places on the ballot to those candidates who \ndemonstrate substantial popular support.''\n  In fact, it is that statement by the Court which demonstrates the \nflaw in the Buckley versus Valeo decision. In the not too distant past, \na candidate had to have the endorsement of a political party, or have \nhis or her own strong, grass roots organization in order to have the \nlarge number of people it takes to gather sufficient petitions to be \nput on the ballot. Now, however, it is actually possible to hire people \nto collect petition signatures, so petitioning does not necessarily \ndemonstrate broad support the way it used to. In fact, a wealthy \ncandidate, under the current state of the law, doesn't have to have any \nbroad support at all to gain access to the ballot, only enough money to \nhire enough petition collectors. If the important government interest \nthe Buckley Court acknowledged is to be protected, therefore, some \nlimits on the use of money by wealthy candidates is required. The use \nof money by wealthy candidates has to be brought into the bill's \nreforms.\n\n  This bill could have only been strengthened by a provision that would \nhave created some mechanism to control this form of campaign financing. \nIt is unfortunate that this bill does not have such a provision, as I \nhave no doubt that, ultimately, unregulated financing will have no \nresult but to drive voters, and talented but less wealthy candidates, \nout of the electorate.\n  Despite this shortcoming, I fully support the goals and the spirit of \nS. 25. It is a solid bill, and a firm step toward the type of \ncomprehensive campaign finance reform that our nation needs to ensure \nthat our electorate becomes involved and has more faith in the people \nthey send to Congress to represent them. S. 25 has the potential to \nreduce some of the cynicism many Americans feel toward the electoral \nprocess, and therefore has the potential to ignite in many Americans \nthe type of desire to become more involved in debates on fundamental \nissues like retirement security, healthcare security, and education.\n  Voters, and not money, should determine election results. The money \nchase has gotten out of control, and voters know that big money stifles \nthe kind of competitive elections that are essential to our democracy. \nS. 25 is a crucial first step in bringing campaigns back to the people. \nI urge my colleagues to support S. 25, and I urge my colleagues to \ncontinue considering ways in which we can encourage the American people \nto continue playing a role in our democracy.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my vote against \ncloture on the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform legislation.\n  As a supporter of campaign finance reform, I have previously outlined \nthe standards which any reform legislation MUST meet in order to gain \nmy support. In addition, I insist that there be some objectives which \nshould be evident in any reform bill. The McCain-Feingold bill, \nunfortunately, falls short of reaching both of these standards, thus I \nvoted against cloture.\n  First in the ``must'' category is that any reform legislation must be \nconsistent with the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United \nStates. Mr. President I could not support McCain-Feingold because some \nprovisions of the bill would establish prior restraint on political \nspeech. Specifically, section 201 of the bill which seeks to redefine \n``express advocacy'' raises serious constitutional questions and would \nin my judgement fall short of the constitutional standard established \nin Buckley Valeo (1976), the landmark case on campaign finance reform.\n  Second in the ``must'' category is that the legislation must not \nimpede or intrude on the prerogatives of the states and local units of \ngovernment with respect to how they conduct political campaigns. Mr. \nPresident, there are provisions in the McCain-Feingold legislation that \nwill limit the ability of the state and local political party \ncommittees to conduct legitimate election activity. Moreover, I feel \nthat as presently constituted, McCain-Feingold would set in motion a \nprocess which ultimately would result in even further intrusion of \nstate and local government election law.\n  Any campaign finance reform legislation must also, in my judgement, \nmaintain a proper balance between the first amendment rights of the \nactual candidates and the political parties they represent and the \nrights of those who are not directly in the arena. Unfortunately, \nMcCain-Feingold tilts the balance strongly in the direction of special \ninterest groups. As these special interest groups grow in dominance, \nthey simultaneously diminish the roles of the candidates and political \nparties. This, Mr. President, is not the way our founding fathers \nenvisioned that our democratic electoral system would conduct itself. \nCandidates, political parties and interest groups should all be able to \nparticipate in the electoral system under the first amendment, however \none entity should not be able to dominate the political speech arena. \nOtherwise, Mr. President we will end up with a system in which the \ncandidates themselves are more bystanders than participants and in \nwhich the various interest groups on all sides of all the issues are \ndoing all of the talking.\n  Furthermore, any campaign reform legislation we pass must be \nbalanced. I believe that McCain-Feingold was not balanced and clearly \ncontained provisions that would protect and enhance the ability of the \nDemocratic Party to raise funds from its traditional sources, while \ndisproportionately limiting the ability of the Republican Party to \nconduct itself.\n  Finally Mr. President, to have my support, any new campaign finance \nlegislation must address what I find in my state to be the most \ndisturbing aspect of the way American federal elections are funded: \nnamely, the increasing extent to which the campaigns of candidates for \nthe House and Senate are financially supported by people who are not \neven constituents of the candidates themselves. McCain-Feingold does \nnot even address this problem. There was no attempt in this bill to \nlimit out of state or non-constituent contributions to a candidate.\n  As I mentioned previously, I do support reforming the method by which \nour federal campaigns are financed. Any campaign finance reform bill I \nsupport must be consistent with the Constitution, not impede on local \nand state government prerogatives, affect both parties fairly and \nequally, and address the problem of special interest, out-of-state \nmoney. Unfortunately, the McCain-Feingold legislation failed to meet \nthese tests and, therefore, did not have my support.\n  While Congress will continue to work on this issue, I feel it is \nunnecessary to\n\n[[Page S10730]]\n\nwait for legislation before those of us who are concerned take action. \nIn fact, during my campaign in 1994, I voluntarily imposed my own \nlimits on the flow of PAC and out-of-state dollars to my campaign. \nInstead of simply waiting around for Congress to act, I will continue \nto observe voluntary caps and encourage other Members to act themselves \nin ways they might choose to address concerns they have with our \nsystem.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in an effort to try to accommodate the \nSenators here, we have about 9 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would it be agreeable to the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from Wyoming that they each take 4 \nminutes, and I will have the last minute, as I have not spoken in this \nhour? Would that be fair?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, is it possible to get an extra 2 minutes?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is 9 minutes until the vote. I say to my friend \nfrom Massachusetts, if we quit talking about it and enter into an \nagreement, you will have 4 minutes, Senator Enzi will have 4 minutes, \nand I will have 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me speak rather quickly as to where we \nfind ourselves. Notwithstanding the comments just heard with respect to \nthe desire for campaign finance reform, there is one simple fact that \nthe country is about to witness. The U.S. Senate is about to see \ncampaign finance reform stay off the calendar and only come back, not \nas a matter of automatic debate on the floor of the Senate, only come \nback if the majority leader decides he wants to bring it back.\n  Effectively, we are witnessing 45 Democrat U.S. Senators prepared to \nvote today for McCain-Feingold, for campaign finance reform, and we \nhave at least 4 Republican Senators prepared to vote for it today, and \nwe are being denied the ability to be able to have that up-or-down vote \non campaign finance reform. That is the bottom line. That is what is \nhappening here.\n  The fact is that we have had an awful lot of straws sort of put up as \nthe reason for doing this--people hiding behind the first amendment, \npeople hiding behind the notion that incumbency is at stake. Incumbents \nget most of the money today. The current system protects incumbents.\n  Under McCain-Feingold and under the Supreme Court, both have said you \ncan't limit issue advocacy. There is nothing in this bill that \nrestrains the capacity of any American to go out and talk about an \nissue. There is something in this bill that tries to say we are going \nto draw a distinction between that which is really advocacy for an \nissue and that which is trying to elect or defeat a candidate.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is here is what this fight is about. \nWe have a group of people who believe that their hold on power and \ntheir ability to be elected is dependent on the money that they spend. \nThey are seeking a partisan political advantage in whatever structure \nthey try to form as campaign finance reform. Now, that is not new here. \nI have seen that on this side of the aisle, too. My colleagues are \nfairly--and I underscore ``fairly''--concerned about whether or not, if \nthey are limited in some regard, people who oppose them--in some \ninstances labor--are going to have an unfair advantage. We ought to \nhave a fairer playing field.\n  But what Senator Snowe and Senator Jeffords offered us as we tried to \nnegotiate was not a fair playing field. We wound up with labor having \nto have its members give their written consent as to what they would \nallow their dues to do. But a member of the National Rifle Association, \na stockholder of AT whose money also winds up going into political \npurposes, would not be treated the same.\n  So, in effect, we will see a failure today because the Republicans \ndecided they wanted to try to legislate an unfair advantage to \nthemselves. We are simply not going to allow that to happen. It is a \ntragedy for the American people that partisan efforts are going to take \nprecedence over what is an overwhelming desire by the American people \nto see their democracy protected and not to have it increasingly become \na dollar-ocracy or whatever you want to call it. Increasingly, this \nsystem is broken. Everybody knows it. For the Senate simply to sort of \nfall prisoner to a parliamentary process of partisanship rather than a \ngenuine effort to try to come to agreement, I think, does not serve any \nof us well here. I regret that. I regret it for the institution. For \nthe 13 years I have been here, we have been trying to deal with \ncampaign finance reform. One side or the other is always trying to find \nthat advantage. We have shown how you can do it fairly. Everybody in \nthe country, I think, has a pretty good definition of that fairness. I \nhope my colleagues will recognize as they go home that their citizens \nand constituents are really fed up and want change.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in favor of campaign reform, but not \nthe proposal before us. I resent that we must apparently be for this \nbill before us or we are pictured as being opposed to reform.\n  This bill has gone through somewhat of a transformation, but not \nmuch. Rather than reform the way campaigns are financed, this \nlegislation would infringe on the first amendment rights of millions of \nAmerican citizens and place enormous burdens on candidates running for \noffice. We must ensure the enforcement of the current law before we \nbuild a whole new bureaucracy. That is what we are talking about.\n  I believe this debate over changes in campaign laws is especially \ntimely in light of the recent discovery of the video tapes of the White \nHouse coffees. It is illegal to campaign, it is illegal to raise money \non Federal property. They are more suspicious since the White House \nwithheld the critical evidence from the investigative committee for \nover 8 months. They just found the tapes? They just found part of the \ntapes--44 out of 150? How hard can tapes be to find? Don't they have a \nprocedure for storing tapes? If they are important enough for history \nin the first place, should there not be a mechanism for finding them?\n  While it's not clear what took place, it calls out for a serious \ninvestigation and the appointment of a special prosecutor.\n  Now we want to add extra criteria. If we just add them, will Congress \nbe the only ones who have to abide by them? Will an acceptable defense \nbe that everybody is doing it, even if that is not true? One of the \nlessons I learned in my 18 years in elected office is that you don't \nincrease compliance with existing laws by increasing the complexity. We \nhaven't talked about truth in advertising. We haven't talked about how \nmuch money is being spent and a way to disclose and to get accurate and \ncomplete disclosure from all groups that are involved in the process. \nWe are only touching on campaign finance reform, and we are calling it \nthe whole ball of wax, the whole answer to everything.\n  Mr. President, while the McCain-Feingold legislation claims to clean \nup elections, it does so by placing unconstitutional restrictions on \ncitizen's ability to participate in the political process. For the past \nfew weeks, we have heard Members of this Senate bemoan the fact that \nvarious citizen groups have taken out ads criticizing them during their \nelections. Having just run my first statewide campaign last year, I can \nsympathize with my colleagues who have been the object of often pointed \nand critical campaign ads. I've said frequently that campaigns need a \ngood truth in advertising law. That's not restriction of free speech. \nThat's requiring honest speech. Yes, there are fine lines of spin, but \nwe haven't even tried to clean up the blatantly wrong ads. Instead we \nwant to restrict the right to even tell the truth. I believe that in a \nfree society it is essential that citizens have the right to articulate \ntheir positions on issues and candidates in the public forum. The first \namendment to our Constitution was drafted to ensure that future \ngenerations would have the right to engage in public political \ndiscourse that\n\n[[Page S10731]]\n\nis vigorous and unfettered. Throughout even the darkest of chapters in \nour Nation's history, our first amendment has provided an essential \nprotection against inclinations to tyranny. Our political future relies \non the protection of free speech.\n  The Supreme Court has consistently held that the first amendment \nprotects the right of individual citizens and organizations to express \ntheir views even through issue advocacy and even if its aimed at an \nindividual. The Court has consistently maintained that individuals and \norganizations do not fall within the restrictions of the Federal \nelection code simply by engaging in this advocacy.\n  Issue advocacy includes the right to promote any candidate for office \nand his views as long as the communication does not in express terms \nadvocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate. As \nlong as independent communication does not cross the bright line of \nexpressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate, individuals \nand groups are free to spend as much as they want promoting or \ncriticizing a candidate and his views. While these holdings may not \nalways be welcome to those of us running campaigns, they represent a \nlogical outgrowth of the first amendment's historic protection of core \npolitical speech. We talk about how much money is spent that way for \nadvocacy, but we are just guessing. We are jumping to the step of \nprecluding that right of free speech talking about how much the cost of \ncampaigns have gone up, but we don't even have a mechanism for \nreporting that in any meaningful way. That should be the first step. We \nneed quick and complete disclosure of all funds spent in a campaign, \ndirectly and indirectly. That means hard money and soft. We need to \nknow from where and whom it comes and for what it was spent. Obviously \nwe need to know how the money got there. We need to know that the laws \non collecting it apply to everyone. That's a simpler step than what is \nproposed and more constitutional too.\n  These unconstitutional restrictions of this bill would increase the \npower of the media elites at the expense of the average American voter. \nOur Founding Fathers drafted the first amendment to protect against \nattempts such as these to prohibit one segment of our society from \nentering into public discourse on issues that greatly affect them.\n  I commend the sponsors for eliminating from the most recent version \nof their legislation the provision that forced businesses to give away \ntheir product in the form of free broadcast time. I also appreciated \nthem taking out the complicated funding formulas. Nonetheless, I still \ncannot support legislation that stifles the free speech of the American \ncitizens and gives expanded new powers to a Washington bureaucracy. For \nthese reasons, I must oppose the revised McCain-Feingold legislation. I \nask my colleagues to join me in paying trouble to the first amendment \nand opposing the McCain-Feingold legislation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his important \ncontribution to this debate. We have 25 speakers in opposition to \nMcCain-Feingold, and a growing number of our Members want to speak out \nin opposition to this piece of legislation.\n  I think a very encouraging thing happened this morning that I would \nlike to report to my colleagues right before the vote.\n  I had an opportunity to attend an announcement of a new organization \ncalled the James Madison Center for Free Speech. What the James Madison \nCenter for Free Speech is going to do is handle litigation all across \nthe country in cases involving political speech. We have heard it \nannounced that the forces of reform who want to shut Americans out of \nthe political process and being frustrated in Washington are taking \ntheir cases out around America. There have been various State laws and \nreferenda that have passed--all of them, so far, struck down in the \nFederal courts. But the James Madison Center is going to be there to \nrepresent litigants all across America who stand up for first amendment \nfree speech.\n  I think that is an important announcement. The proponents of campaign \nfinance reform have said they are not going to go away. The opponents \nare not going to go away. The James Madison Center is going to be there \nevery time free speech is threatened anywhere in America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call \nunder rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a minority has prevailed for the moment in \nblocking campaign finance reform. They will not prevail forever. \nSponsors of campaign finance reform knew from the outset that our \nlegislation faced long odds. We knew that finding a supermajority of \nSenators to cut off debate would be very difficult. Not impossible, but \ndifficult.\n  What we had hoped might occur is that as the amending process on the \nbill proceeded, Senators from both sides of the aisle would begin to \nfind common ground on this subject, and the basis for a fair bipartisan \ncompromise would be discovered. That was not to be the case, however, \nbecause the rules of this debate were structured to prevent anyone from \noffering any amendment. No vote on any single aspect of campaign \nfinance reform was allowed, and that's unfortunate.\n  The chief opponent of our bill, the Senator from Kentucky, very \nforthrightly claimed that he would proudly cast a vote against any bill \nthat sought to reduce the amount of money that currently soaks our \nFederal election system. I commend him for his candor and having the \ncourage of his convictions.\n  Mr. President, I wish all opponents of campaign finance reform were \nso forthright. I wish all Members of the Senate could have had the \nopportunity to unambiguously register their support for or opposition \nto campaign finance reform in all its forms so that the American people \nwould have a clear public record of where we all stood on the subject. \nI can only assume that the public was denied a clear record because \nsome of us are apprehensive about how the public would react to our \nvotes. I cannot find any other explanation for the elaborate lengths \nopponents of the bill went to in order to prevent a single vote on any \namendment to this legislation.\n  I do not resent the use of the filibuster to obstruct reform. I \nregret it, but I do not resent it. It is a frequent roadblock to action \nin the Senate, and I and the other sponsors of the bill always \nunderstood that we must overcome it to prevail. Necessary to our \nefforts to overcome this institutional obstruction, however, is the \namendment process. We believe that if Senators are obliged to vote yea \nor nay on various aspects of reform, the public's reaction to our votes \nmight persuade 60 Senators to vote to limit debate. But as I have \nnoted, we were precluded from offering and disposing of amendments.\n  As I made clear to everyone before debate on this bill began, if the \nsupporters of McCain-Feingold were denied an up-or-down vote on the \nbill or on amendments to the bill, we would exercise our rights as \nMembers of the Senate to offer amendments related to reform on \nlegislation subsequently considered by the Senate. Now we are \nconfronting a parliamentary tactic that is intended to deny us the \nopportunity to offer amendments to the highway funding bill. I don't \nthink that it is fair, even if it is sanctioned by Senate rules. Nor do \nI think the tactic will permanently preclude us from offering reform \namendments to other legislation.\n  Mr. President, no Member of this body can be permanently \ndisenfranchised from the right to offer amendments. It is a practical \nimpossibility. Unanimous consent is required for nearly all the work of \nthe Senate, and Members who are denied their right to amend legislation \nare not likely to consent to moving that legislation forward. Every \nSenator knows that their colleagues who intend to offer campaign \nfinance reform amendments will eventually succeed in doing so. At some \npoint, the support or opposition of Senators will be a matter of public \nrecord. Therefore, I am at a loss to understand what purpose is served \nby attempting to temporarily prevent us from offering these amendments.\n  We cannot be disenfranchised permanently, Mr. President, because to \ndo so would disenfranchise the American people. The people have a right \nto know where their elected representatives stand on the issue of \ncampaign finance reform so that they may render an informed judgment at \nelection time\n\n[[Page S10733]]\n\nabout how fairly we represent their concerns.\n  The supporters of reform intend to offer amendments related to \nvarious aspects of reform, and as I have stated previously, I intend to \noffer an amendment banning soft money, the unregulated ocean of money \nwhich is drowning the integrity of our political system and which \noccasioned so much scandal in the last election. I am looking forward \nto the great debate on the first amendment that supporters of soft \nmoney will offer in opposition to the ban.\n\n  I know that the Senator from Kentucky will enthusiastically engage in \nthat debate, and I again commend him for having the courage of his \nconvictions, for his clear willingness to have his opposition to reform \nrecorded unambiguously for the people to judge. Will the other Senators \njoin him? I don't know. I don't think support for unlimited soft money \nis quite so clear as his opposition to other reform proposals. I think \nwe would win a vote banning soft money. I am not certain, but I am \nfairly confident, and I intend to find out.\n  We will keep trying until the Senate agrees to provide the people we \nserve with an honest, clear record of our support or opposition to \ncampaign finance reform. They will then make a judgment as to whether \nthey approve of our position or not.\n  Finally, again, Mr. President, I am hopeful that at some point, there \nwill be sufficient requests by the American people, including a million \nsignatories, 1 million Americans signing a petition asking us to \naddress this issue of campaign finance reform. I hope that sooner or \nlater that and the better angels of our nature will persuade us that it \nis time to sit down and work out a campaign finance reform which is \nfair to everyone and gives and restores the American people control of \ntheir Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BOND. Without objecting, may I say, we are trying to arrange for \nthe expeditious consideration of the VA-HUD report.\n  Mr. KERRY. I just ask for 3 minutes or so. I want to respond to \nSenator McCain.\n  Mr. BOND. I have no objection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10732-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE SENATE WILL ULTIMATELY BE HEARD\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nArizona for his comments, for his steadfast efforts and leadership on \nthis and, speaking for Senator Daschle who is not here at this moment \nand for the leadership on this side, we would like to make it very \nclear that what Senator McCain has said we are determined to try to \nhelp effect. We are determined that we will bring back campaign finance \nreform again and again and again until we have the ability to vote up \nor down on either McCain-Feingold or on some measure of full reform. I \nthink Senator McCain has appropriately suggested that ultimately the \nwill of the Senate can't be held down on a matter like this. Senators \nwill have to vote one way or the other in order to make their positions \nclear, and the will of the Senate ultimately will be heard.\n  We, on our side, are particularly grateful to Senator Feingold for \nhis leadership, but, Mr. President, we regret enormously that the \nAmerican people were not permitted to have one amendment properly voted \non and debated. Not one. Not once in this important issue, where 88 \npercent of the American people believe we ought to have reform, was the \nU.S. Senate, known as the world's greatest deliberative body, able to \ntruly deliberate. Some would argue deliberation comes in many forms and \na filibuster is a form of that deliberation. But everyone knows that a \nmajority of this Senate was prepared to vote for this bill as it is \ntoday. This bill will come back again and again until the Senate has a \nchance to work its will.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the bill (H.R. 2158) making appropriations for the \nDepartments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and \nfor sundry independent agencies, commissions, corporations, and offices \nfor the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, and for other purposes, \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2158) having met, after full and free conference, have agreed \n     to recommend and do recommend to their respective Houses this \n     report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 6, 1997.)\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to present the Senate with the \nconference report accompanying H.R. 2158. The bill provides a total of \n$90.7 billion in new budget authority, including $21.5 billion in \nmandatory spending, which is $855 million less than the President's \nrequest.\n  As with most legislative activity in this body, the bill is not \nperfect, but I do think it reflects a very balanced approach to a \nnumber of particularly difficult funding and policy decisions. In \nachieving that balance, I owe a special debt of gratitude and express \nmy sincerest thanks to my hard-working ranking member, Senator \nMikulski, whose cooperation, guidance, and wise counsel has helped to \ncraft a consensus in reaching many of these difficult decisions.\n  We have done our best to ensure that both the spirit of the budget \nagreement and the highest priorities of the President have been met \nwithout jeopardizing key programs, such as veterans' medical care and \nthe space program which were not protected in the budget agreement.\n  For the VA, the highest priority in the VA-HUD conference report is \nafforded to veterans' programs which total $40.45 billion and veterans' \nmedical care in particular. The conference report provides \n$17,060,000,000 for VA medical care, which is $100 million more than \nthe President's request and more than $300 million above the amount \nassumed for veterans' medical spending in the budget agreement. This \nlevel should ensure continued care to all eligible veterans and \ncontinued improvements to the VA medical system. Increases also are \nprovided for the State Nursing Home Program construction and research.\n  For the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the conference \nreport provides close to $25 billion for fiscal year 1998, including \nfull funding of $8.2 million for section 8 contract renewals as \nprovided through the budget resolution.\n  Other key programs include $310 million for drug elimination grants; \n$1.5 million for HOME; $4.7 billion for community development block \ngrants; $600 million for the Native American Block Grant Program; $823 \nmillion for homeless assistance programs; $35 million for Youth Build; \n$25 million for Brownfields; and $138 million for the economic \ndevelopment initiative.\n  Unfortunately, we were unable to fund the preservation program due to \nthe high cost of the program, reported\n\n[[Page S10734]]\n\nfraud and abuse, and HUD's lack of capacity to administer the program. \nTo continue the program would cost some $2 billion over the next \nseveral years. Therefore, we have included instead $10 million to \nreimburse costs expended by project owners and nonprofit and tenant \npurchasers under the program.\n  This bill also authorized enhanced--or ``sticky''--vouchers which \nwill protect tenants from being forced to move if an owner chooses to \nprepay a mortgage and higher rents are charged.\n  Mr. President, I also point out that we have worked with the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development and colleagues in the \nauthorizing committee to craft an ongoing solution to the high-cost \nrental program under multifamily projects in a program known as mark-\nto-market.\n  We believe that the Senate's position, which finally has been \naccepted by the House, to deal with these programs to provide a \ncontinuation of housing services to those residents in particularly \nelderly and other projects funded under a multifamily basis, is the \nbest approach to dealing with what otherwise would be a budgetary \nnightmare and potentially totally disruptive to the residents.\n  For EPA, the conference report provides $7.4 billion for fiscal year \n1998, an increase of over $400 million over fiscal year 1997; and an \nadditional $650 million for fiscal year 1999 for the Superfund program. \nThe appropriation includes $3.3 billion for the operating programs, an \nincrease of $200 million or 6 percent over fiscal year 1997.\n  State revolving funds would receive a total of $2.075 billion, \nincluding $1.35 billion for clean water and $725 million for drinking \nwater. The President's proposed reduction of $275 million from the \nclean water State revolving fund was fully restored.\n  For Superfund, the conference report includes $2.1 billion, an \nincrease of $750 million over the current level. This funding includes \nan advance appropriation of $650 million to be made available on \nOctober 1, 1998, so long as a Superfund reform bill is enacted by May \n15, 1998. This reflects the budget agreement which assumed this \nadditional funding only upon a comprehensive reform of the Superfund \nprogram.\n  In addition, given the priority the administration places on funding \nfor Boston Harbor, the conference report provides $50 million, which is \n$27 million more than proposed by the House.\n  For NASA, the conference agreement recommends $13.6 billion, the same \namount as proposed by the House and an increase of $148 million over \nthe Senate level and the administration's budget request. This amount \nwill help NASA deal with the recent problems with the space station \nprogram without jeopardizing critical programs, such as space science, \nearth science, and aeronautics.\n  For the National Science Foundation, appropriations would total \nalmost $3.5 billion, a $60 million increase above the budget request. \nThis funding includes an additional $40 million for plant genome \nresearch. Mr. President, this new comprehensive initiative is critical \nto the future of U.S. crop production, the ability of our strong \nagriculture sector to provide the food and fiber needed in this country \nand the world.\n  For the Federal Emergency Management Agency, this agreement \nrecommends $830 million, including $320 million for disaster relief and \n$30 million for a new predisaster mitigation grant program intended to \nimprove the Nation's ability to reduce the costs and impacts of natural \ndisasters, particularly in communities with significant disaster risks.\n  For the National and Community Service Program, funding is $425.5 \nmillion, an increase of $25 million over the current year. Despite \ncontinued concerns many of us have with this program, we have \nacknowledged the priority the President has placed on the program. And, \nin addition, the $25 million is targeted directly to the critical issue \nof child literacy.\n  Community development financial institutions are provided $80 \nmillion. While this funding is $45 million less than the President's \nrequest of $125 million, the conference report funding represents a \ncompromise which reflects significant concerns raised in the last \nseveral months over the lack of administrative capacity and \naccountability at CDFI, including concerns relating to the contracting \nof services. We expect that the Treasury Department will continue to \nput in systems, procedures and policies that will ensure that the CDFI \nprogram will be administered appropriately in the future.\n\n  As I said before, on the section 8 mark-to-market reforms, title V of \nthe bill provides, beginning in fiscal year 1999, a comprehensive \nreform program that provides a mortgage and rent restructuring program \nto reduce the costs of oversubsidized section 8 multifamily housing \nproperties insured under the FHA. Under this mark-to-market program, \nFHA-insured properties with above-market rents are eligible for debt \nrestructuring to reduce the rent levels to market-rate rents or the \nproject base rents needed to support operations and maintenance.\n  In response to concerns about HUD's capacity, the legislation shifts \nthe management, administration, and restructuring of the portfolio to \ncapable local entities with a public purpose. In most cases, State and \nlocal housing finance agencies will be responsible for the \nrestructuring of projects and consultation with project owners, the \ntenants and the affected community.\n  In addition, the legislation requires the continuation of project-\nbased assistance for projects that serve elderly and disabled families, \nthus ensuring the availability and affordability of low-income housing \nfor the elderly and disabled.\n  I note that a number of provisions, some of which I do not support, \nwere added in conference to ensure the passage of the bill in both the \nHouse and the Senate and to promote signing by the President.\n  In addition, we reached a number of accommodations with the White \nHouse with the cooperation and assistance of Senator Mikulski, \nCongressman Stokes, Congressman Obey, and other members of the \nconference. We are grateful for their assistance.\n  I yield to Senator Mikulski for her opening statement.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Inhofe]. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise today to join my very distinguished colleague, the Senator \nfrom Missouri, to offer for the Senate's consideration the conference \nagreement on the VA-HUD bill.\n  This bill contains $99 billion--$99 billion--in outlay spending, of \nwhich almost $20 billion is in mandatory spending. This isn't just \nabout numbers though. And it will not be about statistics; this is \nabout people.\n  The VA-HUD bill is probably one of the most complex that comes before \nthe Senate. In terms of dollar amounts, it ranks up there with defense, \nand it ranks up there with the Labor, Health and Human Services budget. \nWhat it does in terms of dollar amounts, though, is it really is \nfocused on two policy objectives. No. 1, how do we respond to the day-\nto-day needs of our constituents, those veterans who need health care \nor access to a mortgage, or constituents who need housing, whether it \nis housing for the elderly, or housing for neighborhoods trying to \nrebuild themselves, or in response to the need for emergency \nassistance?\n  At the same time, this subcommittee gets America ready for its \nfuture. It is significant in public investments in science and \ntechnology. That is where we have tried to make wise and prudent \nchoices, on how we respond to the day-to-day needs of the American \npeople and at the same time help our country get ready for the future. \nI believe that, working on a bipartisan basis, we have been able to do \nthis.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Bond, for the collegial manner in which \nhe and his staff have worked with my staff and myself to craft a \nbipartisan bill that represents the best interests of the American \npeople.\n  I am very pleased to say that when it has come to meeting the health \nneeds of our veterans, whether it has been making sure that the housing \nneeds are met, and at the same time whether it is our space program or \nour investments in information technology, we have not played politics.\n  Isn't this what the American people want us to do? For the people who \nrisked their lives at Iwo Jima, Pork Chop Hill, Desert Storm, the \nMekong delta, they want us to get out there and get up every day and \nsee how we\n\n[[Page S10735]]\n\ncan be responsible in meeting their needs and not play politics with \ntheir needs. Well, we looked at people who need public housing or \nsubsidized housing, how we can ensure that housing is not a way of life \nbut a way to a better life. Isn't that what the American people want us \nto do?\n  When they look to not only the Stars and Stripes, but they look out \nthere to the stars of the universe, they want the United States of \nAmerica to lead the way. They do not want us to play politics with our \nspace program. And we have not done that.\n  At the same time, they know a new century is coming, a new economy is \non its way. We need groups like the National Science Foundation, in its \ninvestments in information technology and other basic scientific \nresearch, to do that basic research which the Federal laboratories and \nour universities are best at, so that we can then turn to the private \nsector to value add where public investments in publicly funded \nresearch will lead to the private-sector jobs. And they do not want us \nto play politics with that. And guess what? We did not.\n  So, Mr. President, as we come before you with this VA-HUD bill, I \nthink that is what we have done. We have moved this legislation \nforward. I think the numbers speak for themselves.\n  We have provided $300 million more for VA medical care than the \nbudget agreement because we said, ``Promises made should be promises \nkept to our veterans.''\n  We wanted to be sure that the VA medical research could continue to \nbe funded in a way that meets the important practical clinical research \nthat is important. I am so pleased that we are going to be doing \nresearch on gulf war syndrome. I am particularly pleased that we have \nthe set-aside for both Parkinson's disease and prostate cancer. With \nquality VA medical care and research, we are providing real help for \nreal people.\n  When we look at our housing and urban development, we once again make \nsure that we adequately fund the very successful program that funds \nhousing for the elderly in our local communities.\n  This committee was concerned, though, about two things. First, we \nwere concerned that the way section 8 was being funded could \ninadvertently result in yet one more unfunded liability to taxpayers \nand a hollow opportunity for the poor. The Senator from Missouri, \nSenator Bond, has been an architect of reform in this area. I have \nnoted with great pleasure the way he worked with the administration in \nterms of fashioning a compromise where we meet our fiscal and social \nresponsibility simultaneously.\n  We also fund something called HOPE VI which says that public housing \nshould not be a way of life but a way to a better life. We have come up \nwith not only a new physical infrastructure, but a new social \ninfrastructure that says, if you get a subsidy, you have to get \nyourself, your family, and your community ready for the future because \nit mandates that you must be in job training and it mandates also that \nyou must be engaged in community service in your own area.\n  This way we build the capacity of the individual, we build the \ncommunity in which that individual lives, and we get value not only for \nthe taxpayer, but the lives of residents will be transformed forever.\n  Again, this committee provided real help for real people. This year, \nwhen we looked at the environment, the President's request had many \nitems we worked on, from Superfund to Brownfields, clean air to clean \nwater. What we have been able to do is not only work on these issues, \nbut also lay the groundwork for the research that needs to be done to \nbe sure that we have sufficient science for a regulatory framework.\n\n  I am very grateful for the response of the Senator from Missouri when \nI came to him when Maryland was hit by a terrible tragedy in which we \nhad a fish kill over on our Eastern Shore. We had thousands of fish \ndie. Our great medical community was concerned that it was having a \ndire effect on the physical and public health of our community.\n  Before we responded inappropriately, we felt that we needed to have \nour Federal laboratories engaged so that they could support not only \nMaryland, but other affected States like Virginia and North Carolina, \nso we could come up with wise solutions to protect public health and \nalso maintain the community.\n  I want to thank Senator Bond for responding to my request for $3 \nmillion that will fund EPA to find a solution to a problem called the \npfiesteria, an ``X Files''-like organism that goes from a vegetable to \nan animal and then attacks fish in a vicious way. What we are able to \ndo now is to provide the best science to come up with the best \nsolutions to be able to protect lives, protect the Chesapeake Bay, and \nprotect our economy. I want to thank the Senator for responding to that \nbecause it was a last-minute, but certainly a much needed request.\n\n  In NASA, we also talked about how we maintain our core programs--\nsafety for the shuttle, we will fly high in the space station, and we \nwill once again have adequate funding for Mission to Planet Earth. \nWhile we study the great universe, we also need to look back on the one \nplanet where we do believe there is intelligent life, and that is our \nown dear planet Earth. Thanks to this we will be able to study our \nplanet as if it were a distant planet and come up with new ways of \ndoing business, where we can predict earthquakes, where we can predict \nfloods, where we can predict famine, and using the tools of science, we \ncan help countries all over this planet be able to protect themselves \nfrom either the dire effects of nature or the dire effects that we \nbring upon ourselves.\n  I am also particularly pleased that, once again, the chairman \nresponded to a request from both the administration and from this side \nof the aisle to maintain the National Service Program. This is a \nprogram where we ask young people to volunteer in their communities, \nand while they are doing that, receive a voucher to reduce their \nstudent debts, and at the same time give back to their community.\n  There are many aspects of this bill which we could elaborate on, but \nthe one that we probably have to respond to most immediately is the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA is the 9-1-1 agency for the \nAmerican people. Unfortunately, just about every Senator's State had a \ncall on FEMA. We were able to respond to that, and once again, we \nworked on a bipartisan basis. What we are also going to do now is to \npractice the three R's of emergency management: readiness and \npreparedness, response when a disaster hits, and restoration. Only this \ntime when we restore, we are not going to only restore, we will take \nsteps to help communities reduce the impact from future natural \ndisasters like hurricanes and floods.\n  Mr. President, we could talk about the legislation, but what I am \nhere to say today is that what we have done in this subcommittee is \nthat we have responded to the needs of the American people, we have \ngotten ourselves ready for the future, we have been fiscally \nresponsible, and we have done it on a bipartisan basis. At the end of \nthe day, I don't think we can do better than that. I will be able to go \nback to my constituents in Maryland and say, ``We think we have done a \ngood job for you. We think we have done a good job for America.''\n  I thank Senator Bond and his staff for the way they worked with us, \nparticularly John Kamarck, Carrie Apostolou, and a wonderful detailee, \nSarah Horrigan. I also want to thank my staff, Andy Givens, David \nBowers, and also another detailee, a science whiz kid like Sarah, Stacy \nClosson, who came to us to learn about how the Senate works, while we \nhave a better insight into how science works.\n  Mr. President, I think that concludes my remarks. I yield the floor \nand I will look forward to the passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my remarks are directed at the two \ndistinguished managers of the bill, and I hope they will be able to \nrespond to the concerns I am about to raise.\n  On July 22, while this bill was being debated on the floor of the \nSenate, I shared with the Members of the Senate a series of scandals \nacross Indian country with respect to a housing program for low-income \nIndian reservation residents. The scandal occurred in my own State in \nWashington in the construction of a 5,000 square foot, $400,000 home \nunder this low-income program for the chairman of the housing council\n\n[[Page S10736]]\n\nof the particular tribe, and similar activities in other reservations \nacross the country in which money had been misused not for the benefit \nof low-income Indians on reservations but for the benefit of the people \nwho were managing the money themselves, most of whom were above average \nin income.\n\n  As a result of that set of facts, themselves a result of a long \ninvestigation on the part of the Seattle Times, the Senate unanimously \npassed an amendment that says ``The Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment shall bar any person from participating in any activity \nunder the native American housing block grants program under title I of \nthe Native American Housing Self-Determination Act of 1996 or any \nactivity under the jurisdiction of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment where such person has substantially, significantly, or \nmaterially violated the requirements of any such activity. The \nSecretary shall pursue reimbursement for any losses or costs associated \nwith these violations.''\n  Now, Mr. President, the two managers were delighted to accept that \namendment. The Senator from Missouri told me a week or so ago that the \nHouse was greatly resistant to these provisions and that he greatly \nfeared he would have to drop them. In fact, he has done so, Mr. \nPresident. I simply would like to get his explanation as to why Members \nof the House of Representatives seem to feel that someone can \n``substantially, significantly, and materially violate the requirements \nof the law'' and suffer no consequences for doing so?\n  This seems to me to be a ratification of this widespread fraud. At \nleast two people working for the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment were transferred, another has been forced into early \nretirement as a result. But why is it that a simple prohibition against \nwhat amounts to total fraud--effectively stealing not just the money of \nthe people of the United States, but of poor members of these tribes, \nnow is suddenly dropped from the bill?\n  What sanction contained in this amendment was regarded as so \nobnoxious by Members of the House of Representatives, I ask my \ndistinguished friend and chairman, that they refused to include it in \nthe final bill?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, to respond to my good friend, I first \ncommend him for calling attention to some of the abuses that occurred. \nWhen we accepted on the floor his proposal, it was in light of the \nabuses and the problems that were uncovered. As I have advised my \ncolleague from Washington, the House had grave concerns about the \nbreadth of this issue, fearing that it might bar not only people \nactively engaged in fraud but people with other problems in their \nbackground or in other time periods or in other areas. I cannot do a \ngood job of explaining their objection because it was not my objection. \nWe were unable to include it because we did not have adequate support \nfrom our side to overcome the resistance of their side.\n  I point out to my colleague from Washington that HUD currently has \nauthority under this program to address fraud and abuse in this program \nand they have assured us that they will.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I assure my friend from Washington, \nI am from Missouri, and assurances--frothy substances do not satisfy \nme; I am from Missouri, and you must show me.\n  I expect that the new Native American Housing Block Grant Program \nwhich is under consideration in the Banking Committee will include \nprogram administrative and oversight requirements. At this point we \nmust defer to the Banking Committee which is currently looking at \nnative American housing block grant reforms as part of a HUD extender \nbill which would extend the authorization of a number of the programs \nsuch as FAA and multifamily risk programs. We expect this bill will be \nconsidered by the House and the Senate before the end of the session.\n  I hope there would be an opportunity once again, for the Senator from \nWashington to address the very real concerns he noted.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I appreciate those expressions on the part \nof my friend from Missouri and I emphasize that I know he supported \nthis provision and that he did his best to keep it included in the \nbill.\n  I hope that at some future time in authorizing legislation or \notherwise we will be able to do something similar to this. I, too, have \nheard the assurances of the Department of Housing and Urban Development \nthat this will not happen again, but we have gotten those assurances in \nthe past without them having been carried out.\n  I summarize by saying how anyone could say that a person who ``has \nsubstantially, significantly, or materially violated the requirements'' \nof this law should somehow or another not even receive so much as a tap \non the wrist and should be allowed to go on doing in the future what \nthat person has done in the past, is beyond my understanding. I am \nsorry this is not in the bill. I don't think the excuses of its \nopponents and the House conferees are adequate in the slightest, but I \ndo know that the chairman and the ranking minority member sympathize \nwith me on this and will support us as we continue on a crusade for \nhonesty and straightforward dealing and using this money for the \npurposes for which it was intended. I know they will support that in \nthe future.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for his \ncomments.\n\n\n                  MULTIFAMILY ASSISTED HOUSING REFORM\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support for \nthe inclusion of the Senate's ``Mark to Market'' reform legislation in \nthe Fiscal Year 1998 VA-HUD Appropriations Conference Report. The \nconference report effectively incorporates The Multifamily Assisted \nHousing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 (S. 513), as passed by the \nBanking Committee and full Senate with minor modification.\n  This legislation averts a serious affordable housing crisis by \nrestructuring the Department of Housing and Urban Development's [HUD] \nFederal Housing Administration [FHA] insured section 8 project-based \nassisted portfolio. This legislation will save taxpayer money by \nreducing above-market rents on section 8 properties, will protect \nresidents, and will help maintain a stock of affordable housing which \nwill remain available for the future. The financial viability of \nassisted projects will be protected by refinancing and restructuring \nmortgages which are insured by the FHA.\n  I salute my friend and colleague Senator Connie Mack, Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Housing Opportunity and Community Development, for his \noutstanding efforts in crafting this legislation and ensuring its swift \nenactment. Through his extraordinary leadership this legislation has \nbeen developed in a bipartisan, measured and thoughtful manner. I thank \nmy friend Senator Kit Bond for the critical role he played in the \ndevelopment of this bill as a member of the Banking Committee in the \nlast Congress and for his leadership as chairman of the VA-HUD \nAppropriations Subcommittee in bringing this measure to final passage.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is supported by a broad range of \ninterest groups including resident organizations, owners, nonprofit \nhousing associations, the National Governors Association, the National \nAffordable Housing Management Association, the National Housing \nConference, the National Association of Home Builders, and the National \nCouncil of State Housing Finance Agencies. The New York Housing \nConference and the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition have \nbeen instrumental in the development of this bill and I thank them for \ntheir valuable input and support.\n  This legislation addresses the escalating costs of the HUD section 8 \nprogram and achieves fiscal year 1998 savings of $562 million. \nImportantly, this legislation will save the American taxpayer $4.6 \nbillion over the next 10 years by reducing exorbitant rents in the \nsection 8 program. At the same time, the legislation will protect the \nFHA multifamily insurance fund from losses due to defaults. The \nmortgage restructuring provisions contained in this bill will allow \nprojects to continue to operate effectively with reduced rent levels.\n  Mr. President, millions of needy Americans depend on section 8 \nhousing to provide them with affordable shelter. The average income of \nthese families, elderly and disabled persons is similar to those in \nFederal public housing--approximately 17 percent of the\n\n[[Page S10737]]\n\nlocal area median income. In addition, over 35 percent of these persons \nare elderly. Many more are disabled or families with children. It is \nessential that we protect these residents.\n  Mr. President, the legislation protects residents from displacement \nand provides them with a meaningful voice in the restructuring process. \nResident involvement is essential to prevent physical deterioration of \nbuildings, identify criminal activity and threats to health and safety, \nand contribute to the long-term viability of the affected buildings and \ncommunities. The legislation provides for a strong role on the part of \nresidents to participate in activities such as the determination of \neligibility for restructuring, decisions to renew project-based \ncontracts, the formation of the rental assistance assessment plan, \ncapital needs and management assessments, and physical inspections.\n  In addition, resident involvement in the decisions which affect their \ncommunities and lives will be further ensured by the selection of \nresident-friendly participating administrative entities [PAE]. The \nlegislation mandates that any organization selected as a PAE must have \na demonstrated track record of working directly with residents of low-\nincome housing projects and with community-based organizations. It is \nimperative that these PAE's provide for resident input that is \nmeaningful. This will be achieved by the PAE providing residents \ntimely, adequate and effective written notice of proposed decisions, \ntimely access to relevant information and an adequate time period for \nanalysis and provision of comments to the PAE and HUD. The PAE and HUD \nwill take into account resident comments in a thoughtful and \nconstructive manner.\n  Mr. President, the bill seeks to preserve affordable housing \nthroughout our nation for the benefit of current and future residents. \nCriteria have been developed to assess whether a project should \nmaintain project-based assistance or be converted, in whole or in part, \nto tenant-based assistance. Projects in disrepair will be \nrehabilitated, where feasible, and their proper maintenance will be \nensured. The legislation contains important new enforcement tools for \nHUD to employ to crack down on fraud, waste and abuse by unscrupulous \nlandlords. Landlords who break the rules will be banned from the \nprogram. New protections against equity skimming, as well as expanded \ncivil money penalties will greatly assist efforts to eliminate owners \nwho have cheated the Federal Government. In addition, the legislation \nrefocuses HUD's efforts on oversight and enforcement. By devolving the \nprimary responsibility for conducting mortgage restructurings to the \nState and local level, HUD staff will be able to concentrate on rooting \nout abuses within the system.\n  Rents on restructured properties will be set at local market rates \nbased on comparable properties, or where comparables are unavailable, \nat 90 percent of HUD's Fair Market Rent [FMR]. The legislation provides \nthat up to 20 percent of a given PAE's inventory may receive budget-\nbased rents, capped at 120 percent of FMR, in order to maintain the \nfinancial viability of the projects.\n  The HUD Secretary may waive the 20 percent limitation upon a \ndemonstration of special need. Report language accompanying The \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 (S. 947), which passed the Senate on June \n25, 1997, states:\n\n       The Committee expects that the Secretary shall utilize this \n     important discretionary tool to address the unique \n     circumstances of various communities and regions throughout \n     the nation. The Secretary should consider relevant local or \n     regional conditions to determine whether good cause exists in \n     granting such a waiver. Such factors should include, but \n     should not be limited to: (1) whether the jurisdiction is \n     classified as a ``high cost area'' under other federal \n     statutes or programs; (2) prevailing costs of constructing or \n     developing housing; (3) local regulatory barriers which may \n     have contributed to increased development costs; (4) State or \n     local rent control or rent stabilization laws; (5) the costs \n     of providing necessary security or services; high energy \n     costs; the relative age of housing in a jurisdiction; or (6) \n     other factors which may have contributed to high development \n     or operational costs of affordable housing in a given \n     jurisdiction.''\n\n  By providing a priority to State and local housing finance agencies \n[HFA] to serve as PAE's, we recognize and build upon the increasing \nfinancial and housing management expertise of these public entities. \nHFA's are accountable to State and local governments and the public and \nare dedicated to increasing the availability of affordable housing. In \naddition, they have extensive experience with the section 8 portfolio \nitself and will be able to leverage additional resources for its \nbenefit.\n  Mr. President, this legislation protects the interests of the Federal \ntaxpayer, the security of our residents and the future of affordable \nhousing. It is with great pride that I commend my colleagues in the \nSenate for working together to avoid the social and fiscal crisis which \nwould have occurred had HUD's multifamily inventory not been reformed. \nThis legislation was carefully crafted with the spirit of \nbipartisanship for over 2 years. I salute all who contributed to this \nimportant and essential effort and support immediate passage.\n\n\n                         MARK TO MARKET REFORMS\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe distinguished chairman of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, \nSenator Kit Bond, for the purposes of clarifying the intent of the VA-\nHUD Conferees in regard to several aspects of the section 8 reforms \nincluded in the conference report.\n  First, I would like to clarify the intent of the conferees regarding \ndetermination of market rent levels. In my home State of New York, \nthere are some 1.2 million apartments which are covered by State rent \ncontrol and rent stabilization laws. It is particularly important that \nthe participating administrative entities [PAE] which conduct mortgage \nrestructurings in New York have the flexibility to consider the rents \nof these apartments, particularly those subject to rent stabilization \nor rent control regulation, in making determinations of market rents.\n  Mr. President, I note with regret that the Fair Market Rent [FMR] \nSystem currently used by HUD has numerous flaws, especially when \napplied to a metropolitan area as large and diverse as New York City \nand its surrounding suburbs. For instance, HUD utilizes a single Fair \nMarket Rent estimate for the entire municipality which fails to take \ninto account the various differences in true market rents between such \ndisparate markets as Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Rockland County. \nThese markets are vastly different, but HUD's FMR system does not \nreflect these variations.\n  This legislation, which originated in the Banking Committee, takes \ninto account the shortcomings and limitations of the FMR System. \nInstead of relying on this flawed system, the bill adopts an approach \nwhich would allow participating administrative entities to estimate \ntrue market rents based on comparable properties. While it is true that \nrent levels which are subject to State and local rent regulation may \nnot fully reflect true market rents, nevertheless they can often form \nthe basis for estimating such true market rents. Indeed, many rent \nstabilized apartments in New York City are far closer to true market \nrent levels than HUD's FMR estimates.\n  Mr. President, I thank the conferees for including legislative \namendments to the original Senate bill, S. 513, in the final \nlegislation which will allow participating administrative entities to \nconsider rent stabilized units for the purposes of estimating local \nmarket rents. I would ask my friend, Senator Bond, if my statements are \nconsistent with the intent of the conferees?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my friend Senator D'Amato, the chairman of \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, is entirely \ncorrect. His statements are consistent with the intent of the conferees \nto devolve decisionmaking responsibility to the State and local level. \nClearly, the conferees recognize that participating administrative \nentities in some jurisdictions may find it necessary to take into \naccount rents on units which are subject to local rent stabilization \nregulations in order to determine comparable market rent levels.\n  The conferees are mindful of the unique circumstances of New York \nrental markets. For that reason, the legislation was crafted to allow \nthe consideration of rent stabilized apartments within the definition \nof comparable properties for the purposes of determining market rent \nlevels.\n\n[[Page S10738]]\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nclarifying remarks. I would ask for one additional point of \nclarification.\n  Mr. President, the section 8 reform provisions include a mandatory \nrenewal of project-based assistance for restructured properties which \nhave a significant number of elderly or disabled persons, or which are \nlocated in tight rental markets, such as New York City. In addition, \nthere is a local option to replace project-based assistance contracts \nwith section 8 vouchers, after completion of a rental assistance \nassessment plan by the PAE with meaningful consultation with the owner \nof the affected project.\n  This plan, as with all aspects of the overall mortgage restructuring \nand rental assistance sufficiency plan, shall also be developed with an \nopportunity for meaningful input by the affected residents as well. It \nis imperative that residents be kept informed of the process for \nmortgage restructuring and the possibility of receiving tenant-based \nassistance, and be offered ample opportunity to voice their preferences \nas to the type of assistance provided. It would not be outside the \nauthority of the PAE to conduct a survey, on a project-by-project \nbasis, as to resident preferences in this regard.\n  Mr. President, I would like to emphasize the role of State and local \ndecisionmaking in making this determination. It is not the intent of \nthe drafters of the legislation that HUD attempt to micromanage or \nsecond-guess the determination of the PAE. Neither is it their intent \nthat the HUD implementing regulations include one-sided interpretations \nof the statutory language which will force a preference for tenant-\nbased assistance upon the local decisionmakers. The criteria are \nintentionally objective and neutral and the final decision for applying \nthem rests at the local level.\n  In addition, in interpreting these criteria, the participating \nadministrative entities should, to the fullest extent possible, \nconsider the local experience of the various forms of housing \nassistance. For instance, the PAE should consider the actual \neffectiveness of tenant-based assistance. In many cases, voucher-\nholders are unable to utilize their vouchers. In many areas too, \nvoucher-holders often find their choices constrained to certain areas, \nneighborhoods and projects. The lease-up rates and need to utilize \nsection 8 reserves in order to improve these rates by the local public \nhousing authorities would be relevant in determining the local \neffectiveness of the voucher program.\n  Also, in determining the relative affordability of vouchers, the PAE \nshould consider whether a resident's rental contribution could rise \nabove 30 percent of his or her income. Recent data from HUD indicate \nthat a large percentage of voucher-holders pay more than 30 percent of \ntheir incomes for rent, and many pay more than half of their incomes in \nrent. This data is extremely disturbing. The rent burden of voucher-\nholders is especially relevant in making these determinations. The PAE \ncould consider the impact of reductions in the FMR to the 40th \npercentile of available units on tenant-choice and rent burden as well.\n  Whenever possible, the PAE should use local experience in making this \ndetermination rather than relying on national averages, which often are \nrendered meaningless when applied locally. PAE's should asses the need \nfor a stock of affordable housing which will be available on a long-\nterm basis, when judged in light of the housing needs identified in the \nlocal consolidated plan. PAE's should consider the amount of \nmultifamily housing currently being developed in that area which is \naffordable to low-income families.\n  Mr. President, it is imperative that PAE's consider the \ncharacteristics of specific projects. For instance, a particular \nproject could contain a number of apartments with three or more \nbedrooms in a geographic area where there is a dearth of such \naffordable housing available to large families. In all cases, PAE's \nshould consider the long-term consequences of their decisions. I would \nask my friend, Senator Kit Bond, whether my statements are fully \nconsistent with the intent of the conferees?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the statements of the chairman of the \nCommittee of Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs are indeed consistent \nwith the intent of the conferees. Indeed, devolving responsibility and \ndecisionmaking to the State and local level is one of the primary goals \nof this mark to market legislation. Not surprisingly, that is also the \nreason for the priority in selecting State and local housing finance \nagencies to be PAE's.\n  The decisions made by these entities will have long-term \nconsequences. The PAE's therefore should be granted great deference in \nassessing the impact of these decisions on local housing markets. Also, \nI would reiterate the Senator's statement on the importance of resident \nand owner involvement in the decisionmaking process. We believe the \nlocal PAE's will be in a better position to make these determinations \nthan Federal officials at HUD or the Office of Management and Budget.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I once again thank my colleague for his \nclarifying remarks and I offer my congratulations to him on the passage \nof legislation which is fair, balanced and very effectively serves the \nneeds of the American people.\n\n\n            DISQUALIFIED PROPERTIES UNDER ``MARK-TO-MARKET''\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased that the mark-to-market \nlegislation that is incorporated in the VA-HUD conference report \ncontains some measures that deal with properties that are disqualified \nfrom the restructuring program. I believe that it is critical that \nflexibility is provided to the participating administrative entity \n[PAE] and HUD in dealing with disqualified properties. I am, however, \nconcerned about those properties that are not part of the mark-to-\nmarket program but are disqualified from the renewal process.\n  Mr. MACK. I agree with Senator Sarbanes that this flexibility is \nextremely important in dealing with disqualified properties and that \nwith input from local governments, communities, and residents, \nhopefully some creativity can be used. I strongly believe that it is \nimportant that the Federal Government terminate its relationship with \nthose owners who have abused the program and those properties where it \nis simply infeasible to continue to subsidize. However, we should not \ntake a ``one-size-fits-all'' approach and ensure that the interests of \nresidents, communities, and local governments are carefully considered.\n  I am also concerned about those properties, not eligible for mark-to-\nmarket, whose contracts are not renewed due to noncompliance actions by \nowners or the poor physical condition of the property. I have some \nreservations about HUD's policy to simply voucher out those properties \ninstead of exploring other creative options such as transfers or sales \nto resident-supported nonprofit entities.\n  Mr. BOND. In addressing the Senators' concerns, it is my expectation \nthat the Secretary of HUD will use the same procedures outlined in the \nmark-to-market legislation for those properties affected by the \nnonrenewal policy. The Secretary should not only explore the use sales \nor transfers to nonprofit organizations, but also allow these \nproperties to retain project-based assistance if the ownership or \nphysical condition problems are adequately addressed. I agree with \nSenator Mack that under no circumstances should we continue to \nsubsidize bad landlords or bad properties, but that we need to be \ncareful about how we handle these situations.\n\n\n             CONFLICTS OF INTEREST UNDER ``MARK-TO-MARKET''\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, under the ``mark-to-market'' title that is \ncontained in the VA-HUD appropriations conference report, a strong \npriority to public entities is provided to act as participating \nadministrative entities [PAE]. It is expected that qualified public \nentities will handle most of the work under this program. However, in \ninstances where a qualified public entity is not available, the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] is provided \nflexibility in selecting other qualified entities such as nonprofit and \nfor-profit entities.\n  To ensure that these entities do not use their positions as PAE's for \nunfair financial benefit, the bill contains an important provision that \nwould prevent conflicts of interests by PAE's. It is my understanding \nthat this provision was included to permit the Secretary to establish \nguidelines that\n\n[[Page S10739]]\n\nwould prevent conflicts of interest by a PAE that provides financing or \ncredit enhancement as part of the restructuring process. Further, the \nprovision allows the Secretary to establish guidelines to deal with \nother conflicts of interest issues that would prevent PAE's, especially \nnonprofit and for-profit private entities, from using their roles as \nPAE's in the restructuring program that go beyond the public purposes \noutlined in the legislation.\n  I would like to ask Senator Bond if this is also his understanding of \nthe bill.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct. To handle the workload and \ncomplexity of transactions under mark-to-market, a significant amount \nof flexibility is provided to the PAE's. However, it is expected that \nthe Secretary establish strict and coherent guidelines to ensure that \nPAE's do not go beyond their restructuring duties as intended under the \nbill. To further prevent any abuses, the bill forbids private entities \nthat act as PAE's to share, participate in, or benefit from any equity \nin the restructuring program. Last, it is expected that those most \naffected by restructuring, namely residents, communities, and owners, \nare involved in the process to protect the public interests.\n\n\n                        SECTION 8 RENEWAL POLICY\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I understand that the VA-HUD appropriations \nconference report contains important renewal policy provisions related \nto expiring section 8 contracts. I would like to ask Senator Bond if my \nunderstanding is correct.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct. The bill provides renewal policies \nfor projects which undergo restructuring under the mark-to-market \nprogram and those which do not.\n  Briefly, for fiscal year 1998, the conferees have approved a 1-year \nextension of the basic rent renewal policies in section 211(b) of the \nfiscal year 1997 VA-HUD Appropriations Act and the mark-to-market \ndemonstration program to cover contracts expiring in fiscal year 1998.\n  This means that projects which undergo restructuring under the \ndemonstration program--those with rents in excess of 120 percent of the \nfair market rent [FMR]--will receive rents determined under the \nrestructuring plan. For projects that do not enter the demonstration \nprogram, contracts will be renewed at rents in effect upon expiration, \nbut not to exceed 120 percent of FMR. The 120 percent of FMR limit, \nhowever, does not apply to rents for certain exception projects \nenumerated in the bill. These projects, which include section 202 \nelderly projects and publicly financed projects, for example, will be \nrenewed at existing rent levels.\n  The legislation also establishes permanent renewal policy for fiscal \nyear 1999 and beyond when the permanent mark-to-market program is \nimplemented. Projects which are subject to the program--those with \nrents in excess of comparable market rents--will receive rents in \naccordance with the restructuring plan. For projects that do not \nundergo restructuring, the Secretary may provide section 8 assistance \nfor all units assisted by an expiring contract at rents up to \ncomparable market rent.\n  I also note to the Senator that to ensure consistency with the \npermanent mark-to-market program, we expect that the Secretary will use \nthe definition of comparable market rents in section 514(g)(1) of title \nV of the bill when establishing guidelines for the permanent renewal \npolicy.\n  Under the permanent renewal authority, there again will be certain \nexceptions. Generally, these contracts would be renewed at the lower of \nexisting rents--subject to an operating cost adjustment factor--or \nbudget-based rents--subject to a budget-based rent adjustment.\n  The approach agreed to by the conferees provides policy continuity \nfor the expected 1 year period during which the new mark-to-market \nprogram is being developed, provides an incentive for projects to \nparticipate in the mark-to-market program, and makes clear a cost \neffective permanent renewal policy which will take effect in fiscal \nyear 1999.\n\n\n                          TENANT PARTICIPATION\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to again express my gratitude to my \ncolleagues Senator Mack and Senator Bond for their unrelenting efforts \nto include the mark-to-market legislation in this bill, and \ncongratulate them on their success.\n  As originally passed by the Banking Committee and the Senate, the \nmark-to-market legislation had more detailed language imposing specific \nrequirements on PAE's with regards to tenant participation in the \ndecisions regarding the restructuring and ongoing treatment of eligible \nproperties. At the request of HUD, the conference report provides for a \nmore streamlined approach. We accommodated the administration on this \nissue because we do not want to unnecessarily bog down the \nrestructuring and rehabilitation process.\n  However, I want to make clear that the Congress fully expects that \nPAE's will establish procedures that ensure meaningful and effective \nparticipation for residents of the restructured projects and other \naffected parties, and that a streamlined process should not be \nconstrued to in any way allow the process of participation to be \ncircumvented.\n  Is that your understanding?\n  Mr. MACK. Thank you, Senator Kerry. Let me say that I strongly \nsupport tenant and community participation in this process. As you \nknow, I have consistently advocated for such a role for tenants and \nother community residents in both the mark-to-market legislation and \nthe public housing legislation, which passed the Senate unanimously. So \nI would concur that we expect PAE's to take this provision seriously, \nwhile balancing this with the need to complete the restructuring \nprocess in a timely fashion.\n  Mr. BOND. I agree with my colleagues. In accommodating HUD's desire \nto streamline the tenant participation process, the Congress in no way \nintends to minimize the importance of meaningful and effective \nparticipation of project residents and others with a stake in the \nrestructuring process, including local governments. I agree with my \ncolleagues that this must be done in a way that also ensures that the \nmark-to-market process is completed in the 3-year window created by \nthis legislation.\n\n\n                             SECTION 517(c)\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I want to clarify section 517(c) of the \npending conference report. Let me be clear that the intent of this \nprovision is solely to encourage the Government-sponsored housing \nenterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to provide technical \nassistance and other support for maintaining the availability of \naffordable housing.\n  Mr. MACK. The Senator from North Carolina is correct. This provision \nwas contained in the legislation as it was initially reported out of \nthe Banking Committee as part of the committee's reconciliation bill. \nAt that time, the Banking Committee's report made it clear that nothing \nin the section was intended to be interpreted to impose any new \nregulatory mandate on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to continue existing \nsection 8 contracts in their current subsidized form.\n\n\n           HUD ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GRANT, LEHIGH COUNTY, PA\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to thank my \ncolleague, Chairman Bond, for including in the conference report \n$700,000 for a targeted grant for economic development for Lehigh \nCounty, PA. I am advised that these funds will be used to establish an \naquatic and wellness center on the grounds of Cedar Crest College.\n  The center has much local support because it is designed to stimulate \neconomic development in the Lehigh Valley. For example, the center is \nexpected to host athletic events and bring as much as $3 million \nannually in economic benefits to the region. The center is also \nenvisioned as a means of reducing juvenile crime in the Lehigh Valley. \nAccording to the center's planners, underprivileged inner-city youths \nwill be provided free access to the center in the hope that it will \nprovide a drug-free, healthy environment to juveniles and thus help \nbreak the temptations of street life and crime. We need to do much more \nto reduce juvenile crime, and offering civic diversions is an important \nmeans of accomplishing this goal. There will also be improved civic \nhealth for all social groups, particularly the elderly and the \ndisabled.\n\n[[Page S10740]]\n\n  Private sources have raised $2 million of the $9 million cost of \nconstructing the facility, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has \nincluded this project in its capital budget. Accordingly, I am pleased \nthat the Congress has chosen to make available economic development \nfunds for the center.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleague for his comments and want to confirm \nhis understanding that the $700,000 in the conference report is \nintended to be made available for this center at Cedar Crest College, \nwhich should contribute to economic development in the Lehigh Valley \nregion.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I would like a clarification of an item \nincluded in the fiscal year 1998 Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and independent agencies appropriations bill.\n  The item on which I would like clarification was included under the \nEconomic Development Initiative Program section of the bill and \nprovides a grant of $1,000,000 to the city of Jackson, MS. The \nconference report states that the grant should be used for training \nfacilities and equipment for a downtown multimodal transit center, \nphase II. The conference report incorrectly identifies what the grant \nis to be used for. In fact, the grant is for the acquisition and \nrehabilitation of facilities and related improvements for a downtown \nmultimodal transit center, phase II, in the city of Jackson, MS.\n  These funds are specifically to be used for the aquisition and \nrehabilitation of a trolley barn, downtown employee shuttle park and \nride lots, and a long-term intermodal passenger parking lot. This \nfunding will help revitalize an area of the city of Jackson that has \nbeen federally designated as an enterprise community.\n  It is my understanding that the conference report incorrectly \nidentified the purpose of the economic development initiative grant and \nthat congressional intent for the $1,000,000 grant to the city of \nJackson, MS, is for the purposes as I have described them. Would the \nchairman clarify this understanding?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes. The conference report does mistakenly identify the \npurpose of Jackson, MS, grant. The economic development initiative \ngrant for the city of Jackson should be used for the purposes as \nSenator Cochran describes them.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                            Elderly Housing\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr President, I want to express my appreciation to the \nchairman of the VA-HUD Subcommittee and to Chairman of the Subcommittee \non Housing for working with me to address the special difficulties \nconcerning the treatment of rural elderly housing projects under the \nnew Multifamily Housing Restructuring Program contained in the \nconference report. As the statement of managers states\n\n       A large portion of the properties in the upper Midwest are \n     elderly facilities in rural areas, which are particularly \n     disadvantaged under the Department's fair market rent system \n     because these properties were built to a different standard \n     compared to general rental properties, and the nature of the \n     rental housing depresses the FMR's.\n  The statement of Managers clearly recognizes the situation \nconfronting a large number of projects in my state of Iowa and in other \nstates in the Midwest. There are a variety of factors causing an \nespecially difficult problem for many rural elderly projects. First, \nthey were logically built with common rooms, elevators and other \namenities to serve their elderly occupants which added to construction \ncosts and are rarely found in the rental housing surveyed by HUD for \nFMR-setting purposes. Second, the nature of rural rental housing in \nmuch of the rural upper Midwest creates very low FMR's. Third, a very \nlarge share of the projects built in the late 1970's which are now \ncoming up for renewal were rural elderly projects in many States. That \nmeans that those States will see a large number of projects needing \nexceptions from the rent limitations requiring actions by the \nSecretary. The measure provides for some waiver authority with limits \nset by geographic areas.\n  I want to clarify that the waiver authority and other requirements \nplaced in the legislation during conference are intended to provide \nmaximum flexibility for restructuring projects to ensure that elderly \nprojects, and especially rural elderly projects, are preserved as \nproject-based, low-income housing. This valuable resource is needed to \nensure the availability of affordable, low-income housing for the \nelderly and disabled.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the concerns and efforts of the \nSenator from Iowa in this area. I share his concern about preserving \nelderly rural housing and that any adverse effect on elderly residents \nbe minimized. Clearly, we expect that there will be instances in which \nparticipating administrative entity may need to look at rents outside \nthe jurisdiction to best determine comparable rents. This concept is \nborne out in the definition of ``comparable properties'' in section \n512(1) where such properties are defined as meaning ``properties in the \nsame market areas, where practicable, that (A) are similar'' in various \nindicated ways to the project at issue, including ``type of location,'' \n``unit amenities,'' and ``other relevant characteristics.'' The \naddition of the words ``type of'' was added to meet the concerns you \nand others expressed that the lack of comparable housing for the \nelderly in relatively low population markets calls for appraisers to, \nwithin the normal practices, to use comparables in similar types of \nlocations in other markets when there are not two comparable properties \nin the market.\n  I presume in such a case where it has been determined appropriate to \nlook at other market areas for comparable properties, that the use of \nthe phrase ``in the same market area'' with respect to comparable \nproperties in the definition of ``eligible multifamily housing \nprojects'' in section 512(2)(A) would be guided by the same standards \nas apply in connection with determining comparable properties, i.e., \nthe limitation to the same market area would be to the extent it was \npracticable and that as indicated in the statement of managers, the \nparticipating administrative entity may look at rents outside the \nproject's jurisdiction.\n  And, we expect that the Secretary will grant the waiver authorities \nallowed to him regarding the 20 percent limit on properties receiving \nan FMR of up to 120 percent and for granting appropriate properties \nFMR's in excess of 120 percent up to the limits allowed in the \nlegislation.\n  Again, I thank you for your efforts in this area.\n\n\n                      particulate matter research\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank the chairman for including language on particulate matter \nresearch in the VA, HUD, and independent agencies appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 1998. This bill allocates approximately $50 million for \nresearch on the possible health effects of airborne particulate matter. \nThe administration based its most far-reaching and costly air quality \nstandards on inadequate research and methodology. The language in this \nbill ensures that critically needed research is carefully and \nobjectively mapped-out.\n  The emotionally charged debate on this issue, the concern expressed \nby State, local, and Federal officials over the rules, and the numerous \nunanswered questions and uncertainties identified by EPA's science \nadvisers and other independent scientists only serves to underscore the \npressing need for further research. There is widespread disagreement in \nthe scientific community over the adequacy of the studies the EPA used \nas a basis for the new air quality standards.\n  I am greatly disturbed that these costly standards were promulgated \nwithout any form of scientific consensus that the regulations will \nprovide any measurable improvement in human health. Currently, these \nstandards are subjective in nature not based on available objective \nscientific evidence. It is critical to our Nation that a well organized \nand thought out scientific review of these matters occurs. Premature \nimplementation of the standards is far more damaging to our Nation than \ntaking the time to allow a larger portion of the scientific community \nto study and review these standards. I believe my colleague from \nAlabama would like to share his thoughts on this matter.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Numerous scientists, including several who have \ntestified on this issue before the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, have stated that the size, shape, or chemical composition of \nthe PM that is causing the\n\n[[Page S10741]]\n\nalleged adverse health effects is unknown. There are various theories--\nsulfates, acids, transmetals, ultrafines--regarding the potential bad \nactor.\n  During testimony before the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, we learned that the EPA based its setting of the new \nparticulate matter standard on inconclusive scientific data. In one EPA \nstudy, which attempted to show a relationship between levels of \nparticulate matter and mortality and morbidity in Birmingham, AL, the \nauthor of the study admitted that if humidity was considered in the \nmodel, the effects of particulate matter on morbidity and mortality was \nstatistically insignificant.\n  Billions will need to be spent by individuals, industry, and State \nand local governments to meet compliance with the administration's \nPM2.5 standard. Unless the problem is clearly identified before control \nprograms are implemented, there is no assurance that there will be any \nhealth benefits resulting from the new standards. In fact, the new \nstandards themselves may bring adverse health effects as an unintended \nconsequence caused by a lower standard of living.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that your bill addresses the lack of \nscientific evidence to justify the newly promulgated air quality \nstandards. Science on this matter needs to be completed in order to \nobtain a clearer understanding if there is a problem and then what \nneeds to be done to address the problem. This measure will begin the \nprocess of a strong scientific overview. I support the immediate \ndirection for scientific research.\n  Mr. BOND. I believe research, as outlined in this bill, will begin to \nimprove our understanding of the relationship between particulate \nexposure and adverse health effects. The funding and direction provided \nin the bill will put into place a needed mechanism to establish a \ncomprehensive, peer-reviewed research program which will benefit all \nparties involved with the decision-making activities regarding \nparticulate matter in the years to come. The EPA was one of several \norganizations that worked with us to develop the research directives in \nthis bill and I fully expect the EPA to follow the direction and spirit \nof the statement of managers.\n  Mr. SHELBY. When the administration promulgated these rules, they \nacknowledged the need for additional scientific studies to attempt to \nvalidate their actions. Considering the current controversy surrounding \nthe lack of scientific evidence for the air quality rule, I am pleased \nthat your language opens future research to a diverse section of our \nNation's scientists. Mr. Chairman, how does this language ensure that \nthe EPA will establish a collaborative relationship with the \nparticipating organizations.\n  Mr. BOND. The research program is intended to build on the research \nthat is planned or underway at the EPA, National Institute of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences, National Academy of Sciences [NAS], \nHealth Effects Institute and several other public and private entities. \nWithin 30 days of the enactment of this legislation, the EPA is \nrequired to enter into a cooperative agreement with the National \nAcademy of Sciences [NAS] to develop a comprehensive, prioritized, \nnear- and long-term particulate matter research program, as well as a \nplan to monitor how this research program is being carried out by all \nparticipants. All parties, including Congress, will be apprised of the \nresearch plans and all subsequent steps throughout the process. The EPA \nis expected to implement NAS's plan, including appropriate peer \nreviews. NAS will monitor the implementation of the research plan and \nperiodically report to Congress as to the progress of the research \nprogram. We believe the language included in this bill set forth a \nrealistic and thoughtful plan to address the numerous scientific \nquestions that need to be investigated prior to the next NAAQ's review \nfor particulate matter.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Senator Sessions, for \nparticipating in the colloquy.\n\n\n                coordinated tribal water quality program\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to thank the subcommittee for its \nhard and diligent work on this bill. In particular, I appreciate the \nrecognition of the Coordinated Tribal Water Quality Program in \nWashington State [CTWQP].\n  The CTWQP is a most important model for demonstrating how tribes can \nsolve their water quality protection problems by coordinating with \nlocal, State, and Federal Government agencies. This program began in \n1990 when the 26 tribes and tribal organizations in Washington State \ncame together with a cooperative intergovernmental strategy to \naccomplish national clean water goals and objectives. As a result of \nFederal court decisions, the State of Washington has recognized the \ntribes as comanagers of water quality in the State. This program has \nbeen an effective tool for leveraging scarce public funds to create \nviable, watershed-based water quality protection plans.\n  It is my understanding Congress has increased EPA's General \nAssistance Program [GAP] and other funding mechanisms over the years \nwhich includes the base program efforts for the CTWQP in Washington \nState.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington is correct. The \nGAP and other funding mechanisms in EPA have increased over the years \nto meet the needs of tribal governments. These needs include the CTWQP \nin Washington State. The funding will allow the tribes to fulfill their \nroles as comanagers of water quality in Washington State.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the distinguished chairman for this \nclarification.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, while I congratulate Senators Bond \nand Mikulski on their efforts to craft this year's VA, HUD, and \nindependent agencies appropriations bill, I would like to take \nexception to language contained in the Senate committee report \nregarding the Fair Housing Act and property insurance.\n  The report contains two paragraphs regarding the Office of Fair \nHousing and Equal Opportunity's continued exercise of regulatory \nauthority over property insurance under the Fair Housing Act. I would \nlike to remind my colleagues that discrimination in the provision of \nproperty insurance is a clear violation of the Fair Housing Act.\n  In 1988, Congress gave the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment [HUD] the authority to promulgate regulations to enforce \nthe Fair Housing Act. At that time, HUD under then-President George \nBush and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp--issued a regulation which defined \nconduct prohibited under the Fair Housing Act to include: ``refusing to \nprovide property or hazard insurance for dwellings, or providing such \ninsurance differently, because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, \nfamilial status, or national origin.''\n  The reason for this prohibition is simple. Without property \ninsurance, no lender will provide a mortgage. Without a mortgage, few \nindividuals can buy a house.\n  Recently, Federal courts of appeal in two different circuits have \nheld that the Act applies to insurance discrimination, and the Supreme \nCourt has denied petitions to review those holdings. [See NAACP v. \nAmerican Family, 978 F.2nd (7th Cir. 1992) cert. denied, 508 US 907 \n(1993); Nationwide v. Cisneros, 52 F3d 1352 (6th Cir. 1995), cert. \ndenied, 64 U.S.L.W. 3560, (Feb. 20, 1996)]\n  Some have maintained that combating insurance discrimination has \nnothing to do with civil rights, but rather is a regulatory issue. \nEnforcement of antiredlining provisions, however, is not insurance \nregulation--rather, it is about prohibiting discrimination, a subject \nthat, under our Constitution, is clearly the responsibility of the \nFederal Government. The law works to ensure that insurance--like all \nother goods and services--is available to all citizens, regardless of \nrace.\n  The Senate report contains language stating that the ``McCarran-\nFerguson Act of 1945 explicitly states that unless a Federal law \nspecifically relates to the business of insurance, that law shall not \napply where it would interfere with State insurance regulations.'' \nCurrent law does not violate the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Federal courts \nhave consistently held that the Fair Housing Act only adds remedies for \nillegal discrimination--it does not preempt any State regulation.\n  The Senate language also states that ``HUD's insurance-related \nactivities duplicate State regulation of insurance.'' While most State \ninsurance codes do address issues pertaining to unfair discrimination, \nreferring to treating the same insurance risks differently, these\n\n[[Page S10742]]\n\nState insurance laws generally lack the protections and remedies \nprovided by the Fair Housing Act.\n  Congress has consistently rejected the argument that the Federal \nGovernment should leave the enforcement of civil rights to the \nexclusive jurisdiction of the States. Even in States whose civil rights \nlaws address discrimination in property insurance, protection equal to \nthe Fair Housing Act is all too often lacking. Currently, only 29 \nStates have laws and enforcement mechanisms that have been certified as \nsubstantially equivalent to the Federal Fair Housing Act. Federal \nenforcement must continue if we are to eliminate property insurance \ndiscrimination nationwide.\n  Nothing is more central to the American dream than owning your own \nhome. Millions of Americans work hard and play by the rules to reach \nthat goal. But if homeowners, or would-be homeowners, are redlined by \ninsurance companies, they are denied their chance at the American \ndream.\n  The Fair Housing Act is the basic protection against property-\ninsurance discrimination. I will continue to do everything in my power \nto ensure that homeowners and their families can continue to enjoy the \nprotections of the Fair Housing Act and realize the American dream free \nfrom discrimination.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nconference agreement on H.R. 2158, the VA-HUD appropriations bill for \n1998.\n  This bill provides new budget authority of $90.7 billion and new \noutlays of $52.9 billion to finance operations of the Departments of \nVeterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental \nProtection Agency, NASA, and other independent agencies.\n  I congratulate the distinguished subcommittee chairman and ranking \nmember for producing a bill that is within the Subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation. When outlays from prior-year BA and other adjustments are \ntaken into account, the bill totals $89.9 billion in BA and $100 \nbillion in outlays. The total bill is exactly at the Senate \nsubcommittee's 302(b) nondefense allocation for budget authority and \noutlays. The bill is under the Senate Subcommittee's defense allocation \nby $2 million in BA and by $1 million in outlays.\n  Further, I am pleased that the conferees have produced a bill that \nlargely is in accord with the budget agreement reached with the \nAdministration earlier this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the conference \nagreement on H.R. 2158.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 H.R. 2158, VA-HUD APPROPRIATIONS, 1998, SPENDING COMPARISONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n                                   [Fiscal year 1998, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Defense  Nondefense   Crime  Mandatory    Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference report:\n  Budget authority............................................     128      68,447   ......    21,332     89,907\n  Outlays.....................................................     128      79,833   ......    20,061    100,022\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority............................................     130      68,447   ......    21,332     89,909\n  Outlays.....................................................     129      79,833   ......    20,061    100,023\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority............................................     129      76,965   ......    21,332     98,426\n  Outlays.....................................................     128      80,313   ......    20,061    100,502\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority............................................     128      69,823   ......    21,332     91,283\n  Outlays.....................................................     128      80,403   ......    20,061    100,592\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority............................................     128      68,729   ......    21,332     90,189\n  Outlays.....................................................     128      79,559   ......    20,061     99,748\n \n                                         CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority............................................      -2   ..........  ......  .........        -2\n  Outlays.....................................................      -1   ..........  ......  .........        -1\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority............................................      -1      -8,518   ......  .........    -8,519\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......       -480   ......  .........      -480\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......     -1,376   ......  .........    -1,376\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......       -570   ......  .........      -570\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority............................................  .......       -282   ......  .........      -282\n  Outlays.....................................................  .......        274   ......  .........       274\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals adjusted for consistency with current scorekeeping\n  conversions.\n\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the chairman of the \nVA-HUD Subcommittee, Senator Bond, for crafting a measure that \ncarefully balances a wide range of competing and diverse interests. I \nbelieve this conference report deserves the strong support of all \nSenators.\n  I am especially pleased that this bill contains legislation I \nintroduced, along with Senators D'Amato, Bond, and Bennett, and \ncosponsored by Senators Domenici, Chafee, Faircloth and Grams, to \nreform the Nation's assisted and insured multifamily housing portfolio. \nIt is unusual to have extensive authorizing language in an \nappropriation. However, title V of this bill, the Multifamily Assisted \nHousing Reform and Affordability Act, balances both fiscal and public \npolicy goals. It will save scarce Federal resources over both the short \nand long term while preserving the affordability and availability of \ndecent and safe rental housing for lower income households.\n  About 20 years ago, the Federal Government encouraged private \ndevelopers to construct affordable rental housing by providing mortgage \ninsurance through the Federal Housing Administration [FHA] and rental \nhousing assistance through the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment's [HUD] project-based section 8 program. In addition, tax \nincentives for the development of low-income housing were provided \nthrough the tax code until 1986.\n  HUD's section 8 assisted and FHA-insured multifamily housing program \nhas created thousands of decent, safe and affordable housing \nproperties. However, the current program allows some owners to receive \nmore--often far more Federal dollars than necessary to maintain their \nproperties. Further, a portion of the rental stock suffers from poor \nmanagement or has become physically distressed. Thus, in some cases, \ntaxpayers are paying costly subsidies for inferior housing.\n  We are on the verge of a funding crisis in the renewal of HUD's \nexpiring section 8 rental assistance contracts. Indeed, HUD Secretary \nCuomo has called the section 8 contract renewal problem ``the greatest \ncrisis HUD has ever faced.'' Over the next several years, a majority of \nthe section 8 contracts on the 8,500 FHA-insured properties will \nexpire. If contracts continue to be renewed at existing levels, the \ncost of renewing these contracts will grow from about $2 billion in \nfiscal year 1998 to $5.2 billion in fiscal year 2002 and more than $7.7 \nbillion 10 years from now. The total cost of renewing all section 8 \nproject-based and tenant-based assistance would grow from $9 billion in \nfiscal year 1998 to as much as $18 billion in fiscal year 2002 without \npolicy changes.\n  Federally assisted and insured housing serves almost 1.6 million \nfamilies with an average annual income of $7,000. About half of the \nhouseholds are elderly or contain persons with disabilities. Many of \nthese developments are located in rural areas where no other rental \nhousing exists. Some of these properties serve as anchors of \nneighborhoods where the economic stability of the neighborhood is \ndependent on the vitality of these properties. If the project-based \ncontracts are not renewed, residents and communities would be adversely \naffected. Further, most of the underlying FHA-insured mortgages--with \nan unpaid principal balance of $18 billion--will be forced into \ndefault.\n  The Banking Committee began its examination of what is commonly \nreferred to as the ``mark-to-market'' issue more than 2 years ago. \nSince that time, we have received extensive input from all of the \npotential stakeholders in this issue, including residents, project \nmanagers, low-income advocates and project residents, State and local \ninterests, the financial community, and HUD.\n  The version of the bill we are considering today reflects \nnegotiations with all parties that have occurred since its original \nintroduction as S. 513 in March. It is a consensus bill that helps to \nensure that residents, communities and the Federal investment in the \nhousing are protected at a cost we can afford.\n  At a Housing Subcommittee hearing in June, HUD Secretary Cuomo raised \nsome administration concerns about S. 513. We have attempted to address \nthose concerns and provide a reasonable degree of flexibility for HUD \nin its overall administration of the mortgage restructuring program and \nalso to provide reasonable opportunities for the use of tenant-based \nassistance after restructuring. I appreciate the cooperation of \nSecretary Cuomo in helping to move this important legislation forward.\n  I want to thank Senator D'Amato, chairman of the Banking Committee,\n\n[[Page S10743]]\n\nfor his ongoing, strong support for this legislation. In addition, I \nappreciate the support of Senators Sarbanes and Kerry. From the outset, \nmark-to-market has been a bipartisan effort, and those Senators have \nmade invaluable contributions to the final version of the legislation.\n  I want to touch briefly on some of the bill's major provisions and \nthe compromises that are reflected in the conference agreement.\n  First, the bill ``marks'' rents on oversubsidized properties to \ncomparable market rents or to 90 percent of area fair market rents. The \nunderlying mortgages would be restructured so they could be supported \nby the new rents. In some cases, higher rents could be permitted if \nnecessary to support proper operations and maintenance costs. These \nexceptions are principally intended to assure the continued viability \nof projects, generally serving the elderly, located in rural areas.\n  Second, the bill also recognizes that HUD lacks the staffing capacity \nand expertise to oversee effectively its portfolio of multifamily \nhousing properties or to administer a debt restructuring program. \nAccordingly, the bill would transfer the functions and responsibilities \nof the restructuring program to capable third parties, preferably State \nand local housing finance agencies, who would act as participating \nadministrative entities [PAE's] in managing this program.\n  The language concerning third parties has been modified from its \noriginal form partially in order to accommodate concerns raised by the \nadministration. These changes will increase HUD's flexibility to \npartner with a variety of public, nonprofit, and for-profit entities \nthat have expertise in affordable housing, while also providing an \nexclusive time period for applications submitted by publicly \naccountable entities.\n  Under the revised language, public entities--State and local housing \nfinance agencies [HFA's]--would be given an exclusive time period to \nsubmit proposals to serve as PAE's. Criteria for the selection of PAE's \nwould be based on the applicant's demonstrated experience and expertise \nin multifamily financing and restructuring and the capacity to work \nwith low-income residents and communities. Further, selection would be \nbased on the PAE's ability to perform the portfolio restructuring in a \ntimely, efficient, and cost-effective manner. I would like to emphasize \nthat the Secretary would be required to select housing finance agencies \nas PAE's if they meet the selection criteria.\n  I strongly believe that, based on the housing finance agencies' track \nrecords and mission that they are by far the most viable entities to \ncarry out the responsibilities under this program and to balance the \nfinancial and social policy goals of the bill. Accordingly, it is my \nexpectation that State and local HFA's would be responsible for most of \nthe properties under mark-to-market, as evident by the significant \nparticipation of public entities under HUD's fiscal 1997 mark-to-market \ndemonstration program.\n  Third, owners who clearly violate housing quality standards would no \nlonger be tolerated. The bill screens out bad owners and managers and \nnonviable projects from the inventory and provides tougher and more \neffective enforcement tools that will minimize fraud and abuse of FHA \ninsurance and assisted housing programs.\n  Fourth, the conference bill revises the original version of S. 513, \nwhich had called for the exclusive use of project-based rental \nassistance after restructuring. Under the conference agreement, \nproject-based assistance would be maintained on properties located in \nmarkets where there is inadequate available affordable housing and for \nthose that predominantly serve elderly or disabled populations. For the \nremaining inventory, PAE's would be provided the discretion of either \nmaintaining project-based assistance or providing tenant-based \nassistance. The PAE's decision on the form of assistance would be based \non factors related to the local market, the stability of the project, \nresident choice, and the impact on the community. This decision would \nonly be made after consultation with affected owners and appropriate \npublic officials, and significant participation by affected residents.\n  Fifth, the conference agreement establishes a new Office of \nMultifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring, headed by a \nPresidentially appointed Director, within HUD to oversee the \nrestructuring process. The bill makes it clear that the Director will \nbe answerable and be accountable to the Secretary, but will free of \nundue Secretarial interference in the conduct and decisionmaking of the \noffice.\n  Last, the bill provides tools to recapitalize the assisted stock that \nsuffers from deferred maintenance. It provides the opportunity for \ntenants, local governments and the community in which the project is \nlocated to participate in the restructuring process in a meaningful \nway. Residents would also be empowered through opportunities to \npurchase properties.\n  Mr. President, I would like to emphasize how important it is that we \nare addressing this issue this year. Delays will only harm the assisted \nhousing stock, its residents and communities, and the financial \nstability of the FHA insurance funds. I would add that, as we face an \nexplosion in the cost of section 8 contract renewals, we cannot afford \nto pay more than is reasonable to renew expiring contracts.\n  This legislation will protect the Federal Government's investment in \nassisted housing and ensure that participating administrative entities \nare held accountable for their activities. It is also our goal that \nthis process will ensure the long-term viability of these projects with \nminimal Federal involvement. It is a sincere effort to reduce the cost \nto the Federal Government while recognizing the needs of low-income \nfamilies and communities throughout the Nation.\n  In closing, I want to commend Senator Bond and his counterpart in the \nHouse, Congressman Jerry Lewis, for their cooperation in acting to \navert a potential section 8 contract renewal crisis. This is a \nbipartisan proposal that both reduces unnecessary Federal expenditures \nand represents good and thoughtful Federal housing policy.\n\n\n                     Regulation of Insurance by HUD\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Senate committee report on the fiscal \nyear 1997 VA/HUD appropriations bill regarding HUD's regulation of \ninsurance stated that:\n\n       The Committee intends that funds appropriated to the fair \n     housing initiatives program for enforcement of title VIII of \n     the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended, which prohibits \n     discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing \n     and in the provision of housing and in the provision of \n     brokerage services, be used only to address such forms of \n     discrimination as they are explicitly identified and \n     specifically described in title VIII. Recognizing that there \n     are limited resources available for FHIP activities, the \n     Committee believes that FHIP funds should serve the purposes \n     of Congress as reflected in the express language of title \n     VIII.\n       The Committee notes that HUD's Office of Fair Housing and \n     Equal Opportunity has undertaken a variety of activities \n     pertaining to property insurance under the authority of the \n     Fair Housing Act. HUD recently testified that, due to \n     congressional concern about such activities, it does not \n     intend to focus its regulatory initiatives on property \n     insurance. The Committee is encouraged by this statement, but \n     remains concerned about HUD's use of funds for other fair \n     housing activities aimed at property insurance practices.\n       HUD's insurance-related activities duplicate State \n     regulation of insurance. Every State and the District of \n     Columbia have laws and regulations addressing unfair \n     discrimination in property insurance and are actively \n     investigating and addressing discrimination where it is found \n     to occur. HUD's activities in this area create an unwarranted \n     and unnecessary layer of Federal bureaucracy.\n       The Fair Housing Act makes no mention of discrimination in \n     property insurance. Moreover, neither it nor its legislative \n     history suggests that Congress intended it to apply to the \n     provision of property insurance. Indeed, Congress' intention, \n     as expressly stated in the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 and \n     repeatedly reaffirmed thereafter, is that, unless a Federal \n     law specifically relates to the business of insurance, that \n     law shall not apply where it would interfere with State \n     insurance regulation. HUD's assertion of authority regarding \n     property insurance contradicts this statutory mandate.\n\n  Near-identical language was contained in the House Committee report \non the fiscal year 1997 appropriations bill. Both reports make it clear \nthat Congress does not intend for HUD to use any fiscal year 1997 FHIP \nfunds for activities targeted toward the regulation and practices of \ninsurance companies.\n  Nevertheless, on September 30, 1997, HUD announced 67 awards of \nfiscal\n\n[[Page S10744]]\n\nyear 1997 grants under the FHIP. Out of the total of $15,000,000 in \nfunds awarded, HUD announced that almost one third, an amount of \n$4,170,002, was awarded for activities including investigations, \ntesting, and other enforcement-related projects specifically targeting \ninsurance companies. This is in contradiction of the intent expressed \nin both the House and Senate Committee reports on HUD's fiscal year \n1997 appropriations. I am very concerned about the improper use of \nthese limited and precious resources in a manner inconsistent with the \nlaw and urge HUD to revisit these grants to ensure all awards are \nconsistent with the intent of Congress.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the VA-HUD conference \nreport. This bill funds many programs that are crucial to the Nation's \neconomic vitality. For example, the funding for the National Institutes \nof Health and the National Science Foundation contained in this bill \nboth expands our basic knowledge and helps promote small, innovative \nbusinesses that create well-paying jobs throughout the country.\n  This bill also provides the funds that support important \nenvironmental programs, and, of course, allows us to keep faith with \nAmerica's veterans by providing them with the health care they have \nearned, in some cases at great personal cost.\n  This bill also funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \nThese funds will help families struggling to attain the dream of home \nownership or simply to find or maintain affordable rental housing. It \nprovides funds for homeless programs, programs that provide both \nshelter and the supportive services that are so important in the effort \nto stabilize the lives of these most unfortunate Americans and create \nopportunities for self-sufficiency.\n  I commend Chairman Bond and the ranking member, Senator Mikulski, for \ntheir efforts to serve so many important needs with so little money. In \nfact, Mr. President, while I support this legislation, I must point out \nthat housing programs continue to suffer in our Nation's budget. \nHomeless programs continue to be funded at levels more than 25 percent \nbelow 1995 levels. We ask more from public housing authorities every \nday, but provide no more resources to them to do the job. We are facing \nan increasing housing crisis in America, but with decreasing resources, \nand that is an issue that we must, eventually, confront.\n  I specifically appreciate the willingness of Senators Bond and \nMikulski to work with me, Senator D'Amato, Senator Mack, and Senator \nSarbanes to include in this conference report important legislation \ncommonly known as the Mark-to-Market [MTM] legislation. Senator Mack, \nin particular, deserves special mention for his efforts to get this \nlegislation passed.\n  Passage of the MTM legislation is the first step in solving the \nproblem that Secretary Cuomo called the biggest crisis facing HUD--the \nproblem of over-subsidized section 8 projects that are threatened with \ndefault when their rental assistance contracts expire in the next few \nyears. The problem is truly huge: up to 10,000 projects serving about \n1.6 million families, including hundreds of thousands of elderly and \ndisabled families, were facing possible default. This would have \nresulted in billions of dollars of losses to the American taxpayer \nthrough the FHA fund, and would have led to the outright loss or slow \ndeterioration of increasingly scarce affordable housing.\n  Mr. President, the mark-to-market legislation--Title V of the \nappropriations bill--will allow HUD, primarily through State and local \npartners, to start pushing down excess rents to supportable market \nlevels while providing funds to rehabilitate those properties that need \ncapital investments. The bill will eliminate bad owners from the \nprogram. In such cases, the legislation encourages HUD or the PAE's to \ntransfer these properties to new ownership, preferably to community-\nbased non-profits.\n  Most importantly, Mr. President, this legislation will help preserve \nhundreds of thousands of units of affordable housing for the \nforeseeable future. As I noted, we are seeing an overall reduction in \nthe commitment to affordable housing by the Federal Government. The \nlegislation we are passing today represents an important exception to \nthat disturbing trend. The clear and resounding intent of this bill is \nto preserve and improve this important stock of affordable housing. I \napplaud my colleagues and the Secretary for embracing this goal, and I \nwholeheartedly support it.\n  In implementing this legislation, HUD will most often do the \nrestructuring through a participating administrative entity, or PAE. We \nexpect that State or local housing finance agencies, because of their \nexperience with the financing and management of assisted housing, and \ntheir commitment to the long-term preservation of affordable housing, \nwill typically be the PAE.\n  At the same time, we gave the Secretary the discretion to choose the \nPAE. There will be thousands of projects and hundreds of thousands of \nunits that will have to go through the restructuring process. In order \nto get this done in a timely and cost-effective way, the Secretary may \nhave to reach out to more than one entity in a given area, or HUD may \ndecide to do some of the restructurings itself.\n  It is important to point out that the legislation requires that \ncrucial decisions regarding the long-term disposition of the property \nsuch as, for example, whether the assistance is to remain project-based \nor, in a few cases, may be turned into tenant-based, shall be made by a \npublic agency with a public mission whose interest is to preserve \naffordable housing.\n  Similarly, the ongoing oversight of the projects after restructuring \nis completed will be in the hands of HUD or State or local HFA's. The \nimportant point here is that public funds continue to be at risk; \ntherefore, public agencies must take the responsibility for ensuring \ntheir safety.\n  To further ensure that HFA's are chosen to be the PAE's, I urge HFA's \nto strengthen their applications by creating partnerships with other \nexperienced parties to strengthen their applications. Such partners \nwould include community-based non-profits, residents groups, financial \nand other relevant experts.\n  Mr. President, I want to emphasize that the overriding, primary goal \nof this legislation is to preserve affordable housing for the long \nterm. As a result, we expect the PAE's to continue to provide project-\nbased assistance except in certain rare circumstances. The bill \nprovides for the final decision to be taken only after consultation \nwith residents and owners of the projects, local government officials, \nand other affected parties. Moreover, the PAE must take into \nconsideration the availability of other affordable housing in the area, \nthe ability of tenants to use vouchers successfully, the financial \nstability of the project, and other factors which, when taken as a \nwhole, would lead a PAE to conclude that project-based assistance \ncontinues to be the best choice in most cases.\n  Mr. President, the legislation creates an office within HUD to \noversee the restructuring process called the ``Office of Multifamily \nHousing Assistance and Restructuring'' [OMHAR]. The Director of this \noffice will be appointed by the President and subject to Senate \nconfirmation. The Director will work under the Secretary, subject to \nthe Secretary's direction and oversight. Section 573(d)(2) of the bill \ngives the Director the authority to report directly to the Congress, in \ncertain circumstances, when the Director determines, in his discretion, \nsuch a report would be appropriate.\n  Mr. President, let me reiterate a point also made by my colleagues \nregarding tenant participation in the restructuring process. It is our \nclear intent that HUD and the PAE's work with tenants in a meaningful \nand effective way with regards to all aspects of the restructuring \nprocess. This means timely access to relevant information, adequate \ntime to analyze such information, the right to meet with the PAE, and \nthe right to be included in physical inspections of the property, \ncapital needs assessments, proposals to transfer the property, and \nother decisions that have significant impacts on the residents.\n  Finally, I want to point out that this bill also includes important \nprovisions regarding the renewal of other section 8 contracts. These \nprovisions authorize HUD to renew contracts on high-value properties \nthat do not need to go through the restructuring process at\n\n[[Page S10745]]\n\ncomparable market rents. The Congress expects HUD to exercise this \ndiscretion so as to avoid displacement of current tenants and, whenever \npossible, consistent with the purposes of this title, to preserve the \nhousing for the long term.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I strongly support the MTM provisions \nin the VA-HUD conference report. They will be essential in restoring \nthis valuable housing resource to sound financial and physical \ncondition.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the VA-HUD \nconference report. This bill funds many important programs, programs \nthat are crucial to America's veterans and to poor and working families \nstruggling to attain the dream of home ownership or simply to find \naffordable rental housing. It will help ensure our Nation's \nenvironmental vitality, our Nation's health and scientific progress. \nThe bill will maintain our commitment to the exploration of space. I \ncommend the chairman, Senator Bond, and my good friend and colleague \nfrom Maryland, the ranking member, Senator Mikulski for their hard work \nto serve so many important needs with an ever-shrinking pot of money.\n  I also appreciate their willingness to work with me, Senator D'Amato, \nSenator Mack, and Senator Kerry to include in this report important \nlegislation designed to restructure HUD's portfolio of FHA-insured, \nassisted housing. This legislation is commonly known as the mark-to-\nmarket (MTM) legislation. Senator Mack, in particular, deserves credit \nfor his tireless efforts to have this legislation included in the VA-\nHUD appropriations bill and for his willingness to work with the \nadministration and the House authorizers to craft this final consensus. \nAgain, I thank Senators Bond and Mikulski for their partnership in this \nimportant achievement.\n  Mr. President, the mark-to-market legislation--title V of the \nappropriations bill--will save the American taxpayers billions of \ndollars. It will allow HUD, primarily through State and local partners, \nto squeeze excess rents down to supportable market levels. It will \nprovide for funds to rehabilitate those properties that need capital \ninvestments. It will eliminate bad owners from the program. Most \nimportantly, Mr. President, this legislation will help preserve \nhundreds of thousands of units of affordable housing for the \nforeseeable future. At a time when we are cutting back on the Federal \ncommitment to build new affordable housing while simultaneously facing \ngrowing needs for such housing, the long-term commitment established by \nthis legislation is truly a landmark achievement.\n  In implementing this legislation, HUD will most often do the \nrestructuring through a participating administrative entity, or PAE. \nThe legislation clearly indicates that we expect that, with some \nexceptions, State or local housing finance agencies will act as the \nPAE. In fact, HUD has signed 14 management contracts with State housing \nfinance agencies [HFA's] to implement the fiscal year 1997 MTM \ndemonstration, which was based on the legislation in the current \nappropriations bill. The experience HFA's have in restructuring section \n8 as a result of their participation in the demonstration, or in \nrestructuring equivalent properties, along with their experience in FHA \nrisk sharing, overseeing low-income housing tax credit deals, mortgage \nrevenue bond deals, and in underwriting and managing market rate and \nassisted low-income multifamily housing, clearly makes the HFA's the \nmost qualified candidates to be chosen as the PAE in most cases. In \naddition to all these financial engineering and management \nqualifications, the legislation requires the use of highly qualified \nHFA's because these public agencies have a public purpose and share \nwith the Congress the commitment to preserve these projects as low-\nincome housing far into the future. This factor was paramount in the \ndecision to give the HFA's such a prominent role in the MTM process.\n  At the same time, we gave the Secretary the discretion to make the \nfinal choice of PAE because we did not want the Secretary to be \nrequired to choose an unqualified housing finance agency to be a PAE. \nThere will be thousands of projects and hundreds of thousands of units \nthat will have to go through the restructuring process. In order to get \nthis done in a timely and cost-effective way, the Secretary may have to \nreach out to more than one entity in a given area, or HUD may decide to \ndo the restructurings itself. In all cases, however, the crucial \ndecisions that have major impacts on the residents, the projects, or \ntheir surrounding communities, such as, for example, whether the \nassistance is to remain project-based or, in a few cases, may be turned \ninto tenant-based, shall be made by a public agency with a public \nmission whose interest is to preserve affordable housing.\n  In addition, the ongoing oversight of the projects, after \nrestructuring is completed, will have to be in the hands of the public. \nThis requirement can be satisfied by HUD doing the contract monitoring \nand oversight, or by contracting this function out to a State or local \nHFA. Again, this is a public trust, and the legislation requires that a \npublic agency carry it out.\n  The Congress clearly expects HFA's who seek the role of PAE to \nstrengthen their applications by reaching out to other experienced \nparties, particularly non-profits with experience in real estate \ndevelopment and/or management and with deep roots in their communities, \nto develop partnerships. In addition, PAE's may want to find financial \nand other relevant experts to ensure that they present the best \npossible application to the Secretary.\n  Mr. President, tenants, owners, HFA's, HUD, and the Congress all \nagree that the majority of the portfolio of affordable housing that \nwill go through the MTM process should continue to have project-based \nsection 8 assistance. For example, the legislation requires that \nelderly and disabled housing projects and housing in tight rental \nmarkets continue to receive project-based section 8 assistance.\n  It is the clear intent of the Congress that we preserve the existing \nsection 8 project-based portfolio of affordable housing to the greatest \nextent possible. To do this effectively, we expect the PAE's to \ncontinue to provide project-based assistance except in certain rare \ncircumstances. The bill provides for the final decision to be taken \nonly after consultation with owners, residents of the projects, local \ngovernment officials, and other affected parties. Moreover, the PAE \nmust take into consideration the availability of other affordable \nhousing in the area, the ability of tenants to use vouchers \nsuccessfully, the financial stability of the project, and other factors \nwhich, when taken as a whole, would lead a PAE to conclude that \nproject-based assistance continues to be the best choice in most cases.\n  Mr. President, in the course of the final negotiations to include the \nMTM legislation in the appropriations conference report, it was agreed \nto create an office within HUD to oversee the restructuring process. \nThe office, called the Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance and \nRestructuring [OMHAR] will have a director that is appointed by the \nPresident and subject to Senate confirmation. The Congress clearly \nintends, as the legislation language states, that the Director will \nwork under the Secretary, subject to the Secretary's direction and \noversight. Section 573(d)(2) of the bill gives the Director the \nauthority to report directly to the Congress, in certain circumstances, \nwhen the Director determines, in his discretion, such a report would be \nappropriate.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me reiterate a point also made by my \ncolleagues regarding tenant participation in the restructuring process. \nIt is our clear intent that HUD and the PAE's work with tenants in a \nmeaningful and effective way with regard to all aspects of the \nrestructuring process. This means timely access to relevant \ninformation, adequate time to analyze such information, the right to \nmeet with the PAE, and the right to be included in physical inspections \nof the property, capital needs assessments, proposals to transfer the \nproperty, and other decisions that have significant impacts on the \nresidents.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I strongly support the MTM provisions \nin the VA-HUD conference report, thank my colleagues for their hard \nwork, and look forward to seeing this important Federal resource \nrestored to sound financial and physical condition.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, a number of items in the conference report \nor statement of the managers require further clarification or \ncorrection due to\n\n[[Page S10746]]\n\nprinters' errors. The items are as follows:\n  Within the housing certificate fund, the legislation requires HUD to \nprovide enhanced or sticky vouchers to residents to prevent \ndisplacement where an owner of a property chooses to prepay the \noutstanding indebtedness under a preservation mortgage (which \nprepayment can now be authorized at the option of a property owner). \nThese enhanced vouchers, including those provided in prior years, are \nnot just for the first year after prepayment but must renewed for each \nsubsequent year so long as the assisted family continues to live in the \nproperty.\n  Within the $32 million for section 107 grants under the CDBG Program, \n$4 million for technical assistance, $7.5 million for the Community \nOutreach Program, $6.5 million for Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities, $6.5 million for Community Development Work Study, with a \n$3 million set-aside for Hispanic-serving institutions, $7 million for \ninsular areas, and $500 thousand for the National Center for the \nRevitalization of Central Cities.\n  Within the Economic Development Initiative grants, there is a grant \nto Arab, AL. The statement inadvertently refers to Arab, IL.\n  Within the Economic Development Initiative grants, the grant to the \ncity of Jackson, MS, should be used for the acquisition and \nrehabilitation of facilities and related improvements for a downtown \nmultimodal transit center in the city of Jackson. This project was \nincorrectly identified in the statement of managers.\n  In addition, with respect to EDI, the intent of the conferees is for \nHUD to use the maximum flexibility in funding the specified EDI grants \nin the statement of managers. HUD is not expected to establish special \nrequirements but should work with the entities specified in each grant \nto ensure that activities can be funded and completed in an expeditious \nmanner.\n  Within the Superfund research appropriation, there is a $2.5 million \nappropriation for the Gulf Coast Hazardous Substance Research Center. \nThis item was included in both the House and Senate versions of the \nbill but not expressly identified in the statement of the managers.\n  Within NASA Science, Aeronautics and Technology is a $2 million \nappropriation for the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, HI. This item was \nincluded in the Senate version of the bill, and the House receded to \nthe Senate in conference, but it was inadvertently not included in the \nstatement of the managers.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the conference report on the fiscal year 1998 appropriations for \nVA, HUD and related agencies. While this bill continues to focus on the \ncommitments this Nation has made to our veterans, and provides for the \nimportant scientific and environmental protection priorities that the \nadministration has put forth, I want to take a moment to express my \nsupport for the steps the conferees have taken to address a serious and \npressing issue facing low income housing assistance in this country.\n  Since its inception, the HUD section 8 housing program has provided \nrental assistance for low-income individuals through project-based \ncontracts as well as vouchers which help to preserve low income housing \navailability. This conference report not only includes funding for the \nrenewal of section 8 contracts, but contains the extremely important \nmark-to-market contract restructuring program which, beginning in 1999, \nwill preserve affordable housing for millions of low-income tenants \nwhile saving the taxpayers billions over time as well. I want to \ncommend my Banking Committee colleagues, particularly Senator Mack who \nauthored the initial section 8 restructuring bill, for their tireless \nefforts to insure that this restructuring program was accepted.\n  Nationwide, section 8 contracts covering 1.8 million assisted units \nare expected to expire in fiscal year 1998. The mark-to-market program \nis a mortgage and rent restructuring program to reduce the costs of \nover-subsidized section 8 multifamily housing properties insured \nthrough the FHA. Under this restructuring program, FHA insured \nproperties with above market rents are eligible for debt restructuring \nto bring the rent levels in line with market rate rent levels, or the \nproject-based rents needed to support operation and maintenance of the \nhousing facilities. The bill directs the HUD Secretary to work with \nState and local housing entities to reduce expiring section 8 contract \ncosts, address troubled projects, and correct management and ownership \ndeficiencies.\n  Because Congress has been unsuccessful in past attempts to move the \ntype of section 8 overhaul necessary for the preservation of low-income \nhousing assistance in this climate of budget cuts, HUD has been \nrenewing all longer term expiring Section 8 contracts with quick-fix, \n1-year contracts. The short-term renewals have led to confusion and \nfear among recipients of housing assistance in my State and across the \ncountry.\n  Many assisted housing residents in South Dakota have been worried for \nseveral months as to whether they will continue to have a roof over \ntheir heads in the coming year. As these residents received notice of \nexpiring short-term and long-term section 8 contracts, families were \nconcerned they would be forced from their homes. Some of these families \nhave spent half their lives in these homes. Many of these residents are \nsenior citizens. Many are widows and widowers. Many are disabled. These \nresidents were told that unless Congress acted, they may be forced from \ntheir two-, three-, and four-bedroom homes or one- and- two-bedroom \napartments and displaced into smaller sized units or homes.\n  For many residents in communities such as Northgate Community Homes \nand Lakota Homes in western South Dakota, this is not an option. \nHousing at every level of affordability is extremely scarce in my rural \nState. After raising families in these homes, senior citizen couples \nliving in two- or three-bedroom homes have been told that they would \nhave to downsize to one-bedroom homes. However, at the Northgate and \nLakota developments, there are no one bedroom options. Thus these \nindividuals and families have feared displacement into the surrounding \narea, with great uncertainty about their futures. I have been informed \nby city officials that the low-income housing stock currently available \nis inadequate to absorb the extra burden of these individuals and \nfamilies forced from their section 8-subsidized homes and complexes.\n\n  Already, many elderly and disabled couples and individuals have left \nthe developments over uncertainty about their homes. They are leaving \nbehind years of improvements they made in their homes, as well as the \ncherished memories of raising families in these communities. They have \nbeen forced out because of confusion and expiring contracts.\n  People like Hazel Holmes of Sturgis, SD, who raised her family in a \nsmall two-bedroom home at Northgate Community Homes have been \nthreatened by uncertainty. Hazel's husband died almost 10 years ago and \nshe has continued to live independently in her home. With the expiring \nsection 8 contract, she became very worried--like her neighbors--that \nshe would be forced to leave her home and the neighbors she cherished. \nCouples like Ruth and Carl Kittleman and Ralph and Dorothy Iverson have \nalready moved from Northgate due to inaction and confusion over this \nissue. Others fret on a daily basis about their futures. Seniors like \nChuck Alberts have persevered each day with the pressure and stress of \nhaving his beloved wife Bev in a nursing home. He should not have the \nadded worry about whether he will be able to stay in his home.\n  These are just a few examples of the serious section 8 scare that \nrecipients of low-income housing assistance have faced in my State. I \nam extremely thankful that throughout consideration of the section 8 \nrestructuring proposal my colleagues took special notice of the unique \nneeds of rural housing contract restructuring. Because of continued \npressure from myself and other rural members, the mark-to-market \nproposal contains language for a more flexible approach to determining \nmarket rents in rural communities--communities where market is \ndifficult to determine, where the project in need of contract \nrestructuring might be the only market for hundreds of miles. The \nbroadened definition of market included in this bill will help to \ninsure appropriate restructuring throughout my State.\n\n[[Page S10747]]\n\n  In rural South Dakota, the 244 project-based section 8 contracts \nprovide 6113 housing units, primarily for elderly South Dakotans. With \nfull funding up to $8.2 billion provided through the fiscal year 1998 \nVA HUD bill, 1070 housing units up for renewal in South Dakota in the \nimmediate future will continue to receive section 8 rental assistance. \nThis volume pales in comparison to the hundreds of thousands of section \n8 housing units in jeopardy in states like New York and Illinois, and I \nappreciate my colleagues' continued sensitivity for awareness of the \nunique needs of rural States.\n  Additionally, I commend my colleagues for relying on the qualified \nexisting State housing finance agencies for the administration of \ncontract restructuring, and on local housing entities for management \nand planning decisions, both subject to the approval of the HUD \nSecretary. With public input at every level, HUD will be able to reign \nin excessive subsidies to appropriate levels so that our Federal \nhousing assistance funds go further, and maintain assistance for low-\nincome individuals for the long term. While the majority of current \nproject-based Section 8 will remain available, local communities will \nbe involved in determining whether tenant-based assistance is more \npractical in certain communities. This freedom at the local level is \nimportant, yet I applaud my colleagues for including distinct \nprotection for elderly and disabled project-based assistance, which \nwill eliminate the type of fear and uncertainty that seniors in my \nstate have been subject to in recent years.\n  Without the commitment to fund section 8 for the coming year, and the \ninclusion of the mark-to-market restructuring program, cuts in other \nprograms for the elderly and disabled, and for preserving available \nlow-income housing would be required. By addressing section 8 \nrestructuring and providing adequate funding, this bill reaffirms the \nCongress' long term commitment to low-income housing assistance.\n  HUD and the States have a daunting task ahead, as thousand of \nprojects under contract throughout the country are pending \nrestructuring. In all cases, I am confident that the involvement and \nparticipation of local ad State housing interests at every level will \nprotect the public interest, and all affected parties, including \ntenants, will have a voice in the future of low-income housing \nassistance.\n  Again, I commend my colleagues for including the section 8 \nrestructuring program in the fiscal year 1998 VA, HUD appropriations \nbill, and I look forward to working toward continued security for low-\nincome housing in the coming years.\n\n\n  funding for the health care needs of veterans in northern california\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to weigh in on the \nprovisions included in the VA-HUD conference report regarding the \nhealth care needs of Northern California's veterans. The conference \nreport provides a total of $70.8 million for renovations to the \nexisting McClellan Air Force Hospital at Mather Air Force Base in \nSacramento, as well as for outpatient clinics in Fairfield, Mare \nIsland, Martinez, Auburn, Chico, Eureka, and Merced. While I applaud \nthis much-needed expansion of services in Northern California, I remain \ndeeply disappointed by Congress' decision not to build a veterans \nhospital at Travis Air Force Base.\n  Since 1991, veterans in Northern California have been waiting for a \nnew hospital to replace the Martinez hospital, which was closed for \nseismic reasons. I made a commitment with Vice President Gore to help \nbring a full veterans hospital to Fairfield, and I have been fighting \nfor 4 years to get this project fully funded. Two previous Congresses \nappropriated funding to construct the Travis VA Hospital.\n  Now, unfortunately, we are turning our back on that commitment. It is \ntruly a sad day when the men and women who have served our country \nwithout question--and who have the right to expect their government to \nfulfill its promises--are simply told ``tough luck.''\n  The fact is that a clear majority in Congress oppose the hospital's \nconstruction. This opposition has only grown stronger after two \nindependent reports--one by the General Accounting Office and one by \nPrice Waterhouse--concluded that the Travis VA hospital was not \njustified. Key Committee chairmen in both the House and Senate have \nmade it clear that Congress will provide no Federal funds for a \nreplacement hospital at Travis.\n  The VA-HUD conference report does appropriate $70.8 million for \nveterans' health care needs in Northern California, including:\n  A sharing agreement between VA and the Department of Defense for 100 \nVA beds at David Grant Medical Center at Travis. These beds will be \nserviced by VA doctors.\n  A new $13.5 million VA clinic, to be built adjacent to David Grant \nMedical Center. This clinic will include emergency room facilities, \nambulatory surgery, mental health, some specialty services, and offices \nfor doctors.\n  Conversion of McClellan Hospital at Mather Air Force Base to a VA \nHospital. This will provide 55 new VA beds.\n  Upgrades to the VA outpatient clinics at Mare Island and Martinez.\n  New outpatient clinics in Auburn, Chico, Eureka and Merced.\n  Contracts with community hospitals in Martinez and Redding.\n  While this plan does not fulfill the promise that the VA made to \nSolano County veterans and does not establish the hospital that \nveterans groups like Operation VA fought so hard for so long to obtain, \nwhen examined in light of the position of current congressional \nleaders, it does provide health care for many veterans who presently \ncannot access the VA system. The new outpatient clinics and additional \nhospital beds will make it far easier for veterans in Northern \nCalifornia to benefit from the VA health system. For the first time, \nvets living along the North Coast and in the Sierra will have real and \nmeaningful access to the VA. They will not have to drive for 4 hours or \nmore for basic care. Their visits to the five new VA outpatient clinics \nwill undoubtedly result in higher utilization of the VA inpatient \nfacilities at Travis and Mather Air Force Bases.\n  I know that the people of Solano County have a lot of unanswered \nquestions about the VA proposal, and I pledge that I will work with \nthem to make sure that VA offers the high quality and accessibility of \ncare that our veterans deserve. I am sure that groups like Operation VA \nwill continue to fight for improved veterans health care in Northern \nCalifornia, and I am proud to join in that fight.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as the ranking Democratic member of the \nHousing subcommittee, I spoke earlier today about very significant \nhousing provisions in the VA-HUD conference agreement. I would like now \nto address some other components of this legislation which I believe to \nbe very important to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the nation.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work of the Chairman of the VA-\nHUD appropriations subcommittee, Senator Bond, and the ranking member, \nSenator Mikulski, in crafting a bill which gives such serious \nconsideration to the needs of the people of Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, the subcommittee has allocated $50 million for the \nclean-up of Boston Harbor, a modest sum given the magnitude of the \nchallenge and the scope and cost of the clean-up project. While the \nresidents of Boston continue to face rising water and sewer rates, \nthese rates are not nearly as high as they would be without the \nassistance of the federal government. The Boston Harbor clean-up \nproject construction will be completed in the next two years. Federal \nassistance in these two remaining years will be crucial to ratepayers \nin the 43 greater Boston area communities who must shoulder most of the \nburden of the $3.5 billion project, which also includes the $2 billion \nrequired for combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and other water \ninfrastructure upgrades.\n  The President s fiscal year 1998 budget provided $200 million over \nthe next two years for the Boston Harbor cleanup--which we anticipate \nwill be the last increment of funding assistance needed from the \nfederal government for this important infrastructure project. Even if \nthis amount is forthcoming, the federal share of the Boston Harbor \nclean-up project still will be well below the federal share provided \nfor many other clean water projects across the country, and is \ncertainly well below the full federal funding called for by\n\n[[Page S10748]]\n\nCongress when it passed the Unfunded Mandates Act in 1995.\n  The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), which is in \ncharge of the Harbor cleanup, has continually worked to reduce project \ncosts. Last year, Mr. President, the EPA approved a revised CSO plan \ndeveloped by the MWRA, with assistance from the state Department of \nEnvironmental Protection and local communities, which is estimated to \nsave ratepayers nearly one billion dollars.\n  During the early 1990s, under the past two Administrations--one \nRepublican and one Democratic--the federal government provided $100 \nmillion per year to assist the citizens of the greater Boston area with \nthis project. In FY 1996, although the President requested $100 million \nand I supported his request, Congress appropriated only $50 million for \nthe cleanup of Boston Harbor. For FY 1997, while the President again \nrequested $100 million, the Congress appropriated $75 million as the \nfederal share. All federal assistance is needed and appreciated, so in \nthat respect, I and the people of the Boston area are grateful for the \n$50 million contained in this year's VA/HUD bill. Nonetheless, we are \ndisappointed the Congress, again, did not provide the amount contained \nin the President's budget.\n  I am extremely pleased that the conference report includes $3 million \nfor water projects for Bristol County, Massachusetts. This amount is \nthe same as the President's fiscal year 1998 budget request and will \ncontinue the support which the Committee provided in the past two \nyears. Both Fall River and New Bedford, two major cities in Bristol \nCounty, are implementing court-ordered construction under the Clean \nWater Act that will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. These urban \nindustrial communities continue to be burdened by high unemployment and \nan ongoing recession.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I am delighted the conference report \nincludes a $1.7 million appropriation for water projects in the South \nEssex Sewage District and surrounding communities such as Lynn, \nGloucester and elsewhere. These communities are struggling with the \nprospect of incurring obligations from $12,000 to $22,000 per household \nto come into compliance with current clean water regulations. Despite \nsuccessful efforts to control costs, the projected costs are still huge \nand growing in the South Essex Sewage District: In 1993 the projected \ncosts were $12.6 million and now, for 1998, the projected costs are \nestimated at $29 million. Federal assistance is critical to ease the \nburden of compliance on these communities and to further the national \ngoal of protecting our environment.\n  Mr. President, the conference report also includes funding of $2 \nmillion for the Tapley Street project in Springfield, Massachusetts, \nwhich involves renovation of a former U.S. Postal Service distribution \nfacility that was purchased by Springfield, in 1986 and is now vacant. \nThis building will make an ideal site for consolidated public works \noperations that are currently scattered among several inadequate \nfacilities, including a condemned yard and a makeshift garage in a \ndifferent town. These deficiencies take a serious toll on city-owned \npublic works equipment, employee morale and efficiencies of city \nservices. The renovation will create 300 construction jobs in an area \nthat has been hard-hit by an economic downturn and defense cut-backs.\n  Mr. President, among the important national program in this \nconference report, several are of particular interest to me. \nYouthBuild, which is funded at $35 million in this conference agreement \nfor fiscal year 1998, is an extremely worthwhile program and a \ndemonstrated success. YouthBuild programs around the country have been \nproviding disadvantaged young people with the opportunity to finish \ntheir education while also providing leadership training and job skills \nthrough work on projects producing affordable housing. I am pleased \nthat the conference report recognizes the need to continue and fund \nthis program. I hope that next year, the amount of funding provided for \nit will be much closer to the $70 million 48 other Senators joined me \nin requesting for fiscal year 1998 in order to enable establishment of \nYouthBuild programs in communities around the country where there \ncurrently is no program.\n  Another important national program in the conference report is the \nHousing Opportunities for People With AIDS program, which is the heart \nof the federal housing response for people living with HIV/AIDS. I am \npleased that HOPWA is funded at $204 million for fiscal year 1998. Mr. \nPresident, ninety percent of the HOPWA funds are distributed by formula \ngrants to states and localities hit hardest by the AIDS epidemic; these \nstates and localities control the use of these funds. Communities may \nuse HOPWA funds to meet whatever housing needs they may have, from \nproviding short-term supportive housing or rental assistance for low-\nincome persons with HIV/AIDS to building community residences or \nproviding coordinated home care services.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) \nprogram and the HOME investment partnership program are arguably the \nmost important federal programs for addressing the economic development \nand affordable housing needs of our nation's communities. I strongly \nurged the conferees to provide funding for both programs at levels at \nleast equal to the FY 1996 appropriation of $4.6 billion for CDBG and \n$1.5 billion for HOME in addition to any Congressional set-asides. Both \nprograms share the important feature of providing local flexibility \nwithin broad federal goals and purposes. The success of both programs \nmerits continued strong federal support for CDBG and HOME even as other \nfederal programs are being cut back. The conference agreement does, in \nfact, include those amounts for the two programs, but I am concerned \nbecause Congressional set-asides will be deducted from those levels. I \nwill continue to support additional funding for both CDBG and HOME in \nfuture appropriations bills.\n  Mr. President, in total, this conference report is a laudable effort \nby the subcommittee and especially its Chairman and ranking member, \nespecially as they continue to struggle with the imperative to achieve \nsignificant spending reductions resulting from the balanced budget the \nCongress approved earlier this year. I appreciate their consideration \nfor the interests of the people of Massachusetts, and am pleased to \nsupport this agreement.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the VA-HUD \nConference Report and to commend the conferees for their work in \nresolving a number of contentious issues with the House.\n  First, I would like to commend the conferees for providing adequate \nfunding to renew all expiring section 8 contracts. In my State of Rhode \nIsland, it is expected that section 8 contracts on 4000 units will \nexpire in fiscal year 1998, and I am pleased that this bill will ensure \nthat all of these contracts are renewed.\n  I would also like to commend the conferees on their successful effort \nto include the section 8 mark-to-market reforms in the conference \nreport. The Senate Banking Committee passed a mark-to-market bill in \nJune that was initially attached to the balanced budget legislation, \nbut was subsequently dropped in conference.\n  The significance of inclusion of the mark-to-market reforms in the \nconference report cannot be overstated because these reforms address an \nincreasingly serious problem, which, if left uncorrected, will threaten \nthe future viability of the section 8 program. The problem I am \nreferring to is the projected increase in section 8 costs as the number \nof expiring section 8 contracts increases in coming years. In fiscal \nyear 1997, approximately $3.6 was provided to renew expiring contracts. \nHowever, absent mark-to-market reforms, the costs of renewing expiring \nsection 8 contracts is expected to increase to $9 billion in fiscal \nyear 1998, and to $18 billion in fiscal year 2002.\n  The reforms included in this bill address this issue by enabling \nlandlords of section 8 properties to restructure their mortgage \ncontracts, which will reduce the escalating costs of the section 8 \nprogram. The reforms will also reduce the subsidy levels that HUD pays \nto landlords for section 8 assistance. Because of the high costs to \nbuild many of these section 8 properties, HUD has been forced in many \ncases to pay subsidies that are in excess of 120 percent of fair market \nrent. In fact, a recent study found that 75 percent of\n\n[[Page S10749]]\n\nHUD's newer assisted housing projects had rents above fair market rent, \nand that 50 percent of this housing had rents greater that 120 percent \nof fair market rent. I am pleased that this bill will address this \nproblem by reducing rents to below fair market rents, or fair market \nrents for most section 8 housing. These changes will produce $500 \nmillion in savings for taxpayers.\n  Also, the mark-to-market provisions will improve the quality of \nsection 8 housing by requiring landlords to evaluate the rehabilitation \nneeds of their property and undertake necessary repairs. For too long, \nmany of our section 8 properties have been in an embarrassing state of \ndisrepair. In a recent study, it was found that 24 percent of the \nsection 8 properties were distressed. Sadly, some of these section 8 \nproperties have become havens for crime and drug activities. I am \npleased that the mark-to-market reforms will begin to attack this \nproblem by requiring landlords to make repairs to their properties and \nbecome more responsible owners.\n  The bill also includes provisions that will enable HUD to screen out \nrogue owners and managers, as well as provide more effective \nenforcement tools that will minimize fraud and abuse of HUD insurance \nand assisted housing programs.\n  Most importantly, the reforms in this bill will require landlords who \nare restructuring their mortgages to maintain their property as section \n8 housing throughout the life of the mortgage. This provision is \nparticularly important in ensuring the preservation of the existing \nstock of section 8 housing.\n  The mark-to-market reforms included in this bill could affect five \nRhode Island housing developments in the near term, and could affect \ncountless other developments in the future, as these provisions are \nfully implemented by HUD. Overall, I believe these reforms will improve \nthe quality of life for tenants of section 8 housing, half of whom are \nseniors, and most of whom are very low income.\n  However, it should be noted that these reforms are not a panacea, and \nwe should be mindful that there is much more to be done. For example, \nwe must take steps to address the ever-worsening affordable housing \ncrisis facing this Nation. Unfortunately, this bill follows HUD \nappropriations bills in recent years and fails to provide funds for new \nsection 8 vouchers. Indeed, such funds have not been appropriated since \n1993.\n  Also, there is the issue of the term of section 8 contracts. In years \npast, section 8 contracts have had terms that ranged from 5 to 40 \nyears, with budget authority being allocated in accordance with the \nterms of the contract. However, because of the adverse budgetary \nimplications of providing long-term contracts, expiring contracts are \nnow being renewed for 1-year terms which require annual appropriations. \nThese 1-year renewals have created a great degree of uncertainty among \ntenants of section 8 housing who are being notified annually by HUD \nthat they may not have housing if Congress fails to provide section 8 \nfunding. In a meeting with constituents, I was informed that some \nseniors who are residents of section 8 housing have suffered strokes \nand other ailments after being notified that their housing was in \njeopardy if Congress failed to appropriate funding for section 8 \nrenewals. Mr. President, this is a very serious issue which must be \naddressed.\n  While HUD is required to notify tenants about contract renewals, \nsomething must be done to ensure that this notification does not \nunnecessarily alarm seniors and other residents of section 8 housing. I \nunderstand that HUD is currently working with a number of tenant groups \nto craft a notification letter that is less alarming than letters in \nyears past. I intend to work with HUD to see that future notices \nprovide adequate information, without unnecessarily alarming section 8 \nresidents.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that this bill increases funding relative \nto fiscal year 1997 for a number of important programs to Rhode Island. \nFor example, funding for the Community Development Block Grant Program, \nwhich provides flexible funding to States and localities for community \ndevelopment initiatives, is increased by $75 million. In fiscal year \n1997, Rhode Island cities used over $20 million in CDBG money to fund \ninitiatives ranging from job training to neighborhood revitalization.\n  In addition, funding for the HOME Program, which is aimed at \nexpanding the supply of affordable housing, is increased by $100 \nmillion over fiscal year 1997. Last year, Rhode Island received $3 \nmillion in HOME funding which was used to provide 283 units of \naffordable housing.\n  Finally, the VA-HUD appropriations bill maintains level funding for a \nnumber of important programs such as the section 202 and section 811 \nprograms that provide housing for the Nation's elderly and disabled. A \nnumber of Rhode Island groups have successfully used section 202 and \nsection 811 grants to build housing for the elderly and disabled, \nameliorating the shortage of affordable housing for these groups in \nRhode Island.\n  In conclusion, I would again like to commend the work of the \nconferees. Their efforts will help preserve and maintain the section 8 \nprogram, in addition to a number of other important housing and \ncommunity development programs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate will act shortly to approve the \nconference agreement on the Fiscal Year 1998 VA-HUD Appropriations Act, \nand I intend to vote for the bill. The bill contains many very \nworthwhile programs that are vital to our Nation's veterans, to the \neconomic development and viability of our cities, to rural communities, \nto environmental preservation and remediation, and for other important \nGovernment functions. The conferees have done an excellent job of \ncrafting a bill that is balanced and fair, while staying within the \nbudgetary allocations for these programs.\n  However, once again, I must highlight the myriad of programs that are \nincluded in this conference agreement that were not considered in the \nnormal budgetary review process. These programs may very well have a \ngreat deal of merit, but unless one is a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, it is nearly impossible to determine what, if any, criteria \nwere applied to determine the relative worthiness of each of the \nearmarks and set-asides in the agreement.\n  For example:\n       $5 million dollars is earmarked for a study on the cost-\n     effectiveness of contracting with local hospitals in east \n     central Florida for the provision of nonemergent inpatient \n     health care needs of veterans. This earmark was contained in \n     the House bill, but I find it difficult to determine from the \n     conference agreement or the House report why such a study is \n     so urgently needed in east Florida, rather than other areas \n     of the country that may be considering this type of \n     contracting.\n       As I noted when the Senate considered the bill, $10 is \n     earmarked for demolition and replacement of the Heritage \n     House in Kansas City, Mo. I still do not understand the \n     urgency of proceeding with this, rather than other similar \n     projects.\n       The bill earmarks $99.6 million for 120 specific Economic \n     Development Initiative grants, as specified in the report \n     language. While both bills contained these kinds of earmarks, \n     my colleagues might be interested to know that the amount \n     earmarked in the conference agreement is more than twice the \n     amount earmarked in the Senate bill which was $40 million. I \n     suspect that a scrupulous comparison of the lists of \n     earmarked projects in the two bills would conclude that every \n     project earmarked in either bill is included in this \n     conference agreement, and then some.\n       The bill contains an earmark of $15 million for the county \n     of San Bernardino, Ca, for neighborhood initiatives. I have \n     not been able to find this earmark in either the House or \n     Senate bill, neither of which contain any explanatory \n     language on this initiative.\n       The bill contains a section which was also included in the \n     Senate bill, transferring a previous $7.1 million earmark for \n     a Kansas City industrial park at 18th Street and Indiana \n     Avenue instead to the rehabilitation and infrastructure \n     development associated with the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum \n     and jazz museum at 18th and Vine.\n       The bill authorizes and appropriates $90 million additional \n     funding for construction of a consolidated EPA research \n     facility at Research Triangle Park, NC, and raises the total \n     construction cap on the project, including a child care \n     center and computer center, to $272.7 million. I recognize \n     that this provision was included in the House bill, but I \n     have not been able to find any justification in the bill or \n     report for earmarking $90 million as part of a nearly $300 \n     million expenditure for this project, versus other worthy \n     projects.\n       The bill retains the earmarks in the Senate bill for a $50 \n     million in grants to Texas, requiring State matching of 20 \n     percent, for improving water and wastewater treatment \n     facilities for the colonias; and a $15 million grant to \n     Alaska to address drinking water and wastewater \n     infrastructure needs.\n\n[[Page S10750]]\n\n       The bill also includes an earmark of $253.1 million for 39 \n     specific wastewater and water treatment facilities and ground \n     water protection infrastructure, earmarked as stated in the \n     report. Again, this type of earmark was included in the \n     Senate and House bills, but the conference earmarked almost \n     three times the amount in the Senate bill.\n  The bill also contains three earmarks which I believe were not \nincluded in either the Senate or House bill:\n       $4 million dollars is earmarked for each of three areas--a \n     native American area in Alaska, a rural area in Iowa, and a \n     rural area in Missouri--for rural economic development \n     grants, to test comprehensive approaches to developing a job \n     base through economic development, developing affordable low- \n     and moderate-income rental and homeownership housing, and \n     increasing the investment of both private and nonprofit \n     capital. While I understand the need to provide funding for \n     rural communities to improve their living standards, housing \n     availability, and the like, I question whether the three \n     areas singled out in this language are the most deserving of \n     4 million dollars each. And I note that the earmarks for \n     rural areas in Iowa and Missouri were not contained in either \n     bill, but were added by the conferees.\n       The bill includes a section, which I have not found in \n     either the Senate or House bill, directing FEMA to make a \n     grant of $1.5 million to resolve issues under the Uniform \n     Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Act of \n     1970 involving the city of Jackson, Ms. Again, the \n     justification provided for this project is sketchy, to say \n     the least.\n       The bill contains a section which cancels the indebtedness \n     of the village of Robbins, IL, for HUD-guaranteed water and \n     sewer bonds, including principal, interest, and any fees and \n     other charges.

Mr. President, this is not an exhaustive list of all the \nearmarks the conferees endorsed. As with previously submitted \nconference agreements, the conferees explicitly state in the report \nthat they endorse all the provisions of the Senate and House reports on \nthe bill, unless they are explicitly contradicted or addressed in the \nconference report. So there are a lot more earmarks that the conferees \nintend that the agencies will adhere to in allocating appropriated \nfunds.\n  Again, Mr. President, I hesitate to say that all of these earmarks \nand set-asides are wasteful, or unnecessary. I want to stress that \nthese projects may very well have merit and may very well be worthy of \ninclusion in this bill.\n  But the process the Congress established for itself, which involves \nboth authorization and appropriation of spending items, is routinely \nignored in the appropriations bills. These unauthorized and locality \nspecific earmarks and add-ons have bypassed the normal agency review \nprocess and have bypassed the authorization process. They have simply \nbeen included in the appropriations bill because a small segment of the \nSenate or House, those who serve on Appropriations Committee, decided \nto include them.\n  Mr. President, the American people deserve to know how their money is \nspent, and why. Millions of dollars will be spent for the projects on \nthe attached list, and I doubt that most Senators know why these \nprojects were chosen for earmarks or set-asides. The American people \ncertainly don't have access to that information.\n  I intend to send a letter to the President asking that he consider \nusing his line-item veto authority to eliminate these spending items \nfrom this bill. That is why we gave him a line-item veto--to eliminate \nwasteful, unnecessary, and low-priority spending. He has already \ndemonstrated his willingness to use the line-item veto, and I hope he \ncontinues to exercise that authority when clearly necessary.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I support the majority of the provisions of \nthis bill, and I intend to vote for it. I am thankful, however, that a \nmechanism now exists that could, if utilized, eliminate the earmarks \nand set-asides in this bill to which I must object.\n\n\n                      particulate matter research\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to mention one issue of \nconcern in the conference report on appropriations for the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. It is in regard to report language on \nthe Particulate Matter Research Program.\n  I agree that we need more research on the sources and the health \neffects of particulate matter and strongly support this bill's \nappropriation of funds for new research. However, I would like to make \nit clear, for the record, that I do not agree with the conference \nreport language that says that ``we do not yet have available \nsufficient facts necessary to proceed with future regulations for a new \nparticulate matter standard.''\n  The EPA standards are based on the best available science regarding \nthe health effects of exposure to particulate matter. Some argue that \nwe should not proceed until we have scientific proof of the exact \nrelationship between exposures to particulate matter, and health \neffects.\n  If we applied that principle in the late 1970's, we would not be \nenjoying the benefits of our current standards which have led to, for \nexample, air pollution from carbon monoxide being reduced by 28 \npercent, from sulphur dioxide 41 percent, and from lead 98 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the conference report to accompany H.R. \n2158 is agreed to.\n  The conference agreement was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues and the \nleadership for allowing us to proceed in a timely fashion on this \nmatter.\n  I have mentioned only briefly my appreciation for the work of my \nranking member, Senator Mikulski. Truly, there is no better person to \nhave in a very complicated matter like this than to have someone of \nSenator Mikulski's ability, perspicacity, and dedication to right and \njustice to carry through on this.\n  I am deeply grateful for her cooperation, the cooperation of the \nleadership on her side, and particularly the leadership of both sides \nof the aisle on the Banking Committee which authorizes housing programs \nwithout which we would not have been able to accomplish mark-to-market. \nSenator Mack and his staff, in particular, Senator D'Amato, Senator \nSarbanes, Senator Kerry have been helpful.\n  I express my thanks to Andy Givens, Stacy Closson, and David Bowers \non the minority. We could not have done this on our side without the \ndedicated work of John Kamarck, Carrie Apostolou, and of Sarah \nHorrigan, who assisted us as representatives on loan from the Office of \nManagement and Budget.\n  Mr. President, again, I express my appreciation to my ranking member.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, now that we have concluded our bill, I \ntoo want to express my appreciation to Senator Bond and his very able \nstaff--I am sorry Sarah Horrigan is not with us, her able cooperation--\nand, to my own staff, Andy Givens, David Bowers, and Stacy Closson.\n  I wish all bills could move as quickly and as rigorously and \nthoroughly as ours did. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 7, 1997.)\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconference report be considered read, and that there be 20 minutes \nequally divided; that, following the conclusion or yielding back of the \ntime, the conference report be agreed to and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, all without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n[[Page S10752]]\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased to present the conference \nreport on the fiscal year 1998 Department of Transportation and related \nagencies appropriations bill. This bill is very similar to the \ntransportation appropriations bill that the Senate approved 98 to 1 on \nJuly 30. It provides the highest level of funding for Federal-aid \nhighways in history--$22.9 billion. That's slightly less than the \namount we had included in the Senate bill because, in conference, we \nagreed to fund some other House priorities, but it's still a record \nlevel.\n  The actual distribution of those funds among the States will depend \non reauthorization of ISTEA--the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991--which has provided authorization for Federal \nsurface transportation programs for the past 6 years and which expired \nat the end of fiscal year 1997. But this increase of almost $3 billion \nover fiscal year 1997 will almost certainly mean more Federal highway \nspending for each State.\n  The conference report also includes $300 million for the Appalachian \nDevelopment Highway System as proposed by the Senate. This is a \ndownpayment toward meeting the Federal Government's commitment to \ncompleting that System.\n  The bill includes $4.7 billion for transit grants, including $200 \nmillion for Washington Metro. I ask unanimous consent that a table \nwhich shows the distribution of these funds under current law be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      FISCAL YEAR 1998 DISTRIBUTION OF APPROPRIATED TRANSIT FORMULA AND DISCRETIONARY PROGRAM FUNDS BY

 Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the bill also provides $1.7 billion for \nairport improvement grants, which is $700 million more than the \nadministration requested. In total, this bill contains $30.1 billion \nfor investment in infrastructure that the public uses, that is, \nhighways, transit, airports, and railroads. That represents an 8-\npercent increase over the administration's request.\n  This legislation will improve safety: It provides an 11-percent \nincrease in funds to improve highway safety and will permit FAA to hire \nan additional 235 aviation safety inspectors and 500 air traffic \ncontrollers.\n  Major changes in the bill as a result of conference deliberations \ninclude the addition of $150 million in transit operating assistance \nand reductions of less than 1 percent in the multi-billion dollar FAA \nand Coast Guard operating accounts.\n  The Senate accommodated requests we received from Senators as fully \nas we could. In conference, of course, we had to accommodate requests \nfrom Members of both the Senate and House with no increase in funds \nover the Senate bill to cover these requests. That was a very difficult \nprocess. We tried to be fair and balanced in our treatment of Members' \nrequests.\n  I want to reiterate a point I made when I brought the Senate bill to \nthe floor in July. Many Senators wanted funds for highway projects of \nspecial interest to them and their States. This year, ISTEA \nreauthorization is providing a vehicle for special project funding, \nespecially in the House where\n\n[[Page S10753]]\n\nthere is very active consideration of such funding. I assure my \ncolleagues that I believe that the Congress has at least as legitimate \na role in designating funding for specific highway projects as it does \nin designating which transit projects will be funded. I intend to \nreview the situation after enactment of ISTEA reauthorization \nlegislation and to work with my Senate and House colleagues in the year \nahead to ensure that we have an opportunity to designate funding for \nhighway projects of special interest to our States and communities.\n  There are a great number of people to thank for getting this bill \ncompleted. I want to single out a few for special thanks for all their \nefforts.\n  First, the chairman, my good friend from Alaska. I know he wanted to \nmove this bill along promptly, but he was patient and allowed me to \nwork out the issues that were holding up conference and was always \nwilling to lend his compelling voice to support the Senate position in \nour discussions with the House.\n  The majority leader as well played a critical role in the \nnegotiations with the House. I want to thank him for his leadership, \nadvice, and guidance, as well as for his personal involvement on this \nbill.\n  I want to thank my distinguished ranking member on the subcommittee, \nSenator Lautenberg, for his part in moving the process forward. We \ndon't always take the same position on transportation issues or funding \npriorities, but he is always a strong advocate for meeting the \ntransportation priorities of the Northeast and presents a perspective \non this bill that comes from a great deal of hands-on experience with \ntransportation issues. In addition, this bill has provided an \nopportunity for me to work closely with the distinguished ranking \nmember of the full committee, Senator Byrd. One of the common \npriorities Senator Byrd and I share in the Transportation \nappropriations bill is the completion of the Appalachian Development \nHighway System. Through his leadership and support, we have been able \nto provide substantial support for meeting that priority.\n\n  I also want to thank the other members of the subcommittee for their \nefforts and the efforts of their staffs in support of the Senate's \nposition during the conference. This subcommittee works well together, \nand I am blessed with the luxury of having subcommittee members who \ntake transportation issues very seriously and are quick to let me know \nof their positions on issues. In particular, I want to commend the \nsenior Senator from Missouri, my good friend, Senator Kit Bond. Senator \nBond has been a major force in transportation funding issues this year \nas he has the uncommon responsibilities of sitting on the Budget \nCommittee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, and on the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Transportation. He was a primary \nadvocate for higher highway funding during the budget process; he is a \nmajor force in the Senate consideration of reauthorization legislation, \nand is one of the most thoughtful and effective members of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee. Senator Bond can be a \ndogged advocate for issues of interest to the Show Me State. He was in \na position to put passage of the Transportation appropriations bill in \njeopardy if his legitimate interest in a matter before the conference \nwas not met. In a display of the statesmanship that shows me why he is \nsuch an effective Senator, he refused to hold the bill up--instead, he \nsought a creative way of meeting both the interests of his State and \nthe needs of the Congress to move this legislation along. I pledge to \nhim here that I will work with him to ensure the satisfactory \nresolution of this issue.\n  In addition, I want to thank a few staff members who worked hard to \nput this bill together. The staff director of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, Steve Cortese played a critical role in resolving issues \nbetween the House and the Senate so that we could have this conference \nreport before the Senate today. His counterpart on the House side, Jim \nDyer, as well, deserves note and a word of thanks for his efforts to \nthat end. Although they work in different bodies, these two \nprofessionals work together well and are a credit to the appropriations \nprocess and the Congress. Further, the subcommittee staff, Joyce Rose, \nReid Cavnar, Wally Burnett, and for a short time, George McDonald, as \nwell as my legislative director Kathy Casey and Chief of Staff Tom \nYoung, worked long and hard to put this bill together and I thank them. \nIn addition, Jim English, Peter Rogoff, Peter Neffenger, Carole \nGeagley, and Mike Brennan have helped make this a truly bipartisan \nbill, and I thank them.\n  I am proud of what we have been able to accomplish in this bill. It \nwill benefit all Americans as it helps improve transportation services \nin this country so that the economy and personal mobility are better \nserved.\n  I now turn to my distinguished ranking member from New Jersey, \nSenator Lautenberg, who has worked with me in a bipartisan spirit to \nproduce this bill.\n  Mr. President, I believe overall that this is a good transportation \nappropriations bill. It is not perfect. Nothing is perfect. But Senator \nLautenberg, my colleague from New Jersey, former chairman, now the \nranking member of the committee, worked diligently together with our \nstaffs to put this bill together. We had protracted discussions with \nthe House, and at the end of the day we are here with a completed \nconference report, one which I believe that most people in this body \ncan support.\n  I want to take a minute and thank my staff director, Wally Burnett, \nfor all the work that he has put into this night and day. He knows the \nsubject. He has been very, very diligent and the bill reflects that \ndiligence.\n  I also want to thank my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, for the work \nand the knowledge that he has of these transportation issues. Knowledge \nthat he is beginning to share with me as time goes on. And, to his \nstaff director, Peter Rogoff, I thank you for cooperating with us on so \nmany of the issues. And, at the end of the day, at the end of the week, \nand at the end of this conference we are here.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I, too, view this report as does my \nfriend and colleague and chairman of the subcommittee. It reflects what \nI think is a good outcome after being forced to work with less \nresources than I would like to see devoted to transportation. But that \nis life in the present fiscal climate and consistent with our \ndetermination to have a balanced budget by 2002. As a matter of fact, \nthe news is fairly good on that front. We may actually achieve that \nbalance before then. But, meanwhile, we are taking the appropriate \nsteps to our transportation bill to conform with the responsibility \nthat we have undertaken as a result of the budget agreement. We spent a \nlot of time and energy trying to ensure that transportation would be \ntreated as the appropriate priority, as we see it. And it has some very \npositive results.\n  The Coast Guard is going to get a 12.7 percent boost so that it can \ncontinue to execute its many essential missions.\n  Funding for FAA will increase by almost 10 percent. Within that \namount, we have rejected the proposal by the administration to cut \nairport improvement grants by more than 33 percent. Instead, we have \nprovided an increase for airport grants of more than 16 percent.\n  Funding for Federal-aid highways went to a historically high level of \n$21.5 billion. This increased funding will be especially critical as we \naddress the many vexing challenges that currently surround the \nreauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \nAct, or ISTEA, or ISTEA II, or whatever the name is that we are going \nto give the next 6-year or 5-year program.\n  Funding for formula assistance for the Nation's transit systems will \nincrease by 16.3 percent. I want to point out that in my view this \nincludes a balanced approach in addressing the needs of all of our \nStates in all transportation modes.\n  When the bill was first marked up, I voiced concern that while we \nwere providing a much needed increase in funding for highways, the \nneeds of the transit agencies were not getting appropriate attention.\n  I am pleased to say that between the amendment I offered during full \ncommittee consideration of the bill and the\n\n[[Page S10754]]\n\nfinal deliberations of the conference committee, the increase in \nformula funding for transit was brought to a level comparable with the \nincreases in formula funding provided for other infrastructure \ninvestment programs in the bill.\n  Moreover, I am pleased that the conference agreement includes my \namendment to provide greater flexibility to all transit agencies, large \nand small, in the use of the Federal transit formula funds.\n  Mr. President, all in all, as I said, I think it is a good outcome.\n  The funding level for Amtrak is one that concerns me because Amtrak \nplays such an important part in the transportation of people throughout \nthe Northeast corridor--and other parts of the country as well but \npredominantly in the Northeast corridor, and were we not to have \nAmtrak, which could be the outcome if we failed to fund it properly, we \nwould need 10,000 additional flights of 737's a year between Boston and \nWashington and New York to accommodate the requirements for \ntransportation. So that certainly does not look to be an outcome we can \ntolerate. But nevertheless the Congress has insisted on cutting \nAmtrak's operating subsidy at a much faster rate than they say they can \nabsorb.\n  Almost 3 years ago, the leadership of Amtrak developed an operating \nplan to reduce its dependency on Federal operating support. Their plan \ncalled for reduced appropriations in each and every year for 6 years. \nUnfortunately, for the last 2 years, the Congress has insisted on \ncutting Amtrak's operating subsidy at a much faster rate than Amtrak \nsaid it could absorb. Their financial status, therefore, is in dire \nstraits.\n\n  The bill initially laid down proposed some truly severe cuts, some of \nwhich could certainly put Amtrak into bankruptcy. But the subcommittee \namended the funding level for Amtrak's operations account in the \nsubcommittee and the full committee to get that level up to $344 \nmillion, which was the level requested by the administration.\n  Also, Chairman Shelby agreed to hold a special hearing of the \nsubcommittee to take a fresh look at Amtrak's operating needs. I am \npleased to say that the final conference agreement includes the full \n$344 million for Amtrak's operations as passed by the Senate. It also \nincludes needed boosts in Amtrak's critical capital accounts, and it \nwill only be through this kind of capital investment that Amtrak can \none day become free of Federal operating subsidies, which I, and I am \nsure all of us here, would like to see.\n  However, we are not, I warn all Members, ``out of the woods'' with \nAmtrak. Amtrak has to gain access to more than $2 billion which was \nprovided in the recently enacted tax bill so it can make the kind of \ncapital investments that will bring us a real first-class passenger \nrailroad, and we need to find a mechanism to do that without exacting \npunitive measures against the hard-working employees at Amtrak.\n  On another issue, more parochial perhaps, Mr. President, I call \nattention to that portion of the conference agreement which pertains to \nthe closure of Bader Field Airport in Atlantic City, NJ. The conferees \ncarefully reviewed the statutory provisions pertaining to Bader Field \nas well as another airport that deserves to be closed. And after \ncareful review, it was determined that statutory language was not \nnecessary for the FAA to make the necessary findings. So I am pleased \nthat the conference agreement continues our progress toward the closure \nof these airports as soon as possible.\n  I want to take a minute, Mr. President, to thank my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Shelby, for his ability to work closely with others \nto try to resolve disputes and see if we could do the best possible job \nwith the resources that were available to us, and I think he has done \njust that. It was a pleasure working with him. As Senator Shelby noted, \nI was once the chairman of the committee, and I promised that should I \nbecome chairman again I would work with Senator Shelby just as \ncarefully and courteously as he has worked with me.\n  He has been consistently fair-minded in the distribution of funds \nbetween transportation modes and between projects. He has sought to \naccommodate the priorities of all Members of the Senate. That has been \nthe longstanding tradition in the Transportation Subcommittee and it \ncontinues to be the tradition under Senator Shelby's leadership.\n  I close by thanking my staff also, Peter Rogoff, and thank Senator \nShelby's chief of staff, Tom Young, and Wally Burnett. It is a pleasure \ngetting this done, and I am pleased to see that we have come fairly \nclose to the beginning of the fiscal year in having a transportation \nbill which can take care of our needs for next year.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nagreement accompanying H.R. 2169, the Department of Transportation and \nrelated agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998.\n  I congratulate the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, \nSenator Shelby, for completing his first bill as chairman of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee. I commend the chairman for \nbringing the Senate a balanced bill.\n  As all members know, transportation spending was a priority area \nwithin the bipartisan budget agreement. With passage of this bill, we \nbegin to increase funding for our Nation's infrastructure as we \npromised during negotiations on the balanced budget agreement.\n  The conference agreement provides $13.1 billion budget authority [BA] \nand $13.5 billion in new outlays to fund the programs of the Department \nof Transportation, including Federal-aid highways, mass transit, \naviation activities, the U.S. Coast Guard, and transportation safety \nagencies.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other adjustments \nare taken into account, the bill totals $13.1 billion in budget \nauthority and $37.9 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998.\n  The reported bill is $0.1 billion in budget authority below the \nsubcommittee's revised section 302(b) allocation, and at the \nsubcommittee's allocation for outlays.\n  The spending is less than $0.1 billion in budget authority below the \nPresident's fiscal year 1998 budget request for the subcommittee, and \n$0.4 billion in outlays above the President's request.\n  Mr. President, it is my pleasure to serve on the subcommittee and to \nbe a part of the Conference Committee.\n  I support the conference agreement, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n             H.R. 2169, TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS, 1998, SPENDING COMPARISONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n                                   [Fiscal Year 1998, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 Defense  Nondefense   Crime  Mandatory   Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference report:\n  Budget authority.............................................      300     12,111   ......       698    13,109\n  Outlays......................................................      299     36,905   ......       665    37,869\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.............................................      300     12,211   ......       698    13,209\n  Outlays......................................................      299     36,905   ......       665    37,869\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.............................................      300     12,173   ......       698    13,171\n  Outlays......................................................      299     36,502   ......       665    37,466\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.............................................      300     12,217   ......       698    13,215\n  Outlays......................................................      299     36,855   ......       665    37,819\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.............................................  .......     12,157   ......       698    12,855\n  Outlays......................................................       59     36,892   ......       665    37,616\n \n                                         CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.............................................  .......       -100   ......  .........     -100\n  Outlays......................................................  .......  ..........  ......  .........  .......\nPresident's request\n  Budget authority.............................................  .......        -62   ......  .........      -62\n  Outlays......................................................  .......        403   ......  .........      403\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.............................................  .......       -106   ......  .........     -106\n  Outlays......................................................  .......         50   ......  .........       50\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.............................................      300        -46   ......  .........      254\n  Outlays......................................................      240         13   ......  .........     253\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to total due to rounding. Totals adjusted for consistency with current scorekeeping\n  conventions.\n \n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the fiscal year 1998 \nDepartment of Transportation conference report. Due to a provision \nadded in conference, the Treasury Department will be forced to reduce \nthe Amtrak tax refund by $200 million. This conference report violates \nthe budget agreement, amends the recently enacted tax bill, and \nunnecessarily straps Amtrak as it is facing a possible strike in the \nnext few weeks.\n   Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a \nstrong Amtrak supporter, I find this action by the Appropriations \nCommittee to be outrageous.\n  As my colleagues in the Senate know, one of my top priorities has \nbeen\n\n[[Page S10755]]\n\nto create a dedicated source of capital funding for Amtrak. Congress \nhas voted time and time again that capital funding is critical to \nAmtrak's survival. For that reason, a tax provision was included in the \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997 to provide Amtrak with a tax refund of $2.3 \nbillion for capital expenses.\n  The bottom line is Amtrak desperately needs capital. According to \nGAO, Amtrak must have the capital funding that was provided in the \nTaxpayer Relief Act as well as what is provided through the normal \nappropriation's process. Without both Amtrak faces bankruptcy.\n  The language the conferees included in the fiscal year 1998 \nDepartment of Transportation conference report would undermine the \nefforts Congress has already taken to give Amtrak the capital funding \nit needs to survive.\n   Mr. President, I fully intend to reverse this provision as soon as \nthe next opportunity arises. It is a clear violation of the spirit and \nintent of the budget agreement and of the tax bill signed into law in \nAugust. If this is not reversed, I believe this provision may be the \nfinal straw that finally breaks the financial back of Amtrak.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate will vote today to adopt the \nconference agreement on the fiscal year 1998 transportation \nappropriations bill. As chairman of the Commerce Committee, I intend to \nsupport the measure, because it contains the funding for vitally \nimportant transportation programs.\n  However, once again, I am compelled to note the various earmarks and \nset-aside and low priority spending that is included in this package.\n  This conference agreement contains legislation mandating specific \nactions and spending that the Administration either does not support or \ndid not request. For instance:\n  The bill directs the Secretary of the Navy to transfer the USNS \nEDENTON (ATS-1), which is currently in inactive status, to the Coast \nGuard.\n  The legislation earmarks Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] \nOperations funds and mandates that the FAA provide personnel at Dutch \nHarbor, AK, to provide weather and runway observations.\n  The conference report goes on to highlight millions of dollars that \nexceed the Administration's request, and that are targeted for specific \nprojects.\n  $8.4 million, for instance, is set aside for the relocation of Coast \nGuard Station New Orleans, with $3 million of that amount directed to \nimprove the adjacent waterway. Incidentally, I understand that the \nadjacent waterway improvements are aimed primarily at benefitting \nprivate users of the waterway, not the Coast Guard.\n  The conference report earmarks all intelligent transportation \noperational test funds--nearly $84 million--for 41 specific projects, \neven though the Administration requested zero funds for intelligent \ntransportation operational tests.\n  The report earmarks all but $3 million of the $400 million provided \nfor the discretionary bus and bus-related facilities program.\n  It earmarks all of the $800 million provided for the discretionary \nfixed guide way modernization program.\n  Although the legislation does not mandate certain airport grants, the \nconference report and the Senate report, in particular, urge priority \nconsideration for funding for several specific airport development \nprojects. I urge the Administration to adhere to its own established \nsafety and capacity-enhancement criteria in allocating discretionary \nairport grants and letters of intent.\n  The FAA is bound to receive a great deal of guidance in this respect. \nHowever, if it becomes evident that discretionary grants are being used \nto satisfy political whims rather than the national interest, I pledge \nto review the FAA's discretionary authority in the context of the FAA \nreauthorization bill next year.\n  As I have said many times before, my criticism of this earmarking \nprocess should not be interpreted as a criticism of each of these \nprojects. I recognize that these projects may be beneficial, and that \nseveral would merit full funding in an objective, competitive \nallocation process. Nevertheless, Congress needs to give that process a \nchance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire list of \nearmarked transportation projects be printed in the Record. As on prior \noccasions, I plan to write to the President with a list of projects for \nhim to consider in exercising his line item veto authority.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Objectionable Provisions in H.R. 2169, Conference Agreement on Fisal \n                Year 1998 Transportation Appropriations\n\n\n                              COAST GUARD\n\n                             Bill language\n\n       Withholds $34.3 million in Coast Guard operating expenses \n     unless the Director, Office of National Drug Control Policy \n     (ONDCP) approves the Coast Guard's planned drug interdiction \n     activities to be funded by that $34.3 million. Allows ONDCP \n     to transfer some or all of those funds to other agencies. The \n     Administration request included no such restriction on Coast \n     Guard.\n       Directs the Secretary of the Navy to transfer the USNS \n     EDENTON (ATS-1), which is currently in inactive status, to \n     the Coast Guard. The Administration request did not include \n     this provision.\n\n                           Conference Report\n\n       Earmarks $10.0 million to convert the USNS EDENTON (ATS-1) \n     to a flight deck equipped Coast Guard cutter. This provision \n     was not included in the Administration's budget request.\n       Earmarks $4.0 million to renovate a hanger at the Coast \n     Guard Kodiak, AK facility. This provision was not included in \n     the Administration's budget request.\n       Provides $8.4 million in FY 1998 for the relocation of \n     Coast Guard Station New Orleans and directs that $3.0 million \n     of that amount be used to improve the adjacent waterway \n     (including dredging, bulkhead repair, and bulkhead \n     replacement). The Administration requested $4.2 million in FY \n     1998 to start the relocation project. However, the adjacent \n     waterway improvements funded by the Conference Report were \n     not included in the Administration's request for this project \n     and are primarily aimed at benefitting private users of the \n     waterway, not the Coast Guard.\n       Encourages the Coast Guard to maintain a seasonal (April \n     15, 1998 to October 15, 1998) air facility at the Hampton, NY \n     Air National Guard facility at Coast Guard expense. The \n     Administration request did not include this provision. The \n     Coast Guard previously announced plans to close its air \n     stations in Cape May, NJ and Brooklyn, NY and replace them \n     with an air station in Atlantic City, NJ as a cost-savings \n     measure.\n\n\n                                AVIATION\n\n                             Bill Language\n\n       The bill includes legislative language reauthorizing the \n     Aviation Insurance Program. The authorizing committees in \n     both the House of Representatives and the Senate have \n     approved reauthorization bills that make minor modifications \n     to the program. Floor action in the House and Senate is \n     imminent. (Title I)\n       The legislation earmarks Federal Aviation Administration \n     (FAA) Operations funds and mandates that the FAA provide \n     personnel at Dutch Harbor (AK) to provide real-time weather \n     and runway observation and other such functions to help \n     ensure the safety of aviation operations. (Title III, Sec. \n     335)\n\n                           Conference Report\n\n       The conference report earmarks $400,000 from the FAA \n     Operations account for satellite communications in Anchorage \n     (AK), per Senate direction.\n       The conference report earmarks $400,000 from the FAA \n     Operations account for a human intervention and motivation \n     study, per Senate direction.\n       The conference report directs the FAA to study air traffic \n     in New Bern (NC), Hickory (NC) and Salisbury/Wicomico County \n     Airport (MD), and to open contract towers at those airports \n     in FY 1998 if the studies show that these airports (1) meet \n     the existing benefit-cost criteria for contract air traffic \n     control towers, or (2) are justified after consideration of \n     cost-sharing agreements with non-federal parties.\n       The report adopts the House recommendation of $15,000,000 \n     for aeronautical data link applications. The Administration \n     requested no funds for this category.\n       Per the House direction, the conference report earmarked \n     $45,440,000 for air traffic management, $27,200,000 above the \n     Administration request.\n       The conference report included $24,400,000 for the weather \n     and radar processor program, in line with the House \n     recommendation. The Administration did not request funds for \n     this program.\n       Like the House recommendation, the conference report \n     earmarks $970,000 for innovative infrared deicing technology. \n     There was no Administration request for these funds.\n       The conference report provides $152,830,000 for continued \n     development of the GPS wide area augmentation system, as \n     proposed by the Senate. This amount is $51,300,000 above the \n     Administration request.\n       The conference report earmarks $3,140,000 for the expansion \n     and relocation of remote communications facilities. The \n     Senate proposed this amount, which is $1,700,000 above the \n     Administration recommendation.\n       The conference report incorporates the House recommendation \n     of $6,700,000 for the Omega termination cost. There was no \n     budget request for this item.\n\n[[Page S10756]]\n\n       The conference report includes $67,000,000 for the \n     replacement of terminal air traffic control facilities. Both \n     the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended \n     more than the $62,000,000 budget request.\n       As did the House, the conference report allocates \n     $27,600,000 for construction of the Potomac Metroplex, \n     instead of the budget request of $2,600,000.\n       The conference report sets aside $20,000,000 for the \n     Atlanta Metroplex, $4,400,000 more than the Administration \n     requested, but $5,400,000 less than the House proposed.\n       The conference report earmarks $7,500,000 for airport \n     surface detection equipment (ASDE-3). The Administration made \n     no budget request, although the House recommended $8,600,000.\n       The conference report earmarks $11,600,000 for the airport \n     movement area safety system (AMASS), which is below the House \n     recommendation, but well above the Administration budget \n     request of zero.\n       The conference agreement includes funds of $10,000,000 \n     above the budget request, per the Senate, for the acquisition \n     of additional automated surface observing systems.\n       At the direction of the House, the conference report \n     earmarks $3,000,000 for LORAN-C upgrades, although the \n     Administration did not make a request for this budget item.\n       The Administration requested no funds for precision \n     approach path indicators. The conference agreement earmarks \n     $3,000,000, which is less than both the House and Senate \n     recommendations.\n       Per Senate direction, the conference report earmarks \n     $3,500,000 for anemometers and related equipment in Juneau \n     (AK). The Administration did not include a budget request for \n     this item.\n       The conference agreement allocated $19,200,000 for \n     sustaining and supporting electrical power systems, \n     $3,000,000 above the Administration request, but less than \n     the Senate recommendation.\n       In line with the House recommendation, the report earmarks \n     $4,000,000 for a display system replacement simulator at the \n     Mid-America Aviation Resource Consortium (MN).\n       The conference report sets aside $12,100,000 of the ``ARTCC \n     building/plant improvements'' funds for relocation of the \n     Honolulu center/radar approach control, as proposed by the \n     Senate.\n       The conference report directs the FAA to conduct a study to \n     determine if the air traffic control tower at the Tucson \n     International Airport needs to be relocated to ensure the \n     continued safety of flight operations at this airport.\n       In the Research, Engineering, and Development account, the \n     conference report sets aside $21,258,000 for capacity and air \n     traffic management technology, above the Administration \n     request of $9,108,000.\n       The conference report provides $15,300,000 for weather \n     research, above the Administration request of $3,982,000. The \n     conferees further directed that $500,000 of these funds be \n     allocated to the Center for Wind, Ice and Fog (NH), \n     $3,000,000 to Project SOCRATES, and $11,000,000 to the \n     National Center for Atmospheric Research.\n       The conference report earmarks $49,202,000 for aircraft \n     safety technology, in excess of the Administration request of \n     $26,625,000. The conferees further directed that of the \n     $21,540,000 provided for ``aging aircraft,'' $3,000,000 is to \n     go for direct support of the Aging Aircraft Nondestructive \n     Inspection Validation Center; $1,000,000 for aging aircraft-\n     related activities at the Center for Aviation Systems \n     Reliability; $6,000,000 for the Airworthiness Assurance \n     Center of Excellence; $1,500,000 to conduct research at the \n     Center for Intelligent Aviation Technologies; and $4,400,000 \n     to further engine titanium component inspection.\n       The conference report earmarks $26,550,000, above the \n     Administration request of $10,737,000, for human factors and \n     aviation medicine.

Mr. President, I would like to express my support for the \nconference agreement on H.R. 2169, the Transportation Appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 1998. I would like to express particular gratitude \nto the diligent efforts of Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey who has a \nkeen understanding of the need to modernize and upgrade the aging \ntransportation infrastructure of the congested Northeast. I also want \nto thank Senator Shelby of Alabama for his leadership this year on \ntransportation matters.\n  This bill is very important for Massachusetts and for the Nation. For \nMassachusetts, it contains funding for several important projects. I am \nvery pleased that the conference report provides $3 million for the \nWorcester Union Station Intermodal Center. This facility, which has \nbeen recognized as a model for both urban revitalization and \ntransportation planning, will be situated in a newly renovated Union \nStation and will provide convenient regional access to commuter rail, \nAmtrak, inter-city and intra-city buses, taxis, airport shuttles, bikes \nand private passenger vehicles for Worcester County's 710,000 \nresidents.\n  I am also pleased that the report provides continued funding--$1 \nmillion in fiscal year 1998--for the restoration of historic Union \nStation in Springfield, MA, as an active intermodal center. Once \nrestored, Springfield Union Station will provide an essential gateway \nto the Pioneer Valley to alleviate congestion and better serve the \nlocal and interstate bus and Amtrak passenger traffic which is growing \nby 9 percent annually. This facility will also help connect the city's \ntwo largest job districts which are currently divided by disjointed \ntraffic and development patterns. With the Federal funds provided last \nyear and over $1 million in local funds, the city has quickly moved \nforward on project planning, land assembly and demolition of a \ndeteriorated adjacent building. Indeed, the State legislature has \napproved $10 million to date for this important project.\n  I welcome the Conference Committee's support in the form of $2 \nmillion in funding for the Urban Ring transit system in the Boston \nregion. The need for such a system arises from the strongly radial \nstructure of Greater Boston's existing transit system. It consists of \nspokes emanating from the downtown core to neighborhoods of Boston and \ncities and towns throughout eastern Massachusetts. With an Urban Ring \ntransit route, Massachusetts will begin to link these spokes in an arc \naround downtown, providing easier access to centers of economic growth \noutside the core and reducing congestion in the subway system by \nallowing commuters the opportunity to travel between home and workplace \nwithout the necessity of traveling into the downtown area and back out \nagain.\n  I appreciate the Conference Committee's continued strong support for \nthe South Boston Piers Transitway project, a vital element in the \nCommonwealth's State Implementation Plan required under the Clean Air \nAct. The Transitway, expected to carry approximately 6.4 million riders \nannually, will be integrated with the extensive network of transit, \ncommuter rail, and bus services now available at Boston's South Station \nand will catalyze the development of the South Boston Piers area which \nhas the highest potential for development and job creation in the City \nof Boston.\n  I'm also pleased that the conference report includes $875,000 for the \nFranklin County Visitors Information System. In western Massachusetts, \nmany small, renowned cultural and historical museums and attractions \nare spread over distances where the lack of an effective road system \nhinders potential visitors. The Franklin County Chamber of Commerce, in \nconjunction with the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, hopes to \ndevelop a guidance system that makes use of the latest interactive \nkiosk technologies and mapping capabilities simultaneously to improve \nthe road network for western Massachusetts and enhance access to the \nmultiplicity of community resources.\n  I support the Conference Committee's decision to provide greater \nfunding for Amtrak than the amount of funding in the Senate bill. \nHowever, it is my hope that the Senate and the House will devote \nextraordinary efforts over the next few weeks to enact Amtrak \nreauthorization legislation so that the capital funding set aside \nduring budget reconciliation can be released and spent. Only then will \nAmtrak receive sufficient capital funding over the next several years. \nIt is no secret that the year-to-year battles over\n\n[[Page S10758]]\n\ncapital funding for Amtrak have greatly inhibited Amtrak's ability to \noperate an efficient, and financially stable national passenger rail \nservice. Congress must act on this matter as soon as possible.\n  I also support the Conference Committee's decision to provide $4.8 \nbillion in Federal transit assistance. Though ISTEA has not yet been \nreauthorized, I strongly believe that making investment in public \ntransportation a top priority will bear rich economic, social and \nenvironmental dividends for the Nation.\n  The Conference Committee is to be commended for the fiscal year 1998 \nCoast Guard budget. This budget represents a significant increase from \nfiscal year 1997 funding and certainly represents Federal dollars well \nspent. But I must add that my enthusiasm is somewhat tempered by my \ndeep concern regarding the current state of resource allocation and \nusage within the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard's responsibilities have \ngrown with the many new fisheries enforcement requirements that came \nwith the passage of the Sustainable Fisheries Act last year and \ncontinuing pressure in the constant battle in the war on drugs. I am \nconcerned that, in the effort to cover all of these responsibilities, \nwe may be making tradeoffs that may come back to haunt us later.\n  As you well know, I represent a coastal State that has a 200-year-\nplus history of reliance on the Coast Guard. For that reason, I \nprobably have a better understanding than many Senators of the value of \nthe Coast Guard to the citizens of our Nation that make a living in the \ncoastal regions or on the high seas. In fact, the Massachusetts coastal \nzone contributes 53.3 percent, or $70.7 billion, to the state economy. \nFurther, there are over 10,000 fishing families in New England that \ndepend on the Coast Guard for their safety and are in fact viewed as \ntheir ``real'' guardian angels. One of many concerns that I have for \nthese families is that with the recent catastrophic failure of the New \nEngland groundfish fishery that our fishermen are traveling further, in \nrougher weather, to catch fewer fish. Additionally, because of the \npersonal financial hardship that has resulted from the collapse of the \nfishery, I fear that they are cutting corners to save a dollar such as \nnot outfitting their boats and crews with the vital safety equipment \nthat are required by law. I am concerned that we may cutting corners at \ntheir expense.\n  We may be at a point where we need to stop and reassess the current \ncondition of the Coast Guard. As we continue to examine the Federal \nbudget for those areas where cost savings can be achieved, we need to \nrealize that there exists a point beyond which most Americans are not \nwilling to go in order to save a dollar, and I believe we are at a \npoint where we need to take a strategic look at the ability of the \nCoast Guard to continue to meet the demands of the American public into \nthe 21st century.\n  In sum, taking the concerns I have voiced into account, I support \nthis bill because it approaches transportation spending from a national \nperspective, and it strives to maintain and improve the transportation \ninfrastructure that is so vital to the economic well-being of our \nNation. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting it. Thank you, \nMr. President.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I have an agreement we have worked on \nwhich basically says that on some appropriate vehicle in the future I \nwill work with Chairman Stevens and other members to include a \ntechnical correction to this conference report to accomplish the \nfollowing:\n  At section 337(c) we will insert, after the words: ``House and Senate \nCommittees on Appropriations,'' ``and the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.''\n  I am doing this at the suggestion of Senator Hutchison from Texas, \nand we have agreed to this.\n  Mr. President, at this time I will yield back the remainder of my \ntime if the Senator from New Jersey will.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 10 days ago was the 25th anniversary of a \npolicy in this country that was articulated in a treaty called the ABM \nTreaty. It was a treaty that many of us at that time did not think was \nin the best interests of this country. It was a treaty that came from \nthe Nixon administration, a Republican administration. Of course, Henry \nKissinger was the architect of that treaty in 1972.\n  Essentially what it did was say to any adversaries out there that we \nwill agree to disarm and not to be prepared to defend ourselves if you \nagree to do the same thing. Some people refer to it as mutual assured \ndestruction, a policy I certainly did not adhere to at the time, did \nnot feel was good policy for this country. However, there was an \nargument at that time, because we had two superpowers--we had the then \nSoviet Union and of course the United States--and at that time we had \npretty good intelligence on them, they had pretty good intelligence on \nus, so I suppose we would be overly critical if we said there was just \nno justification for that program, even though I personally disagreed \nwith it at that time.\n  Since that time, starting in 1983 in the Reagan administration, we \nhave elevated the debate that there is a great threat out there and \nthat threat is from the many countries that now have weapons of mass \ndestruction. Over 25 nations now have those weapons, either chemical, \nbiological, or nuclear weapons. The critics, those who would take that \nmoney and apply it to social programs as opposed to defending our \nNation, use such titles as ``star wars,'' and they talk about the \nbillions of dollars that have been invested.\n  Anyway, we are at a point right now where something very interesting \nhas happened just recently. That is, on this 25th anniversary, we have \nfound that the Clinton administration, just about 10 days ago, agreed \nto create new parties to the ABM Treaty. That would be Belarus, \nKazakhstan, Ukraine, and Russia. This is going to have to come before \nthis body. I think this is an opportunity that we need to be looking \nfor, because all it would take is 34 Senators to reject this \nmultilateralization of the ABM Treaty.\n  Right now we have a number of systems that we are putting into place \nto defend the United States of America, both the national missile \ndefense as well as a theater defense. Certainly, with what is going on \nright now in Russia and Iran, the need for such a system has been \nelevated in the minds of most Americans.\n  We have right now, as we speak, 22 Aegis ships that are floating out \nthere in the ocean, already deployed. They have the capability of \nknocking down missiles when they are coming in. All we have to do is \ntake them to the upper tier, and we will have in place a national \nmissile defense system. Certainly that is something that could take \ncare of our theater missile needs. So several of us feel that we should \ngo ahead and conclude that is the system that we need. However, that \ndoes violate, probably violates, the ABM Treaty, as it is in place \ntoday. So I believe we should take this opportunity that is there, when \nit comes before this body for ratification, to reject this and thereby \nkill the ABM Treaty, which certainly is outdated.\n  By the way, it is interesting, the very architect of that treaty, Dr. \nHenry Kissinger, someone whose credentials no one will question, even \nthough they may question some of his previous policy decisions, Dr. \nKissinger, who is the architect of the 1972 ABM Treaty, now says it is \nnuts to make a virtue out of your vulnerability. He is opposed to \ncontinuing the ABM Treaty at this time.\n  So I hope we will take this opportunity to get out from under a \ntreaty\n\n[[Page S10759]]\n\nthat imposes restrictions on our ability to defend ourselves and reject \nthe upgraded system, or the treaty, as it comes before us and take this \nopportunity to defend America.\n  We have an opportunity to get out from under the restriction imposed \nupon us by the ABM Treaty.\n  We have an opportunity to elevate our Aegis system.\n  We have an opportunity to defend America.\n  After all, Mr. President, isn't that what we are supposed to be \ndoing?\n  I ask unanimous consent that a decision brief from the Center for \nSecurity Policy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nA Day That Will Live in Infamy: 25th Anniversary of the A.B.M. Treaty's \n                    Ratification Should Be Its Last\n\n       (Washington, D.C.): Twenty-five years ago tomorrow, the \n     United States ratified the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) \n     Treaty; this Friday will mark the 25th anniversary of that \n     Treaty's entry into force. With those acts, America became \n     legally obliged to leave itself permanently vulnerable to \n     nuclear-armed ballistic missile attack.\n       It is highly debatable whether such a policy of \n     deliberately transforming the American people into hostages \n     against one means of delivering lethal ordnance against them \n     (in contrast to U.S. policy with respect to land invasion, \n     sea assault or aerial attack) made sense in 1972. It \n     certainly does not today, in a world where the Soviet Union \n     no longer exists and Russia no longer has a monopoly on \n     threatening ballistic missiles or the weapons of mass \n     destruction they can carry.\n\n\n                           the reagan legacy\n\n       Indeed, as long ago as March 1983, President Reagan dared \n     to suggest that the United States might be better off \n     defending its people against nuclear-armed ballistic missile \n     attack rather than avenging their deaths after one occurs. \n     And yet, while Mr. Reagan's address spawned a research \n     program that became known as the Strategic Defense Initiative \n     (SDI)--into which tens of billions of dollars have been \n     poured over the past fourteen years, the ABM Treaty remains \n     the ``supreme law of the land.'' As a consequence, the United \n     States continues to fail what has been called ``the one-\n     missile test''. No defenses are in place today to prevent \n     even a single long-range ballistic missile from delivering \n     nuclear, chemical or biological warheads anywhere in the \n     country.\n       This is all the more extraordinary since Republicans and \n     like-minded conservatives have generally recognized that such \n     a posture has become not just dangerous, but also reckless in \n     the ``post-Cold War'' world. In fact, one of the few \n     commitments of the `Contract With America' that remains \n     unfulfilled was arguably among its most important--namely, \n     its promise to defend the American people against ballistic \n     missile attack. Successive legislative attempts to correct \n     this breach-of-contract have all foundered for essentially \n     two reasons.\n\n\n                      why are we still undefended?\n\n       First, most Republicans have shied away from a fight over \n     the ABM Treaty. Some deluded themselves into believing that \n     the opportunity afforded by the Treaty to deploy 100 ground-\n     based anti-missile interceptors in silos at a single site in \n     Grand Forks, North Dakota would allow the U.S. to get started \n     on defenses. Even though such a deployment would neither make \n     strategic sense (it would not cover the entire United States \n     from even a limited attack) nor be justifiable from a \n     budgetary point of view (while estimates vary widely, costs \n     of this minimal system could be well over $10 billion), some \n     missile defense proponents rationalized their support for it \n     by claiming that the anti-defense crowd would not object to \n     this ``treaty-complaint'' deployment and that it would be \n     better than nothing. To date, however, all these ``camel's-\n     nose-under-the-tent'' schemes have come to naught.\n       Such a system would create a basis for addressing new-term \n     missile threats and complement space-based assets that may be \n     needed in the future. The only problem is that the ABM Treaty \n     prohibits such an affordable, formidable sea-borne defensive \n     system. It must no longer be allowed to do so.\n\n\n                            the bottom line\n\n       As it happens, the opening salvos in what may be the \n     endgame of the ABM Treaty fight were sounded this weekend at \n     the first International Conservative Congress (dubbed by one \n     participant ``the Conintern''). One preeminent leader after \n     another--including House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former \n     British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, once-and-future \n     presidential candidate Steve Forbes, former UN Ambassador \n     Jeane Kirkpatrick, Senator Jon Kyl and nationally syndicated \n     columnist Charles Krauthammer--denounced the idea of making \n     it still harder to defend our people against ballistic \n     missile attack. Several, notably Senator Kyl and Mr. Forbes, \n     have explicitly endorsed the AEGIS option to begin performing \n     that task.\n       In an impassioned appeal for missile defenses as part of a \n     robust military posture, Lady Thatcher said yesterday:\n       ``A strong defense, supported by heavy investment in the \n     latest technology, including ballistic missile defense, is as \n     essential now, when we don't know who our future enemy may \n     be, as in the Cold War era. And my friends, we must keep \n     ahead technologically. We must not constrain the hands of our \n     researchers. Had we done so in the past, we would never have \n     had the military superiority that in the end, with the \n     dropping of the atomic bomb, won the war in the Far East and \n     saved many, many, lives, even through it destroyed others. We \n     must always remain technologically ahead. If not, we have no \n     way in which to be certain that our armed forces will \n     prevail. And the research and technology of the United States \n     is sheer genius, and it always has been.''\n       With such leadership, there now looms a distinct \n     possibility that the American people can finally be \n     acquainted with the ominous reality of their vulnerability \n     and empowered to demand and secure corrective actions. Thanks \n     to the Clinton ABM amendments and the new technical options \n     for defending America, we have both the vehicle for getting \n     out from under an accord that was obsolete even in Ronald \n     Reagan's day and the means for making good and cost-effective \n     use of the freedom that will flow from doing so.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, about 10 days ago the Senate adopted the \nappropriations bill on defense. I sit on the appropriations committee. \nI was one of five Senators who voted no. I think the bill passed 95 to \n5.\n  I don't enjoy voting against a defense budget. I am not running \nagain, so I am not worried about somebody accusing me of being soft on \ndefense. That has always been the mortal fear of Members of the Senate \nwhen you are voting on weapons system, that their opponent in the next \nelection will accuse them of being soft on defense.\n  Sometimes I think we should be accused of being soft in the head. We \npassed a bill that contained $247.5 billion for defense, and that did \nnot include nuclear weapons and weapons development. That is all \nhandled in the energy and water appropriations bill. And it did not \ninclude military construction, which is also in a separate bill. When \nyou add those together, the appropriations for national defense total \n$268.2 billion. That is right up there with what we spent in the cold \nwar.\n  If, in 1985, you had asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nindeed, if you had asked all the chiefs, ``If the Soviet Union were to \nsuddenly be dissolved and disappear, how much do you think we could cut \nthe defense budget,'' I promise you the answer would have been anywhere \nfrom $50 billion to $100 billion. Today the Soviet Union has been \ndissolved. It does not exist anymore. The military forces of Russia are \nin shambles. And we are appropriating $268 billion--big, big figures.\n  What are we thinking about? There is not a major enemy in sight. How \nmuch do we spend? And who are we afraid of? Here is a little chart that \nI believe my colleagues will find interesting. When we appropriate $268 \nbillion, we are spending twice as much as all of the eight potential \nenemies we could possibly conjure up. Here is what the United States \nspent, $268 billion; Russia, $82 billion; China, $32 billion; and the \nsix rogue countries, $15 billion. So we spend twice as much as all of \nthose countries, twice as much as Russia, China, Iran, Iraq, North \nKorea, Syria, Libya, Cuba combined. And when you add the NATO alliance, \nJapan and South Korea to what we are spending, it comes to four times \nas much. The United States and its allies are now spending four times \nas much for defense as virtually everybody else in the world.\n  That is the macro overlook of what I think is terribly wrong with the \nway we are appropriating money. But within that $268 billion, let me \njust tell you some of the reasons I could not stomach it. Between 1998 \nand 2001, under that bill, we are going to retire 11 Los Angeles class \nsubmarines that have an average of 13 years left on their lives. What \nare we doing? When we appropriated the money to build Los Angeles class \nsubmarines, we were assured these submarines were the best in the world \nand that they had a 30-year life.\n\n[[Page S10760]]\n\n Everybody beat themselves on the chest and said isn't that wonderful, \nwe are building submarines that have a 30-year life. So now we are \nretiring 11 of them that still have 13 years left on their lives. Why? \nSo we can build one new attack submarine in fiscal 1998 at a cost of \n$2.3 billion.\n  You talk about penny-wise and pound-foolish; we are going to spend \n$3.4 billion for four DDG-51 destroyers. That is even one more than the \nPentagon requested. How are we going to pay for that? Well listen to \nhow we are going to pay for it. First of all, I am offended because \nthey are retiring a ship that Betty Bumpers is the chief sponsor of. We \nchristened the CGN-41, a guided missile nuclear ship, back in 1979. \nThat ship had a life expectancy of 38 years, and we are about to scrap \nit. It is as modern as tomorrow. We are going to scrap it so we can \nbuild four new DDG-51 class destroyers, to keep the shipyards busy. We \nare retiring one of the most beautiful ships you will ever see, and it \nhas 18 years left on its life.\n\n  We are also retiring three Perry-class frigates that have 20 years \nleft on their life. What in the name of all that is good and holy do we \ncare what the life expectancy of a ship is if we are going to retire \nthem in order to make room for some more ships? The first thing you \nknow, we will be building them and retiring them before they go into \nservice so we can keep the shipyards busy.\n  Then, Mr. President, there is the $331 million in this bill for the \nB-2 bomber. Let me say in all fairness, as long as William Jefferson \nClinton is President, we are not going to start building B-2 bombers. I \nheard him speak on that subject. But what are we doing? We are saying, \n``Well, Mr. President, we know you don't like the B-2, so what we're \ngoing to do is give you $331 million to start building nine more B-2 \nbombers, but if you don't want to do that, then spend this money on \nspare parts on the ones we have.''\n  The Pentagon and the Air Force didn't ask for an additional $331 \nmillion in spare parts, and we are not going to build the B-2. Why in \nthe name of all that is good and holy are we putting $331 million in \nthe budget?\n  I come finally to the two items that really burn me worse than any \nother part of the budget. First, the F-22 fighter. When you start \nseeing full-page pictures in the New York Times and the Washington Post \nand in Roll Call and The Hill newspaper of this magnificent F-22 \nfighter, you can bet your bottom dollar the full-court press is on. I \nhave no more ability to stop the F-22 fighter than I can keep the Earth \nfrom revolving. Once a plane like that develops the kind of momentum \nthe F-22 has, nobody can stop it. Nobody can stop it no matter how \nfoolish it is.\n  Let me wedge the F-22 fighter for you in between two other fighter \nplanes. Right now we are beginning to build a new version of the Navy's \nF-18 fighter plane called the F-18 E/F. It is the most advanced version \nof the F-18 to date. Cost? Mr. President, $90 million each. Number? \nProbably around 600.\n  The Navy says, and the intelligence community confirms, that the F-18 \nfighter will be superior to any other non-American fighter plane in the \nworld through the year 2015. I repeat: The 500 to 600 F-18 E/F's we are \ngoing to build will be superior to any non-American fighter plane known \nin the world between now and the year 2015. The Navy says it will \nprovide air dominance until the year 2020. I am for it. We are building \nit. It is a magnificent airplane.\n  So what are we going to do now in the year 1998 to 2000? We are going \nto start building this F-22. Do you want to know the cost of that? \nSixty-two billion dollars for 339 airplanes. That comes to somewhere \nbetween $180 million and $190 million each, which makes it precisely \ntwice as expensive as the most expensive fighter plane ever built in \nthe United States.\n  If we needed it, we might justify the cost. But if we don't need it, \nwe couldn't justify it at any cost. An Air Force official has said, ``I \npromise you, we will build these 339 planes for $61.7 billion.''\n  We just happened to be debating the authorization bill for defense at \nthat time. I said, ``OK, we'll take you at your word. I can't stop the \nplane, which I would divinely like to do, but we will hold you to your \nword. You say you can build it for $61.7 billion. Let's put that in the \nbill, that you may not spend more than that.''\n  Do you know what? They are already hollering like a pig under a gate: \n``We can't live with it.''\n  So when you talk about a $190 million airplane, that is what they are \nsaying today. Anybody who has been in the Senate as long as I have \nknows they are not about to build that plane for that. They already cut \nthe number of planes because they faced a $16 billion cost overrun.\n  To proceed with the sequence, in the year 2005, we are going to start \nbuilding what we call the Joint Strike Fighter, and we are going to \nbuild about 2,800 of those. I happen to support the Joint Strike \nFighter because it is going to be used by the Navy, the Air Force, and \nthe Marine Corps. It is supposed to cost much less than $100 million \neach and be a state of the art fighter plane.\n  So why are we sandwiching this F-22 fighter at a cost of $62 billion \nbetween the F-18 and the Joint Strike Fighter? Why? Because the \nlobbyists have the power to make it happen, not because we need it. It \nis a cold-war relic.\n  You might ask, ``Well, who dreamed up the F-22?'' I will tell you who \ndreamed it up. The Russians. Back when the old Soviet Union kept us \nfrom sleeping at night, they announced in the early 1980's, back in the \nheyday of the Soviet Union, ``We're going to build a fifth-generation \nfighter that's going to be superior to anything ever built in the \nhistory of the world.''\n  That is all you have to do to get the Pentagon's attention. So the \nAir Force went to the drawing board and started designing the F-22 to \nmeet the threat of the Soviet Union and their fifth generation fighter.\n  What happened? The Soviet Union went bankrupt, and the fifth \ngeneration remained on the drawing board where it is today, unless they \nhave lost it. What are we doing? We are getting ready to produce an \nairplane designed to compete with a plane that is still on the drawing \nboard in Russia and may never come off the drawing board.\n  The F-22 has virtually no ground-attack capability. They put a couple \nbombs on it just so they could say it has ground-attack capability. It \nis a good airplane. I am not arguing that. You can build all kinds of \nairplanes that are good airplanes, but I want to tell you something, \nwhile it has a good air superiority capability, in Desert Storm and \nIraq, we flew four times more ground-attack flights than we did flights \nto achieve air dominance and air superiority. Mr. President, this cold \nwar relic should never have been built.\n  Finally, the argument that I thought I was going to finally win--I \ndon't win many arguments on defense. I don't know of anybody who ever \ntries to kill a weapons system or bring some sanity to defense spending \nthat ever wins. I can only remember two or three weapons systems in my \n23 years in the Senate that we have ever stopped. They take on a life \nof their own, and the minute Congress starts looking at them, the \nmanufacturers start running full-page ads in every newspaper and \nmagazine in the United States, giving the American people the \nimpression that we will be seriously threatened if we don't build that \nparticular weapons system.\n  The one I thought I was going to win was to stop plans to backfit our \nPacific fleet submarines with new ballistic missiles. We have 10 \nTrident submarines in the Atlantic and 8 in the Pacific. The ones in \nthe Atlantic are furnished with what we call the D-5 missile. A fine \nmissile, very accurate. It is the most modern, accurate ballistic \nmissile we have. Our eight Trident submarines in the Pacific are \nequipped with an older missile called the C-4.\n  The C-4 is not quite as accurate as the D-5. Do you know what the \ndifference is, Mr. President? According to unclassified data from the \nCongressional Budget Office, the C-4 lacks having the accuracy of the \nD-5, and the accuracy shortage is about 450 feet, or the distance from \nwhere the Presiding Officer is sitting right now to where the Speaker \nof the House is sitting down the hall.\n  When you consider the smallest warhead that goes on these missiles, \nthe 100 kiloton W-76 warhead, would wipe the District of Columbia \ncompletely off\n\n[[Page S10761]]\n\nthe map, why, again, in the name of all that is good and holy are we \ngetting ready to spend $5.6 billion to take the C-4 missiles off our \nPacific fleet and replace them with the D-5 missiles? Do you know why? \nBecause the Navy wants it, and the Navy and the industrial complex have \nthe power to get it.\n  We had a serious debate in the appropriations committee on this, and \nas I started to say earlier, I thought I had won that debate. I thought \nthe committee was agreeing with me. I thought the committee agreed that \nit would be the height of foolishness to retrofit those submarines in \nthe Pacific when the warheads and the missiles on them will last longer \nthan the submarines. No question about it.\n  So what are we going to do here when the cold war has long since \nceased to exist? We are going to scare the life out of the Russians by \nmodernizing our ballistic missile submarine fleet and spend $5.6 \nbillion that we could save doing it. We may also keep the Russians from \nratifying START II.\n  Oh, I could go on and on about what an utter waste of money that is. \nDid you know that those C-4 warheads I just described for you and the \nmissiles on which they sit will last longer than the submarines? We are \nnot even going to backfit four of the submarines because they are going \nto be retired before the C-4 missile will have lived out its \nusefulness.\n  So, Mr. President, I do, indeed, get agitated about these things, and \nI get frustrated.\n  The people sent us here to do a job as best we see fit.\n  When I see the needs of this country, when I see an educational \nsystem that needs to be fixed, when I see a planet threatened by \nenvironmental concerns, and when I see us fighting over who is going to \nget highway money to take care of the 200 million vehicles in this \ncountry, I get frustrated. Mr. President, do you know, just sort of \ndigressing for a moment, when I was a young marine in World War II, I \nremember seeing in one of the papers in California that we had 30 \nmillion vehicles on the road.\n  You know how many we have today? Two hundred million. By the year \n2050, at the rate we are going, we will have 400 million. Mother Teresa \nwas the exemplification of a woman who lived the consummate Judeo-\nChristian life, God bless her soul, but she was fighting a losing \nbattle from the very beginning. When she was a young novitiate, India \nhad 250 million people. Today, they have almost 800 million. Mother \nTeresa was fighting a losing battle.\n  The highway commissions in our respective 50 States are fighting a \nlosing battle, too. They are trying to build more highways, wider \nhighways to accommodate 30 percent of all the vehicles in the world. \nThose 200 million vehicles in this country are 30 percent of all the \nvehicles in the world.\n  We are going to have to think differently and act differently if we \nare going to deal with our transportation needs in the future, or every \ncity in America is going to be in gridlock.\n  In that connection, in putting that in the context of another burning \nissue around here called global warming, those 200 million vehicles \ncontribute 27 percent of all the world's greenhouse gases that the \nUnited States throws into the stratosphere.\n  When you think of what it is going to cost to clean up all the \nSuperfund sites in this country. To try to keep our water and air \nclean, and when I looked at the kind of money we spend on defense, so \nmuch of which is wasted, I had to come to the floor to make this \nspeech.\n  I did not want to vote against the defense budget. I just simply say \nI thought it was too much money. It was a lot more than too much money. \nIt was putting weapons systems in mothballs that have long lives left. \nIt was buying weapons systems we do not need. It was cold war mentality \nat its worst when the cold war is over.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today eight of the largest gun manufacturers \nvoluntarily agreed to include safety locks with every handgun they \nsell. I rise today to commend the President and the gun industry for \ntheir historic efforts.\n  This agreement addresses a very serious problem. Every year, many \nhundreds of children die from accidental shootings and thousands more \ntry to take their own lives with guns. Encouraging parents to use \nsafety locks will not save all of these young lives, to be sure, but it \nwill save many of them. It will make a difference.\n  This deal, however, would not have been possible without the public \noutcry over these tragedies and the growing momentum for bipartisan \nchild safety lock legislation. Our measure, which lost by a single vote \nin the Judiciary Committee this summer, requires the sale of a safety \nlock with every handgun.\n  Mr. President, in my opinion voluntary action is always better than \nGovernment regulation. For that reason, when we entered into \nnegotiations with gun manufacturers, we asked them to take this \ndramatic step on their own initiative. Today we are very pleased that \nmost of the industry has responded so that 80 percent of all handguns \nmanufactured in the United States will now be sold with child safety \nlocks. But we will continue to push until the half million more \nhandguns, including those manufactured abroad, are also covered.\n\n  We will also continue to encourage voluntary compliance, but until we \nhave the support of the entire industry, we will move to enact our \nlegislation. It should be easier now because most of the industry is \nalready on board.\n  Mr. President, today's announcement is an important step for safety \nand a victory for families and children everywhere. We should all be \ngrateful.\n  I thank you and yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to speak to an issue which \nconfronts us nationally and which we, as a nation, seem to be ducking. \nI am talking about terrorism. I am talking about the need for this \ncountry to stand up and be counted in its fight against international \nterrorism whenever and wherever it occurs.\n  Today, Americans are threatened by two very distinct but serious \nkinds of terrorism. The first is international terrorism.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of my efforts that helped to pass the Iran-\nLibya Sanctions Act, a law designed to stop two renegade nations from \nhaving the means necessary to finance international terrorism--by \npunishing those companies who do business with them. The French oil \ncompany, Total, is trying to test our resolve. Total has struck a \nlucrative oil deal with Iran. This company is thumbing its nose at the \nUnited States. I believe it is incumbent upon us to remain strong in \nthe face of these efforts to undermine our fight against terrorism. I \ncall upon the French Government to join the fight against international \nterrorism, not to thumb its nose at the United States, not to applaud \nthe efforts of Total.\n  I believe that our laws must be enforced and its strict sanctions \nmust be brought to bear on Total. Every Member of this body, Mr. \nPresident, voted for the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act.\n  It is only when we see planes being shot down, it is only when the \nvictims and their families come and say, What are you doing? that we \nstand up and take action. Every Member of this body should be outraged \nthat Total has thumbed its nose at this ban. They did so deliberately. \nIts actions are an insult not only to this body but to all of the \nnations of the world who should be working together in a united front \nagainst terrorism.\n  Fighting international terrorism requires every nation to unite \ntogether, and it requires that we remain resolute. It requires that we \nput corporate greed and profits on the back burner. Many of our own \ncompanies are so worried about international profits.\n  But let me tell you, when terrorism strikes here, when you see what \ntakes place, then an aroused American public gets us to do something. \nOnly when we see the bombing at the World Trade Center--that is real; \nimpacting people's lives--and when we see the Iranians\n\n[[Page S10762]]\n\nand the Libyans give sanctuary to terrorists, only then will we maybe \ndo something. But then some say, Not when corporate profits get in the \nway. Or our allies may say, Oh, no, don't do this, knowing that these \nare renegade governments and countries who sponsor terrorist attacks, \nwho are responsible for over 300 U.S. citizens being killed--and the \nLibyans were and they now give sanctuary to two men who have been \nindicted.\n  No. Sadly, we have to do something. I am very concerned that the \nadministration will shirk its responsibility.\n  Sadly, I also rise today to describe another kind of terrorism, Mr. \nPresident. It is one that is too often seen but little done. It is one \nthat permeates our Nation's school systems, particularly inner-city \nschools. It is a terrorism in which violent juveniles prey upon good \nkids. And it has to stop.\n  Just as we must be united and remain resolute in our fight against \ninternational terrorism, we must be united and remain resolute in the \nfight at home. Once again, each and every one of us has a \nresponsibility to stand up and fight this terrorism to make a \ndifference. Business as usual is no longer acceptable. There is no more \nfundamental right in our democracy than the right of our children to \nhave a good education. That requires that they be safe. That requires \nthat a school be an oasis for learning.\n\n  Many people have asked me why I have taken such a public and \noutspoken position as it relates to education reforms. New Yorkers may \nhave been shocked when they read yesterday's newspapers of gang \nviolence in the public schools.\n  I point to those headlines. ``Probe Rips Principals for Turning Blind \nEye to the Gangs.'' The story in the New York Post turns to the issue \nof the gangs which have taken over schools.\n  The Daily News: ``Fear Stalks Hallways as Hoods Take Over.'' One \nstudent says that he feels at times safer--safer--in dangerous \nneighborhoods at night than he does walking in the hallways.\n  We are not talking about violence in streets and alleys. This \nviolence is taking place inside our schools, which should be \nsanctuaries to our children. That means that the real victims are our \nchildren. Just as we must stand up to Total and other companies who \ngive aid and comfort to international regimes, we must stand up to the \nterrorism that is occurring in our classrooms. We must get violent and \ndisruptive juveniles out of the classrooms so good kids can learn. We \nneed fundamental sweeping reforms throughout our educational system.\n  In addition to getting violent and disruptive juveniles out of the \nclassrooms, Mr. President, we need to give merit pay to the outstanding \nteachers, those who are dedicated, those who want to make a difference \nand those who do make a difference. We have to see that we have tenure \nreform in order to get those teachers who are not performing, who are \nbad teachers out of the classroom.\n  We need school choice so that parents can make educational decisions \ninstead of Government bureaucrats.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we have to stand up to the teachers unions \nand tell them to put our children first. Unfortunately, the unions are \nmore interested in their perks and privileges than they are in \nproviding a good education for our children.\n  Above all, we must get violent and disruptive juveniles out of \nschools. I want to see more power given to our school principals to \nremove violent juveniles from the classrooms. We cannot tolerate the \nkind of situation that is taking place in more and more of our schools \nin more and more of our cities to more and more of our children.\n  Principals should have fast-track authority. You want to talk about \nfast-track authority for trade? Give our principals fast-track \nauthority to expel gang members and other violent offenders. That is \nwhat we really need to be doing to help this country and to help the \neducational system.\n  Just like in the fight against international terrorism, more pressure \nhas to be brought to bear on terrorism in our schools. The fight \nagainst terrorism in our schools must be a united fight. The teachers \nunions, who opposed every commonsense reform, surely can agree with the \nnotion that violence in schools must be stopped. Instead of pushing for \nmore pay and less work for teachers, the teachers unions should join me \nand others in a united effort to combat violence in our schools.\n  That is why I have been standing up to those who ask the question, \n``Why do you talk about this?'' We have had debates about educational \nreform and getting more money directly to the District so they can \nspend it on students, not bureaucrats. We have had debates about giving \nparents choice so they can give their kids an opportunity to receive a \nquality education. But let me say something. In every one of those \nsituations we have seen the teachers unions come down and oppose this. \nThey are against merit pay. They are against getting bad teachers out. \nThey want to ensure lifetime contracts. They are interested in perks \nand privileges.\n  By gosh, for one time, join with us and see to it that we have \nmeaningful reforms so that we can fast track violent students out of \nthe schools, so that good and decent kids have an opportunity to have a \ngood education, so that children can learn in safety.\n  Mr. President, I do not think there is a more important fight against \nterrorism that we can and must and should win than that which confronts \nour children every day, unfortunately, in too many of the schools \nthroughout this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10761-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10762-S10777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate began consideration \nof the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997, or \nsometimes referred to as ISTEA II.\n  This legislation is the product of well over a year of hard work and \ncareful negotiation.\n  We had three different proposals, Mr. President, all commendable, and \nthe requirement before us was to integrate these different proposals \ninto one unified plan that all of us could rally around. When I say us, \nI was, of course, talking about the committee at the time, the 18 \nmembers of the Environment and Public Works Committee, but hopefully \nthe entire Senate. When I am taking about 18 members, I, of course, am \nreferring to Democrats and Republicans.\n  I am pleased that the bill before the Senate truly represents a \nconsensus effort with cosponsors from all regions of the country and \nfrom both sides of the aisle. The results of these efforts, so-called \nISTEA II--ISTEA, again, referring to Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1997--provides $145 billion over the next 6 years for \nour Federal highway, highway safety, and other surface transportation \nsystems.\n  Mr. President, this is a 20-percent increase for the Federal aid \nhighway program over the level provided in the original ISTEA, which \nstretched from 1991 to 1997 a, 6-year bill. This bill preserves and \nbuilds upon the laudable goals of intermodalism, flexibility, and \nefficiency, all of which goals were found in the original ISTEA \nlegislation.\n  It does so within the parameters of the balanced budget agreement \nthat Congress passed just 2 months ago, Mr. President. In my view, the \nmost important aspect of this bill is that it works within the context \nof a balanced budget. We were given x amount of dollars, we stayed \nwithin that x amount of dollars. I feel very strongly about that, Mr. \nPresident.\n  On the Nation's highways you get to where you are going by staying \nwithin the lines and playing by the rules. The budget is no different. \nI am very proud that the program that we brought out of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, so-called ISTEA II, stays within the \nparameters of the balanced budget, a budget, as I say, we only adopted \n2 months ago.\n\n[[Page S10763]]\n\n  S. 1173 addresses the concerns of the State by making the program \neasier to understand and by providing greater flexibility to States and \nlocalities. It reduces the number of ISTEA program categories. Under \nthe existing ISTEA legislation there are five categories that we drop \nto three. It includes more than 20 improvements to reduce the red-tape \ninvolved in carrying out transportation projects. Moreover, this bill \nsignificantly reforms the ISTEA funding formulas to balance the diverse \nneeds of the various regions of the Nation. Forty-eight of the 50 \nStates share in the growth of the overall program and the bill \nguarantees 90 cents back for every dollar of State moneys contributed \ninto the highway trust fund. This is a very, very significant \nadvancement and change from the ISTEA legislation currently on the \nbooks.\n  Now, this ISTEA II recognizes the diversity and uniqueness of the \ncountry and all its transportation needs. The aging infrastructure and \ncongested areas of the Northeast, the growing population and capacity \nlimitations in the South and Southwest, and the rural expanses in the \nWest, all of these require different types of transportation \ninvestments. By making the surface transportation program more \nresponsible to all regions of the country, S. 1173 will ensure that the \nintegrity of the original ISTEA program is upheld.\n  Now, Mr. President, to bridge the gap between limited Federal funds \nand formidable infrastructure needs, this bill makes a strategic \ninvestment in the Nation's transportation system. During the 1950's and \nthe 1960's it made more sense for the Nation to build--that is what we \nwere concentrating on, building an interstate system. Today we need to \nbe more creative. We must carefully plan and allocate our limited \nresources.\n  ISTEA II includes a number of innovative ways to finance \ntransportation projects. It establishes a Federal credit assistance \nprogram for surface transportation. This new program leverages limited \nFederal funds by allowing up to $10.6 billion Federal line of credit \nfor transportation projects at a cost to the Federal budget of just \nover $500 million--in other words, for half a billion we are able to \nleverage up to $10.6 billion of a Federal line of credit for \ntransportation projects.\n  To enable States to make the most of their transportation dollars, \nthis bill expands and simplifies the State infrastructure bank program. \nOne of the wisest transportation investments we can make is to do \neverything we can on behalf of the safety of drivers and passengers. \nISTEA II substantially increases the Federal safety commitment. In the \nUnited States alone there are more than 40,000 fatalities and 3.5 \nmillion auto crashes every year. Those are staggering statistics--3.5 \nmillion automobile crashes every year, and 40,000 deaths on our U.S. \nhighways per year. Between 1992 and 1995 the average national highway \nfatality rate increased by more than 2,000 deaths a year while the \nannual national injury rate increased by over 38,000. We must work \nvigorously to reverse this trend. This bill will help us to do so.\n  The funds set aside for safety programs such as hazard elimination, \nrailroads, highway crossings under this bill total $690 million a year, \n55 percent over the current level increase. According to the National \nHighway Safety Traffic Administration, the use of seatbelts is by far \nthe most important step vehicle occupants can take to protect \nthemselves in the event of a collision. Wearing a seatbelt increases a \nperson's chance of surviving a crash by 45 percent, and of avoiding \nserious injury by 50 percent. Think of that--by simply wearing a \nseatbelt, one's chances of avoiding serious injury are increased by 50 \npercent, chances of surviving a crash are increased by 45 percent. To \nencourage the increased use of seatbelts, the bill before us \nestablishes a new safety belt incentive program rewarding those States \nthat increase their seatbelt usage or take other measures to increase \nseatbelt use.\n\n  To combat the serious problem of drunk driving, the ISTEA bill \nestablishes a new program that encourages States to enact laws with \nmaximum penalties for repeat drunk driving offenders.\n  As valuable as transportation is to our society, we have to remember, \nMr. President, yes, transportation obviously is valuable to our \nsociety, but it has taken a tremendous toll on the Nation's air, land, \nand water. The costs of air pollution alone that can be attributed to \ncars and trucks has been estimated to range from $30 to $200 billion a \nyear.\n  ISTEA II upholds the original ISTEA legislation, strong commitment to \npreserving and protecting our environment. ISTEA provides States and \nlocalities with tools to cope with the growing demands on our \ntransportation system and the corresponding strain on our environment.\n  I am proud that the bill before the Senate increases funding for \nISTEA's key programs to offset transportation's impact on the \nenvironment. Clearly, all these automobiles and trucks on our roads \ncontribute to a strain on our environment.\n  ISTEA II provides an average of $1.18 billion per year over the next \n6 years for the so-called congestion mitigation and air quality \nimprovement programs, also known as CMAQ. This is an 18-percent \nincrease over the current funding levels for transit improvement, \nshared ride services, and other activities to help fight air pollution. \nOver the past 6 years, the transportation enhancement program has \noffered a remarkable opportunity for States and localities to use their \nFederal transportation dollars to preserve and create more livable \ncommunities. ISTEA II therefore, provides a 24-percent increase in \nfunding for transportation enhancements such as bicycle and pedestrian \nfacilities, billboard removal, historic preservation, and rails-to-\ntrails program.\n  In addition to CMAQ and enhancements, the ISTEA II bill establishes a \nnew wetland restoration pilot program. Why are we doing this, spending \nhighway money to restore wetlands? We are doing it to fund projects to \noffset the loss or degradation of wetlands resulting from Federal aid \ntransportation projects. There is no question that all kinds of \nwetlands have been lost across our Nation over the last 25 to 30 years \nas a result of the construction and the resulting damage to our \nwetlands.\n  When it was enacted in 1997, ISTEA expanded the focus of the national \npolicy, transforming what was once simply a program for building roads \nand bridges into a surface transportation program dedicated to the \nmobility of passengers and goods. Mr. President, I call your attention \nto the very name of this program. This is not a highway bill. This is a \nsurface transportation efficiency bill. So we do more than just focus \non highways. The purpose is to move people and goods in the most \nefficient manner possible. S. 1173 continues this spirit of \nintermodalism by extending the eligibility of the National Highway \nSystem and surface transportation programs to passenger rail such as \nAmtrak and magnetic levitation systems.\n  The statewide metropolitan planning provisions of ISTEA have yielded \nhighway returns by bringing all interests to the table, and increasing \nthe public's input into the decisionmaking process. ISTEA continues to \nstrengthen the planning provisions of the original legislation. \nAdmittedly, the transition from old policies and practices to those \nembodied in ISTEA has not always been easy. The bill before the Senate \nwill carry forward ISTEA's strengths, but it will also correct ISTEA's \nweakness and provide a responsive transportation program to take us \ninto the next century.\n  Now I would like to turn, if I might, to an issue of great concern. \nOver the past few days there has been some discussion of the \ndistressing prospect of going around the balanced budget agreement to \nincrease funds for the Federal aid highway program. Some Members of \nCongress are trying to ensure that the 4.3-cent gas tax, which is what \nthe tax reconciliation redirects into the highway trust fund, actually \nis spent on highways. Although I support increased funding for \ntransportation, I cannot support the proposition of spending the 4.3-\ncent gas tax.\n  Let me add that transportation nearly fares better than every other \nnational program in the Federal budget resolution. From 1997 through \nthe year 2002--the 5-year budget period which deals with highways--the \nbudget resolution increases transportation spending by almost 7 \npercent. In contrast, other nondefense discretionary programs increase \nby roughly 2 percent. In other words, transportation will grow at a \nrate of three times that of other nondefense discretionary programs.\n\n[[Page S10764]]\n\n  It is imperative that we look at transportation funding in the \ncontext of countless other important legislative priorities of \nCongress. During the consideration of the bill before the Senate, \nSenators Warner, Domenici, and I plan to offer an amendment that will \nresolve the issue of potential budget surplus in an orderly manner \nthrough the budget process next spring. Determining what the Nation's \npriorities are during the budget process when all programs and policies \ncan compete fairly is a responsible way to resolve this complex issue.\n  Before I conclude, I want to express my appreciation to Senators \nWarner and Baucus and other members of the environment committee for \ntheir hard work and determination in developing this program.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. President, this came out of the committee by a \nvote of 18-0, Democrats and Republicans alike supporting it, those from \nthe West, the Midwest, the South, the Southeast, the Northeast, all \nsupported it. Transportation is not a partisan issue as much as it is a \nregional issue. Senators Warner, Baucus, and I represent three distinct \nregions of the country with very different points of view. It has not \nbeen easy and we still have a way to go before reaching the finish \nline.\n  I look forward to working with other Members of the Senate as well as \nthe House leadership to enact a bill this year that will take the \nNation's transportation system into the 21st century.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I recognize others are seeking recognition but I would \nlike first to thank my distinguished chairman because this bill \nrepresents the efforts brought about by his leadership, together with \nmy distinguished colleague, our ranking member, Senator Baucus.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senators Chafee \nand Warner in bringing the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \nAct of 1997 to the floor.\n  What will the bill do? It will help this Nation meet its growing \ntransportation demands. It will help reduce congestion. Make highways \nsafer. Make our economy more efficient. Ease travel for businesses, \nfarmers, and families on vacation. Develop new transportation \ntechnologies for a new century. And protect our environment as we do \nit.\n\n\n                          why spend the money?\n\n  The bill before us today, ISTEA II, is a very big commitment. It will \nprovide over $145 billion for highway and highway safety programs over \nthe next 6 years. That is an increase of more than 20 percent from the \nfunding of today.\n  And some may ask why we do it. Why should we invest billions of \ndollars each year in transportation?\n  Mr. President, the reason is simple. A good transportation system \nmakes life better for everyone. For many years--really, since John \nQuincy Adams, Henry Clay, and the internal improvement program of the \n1820's, which involved postal roads and canals--we have recognized how \nimportant it is to put some money into a system that works for \neveryone.\n  Montana wheatgrowers bringing their produce to the mill; \nmanufacturers shipping goods across the country; families driving off \nfor a weekend in the mountains--all need a safe, efficient \ntransportation network.\n  Today, we benefit enormously from the work President Eisenhower began \nwith the Interstate Highway System in the 1950's. We have the largest \ntransportation system in the world. And we need the money to keep it \nthe best transportation system in the world.\n  We enjoy the premier system of highways--the 45,000 mile Interstate \nSystem--and almost 4 million miles of other roads. Our 265 million \npeople drive over 2.4 trillion miles each year--about half the distance \nfrom Earth to the nearest star.\n  And transportation investment means jobs. We create over 42,000 jobs \nwith each $1 billion of Federal transportation spending. And let's not \nforget that these are good jobs. Jobs that support families throughout \nthe Nation.\n  So that is why we need to make the investment in a national \ntransportation program. And this bill represents policy choices that \nwill serve the Nation well.\n  That much driving means the roads need a lot of fixing. The \nDepartment of Transportation estimates that we will need almost $50 \nbillion a year just to maintain current conditions on our highways. And \nwe need almost $9 billion each year just to maintain current bridge \nconditions.\n  Finally, transportation investment comes with its own benefits. As \nhearings before our Environment and Public Works Committee show, \ntransportation is one of the largest sectors of our economy--accounting \nfor nearly 11 percent of our gross domestic product. Only housing and \nfood account for more.\n\n\n                           istea and istea ii\n\n  ISTEA II builds upon the successes of its predecessor, the ISTEA \nlegislation of 1991. Authored by my colleague from New York, Senator \nMoynihan, that landmark law has helped create a truly seamless, \nintermodal transportation system. Air and seaports link easily with \nroads, railways and transit, meaning that travelers lose the least \npossible time making connections and businesses move their goods as \ncheaply and efficiently as possible.\n  Likewise, our transportation program is flexible. States and local \ngovernments choose transportation projects that meet their diverse \nneeds. States can build highways, transit facilities, bikepaths, \npedestrian walkways, and interomodal facilities--whatever fits the \nneeds of Montanans or New Yorkers or Californians best.\n   Mr. President, the bill before us, ISTEA II, continues along that \npath. And with the experience of 6 years behind us, I believe we have \nmade a good product even better.\n  This bill will give us a transportation program that meets four basic \ncriteria. First, it will meet our economic needs.\n  Second, it will use the most up-to-date technologies and helps \ndevelop new ones so highways are easier and travel is safer. Third, it \nwill remember small communities as well as broad national needs. And \nfourth, it will be fair to all parts of the country.\n  Finally, it will be administratively simpler. Today we have 11 \ncategories of funding. With the new bill we will have five: the \nInterstate/National Highway System, the Surface Transportation Program, \nthe Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program, and two equity \naccounts. Let me explain each one of these in turn.\n\n\n                 the interstate/national highway system\n\n  When Congress enacted the original ISTEA legislation in 1991, it was \nwith the clear understanding that the Interstate System was complete \nand the interstate era was over. It was not time to recognize the \nimportance of a larger network of roads and bridges in this country.\n  Since the inception of the Interstate System in the 1950's, things \nhave changes around the country. No longer is the Interstate the only \nsystem of roads that connect businesses to markets and jobs to homes. \nIt is now a larger system, the National Highway System or NHS.\n  In 1995, Congress formally approved this transition--a transition \nfrom the interstate era to the National Highway System era--when it \napproved the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995.\n  The National Highway System is a system of almost 170,000 miles or \nroads and bridges--including the 45,000 mile Interstate System--that \ncarries the vast majority of our commercial and passenger traffic. NHS \nroads provide access to rural and urban areas. These roads connect our \nhomes to our jobs, our farms to markets, and ultimately our export \nproducts to their overseas markets.\n  So it is only appropriate that under ISTEA II we devote the majority \nof resources to the maintenance and improvement of the National Highway \nSystem. Under the bill, we will spend almost $12 billion a year on \nthese roads, at least $6 billion of that going directly to maintain the \nInterstate System roads and bridges.\n  And while we have eliminated the current bridge program, we have \nfolded it into other categories. States will receive over $4.2 billion \nunder bridge apportionment factors and will have to spend at least what \nthey are spending today on bridges. This will ensure we continue to \nmake improvements in the condition and performance of our bridges.\n\n\n                     surface transportation program\n\n  Second, the present Surface Transportation Program or STP will \ncontinue in the new highway program at\n\n[[Page S10765]]\n\nan annual funding level of $7 billion. The STP is a flexible funding \ncategory that provides for all types of transportation projects, and is \nparticularly valuable for small towns and communities with innovative \nideas.\n  It allows new construction and, improvements to current highways; but \nalso bikepaths, pedestrian walkways, transit capital projects, \ntransportation enhancement projects, rail/highway crossing safety \nimprovements, and hazard elimination projects.\n\n\n                 congestion mitigation and air quality\n\n  Third, we will continue to improve air quality and reduce congestion \naround the country through the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality \nProgram or CMAQ. One of the key features of the original ISTEA \nlegislation was the link developed between the environment and \ntransportation. The CMAQ Program is that link.\n  CMAQ provides funds to nonattainment areas so they may undertake \nprojects to improve their air quality. The past 6 years have \ndemonstrated the benefits of such investments. CMAQ projects have \ncontributed to many areas reaching attainment and have improved traffic \nflows to reduce congestion.\n\n\n                       transportation technology\n\n  Fourth, as well as improving the physical infrastructure, the bill \nbefore us today funds new research and deployment of transportation \ntechnologies in rural and urban areas.\n  Technologies, such a the Intelligent Transportation System or ITS \ntechnologies, will increase the capacity of existing transportation \nsystems without having to add new lanes. ITS also increases safety on \nour roads by providing information to the traveling public about \nroadside hazards, weather conditions, and alternate routing. These \ntechnologies will improve safety and the environment.\n  In the past 25 years, together with seatbelt and drunk driving laws, \nearlier versions of these projects have helped to reduce the rate of \nfatal automobile accidents by more than half, from 44.5 deaths per \n100,000 registered vehicles in 1972 to 21.2 last year. The new program \nwill build on this remarkable success to help keep our highways the \nsafest in the world.\n\n\n                         fair funding formulas\n\n  Finally, fairness. Policy is very important in its own right; but it \nis also important that every part of the country sees the benefits. And \nthat is what we do.\n  Our bill recognizes the diverse transportation needs of the country. \nFor large, sparsely populated States, the bill recognizes their \ndependence upon highways.\n  In Montana, for example, we do not have mass transit, we do not have \nlarge seaports. We rely upon our highways to get from place to place. \nSo the bill uses formula factors that recognize the extent or size of a \nState's highway system. That only makes sense. After all, this is a \nbill that provides funding for States to maintain and improve their \nhighway systems.\n  States in the densely populated Northeast region have an aging \ninfrastructure in need of repairs. The bill recognizes these needs by \nusing formula factors such as vehicle miles traveled or vmt. Vmt \nmeasures the use or wear on your roads. The bill also continues to \nprovide funding for deficient bridges--a very important component of \nthe transportation system in the Northeast region.\n  And for fast-growing, so-called donor States, the bill uses formula \nfactors that take into account this growth. The vmt factor that I \nmentioned above is an example, since it measures how much people are \ndriving in your State. But the bill goes even further.\n  The bill uses contributions to the highway account of the highway \ntrust fund as a formula factor. And of the amount apportioned to the \nStates, every State will receive at least 90 percent of its share of \ncontributions to the highway trust fund.\n  And let's not forget that his bill is not just about highways. In the \ncoming days, the Banking Committee will add their title to this bill to \nreauthorize the mass transit program. Over $24 billion has been \nauthorized for those programs by that committee.\n  So as my colleagues decide whether or not to view the highway \nformulas as fair or not, I urge them to examine this bill in its \nentirety. Because many States receive large sums of funding for their \nmass transit programs, while others rely solely upon highway funding to \nmeet their transportation needs.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  In sum, we have a good product that will help the country. It will \nupdate and improve an already excellent highway program. And we should \nnot wait.\n  Some suggest that we should do only a 6-month extension of ISTEA, \nhoping for more transportation funding in the future. Both Senator \nWarner and I believe we need more funding. But waiting will not \nguarantee that we get it, and it will come with its own cost.\n  States and local governments must plan for the future, and to do so \nthey need to know that we will not be changing the rules every 6 \nmonths. The lack of a long-term transportation program will mean chaos \nand uncertainty across the country for government, businesses, \nagriculture, and citizens.\n  So I believe we should get the job done. We have known for 6 years \nthat ISTEA would expire in 1997. And I believe the bill we bring to the \nfloor today will serve the Nation well. I hope it will get the Senate's \nsupport.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate \nfor consideration S. 1173, the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1997, or ISTEA II.\n  ISTEA II is a 6-year bill that reauthorizes our Nation's highway \nconstruction, highway safety, and research programs. It provides $145 \nbillion over 6 years and meets the requirements of the Balanced Budget \nagreement.\n  Our funding level of $145 billion is 20 percent greater than the $120 \nbillion funding level provided in ISTEA I.\n  Our funding level of $145 billion exceeds the funding level of $135 \nbillion proposed in the administration's NEXTEA bill.\n  Mr. President, along with my strong working partner, Senator Baucus, \nI have worked throughout the year for higher funding levels for our \nNation's surface transportation programs.\n  Unfortunately, our amendment to the budget resolution earlier this \nyear failed by one vote. Later, during the conference on the budget \nresolution, Senator Baucus and I, along with 83 other Senators, urged \nthe conferees to raise the allocation to the highway program so that a \nportion of the 4.3-cent Federal gas tax could be spent.\n  Regrettably, these efforts were not successful. As such, I accepted \nthe decision of the Senate and our commitment to the American people to \nbalance the Federal budget by the year 2002.\n  With the spending limitations set in the balanced budget agreement, \nChairman Chafee, Senator Baucus and I drafted a six-year \nreauthorization bill that complies with the budget agreement.\n  Mr. President, it is also critical that the Congress move forward to \nenact a 6-year, comprehensive transportation bill. Not a 6-month bill \nas some in the other House are advocating.\n  Our State and local transportation partners deserve nothing less. Due \nto the significant length of time required to plan and design any \ntransportation project--an average of 7 years--our states, our \nGovernment, and their respective highway authorities must be able to \nefficiently respond to transportation demands.\n  Mr. President, in bringing this bill before the Senate, I urge every \nmember to examine the bill in its entirety and to evaluate its \nprovisions on the merits of balance and fairness.\n  Those are the two principles that guided my efforts in the drafting \nof this bill.\n  I am well aware that every Senator may not be entirely pleased with \nthis bill. Most of the concern rests, not with the substantive \nmeasures, but with the level of funding. I am convinced, however, that \noverall we bring to the Senate a bill--that addresses the mobility \ndemands of the American people and the growing freight movements of \nAmerican goods;--that will continue to ensure America's competitiveness \nin a one-world market; and that, for the first time, provides a fair \nand equitable return to every State based on the amount of funds we \nspend. Every State will be guaranteed 90 percent of the funds we send \nto the States based on each State's contributions to the highway trust \nfund.\n\n[[Page S10766]]\n\n  How much will each State get at a minimum under this bill? Let me \ndescribe this calculation as there are many different ways to explain \nthe 90-percent guarantee.\n  Let's start first with what each State sends to Washington to the \nhighway trust fund.\n  Under the formula, each's State's share of contributions to the \nhighway trust fund each year is calculated.\n  Then, that percent is compared to the percent share each State \nreceives under the formula.\n  If necessary, the 90-percent minimum guarantee is applied to any \nState whose percent share under the formula is below their 90-percent \nshare of contributions to the highway trust fund.\n  For those States, the 90-percent guarantee, will ensure that each \nState's percentage return under the formula is adjusted upward to equal \ntheir 90-percent share of contributions to the highway trust fund.\n  I want to thank Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus, and all the \nmembers of the committee for their contributions, in developing a \ncompromise bill that represents a balance among the 50 States.\n  This legislation is the product of months of spirited discussions.\n  It is a compromise that addresses the unique transportation needs in \nthe different regions of the country--the congestion demands of the \ngrowing South and Southwest, the aging infrastructure needs of the \nNortheast, and the national transportation needs of the rural West.\n  In putting together this bipartisan and comprehensive measure, great \ncare was taken to preserve fundamental principles of ISTEA I that \nworked well.\n  ISTEA II upholds and strengthens ISTEA's laudable goals of mobility, \nintermodalism, efficiency, and program flexibility.\n  We were committed to continuing those hallmarks of ISTEA which have \nproven to be successful and are strongly supported by our State and \nlocal transportation partners, including: ensuring that our \ntransportation programs contribute to and are compatible with our \nnational commitment to protect our environment; building upon the \nshared decision-making between the Federal, state, and local \ngovernments; and ensuring that the public continues to participate \nfully in the transportation planning process.\n  Mr. President, perhaps the most critical issue that the committee \naddressed in this legislation is the development of equitable funding \nformulas.\n  ISTEA I failed to distribute funding to our States based on current \ncontemporary data that measures the extent, use, and condition of our \ntransportation system. ISTEA I apportioned funds to the States based on \neach State's historical share of funds received in 1987.\n  As we prepare for the transportation challenges of the 21st century, \nreforms to the funding formulas are long overdue. This legislation uses \nindicators that measure the current needs of our transportation system. \nMany of the factors used to distribute funds are consistent with the \nalternatives identified in GAO's 1995 report entitled, ``Highway \nFunding, Alternatives for Distributing Federal Funds.''\n  These indicators are standard measurements of lane miles which \nrepresent the extent of the system in a State, vehicle miles traveled \nwhich represent the extent of congestion, and structural and capacity \ndeficiencies of our Nation's bridges.\n  Using current measurements of our transportation system were called \nfor in every major reauthorization bill introduced this session--\nincluding the administration's NEXTEA bill, STEP-21, STARS 2000, and \nISTEA Works.\n  For those of my colleagues who do not believe their States should see \na change in their share of transportation funds from what they have \npreviously received, I simply respond that we must move forward and \nupdate our formulas to ensure that our national transportation program \nresponds to the many needs across our Nation.\n  In revising these funding formulas, I believe we have made \nsignificant progress to address one of the major shortfalls of ISTEA--\nnamely, providing every state a fair return based on their \ncontributions to the highway trust fund.\n  Our bill today ensures fairness. Every State will receive a minimum \nguarantee of 90 percent of the funds apportioned to the States equal to \n90 percent of their contributions to the Highway Trust Fund.\n  This guarantee is very different from the so-called 90 percent \nminimum allocation in ISTEA I.\n  ISTEA II provides a real and true guarantee of 90 percent of the \nfunds distributed to the States. The minimum guarantee is applied to \n100 percent of apportioned funds.\n  Second, the minimum guarantee calculation is reformed so that the 90 \npercent guarantee is actually achieved. We all know that ISTEA I gave \nmany States less than 90 percent because it did not include all the \nfunds that were distributed to States.\n  While I started with a goal of 95-percent return for every State, a \ntrue 90-percent return calculated on a larger share of the program is a \nmajor achievement for donor States.\n  I am also pleased to report that ISTEA makes great progress in \nconsolidating and streamlining the program.\n  Under ISTEA I there are five major program categories. Under ISTEA \nII, those program categories have been consolidated into three major \nprograms--the Interstate and National Highway System Program, the \nSurface Transportation Program, and the Congestion Mitigation and Air \nQuality Program.\n  Under ISTEA I there are five apportionment adjustments--most of them \ndesigned to address concerns of donor States--that have not worked. \nISTEA II provides for two simple adjustments. First, for donor States \nand small States to provide them a minimum share of funding. The \nsecond, to provide a transition for States based on part of their ISTEA \nfunding.\n  The committee bill also includes many revisions to Federal highway \nprocedures to streamline the complex process of Federal reviews of \nState projects. It is my very strong hope that these provisions will \nenable our States to improve project delivery--the time it takes for a \nproject to move from design to construction to completion.\n  Today, it takes on average 7 years to complete a project. We must \nprovide our States with the tools to do better. I believe many \nprovisions in this bill will free them from Federal redtape which has \ndelayed many projects.\n  Mr. President, those are some of the important highlights of the \ncommittee bill.\n  I look forward to the Senate's consideration of this bill and will \nwork with my colleagues to resolve as many amendments as possible.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this request has been cleared with the \ndistinguished Republican leader.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I, Senator Gramm, Senator Warner, \nSenator Baucus, not necessarily in that order, may have as much as a \ntotal, if needed, of one hour among us to discuss an amendment which we \nare going to offer at a later date.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Just a question, if I might. In other words, you would \nstart now and go until 5:15?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which was \nenacted as part of the balanced budget agreement, included a provision \nwhich ended the use of the 4.3 cents per gallon gas tax for deficit \nreduction and instead placed this tax into the Highway Trust Fund \nbeginning on October 1, 1997. That was a very important first step in \nrestoring integrity to the Highway Trust Fund. It ended the practice of \nusing any Federal gasoline taxes for deficit reduction. This Senator \nwas not alone in seeking to end the practice of using Federal gasoline \ntaxes for deficit reduction. On July 14 of this year, I joined 82 other \nSenators in signing a letter addressed to the Senate majority and \nminority leaders, as well as the chairman and ranking Member of the \nSenate Finance Committee, Senators Roth and Moynihan, and that letter \nis fairly brief.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S10767]]\n\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader.\n     Senator William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance.\n     Senator Daniel P. Moynihan,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Finance.\n       Dear Colleagues: We are writing to express our view that \n     additional funding for transportation programs is urgently \n     needed. As you know, Section 704 of the Senate's version of \n     the Revenue Reconciliation Act transferred 3.8 cents of the \n     federal fuel tax from the general fund to the Highway Trust \n     Fund. While that transfer is an important first step, it does \n     not, by itself, provide the needed additional funds. \n     Therefore, we ask that you urge the conferees to ensure that \n     at least a significant portion of the 3.8 cents be made \n     available for expenditure on highway and transit programs, \n     similar to the manner in which the Senate provided funding \n     for intercity passenger rail service.\n       The reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) will seek to meet the \n     growing demands on our highway and transit systems. Yet the \n     scale and diversity of these national needs combined with the \n     requests for discretionary funds to address local and \n     regional transportation issues requires funding levels \n     greater than that currently available.\n       We are concerned that without additional funding, the \n     reauthorization of ISTEA and the distribution of funds in a \n     fair manner will prove to be impossible and will lead to \n     divisive debate in the Senate.\n       Therefore, we respectfully urge you to provide the means to \n     spend a portion of the 3.8 cents for our highway and transit \n     programs.\n           Sincerely,\n         Max Baucus, Herb Kohl, Byron L.

Murkowski.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the important first step, as I say, which we \n83 Senators sought in our letter has now been achieved; namely, the \ntransfer of the 4.3 cents per gallon gasoline tax from deficit \nreduction into the Highway Trust Fund. I believe it was Senator Gramm \nwho offered the amendment to do that. He offered that amendment in the \nFinance Committee and the Finance Committee adopted that amendment. So \nthat was accomplished in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  Unfortunately, the six-year ISTEA reauthorization bill reported by \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee does not allow the use of \none penny--not one copper penny--of this 4.3 cents gas tax for highway \nconstruction over the next six years. In effect, it allows these \nadditional gas tax revenues to build up huge surpluses over the next \nsix years. The time has come to put our money where our mouth is. We \neither mean it or we don't mean it when we write letters urging our \nleadership not only to place the 4.3 cents per gallon gas tax into the \nHighway Trust Fund, but also to take the next step and allow it to be \nused in the ISTEA bill before the Senate.\n  Did we place the 4.3 cents gas tax into the trust fund simply so that \nthe unspent balance of the trust fund could skyrocket to historic \nlevels, while our bridges crumble, while our constituents sit in ever-\nworsening traffic jams, and while congestion chokes off the economic \npotential of our Nation? Is that what we meant? That was not my \nintention in championing the transfer of this tax, and I don't believe \nit was the intention of my colleagues, those who supported placing the \nrevenue into the Highway Trust Fund.\n  And so, today, three of my colleagues and I--Senators Gramm, Warner, \nand Baucus--are joining in saying to the Senate that we are preparing \nan amendment to the pending ISTEA bill to authorize the use of the full \namount raised by the highway account share of the 4.3 cents gas tax for \nhighway infrastructure and bridge programs over fiscal years 1990-2003. \nOver the life of this bill, this will mean that an additional $31 \nbillion in contract authority will be made available for the National \nHighway System.\n  Mr. President, we must do more to address the continuing and \ndestructive trend of Federal disinvestment in our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure. According to the Federal highway \nadministration, our investment in our Nation's highways is a full $15 \nbillion short each year, just to maintain the current inadequate \nconditions of our National Highway System. Put another way, we would \nhave to increase our national highway investment by more than $15 \nbillion a year to make the least bit of improvement in the status of \nour national highway network each year.\n  Now, as I say, joining me in offering this amendment as principal \ncosponsors are Senators Gramm, Baucus, and Warner. Although our \namendment is still in the process of being drafted, we nevertheless \nhave reached agreement as to the distribution of formula funds among \nthe various States.\n  I will now ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \ntable which sets forth the total amount of highway contract authority \nfor each State in the bill, as reported by the committee, as well as \nthe additional amount of contract authority that each State will \nreceive under the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment over a 5-year \nperiod.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nFY 1999-2003 TOTAL--INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT II,\n                 BYRD/GRAMM AMENDMENT, PRELIMINARY DATA\n                        [In

Mr. President, I encourage all Members to review carefully \nthese tables. They will show that each and every State in the Nation \nwill receive a sizable boost in funding under this amendment. Each and \nevery State will receive increases under the same percentage \ndistribution called for in the underlying bill.\n  We have not put together a new formula in this amendment. For the \ndonor States, the amendment still ensures that they will receive a \nminimum of 90 percent return on their percentage contribution to the \nHighway Trust Fund. Moreover, our amendment, like the committee \nreported bill, utilizes 10 percent of the total available resources for\n\n[[Page S10768]]\n\ndiscretionary purposes. Increased discretionary amounts of contract \nauthority will be available for the Multi-State Trade Corridors \ninitiative, as well as the 13-State Appalachian Highway Development \nSystem.\n  Mr. President, we understand that a point of order will be raised \nagainst this amendment by its opponents. But I think it is important to \nremind Members that the bill before us is not an appropriations bill; \nit is an authorization bill. A point of order lies against this \namendment because it causes the Environment and Public Works Committee \nto exceed the levels that they can authorize to be spent. Adoption of \nthis amendment will not change the scoring of the deficit by one thin \ndime.\n  Opponents of this amendment claim that the increased highway spending \nauthorized by the amendment will cause drastic cuts over the next 5 \nyears in other discretionary spending. Included on the possible list \nfor elimination or drastic cuts--I am talking about a list that I \nunderstand has been circulated by opponents--are such things as Navy \nship building, law enforcement, Section 8 housing, EPA, National Forest \nService, Title I education, Head Start, NIH, and on and on.\n  Mr. President, that argument is an obvious red herring. First of all, \nbecause highway construction requires a number of years to complete \nprojects, the amount of outlays that would be necessary in the \ndiscretionary portion of the budget to pay for the pending amendment is \nnot $30 billion. We are told instead by the experts at the CBO that the \nfigure is $21.6 billion.\n  Secondly, the enactment into law of the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner \namendment will not cause any cut in any Federal program. Let me say \nthat again. The enactment into law of the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner \namendment will not cause any cut in any Federal program.\n  In other words, each year's transportation appropriations bill from \nfiscal years 1999-2003 will contain an obligation limit for total \nhighway spending. That limitation will be set each year in light of the \ncircumstances being faced by the Appropriations Committees in any \nparticular year. Let me put it another way. If we do not adopt this \namendment, we will have precluded, for the next 5 years, any \nconsideration of additional highway spending.\n  Third, regarding the question of outlay caps on discretionary \nspending, I fully support and will strongly urge the Budget Committee \nchairman and the Senate to include in the budget resolution for fiscal \nyear 1999 the necessary provisions to increase discretionary caps for \nthe following 5 years if the economy continues to perform, so that \nthose savings will accrue. As Senators are aware, since the adoption of \nthe balanced budget agreement earlier this year, the projections of \nrevenues have dramatically increased and the projections for spending \nhave been dramatically cut. The result is a far better forecast than \nwas thought to be the case even when we all voted for the balanced \nbudget agreement this past spring. In fact, OMB's recent midsession \nreview now projects revenues over the next 5 years to be $129.8 billion \ngreater--greater--than those projected in the balanced budget \nagreement. On the spending side of the budget--and this is important--\nthe forecast is also much brighter than it was a few short months ago. \nCompared to the balanced budget agreement, OMB now projects in its \nmidsession review that total spending over the period 1998-2002 will be \n$71.6 billion less than was projected in that agreement.\n\n  Our amendment will provide that if the savings and spending for \nfiscal 1998-2002, which I have just identified, are still projected to \nexist in connection with the fiscal year 1999 budget resolution, and if \nthat budget resolution calls for using any of those spending savings, \nthen those spending savings must go toward fully funding the highway \nprogram.\n  In conclusion--and I say ``in conclusion'' because I only intended to \ntake 15 minutes of the hour, I am not here to debate this amendment \nthis afternoon. There will be plenty of time for that. Nobody is going \nto run for the doors when that time comes. There will be plenty of time \nto debate it when my colleagues and I have fully fleshed out the \namendment. But we wanted to put Senators and the country on notice that \nwe have an amendment, and we wanted to do that before this upcoming \nrecess begins.\n  Let me point out again that our amendment would provide the \nauthorization of an additional $31 billion of contract authority within \na 5-year period, 1999-2003. It doesn't add to the deficit. It will call \nfor a consideration, in the fiscal year 1999 budget process, of using \nadditional spending savings to cover the outlays that will occur from \nthe contract authority provided in this amendment.\n  So I urge all colleagues to favorably consider this amendment during \nthe next week, look at the tables, and understand that your State--I am \ntalking to all 100 Senators, to each of them individually--your State \nwill have its highway moneys increased under this amendment. Your State \nwill benefit from this amendment. So I hope that you will examine the \nbenefits that will accrue to your State in additional highway spending \nunder this amendment.\n  Mr. President, let me, in yielding the floor, thank my three \ncolleagues who are the main cosponsors of the amendment.\n  Let me also thank the two leaders for allowing us to impinge upon the \ntime of the Senate at this point for a whole hour if it is needed.\n  Let me say to all Senators who want to debate our amendments that \nthere come a time to debate it. This is an important amendment. This is \na major amendment, and its importance to the country cannot be \nexaggerated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first say that I am very proud to \njoin with Senator Byrd and our two other colleagues in this amendment. \nOur purpose today is not to introduce the amendment as a formal pending \namendment before the Senate but to basically put the facts out on the \ntable so that we can have a full and informed debate, and so that over \nthe recess people will have an opportunity to know what this amendment \ndoes, why it is important to every State in the Union, and why it is \nimportant to the future of the country.\n  I want to try to make two points as briefly as I can make them.\n  The first point is that in 1993, for the first time in the history of \nAmerica, the Congress adopted a permanent gasoline tax that did not go \nto the highway trust fund. Instead, that permanent gasoline tax went to \ngeneral revenues and was spent for general purposes. We had a strong \nbase of support in the Senate and in the House to take the action which \nwas consummated in the Taxpayer Relief Act. The amendment that I \noffered in the Finance Committee was adopted as part of that bill. We \nwere able to put the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline into the \nhighway trust fund where it belonged. That became the law of the land. \nBut our problem was that when the bill that will be before us when we \ndebate ISTEA was reported from the committee, it did not include any of \nthe money that was transferred into the trust fund when we took the \n4.3-cents-a-gallon tax from gasoline and put it where it belonged, in \nthe highway trust fund, to fund highways and to fund mass transit.\n  That produced a situation which is portrayed in this chart. I hope \nevery Member of the Senate will become familiar with this chart because \nit really shows the sleight of hand that has been underway now for \nquite a while and will certainly be perpetuated and expanded in the \nfuture if our amendment is not adopted.\n  We currently collect the money from gasoline taxes and transportation \nfuels taxes that are dedicated in the trust fund to highways and mass \ntransit. But, yet, as of today, we have $23.7 billion in that account \nthat have not been expended for the purpose that they were collected. \nOver the years they have, in fact, for all practical purposes, been \nspent for other purposes.\n  As a result of our decision to put the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on \ngasoline where it belongs, in the highway trust fund, under the ISTEA \nbill as reported from the committee, this surplus in the highway trust \nfund would grow from $23.7 billion today to a whopping $90 billion in \nthe trust funds collected for the purpose of building highways and mass \ntransit but never expended for that purpose. In the year 2003 we would \nhave $90 billion in the trust fund, and\n\n[[Page S10769]]\n\nwe would have told the American people that they were paying gasoline \ntaxes to fund highways and transportation, and, yet, that $90 billion \nwould have been spent for other purposes.\n  What the Byrd-Gramm amendment does--I am very proud that we have the \ntwo most knowledgeable people in the Senate on highway matters who have \nnow joined us as cosponsors--but what our bill does is assure that the \narea you see in blue here, this 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline, is \nspent for the purposes that it was collected.\n  This is a truth-in-government provision. This is a provision where \nyou tell people you are going to do something in government and you do \nit.\n\n  Let me also make note of the fact that, even if our amendment is \nadopted, the balance in the highway trust fund will grow from the \ncurrent $23.7 billion to a whopping $39 billion surplus by the year \n2003. So under our amendment the unspent balance in the trust fund will \ngrow every year even if we spend the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline \nwhere we told the American people that we would spend it.\n  Let me also make note that our amendment is very conservative and \nvery responsible because we don't spend the money in the year that it \nis collected. We spend it the year after it is collected. So even \nthough we will be collecting the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline and \nputting it into the trust fund for the first time in 1998, we don't \nspend any of that money in 1998. We only spend what was collected in \n1998 in fiscal year 1999. And the same process continues throughout the \nperiod of this highway bill through the year 2003.\n  We are talking about highways today because we have the highway \nportion of the bill before us. But, as everyone knows, the mass transit \ntitle of this bill was reported from the Banking Committee, and they \nhave delayed reporting their precise spending figures for technical \nreasons. When that portion of the bill is before the Senate, we intend \nour amendment to apply to it as well because mass transit receives 20 \npercent of the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline, and we want to be \nsure that this portion of the highway taxes can also be spent.\n  Under this provision, every State in the Union will get additional \nfunds. The increase per State will be about 25 percent. I think it is \nimportant to note and for every Member of the Senate to understand that \nunder this amendment the ratio of funds going to States, the proportion \ngoing to any one State, is totally unchanged.\n  But the result of truth in government, the result of spending money \nfor the purpose that it was collected, is pretty remarkable. The result \nis, if we are going to spend $27.8 billion, if this full program is \ncarried out through the year 2003, on highways, the purpose for which \nthe tax was collected to begin with, that will make a very substantial \ndifference to every State in the Union.\n  Arkansas, we know from the very effective arguments that have been \nmade by our colleagues from Arkansas, has felt slighted by this bill. \nUnder the existing bill, they would get $1.47 billion over the five \nyears covered by our amendment. But with the adoption of our amendment, \nthat would grow to $1.84 billion.\n  A similar proportional increase in each State would occur as a result \nof this amendment.\n  I want to make it clear that we are going to hear arguments \nthroughout this debate that we are, through this amendment, taking \nmoney away from other programs. I want to address this head on. I want \nto address it in two ways.\n  First of all, those who are making that argument are in essence \nclaiming that they have the right to spend this $90 billion on other \nprograms, that they have that right.\n  It reminds me of an argument that might be made by a rustler. There \nis this rustler who has been rustling cattle off the Byrd and the Gramm \nranch. We call the sheriff, and the sheriff comes out. The sheriff \nhunts him down, and he brings him to us. We decided, well, we know this \nguy. We are not going to put him in jail. But the sheriff says to him, \n``You have to quit rustling these cattle.'' So the rustler says, ``But \nI am used to eating all this beef. You know. It is easy for you to say, \nbut where am I going to get my beef?'' Well, I think the answer of \nRancher Byrd, Rancher Gramm, Rancher Baucus, and Rancher Warner under \nthis circumstance would be, ``That ain't my problem.''\n  The point is they never had the right to spend the $90 billion for \nanything other than highways to begin with. And we are going to have an \nextensive debate about that.\n  Let me address in a little bit of detail the provisions that Senator \nByrd talked about where we are dedicating, at least in terms of a \ncommitment about the future, funds to fulfill our commitment to build \nthese highways. We have, I believe, very artful language. Senator Byrd \nand Senator Byrd's staff are responsible for the language. I think it \nis language that every Member of the Senate can be supportive of. We \nare not trying to judge what kind of budgets we are going to write in \nthe future. We are not trying to make a judgment about what the economy \nis going to be like in the future, or what kind of expenditure savings \nwe are going to have in the future. We are not making any judgment as \nto how those savings might be used.\n\n  But what we are saying--I think if every Member of the Senate will \nlook at this language, they will be in agreement--we are saying, if \nthere are spending savings that occur in the future and if the Budget \nCommittee decides that any of those spending savings are going to be \nused to spend money through the Federal Government--two ifs--that, if \nthere are savings in other spending programs, and if any of those \nsavings are spent, they have to be used in total or part to fund our \ncommitment to the highway trust fund before any of those savings can be \nused for any other purpose.\n  There is only one reason that anybody would be against that language. \nThe only reason that anybody would be against that language would be if \nthey intend to spend this money for some other purpose.\n  Our point is we are collecting this gasoline tax. It has been put \ninto the trust funds by the decision of the House and the Senate. We \nmade a commitment that it was going to go to build highways and for \nmass transit. What our amendment does is guarantee that if any funds \nare spent, they are going to be spent for this purpose and spent for \nthis purpose first.\n  So I think this is a good amendment. I hope that we are going to get \na strong vote. We have a point of order. Senator Byrd made the point, \nbut I want to reiterate this. This point of order is not that we are \nbusting the budget or raising the deficit. Both of those things are not \nthe case. The point of order is really based on a technicality in the \nbudget because we are allowing funds, if they are spent, to be spent on \ntransportation needs and highways beginning in fiscal year 1999.\n  So, in the technical language of the budget, we are changing the \n302(a) allocation of budget authority to the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. We are not raising the total level of outlays. We are \nnot busting the budget. This is a simple technicality. There ought not \nto be a point of order against it. But there is. So, as a result, we \nare going to have to get 60 votes.\n  So, if you want truth in government, if you want to have a program \nwhereby when people are going to the gas pump and they are looking at \nthat big tax they are paying, and they are saying, ``Well, you know, at \nleast it is being spent on highways,'' we want that to be true. If you \nbelieve that the highway trust fund ought to be used to build the \nhighways and to build mass transit, then we believe that you are going \nto vote for this amendment. We are very hopeful that we are going to be \nsuccessful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I first want to give by deepest respects \nand thanks to the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator Chafee. He has put together a bill that has passed \nour committee unanimously 18 to 0. Not many committees can come up with \na unanimous vote on major bills.\n  But since that bill passed the committee, it has become quite \napparent that some Members want us to improve upon it. So we are going \nto try to do that with this amendment. So, I am going to give five \nreasons why I think the amendment offered by Senator\n\n[[Page S10770]]\n\nGramm, Senator Byrd, Senator Warner, and myself is such an improvement \nto this bill.\n  First, as has been pointed out, the dollars we are discussing are \ntrust fund dollars. I would point out that the American motorist who \npays these fuel taxes expect those dollars to go into transportation, \nincluding highways.\n  Second, despite what some are going to state on this floor later, \nthis amendment does not break the budget. Let me repeat that. It does \nnot break the budget.\n  Third, despite what some might say later, this amendment does not \ntake one penny--as Senator Byrd mentioned, ``not one thin dime''--from \nany other program.\n  Fourth, this amendment is needed to meet our infrastructure needs. We \nare not spending enough in America to maintain our transportation \nsystem and our highways. We certainly are not spending at the level of \nother countries.\n  And fifth, a point which I do not think is fully understood by \nSenators, the amounts provided for in the committee bill lock the \nSenate into those amounts for the next 6 years. So it is important that \nif we are going to increase spending that we do so now. Unlike some \nother spending programs, this program is funded from a trust fund.\n  So this is a much different animal, and therefore this amendment must \nbe addressed and hopefully passed. So let me elaborate on my five \npoints. Mr. President, I think it is clear, when people pay their fuel \ntaxes, they expect those dollars to go to their highways and \ntransportation so we have the best transportation system in the world. \nThere is not little dispute about that. I filled up my gas tank this \nmorning coming to work. I know how expensive it is. Today about 18.4 \ncents of a gallon goes to Federal taxes, and then there are D.C. taxes \nand State taxes. There are a lot of taxes that go into the cost of a \ngallon of gas. All we ask is that these taxes are used for \ntransportation. That is what we want, and that is what we expect when \nwe pay our fuel taxes at the pump.\n  I must remind Senators that the balance in the highway trust fund is \nincreasing. Every year it is increasing. American motorists are not \ngetting their money's worth.\n  Why is it not being spent? It is not being spent because it is being \nused to mask the true Federal deficit. That is why it is not being \nspent. A lot of appropriators and the budget folks around here like \nthose big balances in the trust funds because it masks the true \ndeficit. Again, I say. If this amendment does not pass, the balance in \nthe trust fund is going to continue to grow dramatically over the \nperiod of this bill. So Americans should know that when they pay their \nfuel taxes today, they are not being spent. A lot of it is just \naccumulating. It is a charade. It is a phony game that is being played \nwith American taxpayers. Using fuel tax revenue to mask the true budget \ndeficit is not right and it is not fair. And I have argued this many \ntimes.\n  To my second point. This amendment in no way breaks the budget. Now, \nthere are going to be some on the floor later, perhaps today or later, \nsaying, ``Oh, this breaks the budget.'' It does not break the budget. \nIt does not break the budget at all.\n  Why? Because all this amendment does is raise the contract authority \nor authorizations. It would increase contract authority by $31.6 \nbillion over 5 years. This is the 3.45 cents of the 4.3 cents just \ntransferred to the trust fund on October 1. The amendment would provide \nnew contract authority beginning in 1999. But it does not tell the \nBudget Committee this year or next year that they have to raise \ntransportation spending. It does not tell the Appropriations Committee \nto raise budget caps. It does not touch the budget resolution or \nobligation limitations for highways. Again, it is just contract \nauthority. Therefore, it does not break the budget. It does not require \nany additional spending. The amendment just says that if the projected \nsavings from OMB are realized, and if the Congress decides to spend \nthese savings, then they should be available for transportation.\n\n  It does not require that spending increases. It just says that the \nCongress may spend more for transportation if there are new savings and \nif Congress agrees to spend them on transportation. We are just \nincreasing contract authority. That is all. We increase contract \nauthority by $31.6 billion over 5 years. So, again, this does not break \nthe budget. Yes, we will have at least one point of order. But is not a \npoint of order that we have increased spending. It is a point of order \nthat the Environment and Public Works Committee has exceeded its \ncontract authority allocation. That is all. But that is a minor \ntechnicality. What really counts is, does it require any additional \nspending? The answer is no, not one cent of additional spending is \nrequired. It does not break the budget agreement in any way. I cannot \nmake that point enough.\n  Point 3. Does this amendment take anything away from any other \nFederal program? Some are going to claim that it does. The answer is \nnot one red cent. Nothing is taken away from other programs--nothing. \nNow, someone may claim that it will. They are going to say that. Not \ntrue. Not true at all.\n  Again, because this amendment only provides for raising contract \nauthority. It does not increase spending. I say again, Congress must \nstill decide to spend any new savings, if those savings are in fact \neven available. It is clear that if today OMB projects a savings, that \nsavings may be greater or lower next year. But if that is the case, \nCongress may choose not to increase spending at all. That is fine. \nAgain, the amendment will only provide new spending if savings are \navailable and if Congress decides to spend them.\n  Again, this amendment takes nothing from any program at all. To my \nfourth point, the infrastructure needs of this country. I will talk \nabout this in greater detail when we debate the amendment. But I do \nwant to state that the Department of Transportation says that there is \nabout a $15 billion annual deficit in combined infrastructure spending \nin America. We in America spend far less on highways and infrastructure \nthan other countries do as a percent of their gross domestic product. \nJapan spends four times what we do. European countries spend at least \ntwice as much.\n  I fear that if this amendment does not pass, 6 years from now we are \ngoing to find that our highways in America have deteriorated more. We \nwill continue to fall behind. Our highways and transit systems are not \nall in good shape today. There are a lot of bridges in our country that \nneed repair. There are a lot of roads in our country that need repair. \nI just cannot emphasize too much how important it is for America to \nhave the best highways and transportation system if we are going to \nremain competitive. We need to pass this amendment to make progress on \nour transportation needs.\n  And to my fifth point. Let's not lock into the contract authority \nnumbers that are in this bill unless we have to. Let's have this vote \nand see what happens. I think the case is there to increase \ntransportation spending. We need to do it now and not wait.\n  So I will sum up, Mr. President. I want to again thank all who have \nworked so hard on this amendment, particularly the authors of the \namendment. They have come up with a very sound way of solving the \nproblem of needing more money. Again, it does not break the budget in \nany way. And it does not take any dollars from any other programs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know there are others who are anxious to \nspeak, so therefore I will not go over the points that were very \nclearly enunciated by the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia, my colleague from Texas, and my partner, Senator Baucus, who \nworked with me throughout the formulation of the underlying bill \ntogether with our leadership, the committee chairman, Senator Chafee. \nSenator Baucus has worked with me throughout this process.\n\n  As subcommittee chairman, I started with a group called Step 21 and \nthen eventually we joined forces with a group headed by Senator \nBaucus--Stars 2000 is my recollection--and eventually our distinguished \nchairman joined us. We were able to craft a bill which became the \nsubject of a markup and then gained full support of the committee.\n\n[[Page S10771]]\n\n  It is, I must say, of some personal and professional concern that for \nthe moment I am at odds with my distinguished lifetime friend and \nchairman, Senator Chafee, on this matter, but I hope that in due course \nI and others can persuade him to the wisdom of this amendment. He will \nspeak for himself, I hope, momentarily.\n  As Senators Byrd and Gramm and Baucus have said very clearly, when I \nmet with them last night, I was given the assurance we did not break \nthe budget, and I think the Senators have gone through that very \nclearly.\n  We assure that every State gets a fair return, and 90 percent of the \nfunds sent to the States under the formula is a fundamental principle \nof ISTEA II. And to give absolute credence to that statement I have \njust made, which was the basic criteria for my joining in this effort, \nI ask unanimous consent to print in the Record statistical tables \nprepared by the Federal Highway Administration at my request.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I ask the Senator, what is that again?\n  Mr. WARNER. If I may, I will just pass it to the Senator. It is a \nstatistical table showing that the formula of a 90 percent return that \nwe established in the bill is followed in the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Absolutely. Let me just finish----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Where is the amendment you are following? I haven't \nfound it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I can just finish my remarks, then I \nwill be glad to yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Excuse me.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest that the Senator consult with the distinguished \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, who has put certain documentation \ninto the Record earlier today.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   COMPARISON OF SHARES UNDER ISTEA, FY 1996 HTF CONTRIBUTIONS, S. 1173 AND BYRD/GRAMM\n                                                                 [Dollars in thousands]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                ISTEA avg.\n                                                                 percent    FY 1996 HTF    90% HTF    S. 1173 5yr                Byrd/Gramm\n                            State                                 (incl.

Mr. President, throughout this debate of many, many \nmonths on the highway bill, I have expressed the need to raise the \namount of money that had to be put forward to replenish America's \ninfrastructure. And together with Senator Baucus, we cosponsored an \namendment which lost by one vote in this Chamber to augment the \nspending under this bill. I felt a certain loyalty to that coalition \nwhich had joined with me and had fought so hard to get additional \nfunding.\n  Second, the formula that we devised in the underlying bill, ISTEA II, \nI now recognize, while it was essential in my judgment we establish \nthat 90 percent return--thereby eliminating the donor-donee distinction \nthat existed, I think most unfairly, for these 6 years, and we achieved \nthat result--but I find, in consulting with many of my colleagues, that \nthe transition is very abrupt to their States, those donee States in \nparticular. This amendment, as proposed by the four of us, will help \nease that transition.\n  That point I want to make very clearly, it will help ease that \ntransition, because Senators in clear conscience on both sides of the \naisle have come to the members of the transportation committee and said \nplease, we must have some relief as we begin to transition into ISTEA \nII. This bill provides the added funds to give that needed relief, \nbadly needed in many instances. I think now with this important \namendment as part of the bill if so adopted--the Senate will adopt an \nISTEA II bill.\n  I am reasonably confident it will be along the lines of the committee \nbill. But there have been reports from the other House, and they may be \nrumor but I think there is some documentation, all the way from, ``We \nare not\n\n[[Page S10772]]\n\neven going to conference. There won't be a bill this year.'' Or it will \nbe just a 6-month bill. And I have heard a 90-day bill.\n  At another time I will explain why, in my judgment, that is not good \nfor the United States of America. Our transportation infrastructure and \nthe need for upgrading is critical for this Nation to remain \ncompetitive in a one-world market. A 6-year bill has always been the \nformat, beginning with ISTEA I, by which the Governors and the \nrespective highway authorities in the several States have done the \nlong-term planning necessary to improve their own State transportation \nsystems. They need 6 years to develop the contracts which must be \nguaranteed to have a flow of funds over that period of time. They are \nnot simple contracts, they are very complex contracts.\n  I can go on, on that point. But we will be strengthened, the U.S. \nSenate will strengthen its bill to the point where I think the House \nwill see the wisdom of the course we have charted in this body for a \nhighway bill which is anxiously being awaited by the 50 States. This \namendment, I think, will ensure the ability of the Senate to go in with \na strengthened position and persuade the House to the wisdom of having \na 6-year bill, and hopefully along the funding profile as outlined in \nthis amendment.\n  The House was deeply concerned, as was the Senate, that next year, \nwith the forecast and projections of additional revenues, that they \ncould be forthcoming for transportation. What this amendment does is \nliterally solidifies--no longer ``bet on the come''--that next year we \nwill have additional funds for highways. But this amendment in a sense \nputs that certainty into this legislation, which will enable the \nseveral States to do their planning.\n  So, those are the three basic reasons and I shall add further, such \nthat other Senators can have an opportunity to speak on this, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in the remaining time let me also thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island and others on the committee who \nworked long and hard, in putting together the bill that was reported.\n  Now, I have discussed with the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, the need of the Appalachian corridor States for additional \nmoneys, and that need hasn't been met by this bill. The distinguished \nchairman from Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee, came to my office and listened \nto my concerns. He listened courteously, and I thank him for the \nconsideration that he gave me. But we have a bill here that does not \nmeet those needs that have languished for 31 years. So I feel compelled \nto do what I can for the Appalachian States and the people therein who \nhave been promised for 31 years that those Appalachian corridors would \nbe funded. I feel the need to do what I can to advance their cause.\n  And other Senators have come to me saying, ``We need more money. We \nneed more money.'' Six years ago, when we had the ISTEA bill before the \nSenate, I found, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I found \n$8 billion, a little over $8 billion which enabled the Senate to get \noff the dime, as it were, where it was stalled. That bill wouldn't \nmove. So we divided the $8 billion, half I think among the donor States \nand half to those States which had acted to increase the resources for \ntransportation within their own borders, such as my own State, which \nhad raised its gasoline tax. It had done more than many of the other \nStates had done within the respective borders of those States to try to \nmeet those needs.\n  So, I was able in that instance to find that $8 billion, so Senators \nhave again come to me and said listen, we need more money. We need more \nmoney. So I have done my best to find that money. There will be a time, \nas I have said, when we will debate this matter. But I did want to \nthank the distinguished chairman for his work and I hope he will \nunderstand the necessity that compelled me to try to get more contract \nauthority for highway construction all over this country. I will be \nready to do my best to defend the amendment when we are ready to \nintroduce it.\n\n  Mr. President, at this time I would like to state the names of \nadditional Senators who have indicated they want to cosponsor the \namendment: Mr. Akaka, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Ford, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kennedy, \nMr. Robert Kerrey, Mr. Harry Reid, Mr. Shelby. That completes the list \nas of now.\n  I urge all Senators who, having heard this discussion today and who, \nfeeling that they would like to be cosponsors--I urge them to be in \ntouch with my office, Mr. Gramm's office, Mr. Warner's, or Mr. Baucus', \nand let us know that.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, Senator Santorum, who presided over our \npresentations, asked to be added as a cosponsor. Mr. Faircloth would \nalso like to be listed. We are not offering the amendment today, but in \nterms of putting people on notice, putting the tables out, I wanted to \nbe sure that they were listed as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I appreciate the lovely bouquets that have \nbeen thrown my way. I think I would swap them for more support than I \nam currently receiving. But, nonetheless, I appreciate it. I thank the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia and all around here, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Warner, others. I would ask the sponsors of the \namendment that we would like to see it. We are going away, now, for a \nweek, and I think it would be helpful if we could see this amendment. \nWhen will it be available?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman has asked a \npertinent question. I think I have already answered it. The amendment \nis still being drafted, but, in view of the fact that the Senate is \nabout to go into recess--I understand there won't be a session here \ntomorrow--we, who are the chief cosponsors, felt that we ought to \nannounce to Senators that there will be an amendment. We put tables in \nthe Record, and at such time as the amendment is ready to be offered, \nall Senators will then have it made available to them. Senators are \nentitled to see it when it has been finished.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would ask if it is possible to see it \nbefore we leave? In other words tonight, tomorrow, something like that?\n  Mr. BYRD. As the distinguished chairman knows, the department has had \nsome difficulty in calculating the numbers even for the bill that is \nbefore the Senate. Now we have an amendment that only last night the \nfour chief cosponsors finally agreed upon, and it takes some time for \nthe department to run the tables, run the figures and get them ready. \nSenators know that. The Senator from Rhode Island and other Senators \nknow that. We could have waited until we came back to announce that we \nhave an amendment, but we felt it was the better part of wisdom, \nbecause it is being talked around here. This amendment, without its \nhaving yet been produced, is already being criticized, and things are \nbeing said about the amendment that are not true. So we felt that \nbefore we go into recess we ought to make that clear, that there are \nmistaken conceptions of what the amendment does. We ought to set that \nrecord straight. But the amendment will be made available in due time.\n  And while I am on my feet, I would like to say we ought to have an \nISTEA bill this year. We ought not settle for a 6-months extension. We \nought not settle for a year's bill. Next year is an election year. If \nwe can't reach an agreement this year, how easy is it going to be to \nreach an agreement next year, during an election? We ought to focus our \nenergies and our attention and our talents on promoting action on the \nbill this year, a full 6-year bill.\n  Now, that's the best I can give the Senator in answer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, as I understood there is a table being \npassed around that shows the allocations to the various States. That's \nreally the tough part of the amendment. So, what is left?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will give----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The language of the amendment must be available if----\n  Mr. BYRD. I am pleased to give the Senator the table. It will also be \nin the Congressional Record in the morning, for all to see.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield, I will give him the table that \nI have quickly prepared when I first learned of the amendment, which\n\n[[Page S10773]]\n\nshows the consistency between this amendment and the distribution of \nfunds under our underlying bill, ISTEA II.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I know the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee has some comments. But let me just say briefly, I want \nto put one thing to bed around here, to rest, and that is that this gas \ntax has been collected with the people who are paying it believing it \nis all going into a highway trust fund.\n  Let me just review the bidding a little bit. Many of us--I certainly \nwas here, the Senator from Montana was on the Finance Committee at the \ntime, I don't know whether the Senator from Texas was. But in 1990, \nthere was a 5-cent-per-gallon tax started; 5-cent-per-gallon tax; 2.5 \ncents of that was to go to the general fund, 2.5 cents to the highway \ntrust fund. This was no secret. It wasn't something that was slipped \nover anybody. We all voted for it up or down, knowing 2.5 cents of that \n5 cents was going into the general fund of the United States. There is \nnone of this business of coming to the pump, looking at it and thinking \nthat tax you are paying all goes into building highways.\n  Then in 1993, we added a 4.3-cent tax, all to go to the general fund, \nand that was no secret either.\n  So, Mr. President, I just want to say that this idea that we are \nsomehow deceiving the public by piling up money in the general fund \nfrom the gasoline tax is just not accurate, and everybody who was in \nthe Senate at the time--that is everybody here--certainly those on the \nFinance Committee clearly knew where the money was going to go.\n  Let me just say something else. I know the Senator from New Mexico is \ngoing to deal with this further, but I must say, this is a world record \naround here. We passed a budget in August. That is when it was signed, \nAugust. September, October we are going to deviate from it.\n  The proponents are riding two horses here. One they are saying, ``Oh, \nit's not going to affect anything,'' and that is right, because under \nthis amendment, it goes out to the States but can't be spent until one \nof two things happen: until the other domestic discretionary accounts \nare cut or the cap is, or the overall discretionary cap is raised. That \nis true.\n  So on one hand you can say what marvelous things are going to be done \nfor the highways, every State is going to get more, how wonderful it \nis, and then you say, ``Oh, no, none of it is going to be spent; \ntherefore, it is not going to affect the budget at all.''\n  When the time comes and the decision is made, you radically alter the \nbudget that was just signed by the President a month and a half ago, \nprobably it is 2 months ago now. That is a world record for this \nChamber. Usually we don't deviate from a budget until we have gotten \ninto it a little bit, but here we change it after a little less than 2 \nmonths. I don't think that is a very good record we should be proud of \nin this Chamber. I know the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee will be speaking, and I look forward to hearing his remarks.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a point? I want to make it \nclear for the Record I voted against that 4.3-cent tax.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Maybe you did, but the idea that this was adopted by some \nmasquerade, somehow the impression ``when my wife goes to the gasoline \nstation she is thinking that all that tax money is going into the \nhighway trust fund and that if we send it anywhere else we are \ndeceiving her,'' that is nonsense. It was nonsense right from the \nbeginning, as I said, in delineating the history of what took place in \n1990 and then in 1993.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Sure. Let me say one thing, if I might, Mr. President. I \nam now in my, I guess, 20th year here, and I have been on the side of \nthe distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. I remember lifting \nthe Turkish arms embargo about the first year I came here. And then I \nhave been on the other side, against him. As a general rule, I would \nfar prefer to be on his side than against him. I find it is a much more \ncomfortable position, perhaps a safer position in many ways. So I am \nvery, very conscious that when I duel with the distinguished senior \nSenator from West Virginia, I have to be on the alert.\n  I will buckle on my breastplate of righteousness, I shall seize my \ncap of salvation, I shall grab my sword of the spirit and prepare for \ncombat.\n  Mr. BYRD. Come one, come all. This rock will fly from its firm base \nas soon as I.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island has made \nsome comments questioning the fact that people in this country--I think \nit is a fact--the people in this country go to the gas pump and buy \ngasoline under the impression that their tax money goes into the \nhighway trust fund and that it comes back to meet their transportation \nneeds.\n  Was the Senator here in 1956? I was here in 1956. I was here and I \nsupported President Eisenhower's interstate system. I was here. My wife \nwas buying gas at the pump then. In 1956, Congress created that highway \ntrust fund. She was buying gas at the gas pump then, and the people \nwere told that the gas tax was going into the trust fund tax, and that \nmoney was going to be used for highways.\n  And so for over 40 years the American people have believed that their \nmoney that they were spending at the gas tank, that portion that was \nthe Federal tax, was going into the highway trust fund. That is no \nAlice in Wonderland story. That is no make-believe story. That has been \na fact. I voted for it 41 years ago.\n  In 1990, it was diverted. That is when it was diverted, 1990. I was \nhere. I voted for that. I went over to those long meetings that we had \nwith Mr. Sununu and Mr. Darman and Mr. Domenici and I guess Mr. Warner \nwas there, Mr. Hatfield was there. Anyhow, Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle were there. And we came up with a package. Yes, we diverted \nit. We voted to do that.\n  But recently the Senator from Texas offered an amendment, which said \nthat the gasoline tax should again go into the highway trust fund.\n  So let's not break faith with the American people. They have been \ntold it is for highways, and that is what this amendment says it will \nbe used for if the savings are there. I just wanted to make that point.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I left a very important meeting because \nI thought I had the time at 5:15 or at least after they used an hour or \nso. I think I am being fair in saying they used an hour, and I was \nsupposed to follow for a half-hour.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wonder if the Senator will yield for 1 minute on this \nlast point.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will you set it for 1 minute?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Very briefly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In 1990, we enacted 2.5 cents to deficit reduction. In \n1993, the 4.3 was passed. In 1995, due to pressure from the public, we \nundid the 2.5 cents so that went to the highway trust fund. And right \nnow, because of the public pressure, we are going to put the 4.3 cents \nin the trust fund.\n  In the past, Congress has diverted, but the public is now telling \nus--and we enacted in 1995 to put 2.5 cents back in the trust fund, and \nnow we are putting 4.3 cents in because the public wants it back in the \ntrust fund.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, since there is going to be a week or \nmore intervening before we can debate the so-called amendment, I hope \nit is available for us to look at before then. I am always a little \nsuspicious when a bill isn't ready, especially when everybody is \nclamoring to get on it because it seems to me they know something I \ndon't know.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And I bet they do. I bet they know this bill is going \nto promise them all a lot more money, so why don't they all get on? \nRight, I ask Senator Gramm? Every Senator should get on it. You can \ncount on it, it is going to give you more money, you can count on it, \nwhether it is the Appalachia Regional Commission, Texas, New Mexico--\nall of you are going to get a lot more money.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will yield as much as you like.\n\n[[Page S10774]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I have two things to say. I hear that the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico has an amendment. I hear that he has one. I \nhave seen papers to that extent, memos, or letters something like that. \nI didn't read them, but I have seen them around the desks. So he, too, \nhas an amendment. I haven't seen it. We four sponsors think that even \nthough our amendment is not ready, we should clear the air and clear \nthe record as to what it will not do, because many things are being \nsaid in the Senate about our amendment that are absolutely incorrect. I \nhave seen some of the papers on the desks around here saying what this \namendment purportedly will do. We Senators wanted to clear the record \ntoday to say that it will not do this and it will not do that and it \nwill not do other things stated in the propaganda that is being spread. \nThat is all. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was delighted to yield. First, I would like to make a \npart of the Record and I would like Senators to know a little history \nabout the trust fund and whether or not there really is a surplus. At \nleast on the Republican side I would like them to read the Republican \npolicy statement issued on October 6, just a few days ago, that \nanalyzes the history of this. It will be good reading. If there ever \nwas a myth, it is the myth about the great, great trust fund buildup \nthat is there for highways that we ought to be using, everybody says; \nthis budget process is just building that big reserve and that big \nslush fund. This will tell you that is kind of a paper tiger. I would \ncall it one of the greatest myths around.\n  Having said that, let me clear up the second point. No Republican \nvoted for the 4.3-cent-gasoline tax. So I say to Senator Warner, you \ncan get up and say you didn't. You are in good company. None of them \ndid.\n  On the other hand, I can say to my friend from West Virginia, you \ndid, because every Democrat voted for it. The important thing is, what \nwas it for? I understand that in 1956 Senator Byrd's wife was buying \ngasoline at the pump. I was just a small guy then, but I was buying \ngasoline at the pump. I had a little Chevrolet, secondhand car that my \ndad gave me, and it was secondhand from his business.\n  Let me tell you, this 4.3 cents was adopted in a balanced budget \nproposal by this President, voted for by Democrats. I will tell you, \nsome of us said that it wouldn't work, and maybe it worked better than \nwe thought, but I say to my good friend from West Virginia, there was \nno diversion of highway trust fund moneys. It was voted up or down in \nthe General Treasury to reduce the deficit. We can bring that down here \nand talk about it. It was not a gasoline tax for highway use. It was a \ngasoline tax to reduce the deficit.\n  I submit, since we think we have balanced the budget, Mr. President, \nmaybe the time is to give the 4.3 cents back to the States. That might \nbe a good idea. Its original purpose was to help balance the budget. \nLet's say to the American people, ``We're giving it back to you because \nwe don't need it to balance the budget.''\n  I say to Senator Byrd, I know you want me to yield, but you have been \ndown here a long time. You used the word ``propaganda'' about what I \nsent around. I want to make sure this attack on propaganda is equal, so \nI can attack propaganda about how great this amendment is and what it \nisn't going to do.\n  Frankly, we are going to have a lot longer discussion about this, but \nit is wonderful to just visualize and think for a minute how far we \nhave come.\n  June the 5th--anybody waiting around for me to say what year--this \nyear, June the 5th, 1997, we overwhelmingly adopted a balanced budget \nresolution. And everybody was praising us. And John Warner, a wonderful \nSenator from Virginia, you are hugging Domenici saying, ``You finally \ngot it done''--June 5th.\n  Just a little while later, July 31st, this year--not 10 years ago--we \nadopted two bills, one by a vote of 85-15. Now, I imagine in this \ndebate some can stand and say I did not vote for it. Maybe Phil Gramm \ncan say that. I was not one of the 15. He did not vote for the budget \nresolution, anyway.\n  Anyway, 85 Senators voted for the bill to implement that balanced \nbudget. And lo and behold, on the same day, 92 Senators voted on a new \ntax bill for the United States of America--all part of a big plan to \nbalance the budget.\n  What actually has happened, Mr. President, and fellow Senators, is \nthat along comes a highway bill, after all that is done, and by an \naccident of time it comes after the Budget Act and on to the floor \ncomes Senators saying, ``Let's spend $31 billion more on highways than \nwe expected just on June 5th, 1997.''\n  Now, is Senator Domenici saying you are breaking the budget? Well, I \ndon't know. I am just telling you that on June the 5th you voted in a \nbudget resolution that sets obligation authority for highways, and now \nbefore the year ends you are saying, without another budget, without \nanother debate, without any decision about where the money is going to \ncome from--I will talk about that in a minute--we all decide we are \ngoing to add $31 billion to the highway program.\n  Anybody that thinks Senator Pete Domenici is not for highways has \nSenator Pete Domenici wrong. In fact, about my own State, I have to say \nthat we are not spending enough on highways. And it is going to be very \ndetrimental to the future of our State. Most of it is because we do not \nwant to spend any of our own money. And in our urban areas we put in \nabout $80 million every 2 or 3 years in a bond election. We ought to \nput $250 million, in my opinion.\n  The point is, I am for spending more money on highways. And I will \npresent an amendment that does justice to the votes of these Senators \non June 5th and July 31st. For my amendment will say: Early next year \nwhen we do a new budget resolution and we thoroughly debate--what?--\nprospects for a surplus--I am hearing people running around saying \nthere is going to be a big surplus. We are going to debate that.\n  I hope there is a great national debate because, to tell you the \ntruth, the deficits are going to be down in the year 1998, 1999, and \nthe next year dramatically from what we predicted. And I believe, \nabsent some catastrophe, in the short term we will balance the budget \nand have a lot of money left over in the year 2002.\n  But before we get too excited, during that debate we will have a \npresentation, if not by others, by me, telling you what is going to \nhappen in about 12 years or 14 when the baby boomers hit this. Just \nlike one of these giant pythons when they swallow some big monster \nanimal, they can hardly digest; it gets about that big. That is the way \nthe budget is going to go--huge.\n  Frankly, I want to tell you what I think this amendment does. I \nbelieve there is a disagreement in philosophy between the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, and his cosponsor, Senator \nGramm of Texas. Senator Gramm has said--and he put it in a circular \nthat has gone to everybody around to muster up support--and the fourth \npoint he makes in his circular is that we will not spend any more money \nas a result of spending $31 billion more on highways than we expected, \nwe will not spend any more money.\n  That does not sound possible, does it? Of course, it does. Senator \nGramm says we will take it out of the rest of Government. So what we \nhad planned to spend in Government, which incidentally for those who \nthink we were going to spend a lot of money, get ready. The \nappropriated accounts on the domestic side are expected to increase \nfive-tenths of 1 percent in each of the next 4 years, I say to my \nfriend from West Virginia. That is the number built in the law.\n  Now, think with me. Senator Gramm says, $31 billion more spent on \nhighways than contemplated, but we are not going to spend any more. \nWhere is it going to come from? Now, the version of the Senator from \nTexas is to take it out of the rest of Government, except defense, I \nassume. Wait a minute--you shake your head--it is not right.\n  It is impossible that you can spend $31 billion and not break the \ncaps that are currently established or reduce the level of spending in \nthe appropriated accounts other than transportation. It is \narithmetically impossible. That is not philosophy; that is just plain \nold numbers.\n  Now, Senator Byrd is saying, if I hear him right, ``Now wait a \nminute.''\n  Mr. BYRD: Be careful now. Be careful.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. ``I want to spend this 4.2-cent gasoline tax. I want to \nspend it\n\n[[Page S10775]]\n\non highways. On the other hand, I'm willing, when the time comes, to \nincrease the domestic caps so we don't have to cut appropriations.''\n\n  Now, is this amendment a budget buster or is it not? I guess one \ncould say we are not breaking the budget because somehow the money is \ngoing to come down from Heaven and come into this trust fund, or some \nwill say we are just going to go to the NIH and we are not going to get \nrid of it like Senator Domenici suggested, we are just going to cut it \n5 percent. And we are not going to get rid of all those items that \nsomebody read off my letter, we are just going cut them off 5, 6 \npercent. Well, everybody ought to know what we are going to cut to \nspend $31 billion. And the problem with this process: They will not \nknow until we have already put on the new map $31.6 billion in highway \nfunds.\n  That is the truth of it. Why do I think we should do it another way? \nAnd I urge you all to do it another way. I urge that we not spend the \nmoney, the 4.3 cents, the $31.6 billion, that we not obligate it now \nbut, rather, we say the following in an amendment--and if Senator Byrd \nwants to know what my amendment is, I am explaining it right now--that \nwe adopt an amendment that says, when the budget process is finished, \nand the debate has concluded on what we should do with our money next \nyear, including surpluses, and the following years, when we have \ndecided, if Congress decides to spend more money on highways then, put \nit right in the budget resolution, an automatic supplemental \nappropriation. An amendment to the Highway Act will occur so that you \nhave accomplished it and everybody has had their chance to debate where \nthe $31 billion comes from.\n  And I surmise that some of you might say, including my wonderful \ndebating friend, Senator Gramm, you might say, ``Domenici, you know, \nthey're going to put it in highways anyway.'' Well, that works both \nways. If you know they are going to vote to put it in highways, why \ndon't you wait and do it when everybody can vote on the difference \nbetween spending it here and not spending it in education or spending a \nsurplus to build highways?\n  That is a fair proposal on our part. I will draw the language for \nyou. I will let you help me. Then I will tell you, if you prevail in \nthis debate that you want some surplus going in here, that you want to \ncut other programs to put more here, I will be on the floor supporting \nyou to the best of my ability right on through.\n  Frankly, I do not think--you know, I used to be, in all honesty--I \nwill not tell you when it stopped happening, I say to Senator Byrd--but \nI used to really fret when I thought I had to come down here and argue \nwith you. Because I figured I did not know enough. And by the time you \ngot through with the process down here, you taught me a lesson. You \ntaught me it early. The rules are made for you. If you do not use them, \nit is your fault. And if I use them, it is because I have a right to.\n  I did not feel up to it back yonder. But I welcome this debate. And \nif you all win, you know, I am not going to lose any sleep. But I think \nI will make the point that this is not the way to run the Government of \nthe United States 4 months after you pass a balanced budget and you put \ncaps on what you can spend for each of the next 5 years, literally \ndollar numbers written in the law for all the domestic accounts, \nincluding highways. They are all in that cap. You cannot raise the cap \nwithout 60 votes saying, ``Raise the cap.''\n  And along comes the appropriations process, which is the other \nvehicle you can use, and you cannot--you cannot--mysteriously find $31 \nbillion to spend. You put new commitments in with the same amount of \nmoney to spend for everything--not one penny less or one penny more. It \ndoes not change. There is no inflation built into those caps. They are \nnot tied to the economy of the United States. They are flat literal \nnumbers.\n  And why are they numbers? Because we found the only thing that worked \nto control spending on the appropriated side was to say if you exceed \nthe caps, the Executive must put in an automatic sequester so it is the \nonly thing that works. And it works because twice the White House--not \nthis one--sent us a little signal. We were $40 million-some over the \ncap once, and Dick Darman said, just so you will all know that it \nworks, he sequestered every account in Government to the tune of a \ntotal of $43 million, which I think was one-tenth of one-hundredth of \none-thousandth of a percent, but to prove it works.\n  It was sort of a bit of the leftover of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. \nProbably the one notion of real consequence was the notion of a \nsequester, which most people never heard the word before. In fact, I \nhad not until you introduced the bill--or until we helped you rewrite \nthe bill or whatever. I worked on it for a long time, I say to the \nSenator.\n  I am going to quit for now because if I am going to bore the Senate \nwith my entire speech tonight they will not listen to me the next time. \nAnd I want to make sure that they all hear this and that they all hear \nmy version of this. And then they can vote as they please because that \nis what we were elected for.\n\n  I want to close by saying to all that big lobby group, believe you \nme, when you say ``lobby groups,'' don't think that the highway people \nare not lobbying. Man, oh, man, you would think that the only ones \nlobbying are the manufacturers of America. They are all out there now \nthat you have spoken tonight. When these Senators go home on this \nrecess, they will claw at them. They will already know how much more is \ngoing to be spent on their highway projects. It will not be the \ncitizens. It will be the highway builders. Nothing wrong with that. \nThere is not one Senator that said they should not, but, boy, they are \ngoing to tell you every penny is needed. And they aren't going to know \none diddly about the process going on up here or what they are \ncompeting with. It is just: Build the roads.\n  Someday we are going to build more roads. Maybe I will be voting for \nbuilding more roads. But I tell you for now, you have not come close to \nconvincing me that this is the way to do it. I urge that you go back \nand find a way to draft a contingent bill, draft a bill contingent upon \nthe Congress of the United States in the budget process increasing the \nobligational authority that you think we ought to have.\n  I am willing to help you draft that and say if Congress votes that in \nas it sets its new priorities--and, yes, I would even say decides \nwhether it wants to spend more money--then I will be right there with \nyou when the time comes seeing that you get it. But I just believe \nthat, you know--I cannot yet tonight tell you, but I will be able to in \na week, how this changes the system that was working.\n  I do not mean by that, spending the trust fund reserves. There can be \na big argument about the unified budget and taking it off budget. I \njust mean, to come in at this date just because a highway bill is due \nand add $31 billion this way without having to face up to any competing \nneeds, and leaving that competition to another day, or as one would \nsay, ``Don't worry about the competition. We'll just increase the caps \nand spend more,'' I think that ought to be done not in the context of a \nhighway bill that gives everybody some goodies that they are all prone \nto vote for, I think it should be done in a framework of the U.S. \nSenate at its best, determining what the overall expenditures of \nGovernment ought to be, and maybe I will even say tonight how much of \nthe surplus we want to spend and how much you want to leave, how much \nyou want to put in the Social Security trust fund, and all kinds of \nnice things.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will be very brief because we have other \nbusiness that is going to come before the Senate.\n  Before the Senator from New Mexico leaves, the Senator talks in terms \nof waiting, waiting until we can consider other competing needs. We are \nsaying, ``Let's keep faith with the American people.'' If there are \nsavings, let's spend the money in the trust fund for that which the \nAmerican people think it is to be spent for, not other competing needs. \nThat is just what we are saying it is being spent now for--for other \ncompeting needs. We are saying, stop it, keep faith with the American \npeople. Spend it for highways if it is going to be spent.\n  Other competing needs--like what? Cutting taxes? Is that what it is? \nThe\n\n[[Page S10776]]\n\ndistinguished Senator mentioned how the budget is going to bulge when \nthe baby boomers get on the scene. I voted against a tax cut, Senator. \nI said let's put it against the deficit, let's take what you would \nspend on a tax cut and apply it on the budget. Let's balance the budget \nwith it. I said I'm against a tax cut that the Republicans proposed and \nI'm against the cuts that the President proposed.\n  Now, we are simply saying, let's spend it for highways if it is going \nto be spent and if the savings are there. Of course, the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee and the members of the Budget Committee are going \nto make that decision. But the people need to know something now. Why \ndo we do it now? Because, we have a highway bill before the Senate, \nthat is why. Now is the time. Don't wait until the opportunity has \npassed and say, ``Well, we should have done it when the highway bill \nwas before the Senate.'' Let's do it now.\n  The distinguished Senator says he will welcome the debate.\n  I, too, welcome the debate, and we won't be running for the mountains \ncrying for the rocks to fall on us. When the debate comes, we will be \nready.\n  As I say, we just wanted to put to rest some misunderstandings that \nwere being spread. I don't blame anybody for that. They were jumping to \nunmerited conclusions. We wanted to set that straight. When the time \ncomes, the amendment will be offered, and I welcome any and all \ncosponsors, as do the other sponsors. I don't intend to convince my \nfriend from New Mexico. I honor and respect him. He is one of the \nbrightest minds I have ever seen come in this Senate, but let's keep \nfaith with the American people.\n  Ananias dropped dead, and so did Sapphira, his wife. They lied, they \nlied to God. I'm not saying anybody has lied, but I am saying we are \nnot keeping faith with the American people. The American people were \ntold by us in 1956, Senator--I was here; I was over in that other \nbody--they were told that the money was going into that trust fund and \nwould be coming back home to meet the transportation needs of the \npeople.\n  So, let's keep faith with the American people. And we will renew this \ndebate on another day, I say with great respect to all my friends.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me say it is awfully tempting to get \ninto a debate here, and I will try to avoid that as well. We will have \nan opportunity to do that the week after the recess when our amendment \nwill be before us, the bill will be before us.\n  In the words of Ronald Reagan, let me ask Senator Domenici to take a \nlittle walk with me down memory lane. When his budget was on the floor, \nI offered an amendment to take a position in the Senate that said that \nthe 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline should be put in the trust fund \nand should be spent for highways and for mass transit. By a vote of 83-\n16 Members of the U.S. Senate said yes. When the tax bill was before \nthe Finance Committee I offered an amendment to put the 4.3-cents-a-\ngallon tax on gasoline into the trust fund. By a vote of 15-5 the \nFinance Committee said yes, and that amendment was never challenged on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate. So, whatever the Senator from New Mexico \nwould like the world to be, 83 Members of the Senate said put the \ngasoline tax in the trust fund and spend it for the purpose that \ngasoline taxes have always been spent every time there has been a \npermanent gasoline tax in history before this gasoline tax, spend it \nfor that purpose on highways and mass transit.\n\n  Now, in terms of this debate about the budget, what Senator Domenici \nis saying is, ``Don't amend the highway bill; let me amend the budget. \nDon't do it today, decide it next year.''\n  We have the highway bill before us. The last highway bill that we \nwrote lasted without a change in the amount of money being spent for 6 \nlong years. The reason we debate a highway bill is to write a highway \nbill. The point here is as simple as it can be. Do you believe that the \ngasoline tax which is in the highway trust fund should be spent for \nhighways? If you do, then you are going to end up supporting the \namendment that Senator Byrd and I are offering. If you don't believe \nthat, you are going to end up opposing it.\n  Finally, in terms of the whole debate about the budget, this \namendment does not bust the budget. What this amendment does do is it \nraises the contract authority for highways so that we have an \nopportunity to compete for funds in appropriations to build highways. \nOur amendment is very clear on this point. I don't want to go much \nfurther because it is not fair to Senator Domenici, given that we don't \nhave the amendment before us, but it simply says two things, and I \nthink it is clear there are Members of the Senate who do not support \nthese two things--but I do.\n  It says, No. 1, that if you have savings by lower spending --it \ndoesn't say anything about higher revenues from economic growing, any \nof that stuff. It just says if we spend less than we have in the budget \nand if you decide to spend that money somewhere else--two ifs; it \ndoesn't say you will have the savings and it doesn't say you will spend \nit anywhere else--but it says if you do have the savings and you decide \nto spend it, you have to fund the highway trust fund first. You have to \nfund it first.\n  Now, other people say, well, what is so important about it relative \nto all these other things we spend money on? What is important about it \nis we already have a surplus of $23.7 billion where we told the \nAmerican people their money was going to build highways and we spent it \non something else, as we are doing this very day. That surplus is going \nto grow to $90 billion. Senator Byrd believes, I believe, Senator \nWarner, and Senator Baucus believe that it is fundamentally dishonest \nfor us to tell people the trust fund is for building roads and to be \nbuilding up a surplus of $90 billion where that money is being spent on \nother things.\n  So we are not making a decision here. We are not trying to write \nSenator Domenici's budget next year. We are trying to write the highway \nbill now. Senator Domenici says, ``Well, let's debate next year's \nbudget.'' We are not debating next year's budget. There is no guarantee \nthat all of us will be on the same side of that debate. What we are \ndoing is debating highways. We are saying, we have said by overwhelming \nvotes, including on Senator Domenici's budget this year, that we want \ngasoline taxes to go to the trust fund. We want those taxes to be spent \non highways. All we are saying is that we want to have a highway bill \nthat reflects the position that we have taken not once but twice. Once \nin the budget this year, once in the tax cut this year.\n  This is not a new idea. This is something that we have approved over \nand over and over again. We think the time has come to make it clear in \nthe highway bill--not in some future budget we may write, but in the \nhighway bill--that when we tell people their gasoline tax is going to \nhighways, we want it to go into highways.\n  In terms of our language on the budget, we are just simply saying if \nyou have outlay savings and if you spend them--two big ifs; if you have \noutlay savings and you spend them--you have to fund the highway trust \nfund first.\n  I think the overwhelming majority of the American people are for it. \nI know there are other spending interests that would rather have the \nmoney. That is not the debate today. The debate today is about \nhighways, and we are for them and we want to build them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, at a later date I will enjoy entering \ninto the discussion that has just been commenced. I assure the Senate \nit is not finished. I have great fondness for all participants, but I \nhave two worries. One worry is the worry that the head of the Federal \nReserve just announced we are coming into a period of inflation, and \nthe second worry is whether the impact of the amendment as supported by \nthe Senator from Texas would require a reduction in discretionary \nspending for other accounts in the years covered by the amendment of \nthe Senator from West Virginia. That still has to be examined, in my \nopinion.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens and Mr. Byrd pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1292 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n[[Page S10777]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, first, I see the Democratic leader here. \nI will be very pleased to yield to my friend. We have a series of items \nand we have not yet introduced our bill, but we would be pleased to \nlisten to the leader who has this time reserved.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Alaska.

Mr. President, Lenny Oursler is somebody who has been \nwith us here in the Senate for a long time. Tomorrow he will be leaving \nthe Senate to work in the Congressional Affairs Office of the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  Lenny began work in the Senate stationery store in September 1981. He \nbegan work in the Democratic cloakroom in April of 1987. He has worked \nover 16 years of Government service, 10 in the cloakroom, and he has \nbeen running the cloakroom, now, for the last 5 years. His tasks have \nbeen varied, including keeping Senators and staff apprised of floor \naction, acting as soothsayer in predicting upcoming schedules with \namazing accuracy, making sure that all Democrats reach the floor in \ntime to cast their votes, extending his exuberant hotlines with his \ntrademark ``thank you.''\n  I don't know of anybody who has worked in that capacity who is more \nrespected, and that respect is well earned. He is always available. He \nfrequently works long, long hours and autographs his work with \nexcellence. There will be a large void in the cloakroom that will be \nclearly difficult to fill. He is well liked by Senators and staff \nalike. He always has a cheerful disposition, always has something nice \nto say, a very positive person with an incredible outlook on life. \nOccasionally he even has a funny story to share that I can repeat.\n  Indeed, the only fault I can think of is that he is a diehard Cubs \nfan and he may never be broken of that terrible habit. I have been told \nby some of his friends that on the golf course he has a painfully ugly \nslice and his most valuable club is a ball retriever.\n  I know that Lenny will miss his family here. I know, too, he is \nlooking forward to the new challenges at IRS. He is looking forward to \nmore predictable and regular hours so he can spend more time with his \nyoung sons, Nathan and Benjamin, and wife Sara. I know I speak for all \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle in wishing him luck and \ntelling Lenny we will truly miss him.\n  I yield the floor and again thank the senior Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10777-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDISAPPROVING THE CANCELLATIONS TRANSMITTED BY THE PRESIDENT ON OCTOBER \n                                6, 1997\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have a bill at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be introduced and referred to \nthe appropriate committee.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I wish to have it read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                                S. 1292\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     Congress disapproves of cancellations 97-4, 97-5, 97-6, 97-7, \n     97-8, 97-9, 97-10, 97-11, 97-12, 97-13, 97-14, 97-15, 97-16, \n     97-17, 97-18, 97-19, 97-20, 97-21, 97-22, 97-23, 97-24, 97-\n     25, 97-26, 97-27, 97-28, 97-29, 97-30, 97-32, 97-33, 97-34, \n     97-35, 97-36, 97-37, 97-38, 97-39, and 97-40, as transmitted \n     by the President in a special message on October 6, 1997, \n     regarding Public Law 105-45.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is cosponsored by the Senator from West Virginia \nand a series of other Senators, Mr. President. I do wish to have it \nreferred.\n  I had it read because I think the Senate and those who are watching \nthis proceeding should know how sanitized this process is. Those \nprojects listed by the simple numbers in the President's message were \ndenied the use of $287 million for the men and women of the armed \nservices. As was pointed out by Senator Faircloth of North Carolina, \nthat is approximately the amount of money we are spending per month in \nBosnia. Yet, each one of these projects was very much sought after by \nthe Department of Defense, was reviewed by eight committees of the \nCongress, was reviewed on the floor of the House and here on the floor \nof the Senate and in conference, and once again brought back to each \nHouse.\n  I say again, the Senator from West Virginia makes a compelling case \nfor his position, if this is to be the policy of this administration, \nif there is to be an indiscriminate use of the line-item veto without \nregard to waste, without regard to the necessity of the money that \nCongress says must be spent.\n  So, I look forward to this bill being referred to our committee. When \nwe return from the coming recess we shall proceed expeditiously. \nSenator Byrd and I have agreed these matters will be kept in full \ncommittee so we will not have to go through the subcommittee process. \nAnd we will return this bill to the Senate as quickly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10777-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 830\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in support of \nHouse Concurrent Resolution 8. The United States is beginning to take \nsteps to maintain and protect our coral reef ecosystems. This \nresolution encourages us to continue to improve our stewardship of \nthese treasures in the sea. Coral reefs are among the most biologically \ndiverse and productive marine habitats. They occur throughout the \nworld's tropical and subtropical regions and in the waters of two U.S. \nstates, including my home state of Hawaii.\n  Mr. President, coral reefs are vital to coastal economies, serving as \nthe basis for coastal and marine tourism in several U.S. states and \nterritories. Reefs also make substantial economic contributions by \nsupporting subsistence and commercial reef fisheries. Coral reefs and \nthe ecosystems they support are under increasing pressure, primarily \nfrom human activity. Of approximately 600,000 square kilometers of \ncoral reefs worldwide, estimates are that 10 percent have been degraded \nbeyond recovery and an additional 30 percent are likely to decline \nsignificantly within the next 20 years.\n  We must strengthen our commitment to be stewards of coral reefs, to \ndiscourage harmful fisheries and other practices, to monitor and assess \nthe health of these unique systems; and improve research of and \neducation about coral reef ecosystems. Further, we must ensure that we \nbalance preservation with sustainable use of our coral reef resources. \nWe must identify factors contributing to the global decline of coral \nreef ecosystems and discourage overfishing and other practices that are \nharmful to coral reefs and human health.\n  It is significant that this resolution is passed during the \nInternational Year of the Reef to focus attention on research and \npublic awareness of coral reef issues. The resolution is an important \nstep to promote preservation and sustainable use of coral reef \nresources worldwide. I appreciate the help of other Senators who have \nworked to see that our coral reefs are provided the attention that they \ndeserve.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, Amtrak is at a crisis point. Actually, \nit faces two crises: a strike and the financial crisis brought about by \nfailure to reform the railroad. Reform is a prerequisite to accessing \nthe much-needed capital Congress provided for the railroad in the \nBalanced Budget bill. Congress decided when that bill was passed that \nit did not make sense to provide that money unless the railroad was \nable to act more like a business. I strongly support intercity \npassenger rail but believe that reform is essential before putting this \nmajor financial commitment in place.\n  First, and most immediately, Amtrak is facing a possible national \nshut down because of an impasse between the Brotherhood of Maintenance \nof Way Employees (BMWE) and Amtrak over wages and work rules. At \nquestion is Amtrak's ability to pay for any increase in wages during \nthe difficult financial times the railroad is currently going through.\n  Using the Railway Labor Act, the President has named a Presidential \nEmergency Board to recommend a solution to the dispute. It concluded \nits investigation and made its recommendations. The parties are now in \na 30 day ``cooling off'' period to consider the recommendations. If no \nagreement is reached by the end of this period, which falls on October \n22nd, we could have a strike or a management ``lockout of employees''. \nEither action would have the effect of shutting down all commuter \noperations, as well as other services, across the country. A strike \nwould not be confined to the Northeast Corridor, but would affect all \nof the passengers in the entire Amtrak system.\n  Amtrak's largest operations are in the Northeast Corridor, where a \nlarge number of commuter authorities between Washington, New York and \nBoston depend on that infrastructure to operate their railroads.\n  They include: the MBTA or Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, \nCONNDOT, Long Island Railroad, NJ Transit, the SEPTA or Southeastern \nPennsylvania Transportation Authority, and the two local services, the \nMARC or Maryland Commuter service and the VRE or Virginia Railway \nExpress. Each one of these commuter authorities use the Northeast \nCorridor. If Amtrak cannot operate the Corridor, these services come to \na halt. In addition, freight carriers such as Conrail who use the \nCorridor would be seriously affected, because Amtrak operates much of \nthe track on the Northeast corridor.\n  Mr. President, let me put this in perspective. When a 60-day cooling \noff period recently expired in California, the San Francisco Bay Area's \ncommuter railroad was shut down by a strike which stranded 270,000 \ncommuters.\n  Dispatchers at Norfolk Southern, which carries commuters between \nManassas, Virginia, and Washington, DC recently called a ``wildcat'' \nstrike for three hours and the VRE had to cancel one-half of its \nafternoon trains.\n  But if Amtrak is shut down, it won't be one commuter authority \nparalyzed as we saw in San Francisco or Virginia, it will be many. It \nwon't be thousands of commuters, it will be millions.\n  If this happens, the strike in San Francisco will pale by comparison.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues need to be aware of this situation, \nbecause the Senate needs to address it head-on before we leave in \nNovember.\n  Congress has to act because the future of America's railroad depends \non it. Amtrak is simply in a no-win situation. Amtrak cannot afford the \nterms of the PEB and it cannot afford a strike.\n  The PEB recommended a package of wage increases recently implemented \nby the profitable freight railroads. The freight deal for the BMWE \nwould cost Amtrak $25 million in FY98. If it were extended to all of \nAmtrak's employees, it would cost Amtrak $250 million. I seriously \ndoubt that Congress would appropriate funds for these wages. As it is, \nthe railroad is currently borrowing just to meet existing daily \nexpenses.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues have to be realistic. I look forward to \nworking with both the Majority Leader and Senate Labor Committee \nChairman to find the right solution to this dilemma.\n\n  Mr. President, in that spirit, I plan to move forward on Amtrak's \nreform legislation. I have had extensive discussions with the Majority \nLeader on this matter and he feels the same way.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator from Texas is correct. Amtrak is an important \npart of the national transportation system, not just for the Northeast \nCorridor, but for the entire interstate passenger rail system. This \nsummer, in the Taxpayer Relief Act, Congress provided Amtrak with a \nsecure source of funding for capital assets--some $2.3 billion for \ninfrastructure. I worked hard for those funds, against considerable \nopposition, as did the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation.\n  Rail transportation will continue to play a critical role in the \nAmerican intermodal passenger system through the 21st century. However, \nrail transportation of passengers cannot be done without federal and \nstate funding. It simply cannot be done. Just as commercial air \ntransportation of passengers would have never gotten off the ground \nwithout federal and state assistance, rail transportation of passengers \nwill not progress unless Congress provides infrastructure assistance.\n  Congress is willing to support Amtrak, on the condition that Amtrak \nbe reformed. That is why we insisted that not one dime of that $2.3 \nbillion be spent until a reform package is approved by Congress.\n  If Amtrak is to survive, it is critical that we complete our work on \nthe authorizing legislation. However, the Senate still has some \ncolleagues who are holding up the authorization bill over labor \nprovisions. These provisions are essentially identical to language that \nlabor supported just last year. Now some of our colleagues find them \nunacceptable. Organized labor has joined the Administration in creating \na moving target. If this continues, Amtrak may never get the capital we \nprovided.\n  Mr. President, there will be no capital, I repeat, no $2.3 billion in \ncapital funds provided until an authorization is enacted.\n  I support a national rail system, but I will not support continued \ninefficient use of taxpayers money.\n  If Amtrak is ever going to operate like a business, it must have \nflexibility. It needs freedom from federal laws\n\n[[Page S10782]]\n\nthat tie its hands at the collective bargaining table. Amtrak's labor \nrules must be the same as the private sector's, just like in other \ntransportation modes. Labor's unwillingness to negotiate makes it \nappear that severance packages are more important than rail passenger \nservice.\n  Mayor John Robert Smith, of Meridian, Mississippi, has noted that \nrail labor's message seems to be that they are more willing to allow \nAmtrak to go under and sacrifice all 23,000 Amtrak employees to \nunemployment than to allow collective bargaining in the reform bill. \nLike me, he is appalled that the rail union leadership, supposedly \nrepresenting its workers, would abandon them for its own purposes. \nEqually amazing is the fact that the Amtrak reform language is language \nthat the union leadership itself once drafted, supported, and came in \nmy office to ask me to support. And I did.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The Majority Leader has summed up this situation \nexactly. If we really care about our national rail passenger system, \nthe communities that it serves, the employees that work there and the \nrole it plays in our transportation infrastructure, then we need to \ntake up and pass the Amtrak authorization bill that has been reported \nfrom the Commerce Committee. If the Senate wants to give Amtrak the \ntools it needs to run a national system and collectively bargain with \nthe employees, the Senate needs to act now.\n  The clock is ticking and time is running out. Congress needs to act \nor there most likely will be a national rail strike, crippling \ntransportation of people and goods across the country. Congress also \nneeds to act on the Amtrak reforms to ensure it receives adequate \ncapital funding and becomes solvent. If Congress doesn't act, there \nwill be no national rail passenger system.\n  Mr. LOTT. Senator Hutchison and I are committed to bring the Amtrak \nreform bill to the floor, but not against a swell of opposition. It's a \nvery clear cut choice. My colleagues need to decide if they want a \nnational rail system or not.\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join \nwith my colleagues in celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month. Hispanic \nHeritage Month pays a special tribute to a group of Americans that have \nmade important and lasting contributions to this country's political, \ncultural and intellectual life.\n  Hispanic Americans are people of diverse background. Their forebears \ncame from Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Central and South America, and \nSpain--at different times and for different reasons. Nonetheless, they \nshare a common culture and a deeply held belief in the American Dream. \nThey came here to share in the freedom and prosperity that we have \nachieved as a nation and have added greatly to that richness.\n  It is true that Hispanic-Americans faced discrimination in this \ncountry. In recent years, however, we have made great strides to \neliminate legal and societal barriers to their full integration into \nAmerican life. Since the passage of laws barring employment \ndiscrimination, Hispanics have made great advancements economically \nand, with the passage of the Voting Rights Act, have increased their \nparticipation in the political process. There are currently 17 members \nof the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n  Just recently, a great Hispanic Congressional leader, Congressman \nHenry B. Gonzalez, announced his retirement to the great sadness of his \ncolleagues. Henry Gonzalez has served as the dean of the Hispanic \nCaucus and is the former chairman, and now ranking member, of the \nCommittee on Banking and Financial Services.\n  I proudly worked with him when I served in the House of \nRepresentatives and witnessed for myself his hard work and commitment \nto doing what is right. Dean Gonzalez has given 36 years of dedicated \nservice to his constituents in Texas, the Hispanic community and the \nAmerican people. He came to Washington in 1961, after serving in the \nSan Antonio City Council and the Texas State Legislature, and was the \nfirst Hispanic Congressman ever elected from the State of Texas. And \nback in December, 1976, Dean Gonzalez, with 4 other members of \nCongress, founded the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n  Dean Gonzalez has served as a leader and trail blazer for Hispanic-\nAmericans and an inspiration to all Americans. He demonstrated to all \nof us that, as a nation, we are capable of coming together, of \novercoming discrimination, and of celebrating the cultural bounty \nbrought by people of all backgrounds. When he leaves the House later \nthis year, I know that he will be sorely missed by his colleagues in \nthe House of Representatives and by those of us in the Senate who had \nthe good fortune to work with him.\n  Dean Gonzalez is just one of many great Hispanic-Americans. I am \nproud to add my tribute to these Americans and thank them for enriching \nour social, intellectual and artistic life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10781-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10782-S10786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE STRATEGIC RATIONALE FOR NATO ENLARGEMENT\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. Prsident, this week the Committee on Foreign Relations \nbegan a comprehensive series of six hearings on NATO enlargement. I \ncommend Chairman Helms for holding these hearings at this busy time. He \nand I have met at great length to construct the agenda as preparation \nfor the committee's acting expeditiously next year to consider the \nenlargement amendment to the Washington Treaty.\n  At the committee's first hearing on October 7, Secretary of State \nMadeleine Albright outlined the adminsitration's strategic rationale \nfor enlargement. Mr. President, I ask permission for the text of \nSecretary Albright's statement be printed in the Record. Following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. The second hearing today will feature testimony of \ndistinguished experts who are for and against enlargement. Later in the \nmonth the committee will hear examinations of cost and burden-sharing, \nof the qualifications for membership of the three candidate countries--\nPoland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, and of the new relationship \nbetween NATO and Russia. The final hearing will be reserved for public \ntestimony from individuals and groups with special interest in the NATO \nenlargement issue.\n  Through these hearings, the Committee on Foreign Relations hopes to \ninform not only the entire Senate on this critically important issue, \nbut also the American public.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I have spoken many times in \nsome detail on this floor about the issue of NATO enlargement. As the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations launches its series of hearings, I would \nlike briefly to recapitulate why I believe NATO enlargement is in the \nbest interest of the United States.\n  Europe remains a vital area of interest for the United States for \npolitical, strategic, economic, and cultural reasons. A sizable \npercentage of the world's democracies are in Europe, and the continent \nremains a major global economic player and partner of the United \nStates. The European Union, with a combined population a third larger \nthan ours, has a combined gross domestic product that exceeds ours.\n  While the United States has a larger and less balanced trading \nrelationship with Asia than with Europe, we invest far more in Europe. \nSeveral new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe have highly \neducated work forces, already boast rapidly expanding economies, and \nalready attract considerable American investment. Moreover, most \nAmericans trace their ethnic and cultural roots to Europe, and millions \nretain personal ties to it.\n  Other than North America, no other part of the world can match \nEurope's combination of political, economic, military, and cultural \npower. By any geopolitical standard, it would be a catastrophe for U.S. \ninterests if instability would alter the current situation in Europe.\n  Of course no one believes that the Russian Army is poised to pour \nthrough the Fulda Gap in Germany--NATO's horror scenario for 45 years. \nRather, the threats to stability in Europe have changed, but they are, \nif anything, even more real than those of the cold war: ethnic and \nreligious hatred as horrifyingly shown in the hundreds of thousands \nkilled, raped, made homeless, or otherwise brutalized in Bosnia, and \nthe well-organized forces of\n\n[[Page S10783]]\n\ninternational crime, whose tentacles extend from Moscow and Palermo to \nNew York and Los Angeles.\n  Unfortunately, the history of the 20th century has demonstrated that \nout of enlightened self-interest the United States must play a leading \nrole in organizing the security of Europe. In two world wars and lately \nin Bosnia without American leadership the countries of Europe have been \nunable to resolve their differences peacefully.\n  Translated into 1997 terms it means that we must lead the Europeans \nto create a new security architecture to guarantee stability to the \nareas most vulnerable to disruption, namely Central and Eastern Europe, \nwhere newly independent states are striving to create and soldify \npolitical democracy and free markets. It is a difficult process, which \nif not put into a larger framework could spin out of control.\n  It is in this context that the enlargement of NATO must be \nseen. During the cold war, NATO provided the security umbrella under \nwhich former enemies like France and Germany were able to cooperate and \nbuild highly successful free societies.\n\n  It was the framework in which former pariahs like Germany, Italy, and \nSpain could be reintegrated into democratic Europe. And it was NATO \nthat kept the feud between Greece and Turkey from escalating to \nwarfare.\n  The enlargement of NATO can now serve to move the zone of stability \neastward to Central Europe and thereby both prevent ethnic conflicts \nfrom escalating and forestall a scramble for new bilateral and \nmultilateral pacts along the lines of the 1930's from occurring.\n  In fact, it is already happening. In anticipation of NATO membership, \nseveral Central and East European countries have recently settled long-\nstanding disputes.\n  If NATO were not to enlarge, however, the countries between Germany \nand Russia would inevitably seek other means to protect themselves. The \nquestion for today is not, as is often assumed, enlarge NATO or remain \nthe same. The status quo is simply not an option.\n  Finally, there is the moral argument for enlargement. For 40 years \nthe United States loudly proclaimed its solidarity with the captive \nnations who were under the heel of communist oppressors. Now that most \nof them have cast off their shackles, it is our responsibility to live \nup to our pledges to readmit them into the West through NATO and the \nEuropean Union when they are fully qualified.\n  NATO enlargement, of course, like any venture, is not cost-free. \nEarlier this year the Pentagon issued a study that estimated the cost \nto the United States to be around $200 million per year for 10 years. \nOther estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and by the Rand \nCorp. have varied considerably, according to risk assumptions. At the \nJuly NATO Summit in Madrid, the North Atlantic Council directed the \nAlliance to come up with a definitive cost estimate for the NATO \nministerial meeting in December.\n  Whatever the final, authoritative cost estimate turns out to be, we \nmust be certain that our current allies, and our future allies, pay \ntheir fair share of the enlargement costs.\n  Similarly, before we in the Senate vote on whether or not to admit \nPoland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary to NATO, we must settle what we \nplan to do in Bosnia after the expiration of the mandate for SFOR in \nJune 1998. That in itself is an immensely complicated topic, for which \nthere is inadequate time to discuss today. After my latest trip to \nBosnia at the end of August, I am more convinced than ever that we are \nmaking progress and that we must not abandon the international effort \nto reach a lasting, peaceful, and just solution for that troubled land. \nBut whatever post-SFOR plan we hammer out, it must be done on the basis \nof sharing the risks and costs with our European allies and with non-\nNATO contributors to SFOR.\n  NATO enlargement need not adversely affect our relations with Russia. \nIn fact, we must redouble our peaceful engagement with Russia in the \nhope that its nascent democracy and free market system will mature \nsufficiently so that some day it may fully join the Western world. The \nNATO-Russia Founding Act of May 1997 is a significant step in the right \ndirection.\n  Enlargement plans have been accompanied by a redefinition of NATO's \nmission and force posture. The alliance's primary mission remains the \nsame: treating an attack on one member as an attack on all, and \nresponding through the use of armed force if necessary.\n  NATO's new strategic concept emphasizes rapid and flexible \ndeployment. The three new members, plus other countries like Slovenia \nand Romania in the near future, will enhance NATO's ability to project \npower, if necessary, into crisis areas like the Middle East.\n  In addition, in the current post-cold war situation, missions like \npeacekeeping, sometimes in cooperation with non-NATO powers, have \nbecome possible. The SFOR joint effort in Bosnia with Russia and \nseveral other non-NATO countries, which I mentioned earlier, is an \nexcellent example.\n  NATO enlargement corresponds to America's security requirements in \nthe 21st century. As long as the costs of enlargement are equitably \nshared among current and future NATO members, and as long as we have \nagreed upon a fair and coherent plan for Bosina after SFOR, I believe \nthat my Senate colleagues will vote to ratify NATO enlargement when it \ncomes before us next spring.\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nStatement by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright before the Senate \n              Foreign Relations Committee, October 7, 1997\n\n       Chairman Helms, Senator Biden, members of the committee: It \n     is with a sense of appreciation and anticipation that I come \n     before you to urge support for the admission of the Czech \n     Republic, Hungary and Poland to NATO.\n       Each of us today is playing our part in the long unfolding \n     story of America's modern partnership with Europe. That story \n     began not in Madrid, when the President and his fellow NATO \n     leaders invited these three new democracies to join our \n     Alliance, nor eight years ago when the Berlin Wall fell, but \n     half a century ago when your predecessors and mine dedicated \n     our nation to the goal of a secure, united Europe.\n       It was then that we broke with the American aversion to \n     European entanglements, an aversion which served us well in \n     our early days, but poorly when we became a global power. It \n     was then that we sealed a peacetime alliance open not only to \n     the nations which had shared our victory in World War II, but \n     to our former adversaries. It was then that this committee \n     unanimously recommended that the Senate approve the original \n     NATO treaty.\n       The history books will long record that day as among the \n     Senate's finest. On that day, the leaders of this body rose \n     above partisanship and they rose to the challenge of a \n     pivotal moment in the history of the world.\n       Mr. Chairman, I believe you are continuing that tradition \n     today. I thank you for your decision to hold these hearings \n     early, for the bipartisan manner in which you and Senator \n     Biden are conducting them, and for the serious and \n     substantive way in which you have framed our discussion.\n       I am honored to be part of what you have rightly called the \n     beginning of the process of advice and consent. And I am \n     hopeful that with your support, and after the full national \n     debate to which these hearings will contribute, the Senate \n     will embrace the addition of new members to NATO. It would be \n     fitting if this renewal of our commitment to security in \n     Europe could come early next year, as Congress celebrates the \n     50th anniversary of its approval of the Marshall Plan.\n       As I said, and as you can see, I am very conscious of \n     history today. I hope that you and your colleagues will look \n     back as I have on the deliberations of 1949, for they address \n     so many of the questions I know you have now: How much will a \n     new alliance cost and what are its benefits? Will it bind us \n     to go to war? Will it entangle us in far away quarrels?\n       We should take a moment to remember what was said then \n     about the alliance we are striving to renew and expand today.\n       Senator Vandenberg, Chairman Helms' extraordinary \n     predecessor, predicted that NATO would become ``the greatest \n     war deterrent in history.'' He was right. American forces \n     have never had to fire a shot to defend a NATO ally.\n       This Committee, in its report to the Senate on the NATO \n     treaty, predicted that it would ``free the minds of men in \n     many nations from a haunting sense of insecurity, and enable \n     them to work and plan with that confidence in the future \n     which is essential to economic recovery and progress.'' Your \n     predecessors were right. NATO gave our allies time to rebuild \n     their economies. It helped reconcile their ancient \n     animosities. And it made possible an unprecedented era of \n     unity in Western Europe.\n       President Truman said that the NATO pact ``will be a \n     positive, not a negative, influence\n\n[[Page S10784]]\n\n     for peace, and its influence will be felt not only in the \n     area it specifically covers but throughout the world.'' And \n     he was right, too. NATO gave hope to democratic forces in \n     West Germany that their country would be welcome and secure \n     in our community if they kept making the right choices. \n     Ultimately, it helped bring the former fascist countries into \n     a prosperous and democratic Europe. And it helped free the \n     entire planet from the icy grip of the Cold War.\n       Thanks in no small part to NATO, we live in a different \n     world. Our Soviet adversary has vanished. Freedom's flag has \n     been unfurled from the Baltics to Bulgaria. The threat of \n     nuclear war has sharply diminished. As I speak to you today, \n     our immediate survival is not at risk.\n       Indeed, you may ask if the principle of collective defense \n     at NATO's heart is relevant to the challenges of a wider and \n     freer Europe. You may ask why, in this time of relative \n     peace, are we so focused on security?\n       The answer is, we want the peace to last. We want freedom \n     to endure. And we believe there are still potential threats \n     to our security emanating from European soil.\n       You have asked me, Mr. Chairman, what these threats are. I \n     want to answer as plainly as I can.\n       First, there are the dangers of Europe's past. It is easy \n     to forget this, but for centuries virtually every European \n     nation treated virtually every other as a military threat. \n     That pattern was broken only when NATO was born and only in \n     the half of Europe NATO covered. With NATO, Europe's armies \n     prepared to fight beside their neighbors, not against them; \n     each member's security came to depend on cooperation with \n     others, not competition.\n       That is one reason why NATO remains essential, even though \n     the Cold War is over. It is also one reason why we need a \n     larger NATO, so that the other half of Europe is finally \n     embedded in the same cooperative structure of military \n     planning and preparation.\n       A second set of dangers lies in Europe's present. Because \n     of conflict in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union, \n     Europe has already buried more victims of war since the \n     Berlin Wall fell than in all the years of the Cold War. It is \n     sobering to recall that this violence has its roots in the \n     same problems of shattered states and hatred among ethnic \n     groups that tyrants exploited to start this century's great \n     wars.\n       Finally, Mr. Chairman, and most important, we must consider \n     the dangers of Europe's future. By this I mean direct threats \n     against the soil of NATO members that a collective defense \n     pact is designed to meet. Some are visible on Europe's \n     horizon, such as the threat posed by rogue states with \n     dangerous weapons that might have Europe within their range \n     and in their sights. Others may not seem apparent today, in \n     part because the existence of NATO has helped to deter them. \n     But they are not unthinkable.\n       Within this category lie questions about the future of \n     Russia. We have an interest in seeing Russian democracy \n     endure. We are doing all we can with our Russian partners to \n     see that it does. And we have many reasons to be optimistic. \n     At the same time, one should not dismiss the possibility that \n     Russia could return to the patterns of its past. By engaging \n     Russia and enlarging NATO, we give Russia every incentive to \n     deepen its commitment to democracy and peaceful relations \n     with neighbors, while closing the avenue to more destructive \n     alternatives.\n       We do not know what other dangers may arise 10, 20, or even \n     50 years from now. We do know enough from history and human \n     experience to believe that a grave threat, if allowed to \n     arise, would arise. We know that whatever the future may \n     hold, it will be in our interest to have a vigorous and \n     larger alliance with those European democracies that share \n     our values and our determination to defend them.\n       We recognize NATO expansion involves a solemn expansion of \n     American responsibilities in Europe. It does not bind us to \n     respond to every violent incident by going to war. But it \n     does oblige us to consider an armed attack against one ally \n     an attack against all and to respond with such action as we \n     deem necessary, including the use of force, to restore the \n     security of the North Atlantic area.\n       As Americans, we take our commitments seriously and we do \n     not extend them lightly. Mr. Chairman, you and I do not agree \n     on everything, but we certainly agree that any major \n     extension of American commitments must serve America's \n     strategic interests.\n       Let me explain why welcoming the Czech Republic, Hungary \n     and Poland into NATO meets that test.\n       First, a larger NATO will make us safer by expanding the \n     area in Europe where wars simply do not happen. This is the \n     productive paradox at NATO's heart: By imposing a price on \n     aggression, it deters aggression. By making clear that we \n     will fight, if necessary, to defend our allies, it makes it \n     less likely our troops will ever be called upon to do so.\n       Now, you may say that no part of Europe faces any immediate \n     threat of armed attack today. That is true. And I would say \n     that the purpose of NATO enlargement is to keep it that way. \n     Senator Vandenberg said it in 1949: ``[NATO] is not built to \n     stop a war after it starts, although its potentialities in \n     this regard are infinite. It is built to stop wars before \n     they start.''\n       It is also fair to ask if it is in our vital interest to \n     prevent conflict in central Europe. There are those who imply \n     it is not. I'm sure you have even heard a few people trot out \n     what I call the ``consonant cluster clause,'' the myth that \n     in times of crisis Americans will make no sacrifice to defend \n     a distant city with an unpronounceable name, that we will \n     protect the freedom of Strasbourg but not Szczecin, \n     Barcelona, but not Brno.\n       Let us not deceive ourselves. The United States is a \n     European power. We have an interest not only in the lands \n     west of the Oder river, but in the fate of the 200 million \n     people who live in the nations between the Baltic and Black \n     Seas. We waged the Cold War in part because these nations \n     were held captive. We fought World War II in part because \n     these nations had been invaded.\n       Now that these nations are free, we want them to succeed \n     and we want them to be safe, whether they are large or small. \n     For if there were a major threat to the security of their \n     region, if we were to wake up one morning to the sight of \n     cities being shelled and borders being overrun, I am certain \n     that we would choose to act, enlargement or no enlargement. \n     Expanding NATO now is simply the surest way to prevent that \n     kind of threat from arising, and thus the need to make that \n     kind of choice.\n       Mr. Chairman, the second reason why enlargement passes the \n     test of national interest is that it will make NATO stronger \n     and more cohesive. The Poles, Hungarians and Czechs are \n     passionately committed to NATO and its principles of shared \n     responsibility. Experience has taught them to believe in a \n     strong American leadership role in Europe. Their forces have \n     risked their lives alongside ours from the Gulf War to \n     Bosnia. Just last month, Czech soldiers joined our British \n     allies in securing a police station from heavily armed \n     Bosnian Serb extremists.\n       Mr. Chairman, I know you have expressed concern that \n     enlargement could dilute NATO by adding too many members and \n     by involving the alliance in too many missions. Let me assure \n     you that we invited only the strongest candidates to join the \n     Alliance. And nothing about enlargement will change NATO's \n     core mission, which is and will remain the collective defense \n     of NATO soil.\n       At the same time, it is important to remember that NATO has \n     always served a political function as well. It binds our \n     allies to us just as it binds us to our allies. So when you \n     consider the candidacy of the Czech Republic, Hungary and \n     Poland, Mr. Chairman, I ask you to consider this:\n       When peace is threatened somewhere in the world and we \n     decide it is in our interest to act, here are three nations \n     we have been able to count on to be with us. In the fight \n     against terror and nuclear proliferation, here are three \n     nations we have been able to count on. In our effort to \n     reform the UN, here are three nations we have been able to \n     count on. When we speak out for human rights around the \n     world, here are three nations we will always be able to count \n     on.\n       Here are three nations that know what it means to lose \n     their freedom and who will do what it takes to defend it. \n     Here are three democracies that are ready to do their \n     dependable part in the common enterprise of our alliance of \n     democracies.\n       Mr. Chairman, the third reason why a larger NATO serves our \n     interests is that the very promise of it gives the nations of \n     central and eastern Europe an incentive to solve their own \n     problems. To align themselves with NATO, aspiring countries \n     have strengthened their democratic institutions. They have \n     made sure that soldiers serve civilians, not the other way \n     around. They have signed 10 major accords that taken together \n     resolve virtually every old ethnic and border dispute in the \n     region, exactly the kind of disputes that might have led to \n     future Bosnias. In fact, the three states we have invited to \n     join NATO have resolved every outstanding dispute of this \n     type.\n       I have been a student of central European history and I \n     have lived some of it myself. When I see Romanians and \n     Hungarians building a genuine friendship after centuries of \n     enmity, when I see Poles, Ukrainians and Lithuanians forming \n     joint military units after years of suspicion, when I see \n     Czechs and Germans overcoming decades of mistrust, when I see \n     central Europeans confident enough to improve their political \n     and economic ties with Russia, I know something remarkable is \n     happening.\n       NATO is doing for Europe's east precisely what it did--\n     precisely what this Committee predicted it would do--for \n     Europe's west after World War II. It is helping to vanquish \n     old hatreds, to promote integration and to create a secure \n     environment for economic prosperity. This is another reminder \n     that the contingencies we do not want our troops to face, \n     such as ethnic conflict, border skirmishes, and social unrest \n     are far more easily avoided with NATO enlargement than \n     without it.\n       In short, a larger NATO will prevent conflict, strengthen \n     NATO, and protect the gains of stability and freedom in \n     central and eastern Europe. That is the strategic rationale. \n     But I would be disingenuous if I did not tell you that I see \n     a moral imperative as well. For this is a policy that should \n     appeal to our hearts as well as to our heads, to our sense of \n     what is right as well as to our sense of what is smart.\n       NATO defines a community of interest among the free nations \n     of North America and Europe that both preceded and outlasted \n     the Cold War. America has long stood for the proposition that \n     this Atlantic community should not be artificially divided \n     and that its nations should be free to shape their destiny. \n     We have long argued that the nations of\n\n[[Page S10785]]\n\n     central and eastern Europe belong to the same democratic \n     family as our allies in western Europe.\n       We often call them ``former communist countries,'' and that \n     is true in the same sense that America is a ``former British \n     colony.'' Yes, the Czechs, Poles, and Hungarians were on the \n     other side of the Iron Curtain during the Cold War. But we \n     were surely on the same side in the ways that truly count.\n       As Americans, we should be heartened today that so many of \n     Europe's new democracies wish to join the institutions \n     Americans did so much to build. They are our friends and we \n     should be proud to welcome them home.\n       We should also think about what would happen if we were to \n     turn them away. That would mean freezing NATO at its Cold War \n     membership and preserving the old Iron Curtain as its eastern \n     frontier. It would mean locking out a whole group of \n     otherwise qualified democracies simply because they were \n     once, against their will, members of the Warsaw Pact.\n       Why would America choose to be allied with Europe's old \n     democracies forever, but its new democracies never? There is \n     no acceptable, objective answer to that question. Instead, it \n     would probably be said that we blocked the aspirations of our \n     would-be allies because Russia objected. And that, in turn, \n     could cause confidence to crumble in central Europe, leading \n     to a search for security by other means, including costly \n     arms buildups and competition among neighbors.\n       We have chosen a better way. We have chosen to look at the \n     landscape of the new Europe and to ask a simple question: \n     Which of these nations that are so clearly important to our \n     security are ready and able to contribute to our security? \n     The answer to that question is before you today, awaiting \n     your affirmation.\n       I said at the outset, Mr. Chairman, that there are weighty \n     voices on both sides of this debate. There are legitimate \n     concerns with which we have grappled along the way, and that \n     I expect you to consider fully as well. Let me address a few.\n       First, we all want to make sure that the costs of expansion \n     are distributed fairly. Last February, at the behest of \n     Congress and before the Alliance had decided which nations to \n     invite to membership, the Administration made a preliminary \n     estimate of America's share. Now that we have settled on \n     three candidates, we are working with our allies to produce a \n     common estimate by the December meeting of the North Atlantic \n     Council. At this point, the numbers we agree upon as 16 \n     allies are needed prior to any further calculations made in \n     Washington.\n       I know you are holding separate hearings in which my \n     Pentagon colleagues will go into this question in detail. But \n     I will say this: I am convinced that the cost of expansion is \n     real but affordable. I am certain our prospective allies are \n     willing and able to pay their share, because in the long run \n     it will be cheaper for them to upgrade their forces within \n     the alliance than outside it. As Secretary of State, I will \n     insist that our old allies share this burden fairly. That is \n     what NATO is all about.\n       I know there are serious people who estimate that a larger \n     NATO will cost far more than we have anticipated. The key \n     fact about our estimate is that it is premised on the \n     current, favorable security environment in Europe. Obviously, \n     if a grave threat were to arise, the cost of enlargement \n     would rise. But then so would the cost of our entire defense \n     budget.\n       In any case, there are budgetary constraints in all 16 NATO \n     democracies that will prevent costs from ballooning. That is \n     why the main focus of our discussion, Mr. Chairman, and in \n     our consultations with our allies, needs to be on defining \n     the level of military capability we want our old and new \n     allies to have in this favorable environment, and then making \n     sure that they commit to that level. We must spend no more \n     than we must, but no less than we need to keep NATO strong.\n       Another common concern about NATO enlargement is that it \n     might damage our cooperation with a democratic Russia. \n     Russian opposition to NATO enlargement is real. But we should \n     see it for what it is: a product of old misperceptions about \n     NATO and old ways of thinking about its former satellites in \n     central Europe. Instead of changing our policies to \n     accommodate Russia's outdated fears, we need to encourage \n     Russia's more modern aspirations.\n       This means that we should remain Russia's most steadfast \n     champion whenever it seeks to define its greatness by joining \n     international institutions, opening its markets and \n     participating constructively in world affairs. It means we \n     should welcome Russia's decision to build a close partnership \n     with NATO, as we did in the NATO-Russia Founding Act.\n       But when some Russian leaders suggest that a larger NATO is \n     a threat, we owe it candor to say that is false--and to base \n     our policies on what we know to be true. When they imply that \n     central Europe is special, that its nations still are not \n     free to choose their security arrangements, we owe it to \n     candor to say that times have changed, and that no nation can \n     assert its greatness at the expense of its neighbors. We do \n     no favor to Russian democrats and modernizers to suggest \n     otherwise.\n       I believe our approach is sound and producing results. Over \n     the past year, against the backdrop of NATO enlargement, \n     reformers have made remarkable gains in the Russian \n     government. We have agreed to pursue deeper arms reductions. \n     Our troops have built a solid working relationship on the \n     ground in Bosnia. Russia was our full partner at the Summit \n     of the Eight in Denver and it has joined the Paris Club of \n     major international lenders.\n       What is more, last week in New York we signed documents \n     that should pave the way for the Russian Duma to ratify the \n     START II treaty. While this prospect is still by no means \n     certain, it would become far less so if we gave the Duma any \n     reason to think it could hold up NATO enlargement by holding \n     up START II.\n       As you know Mr. Chairman, last week, NATO and Russia held \n     the first ministerial meeting of their Permanent Joint \n     Council. This council gives us an invaluable mechanism for \n     building trust between NATO and Russia through dialogue and \n     transparency.\n       I know that some are concerned NATO's new relationship with \n     Russia will actually go too far. You have asked me for an \n     affirmation, Mr. Chairman, that the North Atlantic Council \n     remains NATO's supreme decision making body. Let me say it \n     clearly: It does and it will. The NATO-Russia Founding Act \n     gives Russia no opportunity to dilute, delay or block NATO \n     decisions. NATO's allies will always meet to agree on every \n     item on their agenda before meeting with Russia. And the \n     relationship between NATO and Russia will grow in importance \n     only to the extent Russia uses it constructively.\n       The Founding Act also does not limit NATO's ultimate \n     authority to deploy troops or nuclear weapons in order to \n     meet its commitments to new and old members. All it does is \n     to restate unilaterally existing NATO policy: that in the \n     current and foreseeable security environment, we have no \n     plan, no need, and no intention to station nuclear weapons in \n     the new member countries, nor do we contemplate permanently \n     stationing substantial combat forces. The only binding limits \n     on conventional forces in Europe will be set as we adapt the \n     CFE treaty, with central European countries and all the other \n     signatories at the table, and we will proceed on the \n     principle of reciprocity.\n       Another important concern is that enlargement may create a \n     new dividing line in Europe between a larger NATO and the \n     countries that will not join in the first round. We have \n     taken a range of steps to ensure this does not happen.\n       President Clinton has pledged that the first new members \n     will not be the last. NATO leaders will consider the next \n     steps in the process of enlargement before the end of the \n     decade. We have strengthened NATO's Partnership for Peace \n     program. We have created a new Euro-Atlantic Partnership \n     Council, through which NATO and its democratic partners \n     throughout Europe will shape the missions we undertake \n     together. We have made it clear that the distinction between \n     the nations NATO invited to join in Madrid and those it did \n     not is based purely on objective factors--unlike the \n     arbitrary line that would divide Europe if NATO stood still.\n       Among the countries that still aspire to membership, there \n     is enthusiastic support for the process NATO has begun. Had \n     you seen the crowds that cheered the President in Romania in \n     July, had you been with me when I spoke to the leaders of \n     Lithuania and Slovenia, you would have sensed how eager these \n     nations are to redouble their efforts.\n       They understand a simple fact: With enlargement, no new \n     democracy is permanently excluded; without enlargement, every \n     new democracy would be permanently excluded. The most \n     important thing the Senate can do to reassure them now is to \n     get the ball rolling by ratifying the admission of the first \n     three candidates.\n       Mr. Chairman, a final concern I wish to address has to do \n     with Bosnia.\n       Some have suggested that our debate on NATO enlargement \n     simply cannot be separated from our actions and decisions in \n     that troubled country. I agree with them. Both enlargement \n     and our mission in Bosnia are aimed at building a stable \n     undivided Europe. Both involve NATO and its new partners to \n     the east.\n       It was our experience in Bosnia that proved the fundamental \n     premise of our enlargement strategy: there are still threats \n     to peace and security in Europe that only NATO can meet. It \n     was in Bosnia that our prospective allies proved they are \n     ready to take responsibility for the security of others. It \n     was in Bosnia that we proved NATO and Russian troops can work \n     together.\n       We cannot know today if our mission in Bosnia will achieve \n     all its goals, for that ultimately depends on the choices the \n     Bosnian people will make. But we can say that whatever may \n     happen, NATO's part in achieving the military goals of our \n     mission has been a resounding success. Whatever may happen, \n     our interest in a larger, stronger NATO will endure long \n     after the last foreign soldier has left Bosnia.\n       We can also say that NATO will remain the most powerful \n     instrument we have for building effective military coalitions \n     such as SFOR. At the same time, Bosnia does not by itself \n     define the future of a larger NATO. NATO's fundamental \n     purpose is collective defense against aggression. Its most \n     important aim, if I can paraphrase Arthur Vandenberg, is to \n     prevent wars before they start so it does not have to keep \n     the peace after they stop.\n       These are some of the principal concerns I wanted to \n     address today; I know you have many more questions and I look \n     forward to answering them all.\n\n[[Page S10786]]\n\n       This discussion is just beginning. I am glad that it will \n     also involve other committees of the Senate, the NATO \n     Observers' Group and the House of Representatives. Most \n     important, I am glad it will involve the people of the United \n     States. For the commitment a larger NATO entails will only be \n     meaningful if the American people understand and accept it.\n       When these three new democracies join NATO in 1999, as I \n     trust they will, it will be a victory for us all, Mr. \n     Chairman. And on that day, we will be standing on the \n     shoulders of many.\n       We will be thankful to all those who prosecuted the Cold \n     War, to all those on both sides of the Iron Curtain who \n     believed that the goal of containment was to bring about the \n     day when the enlargement of our democratic community would be \n     possible.\n       We will be grateful to all those who championed the idea of \n     a larger NATO--not just President Clinton, or President \n     Havel, or President Walesa, but members of Congress from both \n     parties who voted for resolutions urging the admission of \n     these three nations. We will owe a debt to the Republican \n     members who made NATO enlargement part of their Contract with \n     America.\n       Today, all of our allies and future allies are watching you \n     for one simple reason. The American Constitution is unique in \n     the power it grants to the legislative branch over foreign \n     policy, especially over treaties. In this matter, Mr. \n     Chairman, members of the Committee, you and the American \n     people you represent are truly in the driver's seat.\n       That is as it should be. In fact, I enjoy going to Europe \n     and telling our allies: ``This is what we want to do, but \n     ultimately, it will be up to our Senate and our people to \n     decide.'' I say that with pride because it tells them \n     something about America's faith in the democratic process.\n       But I have to tell you that I say it with confidence as \n     well. I believe we will stand together, Mr. Chairman, when \n     the time comes for the Senate to decide, because I know that \n     the policy we ask you to embrace is a policy that the \n     Administration and Congress shaped together, and because I am \n     certain that it advances the fundamental interests of the \n     United States.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10782-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONGRATULATIONS TO KENTUCKY FORD AND TOYOTA WORKERS\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to take just a moment today to talk \nabout some hard working Kentuckians. Earlier this month marked the \nclose of the 1997 year for car models. With that closing came the news \nthat the Toyota Camry was the best-selling car in the United States and \nthat Ford's F-Series trucks are the number one selling trucks in the \nnation for the 16th year in a row. Also at the top were the Ford \nExplorer as the number one sports utility vehicle and the Ranger as the \nnumber one compact pickup.\n  I'm proud to say that the number one car, truck and sports utility \nvehicle all have ``made in Kentucky'' stamped inside. The Camry is \nbuilt in Georgetown and two of the Ford trucks--the F-250 and the F-\n350--along with both the Ranger and the Explorer, are all made in \nLouisville. About 80 percent of the Camrys sold in the nation come from \nKentucky, while the Kentucky-made Ford trucks account for about 26 \npercent of the F-Series sales.\n  Behind those impressive sales figures are thousands of hard-working \nKentuckians committed to doing the best job possible.\n  Their hard work not only put Toyota and Ford at the top of the \ncharts, but their local communities and the state come out winners as \nwell. A strong company with productive workers is a boost to the local \neconomy and a successful plant is a powerful recruitment tool for the \nstate.\n  Mr. President, number one sales mean a number one production team. I \nknow I speak for my fellow Kentuckians when I say we're awfully proud \nof all the hard work that put the Toyota and Ford vehicles at the top.\n  Keep up the good work and know that you've made all Kentuckians \nproud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10786-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in execution session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10786-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agrees \nto the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n2169) making appropriations for the Department of Transportation and \nrelated agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, and for \nother purposes.\n                                  ____\n\n  At 2:34 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 901.

A bill to amend the Indian Employment, Training and Related \nServices Demonstration Act of 1992 to provide for the transfer of \nservices and personnel from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the Office \nof Self-Governance, to emphasize the need for job creation on Indian \nreservations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n\n\n THE INDIAN EMPLOYMENT TRAINING AND RELATED SERVICES DEMONSTRATION ACT \n                           AMENDMENTS OF 1997\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation which amends the Indian Employment, Training, and Related \nServices Demonstration Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-477). The current Act has \nproven successful and represents one of the few programs that works for \nIndian country. I want to thank Senator Murkowski for his work on his \nown ``477'' bill that takes aim at the specific problems experienced by \nAlaska natives in administering the 477 program. I am pleased to co-\nsponsor his and that he is co-sponsoring my legislation.\n  It is my hope that together we can develop amendments that will \nclarify and strengthen the program for American Indians and Alaska \nnatives and lead to better training programs and higher job placements. \nThe main reason for the success of the 477 program is that it relies on \nthe tribes themselves to make the key decisions involving the design \nand implementation of employment training and related matters. This \nprogram puts tribes, not federal bureaucrats, in the driver's seat.\n  The Act empowers tribal governments to consolidate formula funds they \nreceive for employment training and education services into one \nprogram--which in turn enables tribes to streamline services provided, \nwhile cutting administrative time and costs. The Act does contain \ncertain limitations and in practice tribes have faced a few roadblocks.\n  This bill removes these limitations, expands programs affected by the \nAct, and broadens permissible job creation activities. The unemployment \nproblem in Indian country is well-documented. Tribes currently suffer \nfrom a national unemployment rate of approximately 52%, with some like \nthe Oglala Sioux Tribe suffer from a rate of 95%. In comparison, the \nnational unemployment rate is 6%. The lack of employment opportunities \nin Indian country has exacerbated an already-poor health situation, and \nhas lead to grinding social problems such as crime, domestic abuse, and \nalcohol and drug abuse. While gaming has aided a few tribal economies \nover the past decade, the great majority of tribes continue to struggle \nwith joblessness and poverty. Gaming is not the long term solution to \nthe goal of tribal self-determination and economic self-sufficiency. \nDiverse job creation is.\n  The Indian Employment, Training, and Related Services Demonstration \nAct provides tribes with a valuable tool in combating reservation \nunemployment. Indian tribes, like many American communities, are \nstruggling to comply with the work requirements of the new welfare \nreform law. By focusing on job creation as a necessary component to any \nemployment training program, tribes can add a new weapon in their \nbattle against joblessness and poverty.\n  One of the more consistent obstacles to greater success with the Act \nis the Bureau of Indian Affairs management of the program. To remedy \nthis problem, the bill transfers lead agency responsibilities from the \nBureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to the Office of Self-Governance (OSG), \nboth agencies contained within the Department of the Interior. On May \n13, 1997, the Committee on Indian Affairs conducted an oversight \nhearing to discuss the progress made by tribes under the Act. Tribe \nafter tribe testified and revealed that this program is working, and \nworking well. Tribes participating in the program testified that the \nprogram has reduced the federal paperwork burden associated with \napplying for related programs by as much as 96%, reduced administration \ntime and costs of delivering job training services to tribal customers \nwhile enhancing the quality of services rendered.\n  Most importantly, witnesses indicated great increases in job \nplacements for tribal members. One of the reasons for the success of \nthis program is that it is voluntary. It is not another imposition, by \nthe federal government, of what we think will work for them. I would \nlike to highlight the fact that this Demonstration Act has cost the \nfederal government nothing--- the attraction of the program is in \nstreamlining paperwork and other administrative burdens and operating \nprimarily at the local level. The philosophy of the program is similar \nto that of the Self-Governance model under which tribes, under contract \nwith the United States, manage services and programs formerly provided \nby the federal government.\n  The witnesses at the May hearing discussed problems that they have \nhad with the lead agency, the BIA. Of the four tribal participants \ntestifying, all expressed dissatisfaction with the BIA. One testified \nthat ``the Bureau of Indian Affairs has been the biggest obstacle to \nthe implementation of P.L. 102-477.'' 20 tribal applicants representing \nmore than 175 tribes currently participate in this demonstration, yet \nthe BIA states that it has only two full-time employees committed to \nworking on this program, and that number is in dispute. Additionally, \nall tribal witnesses reported significant delays in receiving programs \nfunds consolidated under their approved plans.\n  Reasons for the delays ranged from deliberate withholding to poor \naccounting procedures on the part of the BIA. The May hearing, as well \nas subsequent meetings held with the Tribal Working Group for the \nDemonstration Act, have made clear that there is a consensus among \nparticipating tribes that the OSG should undertake this program. The \nbill proposes to transfer authority to the OSG because that office has \na proven track record in working with tribes to consolidate programs \nand services and to achieve more effective delivery to tribal members.\n  If this Congress is serious about encouraging self-determination and \nself-sufficiency, we must provide tribes with the tools they need to \nfurther these goals. Reservation economic development and job creation \ngo hand-in-hand and we cannot ignore this basic fact.\n  The current Act has gone far in permitting tribes to do more with \nless, as the quality of training and education services has risen with \nincreased job placements. These amendments take the next logical step, \nwhich is to encourage job creation and make the promise of the program \na reality for those that want to work and want to be productive and \nwant to improve their lives and the lives of their families.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional \nmaterial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1279\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S10789]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Employment, Training \n     and Related Services Demonstration Act Amendments of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Indian tribes and Alaska Native organizations that have \n     participated in carrying out programs under the Indian \n     Employment, Training and Related Services Demonstration Act \n     of 1992 (25 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.) have--\n       (A) improved the effectiveness of services provided by \n     those tribes and organizations;\n       (B) enabled more Indian people to secure employment;\n       (C) assisted welfare recipients; and\n       (D) otherwise demonstrated the value of integrating \n     education, employment, and training services.\n       (2) The initiative under the Indian Employment, Training \n     and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992 should be \n     strengthened by ensuring that all programs that emphasize the \n     value of work may be included within a demonstration program \n     of an Indian tribe or Alaska Native organization.\n       (3) The initiative under the Indian Employment, Training \n     and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992 shares goals \n     and innovative approaches of the Indian Self-Determination \n     and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.).\n       (4) The programs referred to in paragraph (2) should be \n     implemented by the unit within the Department of the Interior \n     responsible for carrying out the Indian Employment, Training \n     and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992.\n       (5) The initiative under the Indian Employment, Training \n     and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992 should have \n     the benefit of the support and attention of the officials \n     of--\n       (A) the Department of the Interior; and\n       (B) other Federal agencies involved with policymaking \n     authority with respect to programs that emphasize the value \n     of work for American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide technical corrections to the Native \nAmerican Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996, to \nimprove the delivery of housing assistance to Indian tribes in a manner \nthat recognizes the right of tribal self-governance, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n   THE NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND SELF-DETERMINATION ACT \n                           AMENDMENTS OF 1997\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, in 1996 the Congress enacted historic \nlegislation involving the financing, construction, and maintenance of \nhousing for Indian people. With the enactment of the Native American \nHousing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA), Indian \nhousing is no longer solely in the province of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development (HUD).\n  With NAHASDA tribes have the opportunity to develop and implement \nhousing plans that meet their needs and values, and can do so in a way \nthat is more efficient. I am hopeful that the success achieved by \ntribes participating in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Act \nand the Self- Governance Act programs can be duplicated in the housing \narena with the implementation of NAHASDA.\n  The Act requires that funds for Indian housing be provided to Indian \ntribes in block grants with monitoring and oversight appropriately \nprovided by HUD. By empowering the tribes themselves and decreasing \ntribal reliance on the federal bureaucracy, this Act is consistent with \nprinciples of tribal self-determination and self-sufficiency that have \nbeen the hallmark of federal Indian policy for nearly thirty years.\n  By the terms of the Act, NAHASDA becomes effective October 1, 1997. \nThis will mean sweeping changes in the way housing is built and \nfinanced in Indian country. It is my hope that we can build on the \nNAHASDA model and encourage related initiatives such as banking, \nbusiness development, and infrastructure construction.\n  Even though NAHASDA has yet to be implemented, both HUD and the \ntribes agree that there are sections in the Act that need \nclarification. The bill I am introducing, the ``Native American Housing \nAssistance and Self-Determination Act Amendments of 1997'', provides \nthe required clarification and changes that will help tribes and HUD in \nachieving a smoother transition from the old housing regime to the new \nframework of NAHASDA.\n  The proposed amendments contained in this bill are partly the result \nof a hearing held by the Committee on Indian Affairs in March, 1997, \nwhich focused on the management of Indian housing under the old HUD-\ndominated regime.\n  Tribal leaders, Indian housing experts, and federal officials \ntestified about funding problems and other matters, including the \nproper level of oversight and monitoring. The focus of the hearing was \nconstructive and with an eye toward encouraging a better managed and \nmore efficient Indian housing system.\n  After auditing Indian housing programs from around the nation, and \nafter reviewing HUD's monitoring and enforcement provisions, HUD's \nInspector General testified as to perceived problems in the old housing \nregime and the NAHASDA framework. The IG's testimony included her \nopinion that clarifications were needed in the\n\n[[Page S10790]]\n\nNAHASDA including minor changes to the Act's enforcement provisions.\n  My goal as Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs is to ensure \nthat housing funds are used properly and within the bounds permitted by \nlaw. I also want to ensure that, consistent with federal obligations to \nIndian tribes, tribal members are properly housed and living in decent \nconditions.\n  I am confident that with the implementation of NAHASDA, tribes will \nbe able to better design and implement their own housing plans and in \nthe process will be able to provide better housing to their members. In \nmaking the transition from dominating the housing realm to monitoring \nthe activities of the tribes, HUD needs guidance from the Committee as \nto its proper role and responsibilities under the Act.\n  The Act, and the amendments I am proposing today, will go a long way \nin making sure that the management problems that were associated with \nthe old, HUD-dominated housing system will not be part of NAHASDA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord, and urge my colleagues to join me in enacting these reasonable \namendments.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1280\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Indian Employment, Training and Related \nServices Demonstration Act of 1992 to provide for the transfer of \nservices and personnel from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the Office \nof Self-Governance, to facilitate the creation of employment \nopportunities for American Indians and Alaska Natives, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n      the indian employment and training improvements act of 1997\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Indian \nEmployment and Training Improvements Act of 1997, making technical \namendments to the Indian Job Training and Consolidation Act of 1992. I \nwas an original cosponsor of this law because I saw a need to reduce \nunnecessary, repetitive administrative costs in job development \nprograms geared toward American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  I am glad to say that after only a few years, it is clear that this \nprogram is working. Alaska tribal groups tell me that they have \nreported great savings in administering employment and training \nprograms through consolidation of application and reporting \nrequirements. The Cook inlet Tribal Corporation in Alaska alone reports \na near tripling of jobs in the Anchorage area since the passage of this \nact, from 500 to nearly 1,500 jobs. The Aleutian Pribiloffs Island \nAssociation, the Bristol Bay Native Association, Tlingit-Haida Indian \nTibes in southeast Alaska, and Kawerak corporation in Norton Sound all \nreport satisfaction with this program. I thank these Alaska Native \ngroups for working with my staff to complete these amendments.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Campbell for his work on this \nissue and for introducing his fine bill. I look forward to combining \nthe best aspects of our bills at a mark-up to be held later this year. \nI appreciate his sensitivity to Alaska-specific concerns on this and \nother Indian Affairs issues.\n  Mr. President, my bill would make several technical corrections that \nwould encourage more tribes to take advantage of this demonstration. \nLet me highlight a few of these changes. First, it would establish the \nOffice of Self Governance as the lead agency, replacing the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs. This change is needed because the BIA has shown \nresistance to allowing two of its programs to be included in the \nprogram: the Johnson O'Malley education program and general assistance \ndollars. The Office of Self governance, in contrast, has shown itself \nto be an effective administration in working with tribes to meet their \nneeds.\n  Second, it would allow the regional non-profit corporations in Alaska \nto act on behalf of the tribes, without having specific authorizing \nresolutions on the exact subject at hand, though the tribes could \nalways object and opt out of the regional's actions. Third, it\n\n[[Page S10792]]\n\nwould enable tribes to establish one consolidated advisory committee to \nencompass all the advisory councils currently required by the programs \nthat are included in the demonstration.\n  All these changes will allow the participating tribes to get more out \nof the Indian Job Training and consolidation Act by enabling them to \nbetter tailor their programs for their individual needs and by reducing \nregulatory barriers to efficient consolidation of Indian job training \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, the drop-out rate from college of Alaska Native kids \nin the Anchorage area is usually between 80-90 percent. We need to \nprovide these young Alaskans with both educational and job skills so \nthey can fully participate in Alaska's economy. The technical \namendments I am introducing today will lead to further economic growth \nand more efficient use of Indian job training dollars. I urge my \ncolleagues to support these amendments.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Ms. Moseley-Braun, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1282. A bill to provide for the establishment of the National \nMuseum for the Peopling of America within the Smithsonian Institution, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n                   the peopling of america museum act\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, last year marked the 150th anniversary of \nthe Smithsonian Institution, an establishment dedicated to the \n``increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.'' Since its founding, \nthe Smithsonian has promoted excellence in research and public \neducation in all fields of human and scientific interest. To continue \nthis great tradition of excellence, and to ensure its relevance to its \npatrons and beneficiaries, the American people, today I am introducing \nlegislation, cosponsored by Senator Carol Moseley-Braun and Senator \nPatty Murray, to establish a new Smithsonian entity, the National \nMuseum for the Peopling of America.\n  The Peopling of America Museum would be dedicated to presenting one \nof the most significant experiences in American history, the complex \nmovement of people, ideas, and cultures across boundaries--both \ninternal or external--that resulted in the peopling of the Nation and \nthe development of our unique, pluralist society. This movement \ntransformed us from strangers from different shores into neighbors \nunified in our inimitable diversity--Americans all.\n  Under our bill, the Museum would have a number of different \nfunctions. These include serving as: A location for exhibits and \nprograms depicting the history of America's diverse peoples and their \ninteractions with each other. The exhibits would collectively form a \nunified narrative of the historical processes by which the United \nStates was developed; A center for research and scholarship to ensure \nthat future generations of scholars will have access to resources \nnecessary for telling the story of American pluralism; A repository for \nthe collection of relevant artifacts, artworks, and documents to be \npreserved, studied, and interpreted; A venue for integrated public \neducation programs, including lectures, films, and seminars, based on \nthe Center's collections and research; and A location for a \nstandardized index of resources within the Smithsonian dealing with the \nheritages of all Americans. The Smithsonian's holdings contain millions \nof artifacts which have not been identified or classified for this \npurpose.\n  A clearinghouse for information on ethnic documents, artifacts, and \nartworks that may be available through non-Smithsonian sources, such as \nother federal agencies, museums, academic institutions, individuals, or \nforeign entities.\n  A folklife center highlighting the cultural expressions of the \npeoples of the United States. The existing Smithsonian Center for \nFolklife Programs and Cultural Studies, which already performs this \nfunction, could be integrated with the museum.\n  A center to promote mutual understanding and tolerance. The Museum \nwould facilitate programs designed to encourage greater understanding \nof, and respect for, each of America's diverse ethnic and cultural \nheritages. The Museum would also disseminate techniques of conflict \nresolution currently being developed by social scientists.\n  An oral history center developed through interviews with volunteers \nand visitors. The museum would also serve as an oral history repository \nand a clearinghouse for oral histories held by other institutions.\n  A visitor center providing individually tailored orientation guides \nto Smithsonian visitors. Visitors could use the museum as an initial \norientation phase for ethnically or culturally related artifacts, \nartworks, or information that can be found in each of the Smithsonian's \nmany facilities.\n  A location for training museum professionals in museum practices \nrelating to the life, history, art, and culture of the peoples of the \nUnited States. The museum would sponsor training programs for \nprofessionals or students involved in teaching, researching, and \ninterpreting the heritage of America's peoples.\n  A location for testing and evaluating new museum-related technologies \nthat could facilitate the operation of the museum. The facility could \nserve as a test bed for cutting-edge technologies that could later be \nused by other private or public museums.\n  Our legislation also stipulates that the museum would be located in \nnew or existing Smithsonian facilities on or near the National Mall. \nAdditionally, the measure establishes an Advisory Committee on American \nCultural Heritage to provide guidance on the operation and direction of \nthe proposed museum.\n   Mr. President, aside from the first Americans, whose precedence must \nbe acknowledged, we Americans were travelers from other lands. From the \nfirst Europeans who came as explorers and conquerors to the African \nslaves who endured the middle passage and labored in the fields of our \nearly plantations, from the people of Nuevo Mexico to the French of the \nLouisiana Territory who became Americans through annexation, from the \nIrish who fled poverty and famine at home to the Chinese who came in \nsearch of Gold Mountain--all were once visitors to this great country.\n  America is defined by the grand, entangled progress of its individual \npeoples to and across the American landscape--through exploration, the \nslave trade, immigration, or internal migration--that gave rise to the \nrich interactions that make the American experience unique. We embody \nthe cultures and traditions that our forebears brought from other \nshores, as well as the new traditions and cultures that we adopted on \narrival.\n  Whether we settled in the agrarian West, the industrialized North, \nthe small towns of the Midwest, or the genteel cities of the South, our \nforebears inevitably formed relationships with peoples of other \nbackgrounds and cultures. Our rich heritage as Americans is \ncomprehensible only through the histories of our various constituent \ncultures, carried with us from other lands and transformed by \nencounters with other cultures. As one eminent cultural scholar has \nnoted:\n\n       How can one learn about slavery, holocausts, immigration, \n     ecological adaptation or ways of seeing the world without \n     some type of comparative perspective, without some type of \n     relationship between cultures and peoples. How can we \n     understand the history of any one cultural group--for \n     example, the Irish--without reference to other groups--for \n     example, the British. How can we understand African American \n     culture without placing it in some relationship to its \n     diverse African cultural roots, the creolized cultures of the \n     Caribbean, the Native American bases of Maroon and Black \n     Seminole cultures, the religious, economic and linguistic \n     cultures of the colonial Spanish in Columbia, the French in \n     Haiti, the Dutch in Suriname, and the English in the United \n     States?\n\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Smithsonian, perhaps our most \nprestigious educational institution, has never attempted to explore \nthis comparative perspective of how our Nation came to be peopled. For \nwhatever reason, the institution has failed to examine the college of \nrelationships that shaped the values, attitudes, and behaviors of our \nvarious constituencies. Aside from occasional, temporary exhibits on a \nspecific immigration or migration topic, such as the Museum of American \nHistory's recent exhibit on the northern migration of African-\nAmericans, none of the Smithsonian's many museums and facilities has \ntasked itself to examine any aspect of\n\n[[Page S10793]]\n\nthis phenomenon, the peopling of America experience, much less offered \na global review of the subject.\n  This shortcoming derives, in part, from the fact that the \nSmithsonian, for all its reputation as a world-class research and \neducational organization, remains an institution rooted in 19th century \nintellectual taxonomy. For example, during the early years of the \nSmithsonian, the cultures of Northern and Western European Americans \nwere originally represented at the Museum of Science and Industry, \nwhich eventually became the Museum of American History. However, \nAfrican Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and others were \ntreated ethnographically as part of the Museum of Natural History. This \nartificial bifurcation of our cultural patrimonies is still in place \ntoday. Consequently, the collections of various ethnic and cultural \ngroups have been fragmented among various Smithsonian entities, making \nit difficult to view these groups in relation to each other or as part \nof a larger whole.\n\n  The establishment of the Peopling of America Museum would address \nthis glaring deficiency. The museum would instantly create a national \nvenue where all Americans, regardless of ethnic origin, could visit in \norder to discover and celebrate their diverse historical roots. More \nimportant, the museum would facilitate an exploration of our \ncommonalities, the historical and cultural experiences that created the \nunique American identity and sensibility.\n  Mr. President, in May 1995, the Commission on the Future of the \nSmithsonian Institution, a blue ribbon panel charged with pondering the \nfuture of the 150-year-old institution, issued its final report. In its \npreface, the Commission noted:\n\n       The Smithsonian Institution is the principal repository of \n     the nation's collective memory and the nation's largest \n     public cultural space. It is dedicated to preserving, \n     understanding, and displaying the land we inhabit and the \n     diversity and depth of American civilization in all its \n     timbres and color. It holds in common for all Americans that \n     set of beliefs--in the form of artifacts--about our past \n     that, taken together, comprise our collective history and \n     symbolize the ideals to which we aspire as a polity. The \n     Smithsonian--with its 140 million objects, 16 museums and \n     galleries, the national Zoo, and 29 million annual visits--\n     has been, for a century and a half, a place of wonder, a \n     magical place where Americans are reminded of how much we \n     have in common.\n       The story of America is the story of a plural nation. As \n     epitomized by our nation's motto, America is a composite of \n     peoples. Our vast country was inhabited by various cultures \n     long before the Pilgrims arrived. Slaves and immigrants built \n     a new nation from ``sea to shining sea,'' across mountains, \n     plains, deserts and great rivers, all rich in diverse \n     climates, animals, and plants. One of the Smithsonian's \n     essential tasks is to make the history of our country come \n     alive for each new generation of American children.\n       We cannot even imagine an ``American'' culture that is not \n     multiple in its roots and in its branches. In a world \n     fissured by differences of ethnicity and religion, we must \n     all learn to live without the age-old dream of purity--\n     whether of bloodlines or cultural inheritance--and learn to \n     find comfort, solace, and even fulfillment in the rough magic \n     of the cultural mix. And it is the challenge to preserve and \n     embody that marvelous mix--the multi-various mosaic that is \n     our history, culture, land, and the people who have made it--\n     that the Smithsonian Institution, on the eve of the twenty-\n     first century, must rededicate itself.\n\n  Mr. President, what more compelling argument in favor of the Peopling \nof America Museum can be found than in these words? What initiative \nother than the Peopling of America Museum would more directly address \nthe Smithsonian's role in presenting the diversity and depth of \nAmerican civilization in all its timbres and color, or making the \nhistory of our country come alive for each new generation of American \nchildren, or preserving the multivarious mosaic that is our history, \nculture, land, and the people who have made it?\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe that this initiative will \nfoster a much-needed understanding of our diversity, of the rich \ncultural and historical differences that constitute our uniqueness as \nindividuals. Conversely, and more important, I believe that the \nPeopling of America Museum will promote an appreciation of the common \nvalues, relationships, and experiences that bind our citizens together. \nA museum dedicated to the celebration of our unity in diversity will \nsustain and invigorate our sense of national purpose; surely this is a \nmission worthy of the Smithsonian to undertake.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I hope that this legislation will initiate \na national dialog about the central role that the Smithsonian should \nplay in preserving, researching, and exhibiting America's cultural and \nhistorical patrimony. I look forward to beginning this conversation \nwith my colleagues, the academic community, and the interested public.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1282\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to award Congressional gold medals to Jean Brown \nTrickey, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Melba Patillo Beals, Terrence Roberts, \nGloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed Wair, Ernest Green, Elizabeth \nEckford, and Jefferson Thomas, commonly referred collectively as the \n``Little Rock Nine'' on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the \nintegration of the Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                 congresSIONAL GOld MeDaLs LeGIslaTIon\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill on \nbehalf of Senator Carol Moseley-Braun and myself authorizing the award \nof the Congressional Gold Medal to the extraordinary group of Americans \nknown as the Little Rock Nine. We speak often of heroes in this body. \nSometimes we worry that there are no heroes in our country today, no \none for our children to look up to, no one to inspire us to be our best \nselves. But a couple of weeks ago, we had a vivid reminder that there \nare still heroes among us. The Little Rock Nine returned to Little Rock \nCentral High School to stride through the doors again. This time those \ndoors were held open by the Governor of Arkansas and the President of \nthe United States.\n\n  Jean Brown Trickey, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Melba Patillo Beals, \nTerrence Roberts, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed Wair, Ernest \nGreen, Elizabeth Eckford, and Jefferson Thomas. Their names are not so \nfamiliar to the American public, but they ought to be.\n  On a fall day in 1957, these nine Americans were teenagers, children \nreally, and they marched up the steps of Little Rock Central High \nSchool, young black teenagers through a huge crowd--actually a mob--of \nangry white people who despised them just for being there and presuming \nto attend a public school in their own home town. They marched up the \nsteps with a cool courage that remains awesome today, no matter how \nmany times we see the grainy newsreels.\n  In 1957, Little Rock was not a very big city, but for a few days, it \nbecame the center of the world. Arkansas was not the most staunchly \nsegregationist State in the South, but politics, history and fear \nconspired to make it the\n\n[[Page S10795]]\n\ncrucible for the authority of Brown v. Board of Education. And through \nthat storm of controversy marched these nine young people, frightened \nbut dignified, barely comprehending what was happening but sensing that \nthey were helping to move aside a profound obstacle.\n  Now, even the people who jeered at them will admit that they were \nimpressed and moved by the courage of those nine kids. The images of \nthose days in Little Rock, and the extraordinary lives these nine sons \nand daughters of Arkansas have led are proud symbols of the progress we \nhave made in America and a solemn reminder of the progress we have yet \nto make.\n  Any ordinary teenager is sensitive to the tiniest insult, the most \ninnocent slight. It is hard to imagine what these nine felt as they \nwere cursed and spat upon, peppered with every slur and threat the \ncrowd could muster. They were opposed by the Governor, by most every \nlocal leader, by their peers and by a fully armed unit of the National \nGuard. They were able to enter the school when President Eisenhower \nordered in units of the airborne division to escort them and enforce \nthe order of the Supreme Court. But it was not the power of the \nsoldiers or the authority of the law that won the day. It was the grace \nand courage of those nine young people.\n  Their grace and courage prevailed that day and has inspired us for 40 \nyears. They deserve our thanks and admiration. They deserve a medal. We \nshould present those nine heroes of Little Rock with the Congressional \nGold Medal as a permanent remembrance of their unforgettable moment of \ncourage. I hope all of my colleagues will cosponsor this bill and see \nthat it quickly becomes law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1283\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress hereby finds the following:\n       (1) Jean Brown Trickey, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Melba \n     Patillo Beals, Terrence Roberts, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma \n     Mothershed Wair, Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, and \n     Jefferson Thomas, hereafter in this section referred to as \n     the ``Little Rock Nine'', voluntarily subjected themselves to \n     the bitter stinging pains of racial bigotry.\n       (2) The Little Rock Nine are civil rights pioneers whose \n     selfless acts considerably advanced the civil rights debate \n     in this country.\n       (3) The Little Rock Nine risked their lives to integrate \n     Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, and \n     subsequently the Nation.\n       (4) The Little Rock Nine sacrificed their innocence to \n     protect the American principle that we are all ``one nation, \n     under God, indivisible''.\n       (5) The Little Rock Nine have indelibly left their mark on \n     the history of this Nation.\n       (6) the Little Rock Nine have continued to work towards \n     equality for all Americans.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to prohibit construction of any monument, memorial, \nor other structure at the site of the Iwo Jima Memorial in Arlington, \nVA, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                  CONSTRUCTION PROHIBITION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nreally should not have to be introduced to address a controversy that \nshould not be taking place. The legislation is intended to prevent \nfurther construction of any memorial on the parcel of Federal land \nsurrounding the U.S. Marine Corps memorial commonly known as the Iwo \nJima memorial located in Arlington, VA.\n  Mr. President, the reason I am introducing this legislation is that, \nunfortunately, this site has been selected for a 50-foot high Air Force \nmemorial approximately 500 feet from the Iwo Jima statue.\n  Mr. President, I realize full well that this legislation and this \nissue will and has caused considerable emotional debate and difference \nof opinion within our Marine and Air Force communities. I stress that \nin my opinion it does not have to be that way.\n  First, the points that I will raise should not be construed as any \ndenigration or challenge to the worthiness of a memorial to the proud \nmen and women of the U.S. Air Force who have served our Nation so very \nwell. In fact, one of my points is that our U.S. Air Force deserves its \nown special place that will not compete with any other memorial.\n  In discussing this legislation, I am going to leave the legal issues \nto those with better expertise in the nuance of law. The point I would \nlike to stress is very basic. It supersedes reports and hearings and \ncommission recommendations and whether or not the proponents of \nconstruction of another memorial have successfully--and apparently they \nhave--traversed the procedural obstacle course and the tripwires \nnecessary to gain approval for construction.\n  Simply put, the Iwo Jima memorial represents and memorializes an \nabsolutely unique and special time in our Nation's history. Just as \nBunker Hill and Saratoga and Yorktown and Gettysburg, Belleau Wood and \nBataan, Normandy, Chosin Reservoir, and other battles have been etched \nin our national psyche as touchstones and reminders of courage, valor \nand bravery in defense of freedom, and have special meaning for this \nNation and the valiant members of our Armed Forces that fought bravely \nin each of those campaigns, Iwo Jima became a rallying point for this \ncountry and the U.S. Marine Corps during the dark days of the war in \nthe Pacific.\n  Mr. President, on a personal note, for me, the Iwo Jima memorial has \nspecial meaning. My dad, then a Marine major, Wes Roberts, took part in \nthe battle of Iwo Jima. His accounts of the bravery and sacrifice are \npart of our family's history and inspiration. Fifteen years later, then \nMarine Lt. Pat Roberts, stationed in Okinawa with the 3d Marine \nDivision, revisited Iwo Jima, along with the first official Marine \nparty to pay a personal tribute and visit to that island. My assignment \nwas to cover the visit and dedication for the Stars and Stripes \nnewspaper.\n  I shall never forget the experience. Iwo Jima veterans, enlisted and \nofficers, stood on Mt. Suribachi in the quiet of the gentle wind \noverlooking a now lush green island in the blue of the Pacific, and \nthere was not a sound. Then, in hushed tones, mixed with emotion and \ntears, the Iwo Jima veterans relived, recounted that battle and said \nmany a prayer for their fallen comrades.\n  Lt. General Thomas A. Wornham placed a 5th Marine Division insignia \non the flagpole atop famous Suribachi. Former members of his old unit, \nthe 27th Marines, stood with visiting dignitaries. They listened \nquietly. The general said, ``We landed over there by those two rocks. \nThe terraces were much higher then. I crawled on my hands and knees \nright by that small hill.''\n  In a low whisper, Col. John W. Antonelli, former 2d battalion \nCommander in the 27th, said, ``I cannot look at this scene, this \nisland, without thinking of my Marines who died in\n\n[[Page S10796]]\n\norder to capture it. From the top of Suribachi, I can see where they \nfell. One of my best friends was killed in that ravine. Every time the \nMarines would take cover there, they invited the incoming artillery.''\n  Then Col. Donn J. Robertson, former 3d battalion commander in the \nfamous regiment, told listeners how the island had changed. ``This new \nlush vegetation would have given our boys much needed cover then. As I \nstand here looking down from Suribachi, I realize how the enemy had us \ncovered in interlocking fire. We landed on a beautiful day just like \nthis, sun shining, blue sky, blue ocean. I am thankful to be alive.''\n  Standing on Suribachi, it was difficult for any of us to imagine how \nanyone could have survived the landing and day-after-day assault. The \nday after the island was declared secure more marines suffered \ncasualties than they had in the last 10.\n  But survive they did, and Old Glory was raised over Iwo Jima on the \n23d of February, 1945, and captured on film to become a pictorial \nmoment in history unequaled in portraying uncommon valor. Almost 10 \nyears later, that special event in our Nation's history was recreated \nand consecrated forever in the dedication of the Iwo Jima memorial here \nin our Nation's Capital and now attracts over 1 million visitors every \nyear.\n  Let me stress, Mr. President, that Iwo Jima is not purely a Marine \nCorps memorial. It does, of course, represent an extremely important \nevent in the proud history of our corps, but it is, in a larger sense, \na memorial for the American people. Many consider the Iwo Jima site as \nhallowed ground and certainly not a site where there should be a \ncompeting memorial.\n  I also wish to acknowledge that the Air Force Association has been \nforthright and aboveboard in the process to find a suitable site for \ntheir proposed memorial. I applaud and support their efforts to \nproperly recognize the superb contribution the men and women of the \nU.S. Air Force have made to this country. The point is that I do not \nbelieve it serves any purpose for either memorial to compete with or \nstand in the shadow of the other.\n  I also realize the proponents of the Air Force memorial will say it \nwill not interfere with Iwo Jima, and it will be located behind a line \nof trees so that it cannot be seen from the Iwo site.\n  Now, the sense I get from those statements is that the Air Force \nmemorial will figuratively be in the shadow of Iwo Jima. If so, that, \nquite frankly, is not fair to the Air Force and to those the memorial \nis intended to honor. A location should be found where the memorial can \nstand clearly, proudly, and in its own place without competition from \nany other structure.\n  In addition, the National Planning Commission report recognizes that \nthe site for the proposed Air Force memorial is, ``fragile and \ndelicate.'' The report further recognizes that the area encompassing \nthe Iwo Jima memorial and the Netherlands Carillon and the Arlington \nNational Cemetery is ``reverent space whose beautiful nature is already \nheavily disrupted by heavy automobile and bus traffic on the periphery \nand by tour bus traffic within the area itself. The planned \nconstruction of 40 additional parking spaces adjacent to the memorial, \nwhich is currently a wooded area, would further diminish the natural \nbeauty of the memorial and the park surroundings.''\n  I realize in the passage of time, even the most memorable acts of \ncourage and valor and bravery tend to fade into yesterday's history \nbooks. Succeeding generations tend to forget the lessons of the past, \nand the world, indeed, is a different place. Today, great historical \nevents, and even the lives and lessons of our Founding Fathers are many \ntimes mere footnotes in a fast-paced society, or worse, subject to \nrevision depending on what is politically correct at the moment.\n  But, let us not add to or hasten this erosion by unnecessarily \ncompeting or infringing upon what has been accurately called ``sacred \nand reverent space.''\n  This so-called controversy about the location of the proposed Air \nForce memorial in conjunction with the Iwo Jima memorial is, in fact, a \nparadox of enormous irony. The battle of Iwo Jima was fought to secure \na safe haven and staging area for bomber aircraft flown by the \nforerunners of the U.S. Air Force. Marines fought and died to help save \nthe lives of the fliers of the Army Air Corps. For 43 years, ever since \nthe memorial was dedicated on the Marine Corps birthday in 1954, the \nIwo Jima memorial has been in fact a memorial to both brave marines and \nfliers of World War II.\n  Why, why then, why indeed, should any memorial so inspired, so true \nto the memory and sacrifice of both marines and Army Air Corps fliers, \nwhy should such hallowed ground be subject to encroachment and \nduplication of yet another memorial for the same purpose, a memorial \nthat should stand in its own right and on its own site?\n  We should preserve the sanctity of a memorial that has come to be \nviewed by all Americans as a de facto memorial to World War II. Nothing \nshould detract from the serene and hallowed setting of the Iwo Jima \nmemorial.\n  In a letter I have received from the Commandant of the U.S. Marine \nCorps, Gen. C.C. Krulak, the Commandant eloquently sums up what all \nmarines feel in their hearts and what I have tried to explain in my \nremarks. I quote from his letter:\n\n       Although I was just a young boy, I remember watching as the \n     Iwo Jima memorial was erected on the edge of Arlington \n     Cemetery. I remember that November day in 1954 when my \n     godfather, Gen. Holland ``Howlin Mad'' Smith, stood before \n     that magnificent statue and, with tears slowly streaming down \n     his cheeks, softly said, ``My marines, my marines. . . .'' \n     Truly, this is a sacred place.\n\n  Mr. President, the commandant went on to say that, as the last marine \non active duty to have witnessed the Iwo dedication, he truly believes \nthat this Nation must preserve its sanctity. For, as General Krulak \nsaid, the Iwo Jima memorial is more than a monument; it is a place for \nreflection, a place to pay respect, and a place to gain inner strength. \nOver 23,000 marines were killed or injured on Iwo Jima, and each year, \nover 1 million Americans pay tribute to those marines.\n  General Krulak closed his letter by saying:\n\n       In speaking for them, for their survivors, and for all \n     marines past, present and future, the sanctity of the Iwo \n     Jima memorial must be preserved.\n\n  Semper fidelis, general, semper fidelis.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FAIRCLOTH (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Mack, Mr. \n        Lott, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Allard, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. \n        Brownback, Mr. Burns, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coverdell, \n        Mr. Craig, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Frist, Mr. Gorton, Mr. \n        Gramm, Mr. Grams, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Helms, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Bennett, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n        McConnell, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Smith \n        of Oregon, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Warner and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1285. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat married couples may file a combined return under which each spouse \nis taxed using the rates applicable to unmarried individuals; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n            THE MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY ELIMINATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that will eliminate the marriage penalty tax. This is \nsimilar to legislation in the House, H.R. 2456, which has 218 \ncosponsors, including the Speaker of the House.\n  According to the Joint Economic Committee, in 1996, more than 23 \nmillion married couples paid a marriage penalty, totaling an extra $28 \nbillion in taxes. This would mean the average couple is paying $1,200 \nmore in income taxes simply because they are married. I think it is \ntime to change the tax code so that we do not punish people simply for \nbeing married.\n  From 1913 to 1969, the federal income tax treated married couples \neither just as well as or better than if they were single. Since then, \nmarried couples have had to pay a marriage penalty. This is even more \nironic if you consider that the number of married couples where both \nwork has increased dramatically. Finally, the tax increase in 1993 made \nthe problem worse by raising the tax rates.\n\n[[Page S10797]]\n\n  This legislation is supported by Americans for Tax Reform and the \nNational Taxpayers Unions. I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nHutchinson and Mack, making a total of 35 Senators that are original \ncosponsors.\n  I would hope that we could end this penalty against marriage. \nMarriage should be cherished, not punished by the Federal Government. I \nwould urge other Senators to cosponsor this bill, and I would hope that \nwe could take up this legislation as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 1287. A bill to assist in the conservation of Asian elephants by \nsupporting and providing financial resources for the conservation \nprograms of nations within the range of Asian elephants and projects of \npersons with demonstrated expertise in the conservation of Asian \nelephants; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n              The Asian Elephant Conservation Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise today to introduce a bill \nto assist in the preservation of Asian elephants. The bill, the ``Asian \nElephant Conservation Act of 1997'', is modeled after the highly \nsuccessful African Elephant Conservation Act of 1988 and the Rhinoceros \nand Tiger Conservation Act of 1994. It will authorize up to $5 million \nper year to be appropriated to the Department of the Interior to fund \nvarious projects to aid in the preservation of the Asian elephant.\n  Since the challenges of the Asian elephants are so great, resources \nto date have not been sufficient to cope with the continued loss of \nhabitat and the consequent diminution of Asian elephant populations\n  Among the threats to the Asian elephant in addition to habitat loss \nare population fragmentation, human-elephant conflict, poaching for \nivory, meat, hide, bones and teeth, and capture for domestication. To \nreduce, remove, or otherwise effectively address these threats to the \nlong-term viability of populations of Asian elephants in the wild will \nrequire the joint commitment and effort of nations within the range of \nAsian elephants, the United States and other countries, and the private \nsector.\n  On April 22, 1997, I introduced the African Elephant Conservation \nReauthorization Act of 1997 (S. 627). By the late 1980's, the \npopulation of African elephants had dramatically declined from \napproximately 1.3 million animals in 1979 to less than 700,000 in 1987. \nThe primary reason for this decline was the poaching and illegal \nslaughter of elephants for their tusks, which fueled the international \ntrade policy. Today, as a result of the bill, the African elephant \npopulation has stabilized, international ivory prices remain low, and \nwildlife rangers are better equipped to stop illegal poaching \nactivities.\n  I am a strong proponent of the protection and conservation of \nendangered species. If we do not act now, the world's future \ngenerations may not be able to enjoy many of the species of wildlife \nnow in existence. This small, but critical investment of U.S. taxpayer \nmoney will be matched by private funds and will significantly improve \nthe likelihood that wild Asian elephants will exist in the 21st \nCentury. It is my hope that the Asian Elephant Conservation Act of 1997 \nwill hopefully see the same successes that the African elephant bill \nhas seen.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Campbell):\n  S. 1289. A bill to temporarily decrease the duty on certain \nindustrial nylon fabrics; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      tariff reduction legislation\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing this legislation to \nlessen a financial burden on American companies. I am pleased that my \ncolleague from Colorado, Senator Campbell is joining me as an original \ncosponsor. For approximately 20 years, various U.S. manufacturers have \nbeen paying substantial tariffs on a product that is not produced in \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, my legislation would significantly reduce the tariff \non this particular product from 16 to 6.7 percent. This product is an \nindustrial nylon fabric used in the manufacture of automotive timing \nbelts. United States companies that use this product in their \nmanufacturing processes have no choice but to import it since it has \nnot been produced domestically since the mid-1970's.\n  There is no domestic industry to harm by lowering this tariff, \nconsumers will clearly benefit, and many domestic industries will \nbenefit by becoming more competitive.\n  My bill would temporarily reduce the tariff on the nylon fabric \nproduct for 3 years. After that period, if there are still no U.S. \nproducers, further action would then be in order. Mr. President, \nreducing American competitiveness to protect non-existent domestic \nindustries simply does not make sense. It is my hope that this \nsituation will be rectified.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1290. A bill for the relief of Saeed Rezai; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                       private relief legislation\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce private relief \nlegislation on behalf of my constituents, Mr. Saeed Rezai, and his \nwife, Mrs. Julie Rezai.\n  As my colleagues are aware, those immigration cases that warrant \nprivate legislation are extremely rare. In fact, in nearly 8 years, I \nhave introduced just one bill to grant such relief--a bill for the \nrelief of Saeed Rezai in the last Congress. As I said before the Senate \nwhen I introduced that bill in 1995, I had hoped that this case would \nnot require congressional intervention. Unfortunately, it is clear that \nprivate legislation is the only means remaining to ensure that the \nequities of Mr. and Mrs. Rezai's case are heard and that a number of \nunresolved questions are answered without imposing a terrible hardship \non Mr. and Mrs. Rezai and on their marriage.\n  I wish to take a moment, Mr. President, to provide something by way \nof background to this somewhat complicated case and to explain the \nurgency of this legislation. Mr. Rezai first came to the United States \nin 1986. On June 15, 1991, he married his current wife, Julie, who is a \nU.S. citizen. Shortly thereafter, she filed an immigrant visa petition \non his behalf. Approval of this petition has been blocked, however, by \nthe application of Sec. 204(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. \nSection 204(c) precludes the approval of a visa petition for anyone who \nentered, or conspired to enter, into a fraudulent marriage. The \nImmigration and Naturalization Service [INS] applied this provision in \nMr. Rezai's case because his previous marriage ended in divorce before \nhis 2-year period of conditional residence had expired. In immigration \nproceedings following the divorce, the judge heard testimony from \nwitnesses on behalf of Mr. Rezai and his former wife. After considering \nthat testimony, he found there was insufficient evidence to warrant \nlifting the conditions on Mr. Rezai's permanent residency and, in the \nabsence of a qualifying marriage, granted Mr. Rezai voluntary departure \nfrom the United States. The judge was very careful to mention, however, \nthat there was no proof of false testimony by Mr. Rezai, and he granted \nvoluntary departure rather than ordering deportation because, in his \nwords, Mr. Rezai ``may be eligible for a visa in the future.''\n  Despite these comments by the immigration judge, who clearly did not \nanticipate the future application of the Sec. 204(c) exclusion to Mr. \nRezai's case, the INS has refused to approve Mrs. Rezai's petition for \npermanent residence on behalf of her husband based on that very \nexclusion. An appeal of this decision has been pending before the Board \nof Immigration Appeals [BIA] for 3 years. In the meantime, Mr. Rezai \nappealed the initial termination of his lawful permanent resident \nstatus in 1990. In August 1995, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals \ndenied this appeal and reinstated the voluntary departure order. Under \ncurrent law, there is no provision to stay Mr. Rezai's deportation \npending the BIA's consideration of Mrs. Rezai's current immigrant visa \npetition.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that Mr. Rezai deportation will \ncreate extraordinary hardship for both Mr. and Mrs. Rezai. Throughout \nall the proceedings of the past 6 years, not a single person that I \nknow of--including the INS--has questioned the validity of Mr. and Mrs. \nRezai's marriage. In fact, many that I have heard from have \nemphatically told me that Mr. and Mrs.\n\n[[Page S10798]]\n\nRezai's marriage is as strong as any they have seen. Given the \nprevailing political and cultural climate in Iran, I would not expect \nthat Mrs. Rezai will choose to make her home there. Thus, Mrs. Rezai's \ndeportation will result in either the breakup of a legitimate family or \nthe forced removal of a U.S. citizen and her husband to a third country \nforeign to both of them.\n\n  It should also be noted that Mr. Rezai has been present in the United \nStates for more than a decade. During this time he has assimilated to \nAmerican culture and has become a contributing member of his community. \nHe has been placed in a responsible position of employment as the \nsecurity field supervisor at Westminster College where he has gained \nthe respect and admiration of both his peers and his supervisors. In \nfact, I received a letter from the interim president of Westminster \nCollege, signed by close to 150 of Mr. Rezai's associates, attesting to \nhis many contributions to the college and the community. This is just \none of the many, many letters and phone calls I have received from \nmembers of our community. Mr. Rezai's forced departure in light of \nthese considerations would both unduly limit his own opportunities and \ndeprive the community of his continued contributions.\n  Finally, Mr. Rezai's deportation would create a particular hardship \nfor his wife, who was diagnosed just a few years ago with Multiple \nSclerosis [MS]. Mrs. Rezai's doctor has recommended that her husband be \ndesignated as her primary caregiver for what is expected to be a \nlifelong debilitating illness. It is doubtful that adequate medical \ncare would be available should she be forced to return with her husband \nto Iran or to some other country willing to accept them as immigrants. \nFinally, her doctor has suggested that severe symptoms and rapid \ndeterioration of Mrs. Rezai's condition are possible as a result of the \nstress being placed upon her by her husband's protracted immigration \nproceedings and the uncertainty of their future.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that we must think before enforcing \nan action that will result in such severe consequences as the \ndestruction of Mr. and Mrs. Rezai's marriage and the endangering of \nMrs. Rezai's already fragile health. The legislation I am introducing \ntoday, if enacted, will put an end to what has been a long and drawn-\nout ordeal for the Rezais by granting Mr. Rezai full permanent resident \nstatus. At a minimum, the outstanding questions regarding the propriety \nof the denial of Mr. Rezai's current immigrant visa petition need to be \naddressed. With the introduction of this legislation today and its \nconsideration by the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration, \nwe can ensure that Mr. Rezai's deportation will be stayed pending the \nthorough review of these questions by the Board of Immigration Appeals. \nI urge each of my colleagues to support this immigration bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \n        Brownback, Mr. Roberts and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 1291. A bill to permit the interstate distribution of State-\ninspected meat under certain circumstances; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n    THE INTERSTATE DISTRIBUTION OF STATE-INSPECTED MEAT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Interstate \nDistribution of State-inspected Meat Act of 1997. This legislation will \nlift the ban on interstate distribution of State-inspected meat and \npoultry, providing some long-term relief to our livestock producers and \nfinally ending a long-standing inequity in meat inspection laws that \naffects about 3,000 meat processors in 26 States.\n\n  In the 1960's, the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry \nProducts Inspection Act allowed States to implement their own \ninspection programs. At the time, there remained some uncertainty as to \nhow well the State inspection programs would function, so a provision \nwas included banning meat inspected by States from interstate \ndistribution. There was also a provision included requiring the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to periodically recertify that the State \nprograms are ``at least equal to'' the Federal standards. In the 30 \nyears since this program was instituted, a State program has never \nfailed to achieve recertification.\n  Mr. President, today the ban on interstate distribution has clearly \noutlived its purpose. Instead of protecting the health of our citizens, \nit only stifles competition in the meat packing industry and impounds \nthe available market to State-inspected plants. Right now, State-\ninspected ostrich, venison, buffalo, and pheasant are freely \ndistributed across State lines; yet, a perfectly good steak is banned.\n  Furthermore, foreign competitors are allowed to send their meat \nproducts throughout the United States without regard for State \nboundaries. These foreign companies do not face a higher standard than \nour State-inspected processing plants. The only difference is that the \nState-inspected plants have much tighter oversight by the USDA. There \nis no reason that U.S. plants should be restricted from competing with \nforeign countries.\n  Monte Lucherini runs a State-inspected plant in Logan, UT. He runs a \ngood business and makes an excellent product, but is still not allowed \nto do business outside of Utah. He writes:\n\n       I believe that my gross sales would increase 30 to 40 \n     percent. . . . Employment would be increased also. I would \n     need two to three more butchers, and probably five to six \n     more part-time workers. . . . It has always been a thorn in \n     our side that we couldn't service the customers that want our \n     products.\n\n  David H. Yadron runs a state-inspected plant in Orem, Utah. He says:\n\n       By scrimping and saving, this ``mom and pop'' operation was \n     built to federal standards two years ago. Nevertheless, large \n     companies and foreign competitors enjoy the privilege of \n     shipping their meat products interstate even though our \n     facility and products are equal or superior to theirs. This \n     injustice limits our profitability while providing an unfair \n     marketing advantage to foreign companies and large domestic \n     operations. Unless Congress repeals the unfair prohibition, \n     we could be forced out of business. Conversely, if Wind River \n     grows, then our suppliers, including the local, federal meat \n     inspected packers, would also grow.\n\n  Mr. President, there are restaurants and food retailers in many \nStates that would love to purchase meat products from Utah's State-\ninspected plants. Utah's State inspection program receives the highest \nmarks possible by the USDA, and many of our plants produce unique and \nhard-to-find products. Instead of purchasing from Utah, these \nrestaurants and retailers are forced to purchase from foreign \ncompetitors, even though the quality of the foreign product is often \ninferior.\n  There is no sense to this, Mr. President; it cuts into the profits of \nour retailers, raises the prices for our consumers, stifles business \nfor our processors, and limits the market for our livestock and poultry \nproducers.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to lift the ban in State-inspected \nmeat and poultry. There is no reason whatever to believe that \npermitting interstate distribution for State-inspected meat would \ncompromise safety in any way. In fact, I believe we would have even \ngreater assurances about the safety of meat than we do now. The USDA \nwould continue to set and ensure inspection standards.\n  I am aware that the USDA has recently begun looking into the merits \nof lifting the prohibition on interstate distribution, and I am eager \nto work with the USDA on a workable plan for bringing this law up-to-\ndate. I call on my colleagues to support this effort to introduce \nequity into the meat packing industry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof the Interstate Distribution of State-inspected Meat Act of 1997 \nintroduced today by my colleague from Utah [Mr. Hatch] and I thank him \nfor his leadership on this issue.\n  This is a very important bill for my State of Wisconsin which has \nnearly 300 State-inspected meat plants which provide jobs and income \nfor rural communities. The quality meat products processed by these \nplants such as the Lodi Sausage Co. in Lodi, WI, Gunderson Food Service \nin Mondovi, WI, Goodfella's Pizza Corp. in Medford, WI, The Ham Store \nin Brookfield, WI, Country Fresh Meats in Hatley, WI, and Louie's Finer \nMeats, Inc. in Cumberland, WI are prohibited from being sold across \nState lines. These small businesses face the interstate marketing \nprohibition not because their products haven't been inspected--in fact \nall these businesses are inspected by the\n\n[[Page S10799]]\n\nState of Wisconsin--but because of an archaic provision of Federal law \nwhich prohibits interstate shipment of State-inspected meats even \nthough the State inspection program is certified as equal to Federal \nmeat inspection programs.\n  These plants, and hundreds like them in Wisconsin, produce quality \nspecialty meat products which are demanded by consumers in other \nStates. But the owners of these facilities are unable to capitalize on \ntheir specialties and meet that market demand. By limiting these plants \nto markets within their home-State borders, Federal law effectively \nprevents them from expanding their markets, increasing the number of \npeople they employ, and generating additional economic activity in \nrural areas.\n  These small plants pose no competitive threat to larger processors \nwho are federally inspected. In most cases, State-inspected plants are \nsmall family owned businesses, employing between 1 and 20 people, \nproducing specialty products to fill a small market niche. These plant \nowners and operators pay special attention to the quality of their \nproducts and because of this they cannot grow very large. Wisconsin's \nsmall-scale meat processors take great pride in their products which \nreflect the ethnic diversity in my State. In fact, it is my \nunderstanding that Wisconsin specialty meat products win nearly 25 \npercent of the awards at the American Association of Meat Processors' \nnationwide product show.\n  Furthermore, these small State-inspected plants play a critical role \nin sustaining rural communities and helping to ensure diversity of size \nin the livestock industry. Most of these plants buy livestock locally \nwhich helps maintain the viability of nearby small family livestock \noperations. By buying locally they know exactly where their inputs bar \ncoming from and how they are produced, which allows them to control the \nquality of their products. These local buying practices help counteract \ntrends toward concentration in the livestock and poultry production and \nprocessing industries providing small livestock and dairy producers \nwith marketing alternatives in any industry dominated by a few large \nmeat packers.\n  The owners of these small businesses in Wisconsin correctly point out \nthat they face even more meat shipment restrictions than their \ncompetitors from foreign countries. Under our trade agreements, meat \nproducts from foreign countries are allowed into the United States and \nacross State borders as long as the country has an inspection program \nthat is ``equivalent'' to U.S. programs. Meanwhile, even if State \ninspection programs are ``equal to'' Federal inspection programs, meats \ninspected under State programs are still precluded from interstate \nshipment Mr. President, it simply isn't fair and it is time to \neliminate this inequity.\n  The bill we are introducing today makes a simple but important change \nto Federal law to allow State-inspected meats to be sold across State \nlines after the State inspection program is favorably reviewed and \ncertified by the Secretary of Agriculture as at least ``equal to'' \nFederal meat inspection programs. If State programs are not equal to \nthe Federal inspection program, they will not be certified by USDA and \nState-inspected meats will not cross State lines. The Secretary is also \nrequired by this bill to certify that the State inspection program is \non schedule in implementing USDA's new Hazard Analysis and Critical \nControl Points [HAACP] regulations. The bill also requires the \nSecretary to annually recertify the State program. To provide further \nsafeguards, Federal meat inspectors may also randomly inspect State \nplants to ensure that they continue to meet Federal standards. The \nSecretary will have the authority to reinstate the interstate shipment \nban on plants that fail to meet Federal standards. This bill is \nresponsible to consumers while providing equity to small State-\ninspected plants.\n  Mr. President, I think the best arguments in favor of this \nlegislation are made by those small business owners who are directly \naffected by the interstate shipment prohibition imposed on their meat \nproducts. I want to share with my colleagues some comments made by \nowners of some State-inspected processing businesses in Wisconsin.:\n  Louis Muench, owner of Louie's Finer Meats, Inc. In Cumberland, WI \nwrites:\n\n       We are the operators of a small meat processing and sausage \n     making operation in a small town in northern Wisconsin . . . \n     Our plant is 30 miles from the Minnesota border and we cannot \n     even provide sausage for a pancake supper in Minnesota, let \n     alone any wholesaling to supermarkets and convenience stores. \n     We have received over 100 State and National awards for our \n     sausage products. We cannot even market these products on a \n     regional basis, let alone a national basis. This past May \n     [1996], we were honored to receive two international gold \n     medals for our sausage in Frankfurt, Germany. We are not \n     allowed to market these products anywhere but Wisconsin. \n     These kinds of restrictions make it difficult to maintain a \n     profitable business.\n\n  Dan Kubly, one of the owners of LazyBones Ham Store, in Brookfield, \nWI writes:\n\n       We work very closely with our state inspectors and consider \n     them an ally in our overall business. We constantly consult \n     with them on equipment conditions, labeling and handling \n     procedures in our plant. It makes no sense that we are \n     permitted to ship our products anywhere as long as the retail \n     customer buys the product at our stores, but are not allowed \n     to ship the same product across state lines through a \n     distributor . . . Our volume is increasing rapidly and we are \n     interested in contracting with a multi-state distributor, \n     however we are unable to do this because we do not have USDA \n     inspection. We feel our business will suffer significantly \n     and job creation will end if we are not permitted to expand \n     due to this unnecessary prohibition.\n\n  James Weber, owner of Gunderson Food Service, in Modovi, WI writes:\n\n       We are operating a small meat plant in northwest Wisconsin \n     and employ 9 people. We slaughter and and custom process for \n     the local farm community, smoke ham and bacon, manufacture \n     sausage and sell retail and wholesale. We are under Wisconsin \n     meat inspection and are required to be equal to or better \n     than Federal inspection. In the last 4 years we have taken 18 \n     Wisconsin, national and international awards for our ham, \n     jerky, beef sticks and sausage; but because I am in Wisconsin \n     I am discriminated against by the Federal government. We are \n     30 miles from the Minnesota border but cannot sell our \n     product there. If my products are of high enough quality to \n     be sent 250 miles to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, then why is there \n     a problem with me selling it 25 miles away in Waubaska, \n     Minnesota?\n\n  Bill Ruef, owner of Ruef's Meat Market in New Glarus, WI who \nprocesses a Swiss ready-to-eat snack called ``Landjaeger'' writes:\n\n       This [Landjaeger] is our most popular item, and I get asked \n     on a regular basis by business owners from other states--we \n     are about 25 miles from the Illinois border--if we can ship \n     our Landjaegers to them for resale in their establishments. \n     It really hurts me and my business when I have to tell them \n     ``no'' because we aren't federally inspected. This kind of \n     unfair prohibition will only continue to drive small \n     businesses to fold and allow large conglomerates to \n     monopolize the industry.\n\n  Mr. President, these business owners say it best. The current \nprohibition on interstate shipment of State-inspected meats is obsolete \nand patently unfair to small meat processors. It is time to correct \nthis inequity and I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I join with the distinguished \nSenators from Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming in introducing a bill which \naddresses an injustice that has developed out of current law.\n  Under current law, meat and poultry products that are processed in \nplants which are inspected by State departments of agriculture are not \nallowed to be shipped over State lines. This restriction is an unfair \nrestraint on competition which is especially discriminatory toward \nsmall processing facilities.\n  State inspection programs are required to maintain standards are ``at \nleast equal to'' federal inspection standards. The U.S. Department of \nAgriculture periodically recertifies that State programs continue to \nmeet that standard. meeting an ``equal to'' standard is the same \nrequirement that foreign meat processors must meet in order to sell \ntheir product within U.S. borders. Not allowing State inspected \nfacilities the freedom to sell their product throughout the country \nafter having met the same standard that allows their foreign \ncompetitors to market their product unimpeded is, quite simply, unfair.\n  This arbitrary restriction has been troublesome to me ever since I \nwas Secretary of Agriculture for Kansas. I've seen firsthand that this \nrestriction impedes competition. In fact, I would like to insert in the \nRecord a letter that I received from a professional in\n\n[[Page S10800]]\n\nthe State of Kansas who operates a State inspected plant. My \nconstituent presents a credible case for why her business is limited \nbecause of the restriction on interstate shipment.\n  Proprietors of State-inspected plants are not the only advocates of \nchanging the law. USDA's packer concentration panel recommended an \nimmediate repeal of this prohibition as a way to slow packer \nconcentration. The National Association of State Department of \nAgriculture, which represents the Secretaries and Commissioners of \nAgriculture which have responsibility for overseeing State programs, \nstrongly endorses the repeal of interstate shipment restrictions. Based \non public comment solicited in the Federal Register and public hearings \nthat were held throughout the country, the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture recently announced its support of lifting the ban on \ninterstate shipment.\n  Mr. President, I would like to address the issue of food safety in \nrelation to my proposal. Food safety is paramount. This measure would \nnot in any way undermine the consumer's access to a reliable and safe \nproduct. However, this bill is not about food safety. Rather, this bill \naddresses an issue of commerce and trade.\n  In other words, food safety is an issue of enforcing the inspection \nstandards that are in place, whether under State or Federal oversight. \nIf State-inspected meat is safe to be distributed in Kansas, it is safe \nto be shipped to Missouri, or Oklahoma, or wherever else an \nentrepreneur finds a customer. Conversely, if the food is not safe to \nbe shipped over State lines, it shouldn't be distributed with the State \neither.\n  And, as both State and federally inspected plants implement the \nHazard Analysis and Critical Control Point system, we can be even more \nassured that plants throughout the country are conforming to a \nuniformly high set of standards. Now, more than ever, a focus on who \ndoes the inspecting has no relevance in determining where the product \ncan be consumed safely.\n  I would like to highlight the paper that the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture recently released in support of allowing the interstate \nshipment of State-inspected meat and poultry products. In this paper, \nthe administration states its concept for legislative action and \nestablishes certain recommendations for what that legislation should \ninclude. I believe that there is much common ground between the \nSecretary's guidelines and the bill that my colleagues and I are \nintroducing today.\n  I look forward to working with the USDA, as well as my colleagues \nhere in the Senate, in order to pass and implement this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Home On The Range & Co.,\n\n                               Scott City, KS, September 11, 1997.\n     Congressman Sam Brownback,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Brownback: On September 6 of last week I \n     was asked to attend a meeting called by Secretary of \n     Agriculture Dan Glickman concerning the interstate shipment \n     of State inspected meat and poultry products. I was a Kansas \n     representative of small processors that are affected by this \n     issue.\n       This is not a food safety issue. Our plants meet or exceed \n     the provisions provided by the USDA. In many cases we are \n     even more careful of our products standards because we live \n     in the communities where we work. If our customers do not \n     like the quality of products we produce they tell their \n     friends and so on. We want to produce the safest and highest \n     quality of products.\n       It is an unfair competition issue. With the passage of the \n     NAFTA and other trade agreements, foreign meat and poultry \n     products have free access to United States interstate \n     commerce. These foreign inspection systems must meet \n     requirements similar to those that the states must meet in \n     assuring that their systems meet the requirements found in \n     the federal acts. Why should beef inspected in Mexico have \n     free access to interstate commerce when beef I process can \n     not be sold in Colorado?\n       Expanding the market for state inspected plants will create \n     jobs and the economy in all our communities. These plants \n     provide ``value added'' and specialty products to the market \n     that the larger plants do not want to produce.\n       Another issue that does not make sense is the fact that the \n     Buffalo Jerky I produce by the exact process as the Beef \n     Jerky I produce is able to be sold across the United States \n     because the USDA does not regulate them as species which \n     require mandatory federal inspection.\n       Please give your support to Bill number S. 1862 that is \n     being introduced concerning this matter. It is very important \n     this be passed now. Time is running out for the small \n     processors. In Kansas alone, 6-7 plants are closing a year \n     because we are not able to access the trade we need to stay \n     in business.\n       Kansas Secretary of Agriculture, Allie Devine is in favor \n     of this bill. She would be happy to answer any questions you \n     may have on this issue.\n       Thank you very much for your time.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Lori Robbins, Owner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Burns, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Akaka, Mr. Allard, Mr. Bond, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coverdell, \n        Mr. Craig, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Ford, \n        Mr. Frist, Mr. Graham, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Helms, Mrs. Hutchison, \n        Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lott, Mr. Mack, Mr. \n        McConnell, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Reid, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Santorum, \n        Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Specter, Mr. Thompson, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1292. A resolution disapproving the cancellations transmitted by \nthe President on October 6, 1997, regarding Public Law 105-45; to the \nCommittee on Appropriations, pursuant to the order of section 1025 of \nPublic Law 93-344 for seven days of session.\n\n\n                        disapproval legislation\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have sought the floor now to introduce \na disapproval bill to reverse the President's use of the line-item veto \nin the fiscal year 1998 military construction appropriations bill. I \nbelieve at least 37 of my colleagues will join as cosponsors of this \nbill.\n  The Line-Item Veto Act, public law 104-130, provides very specific \nfast-track procedures for consideration of a disapproval bill. I want \nto discuss those in detail later in these comments.\n  Congress received the President's special message listing the 38 \ncancellations in the military construction bill on Monday, October 6. \nThe bill we introduce today is within the 5 calendar days of session \ntimeframe provided for fast-track process.\n  Let me take a minute on the merits of this bill, Mr. President. In \nJune, the President reached a budget agreement with the bipartisan \nleadership of the Congress. That agreement provided an increase of $2.6 \nbillion for national defense over the amount that the President had \nrequested in the budget for fiscal year 1998. The President's action on \nthe military construction bill, in my judgment, reneges on the budget \nagreement he reached with the Congress. We were given our spending caps \nunder the agreement and the Appropriations Committee presented the \nSenate with 13 appropriations bills consistent with the spirit, terms \nand limits of the revised budget.\n  We upheld our end of the agreement with the President. The President \nhas not. This afternoon the Appropriations Committee met to evaluate \nthe President's use of the line-item veto authority.\n  I called this hearing after consultation with Senator Byrd because of \nthe manner in which the President had used this new prerogative on this \nmilitary construction bill. I asked the committee to consider whether \nthat tool was used as intended by Congress, and that intention was that \nthe line-item veto would be used to eliminate wasteful or unnecessary \nspending. The committee heard testimony from the Air Force, Navy and \nArmy regarding the merits of the 38 military construction projects. \nToday's hearings afforded our committee the chance to review the status \nof these projects in the military's future budget plans and whether or \nnot they could be executed in 1998. Our military witnesses testified \nthat in fact these projects were mission-essential and that they could \nbe commenced in 1998. These military witnesses stated that the military \nservices were not consulted in deciding which projects should be vetoed \non this bill. These witnesses also informed us that 33 of the 38 \nprojects in the President's message on the line-item veto are in the \nDepartment's future year defense plan. Let me repeat that. Thirty-three \nof the 38 projects the President indicated he\n\n[[Page S10801]]\n\nwished to line-item veto were in a plan he had approved himself.\n  They told us that the President's January budget constraints had \nprohibited them from including many of these projects in this year's \nbudget. If the military services at the beginning of the year had had \nthe extra $2.6 billion that the President agreed to in July, it is my \njudgment that all of the projects listed in the disapproval bill could \nand probably would have been included in the President's fiscal year \n1998 budget request, if he listened to the military departments.\n  It's my belief that we will be successful in what we are starting \ntoday, which is an effort to overturn these line-item vetoes because \nthe projects that the President has attempted to eliminate are \nmeritorious, are sought by the Department, are within the budget \nagreement, and they are not wasteful or excessive spending.\n  These projects reflect a combination of quality of life, safety, \nreadiness and infrastructure enhancement initiatives, Mr. President. A \nsubstantial number of them would significantly improve the day-to-day \nworking conditions for men and women in uniform. Our soldiers, sailors, \nairmen and marines are the ones that are being shortchanged by the \nPresident's veto, not officials in the Pentagon or in the White House.\n  I will urge my colleagues to support us in this important endeavor. \nWe must stand together to require that the President live up to the \nbargain he made with the Congress this summer. The Line-Item Veto Act \nprovides a process to resolve the issue quickly, so I want to take the \ntime of the Senate to outline that process so that we all know this is \na new process for all of us.\n  Under this act, the President sent to Congress one special message \nfor each law in which the President exercises his cancellation \nauthority under the Line-Item Veto Act. That special message must \ncontain a numbered list of each item the President seeks to cancel. The \nLine-Item Veto Act includes a fast track--a process for the speedy \nconsideration of one disapproval bill for each message. Our action \ntoday only pertains to the military construction bill.\n  In order to overturn one or more of the cancellations in a special \nmessage, the Congress must send a bill to the President disapproving \nthe cancellations. That bill may be vetoed by the President using his \nconstitutional veto authority. As with any other bill, the President's \nveto then may be overturned only by an affirmative vote of two-thirds \nof the Members of each House. In order to qualify for this expedited \nprocess, the provisions of the Line-Item Veto Act require that a \ndisapproval bill must be introduced within five calendar days of \nsession after the Congress receives a special message from the \nPresident. With respect to the Senate, a calendar day of session is a \nday in which both Houses of Congress are in session. This fast-track \nprocedure applies only in the House for 30 calendar days of session. \nThere is no time limit on the Senate's consideration of the bill, other \nthan the time for introduction of the bill and the discharge from the \ncommittee.\n\n  A disapproval bill in the House must contain a list of all the items \ncanceled in the special message. A disapproval bill in the Senate may \ncontain any or all of the items canceled. I might say, Mr. President, \nthat the bill I will introduce with my cosponsors will not include all \nof the measures, because some Senators have indicated they do not want \nto move forward with their items. The format for the disapproval bill \nis spelled out in the Line-Item Veto Act, and the fast track process is \navailable only if that exact format is followed.\n  The addition of anything other than the numbers from the list of the \nitems canceled in the special message, whether on the floor or in \nconference, results in the loss of the fast track process in both the \nHouse and the Senate. In other words, no amendments to this bill, other \nthan dealing with the specific items by number as listed in the \nPresident's message, are in order. Once introduced, the disapproval \nbill is referred to the committees with jurisdiction over the items \nthat have been canceled, and it must be reported within 7 calendar days \nof session. After 7 calendar days of session, it is in order in either \nthe House or the Senate to have the committees discharged. Special \nrules then apply in the House and the Senate with respect to debate and \namendments on a disapproval bill.\n  In the Senate, there are no more than 10 hours of debate with one \nextension of time for up to 5 additional hours. That is possible at the \nrequest of the leadership. Debate on any amendment is limited to one \nhour with up to a limit of 10 hours, at which time all amendments then \npending are voted on.\n  Special rules are also provided in the act for the conference \ncommittee. The conferees are directed to accept any item in a \ndisapproval bill that was included in both the House and the Senate and \nare limited to accepting or rejecting any item in disagreement. In \nother words, there can be nothing added in conference that is not in \none bill or the other.\n  Debate in the Senate on a conference report is limited to four hours. \nThis will be an expedited process, Mr. President. We intend to start it \nas soon as we return. Let me say again that there is a learning curve \nfor us on the line-item veto process, and I am also constrained to say \nto the Senate what I just said at the conclusion of the hearing on the \nsubject of the President's special message before the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  It is obvious to me that the use of the line-item veto by the White \nHouse in this instance was very excessive. It is also obvious to me \nthat the information process in getting the details to the President \nconcerning the items in the bill that he used the line-item veto on \nwere very, very badly handled. We are now awaiting the President's \naction on the Defense Appropriations bill. As chairman, I have been \nnotified that the Department of Defense wishes to discuss that bill \nwith our staff and with Members, and there was an indication that we \nmight be asked to ``negotiate'' to see what items would be subject to a \nveto under the Line-Item Veto Act and what items the President would \nyield to that Congress desires to not have vetoed.\n  I have notified the Department of Defense and the White House that we \nare not prepared--Senator Byrd and I have agreed--to negotiate with \nregard to any of those items. We will--and our door is open--explain to \nthe White House or the Department why we put in any of the items, or \nwhy we left them out, but we will not negotiate. Our constitutional \nduty is to pass legislation. As a matter of fact, the Congress is given \nthe specific authority for the legislative process. The President may \nrecommend to the Congress, but he cannot dictate to the Congress, and \nhe is not going to dictate to the Congress during the watch of this \nSenator. I think I am joined in that regard by the Senator from West \nVirginia. We do not intend to negotiate with regard to items that have \nalready been passed by the Congress. We do discuss it before we pass a \nbill with the administration and we listen to them at times about \nthreats of vetoes. But we are not going to listen to those threats \nafter a bill is passed.\n  I urge the Senate to understand this process that we are going \nthrough now because it is obvious that the process will be followed \nagain and again. I announced at the conclusion of the hearings on this \nmessage on the Military Construction bill that if the same process is \nfollowed on the Department of Defense bill, an arrogant abuse of power, \nI intend to introduce a bill to repeal the Line-Item Veto Act. I was a \nsupporter of the Line-Item Veto Act; as a matter of fact, I was \nchairman of the conference on the Senate side of that act. But I \nbelieved it should be used for a stated purpose, only to eliminate \nwasteful or unnecessary spending. We make mistakes at times and we make \ncompromises at times, which perhaps could lead to what a President \ncould class as being wasteful or unnecessary spending. But a wholesale \ncondemnation of an act passed by Congress by use of the line-item veto \npen, to me, is arrogance. From my point of view, I will persist in \ntrying to repeal that statute and take it away from this \nadministration--it will only be extended to the executive branch for a \nshort period of time anyway--if it is abused again.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10802]]\n\n                                S. 1292\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     Congress disapproves of cancellations 97-4, 97-5, 97-6, 97-7, \n     98-8, 97-9, 97-10, 97-11, 97-12, 97-13, 97-14, 97-15, 97-16, \n     97-17, 97-18, 97-19, 97-20, 97-21, 97-22, 97-23, 97-24, 97-\n     25, 97-26, 97-27, 97-28, 97-29, 97-30, 97-32, 97-33, 97-34, \n     97-35, 97-36, 97-37, 97-38, 97-39, and 97-40, as transmitted \n     by the President in a special message on October 6, 1997, \n     regarding Public Law 105-45.\n\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased and I am proud to join with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, my friend, a \nfriend in every sense of the word, Ted Stevens, in offering legislation \nto put back on the President's desk those projects which were line-item \nvetoed, at least those projects that Senators want to put back before \nthe President for his consideration, and if he wants to veto that bill, \nhe can do so, and then Congress can override or sustain his veto.\n  Mr. President, I think that one of the most significant things that \nhas happened in the history of this country was the passage of the \nLine-Item Veto Act. To me, it was one of the most shocking abdications \nof duty that Members of the Congress have committed. I am not here \ntoday to say ``I told you so,'' but I am here today to say that this \npernicious act should be repealed.\n  I hope that the Supreme Court of the United States will strike it \ndown, but there has to be a case brought. I attempted that with other \ncolleagues in both Houses, and the Supreme Court, as everybody knows, \nsaid we didn't have standing, even though the act itself anticipated \nthat such a case would be brought by Members of Congress.\n  I am not here today to argue that. But I am here today to just take a \nfew minutes to point out for the record why the Line Item Veto Act is \nan unconstitutional act. No matter what the Supreme Court ultimately \nsays, I will always think it is an unconstitutional act. The \ndistinguished chairman has already stated the law and what the \ninstructions were in that law as to what actions Congress may take and \nwhen, and all of that. So I will not attempt to go into that. He has \nalready indicated what was brought out in the hearings this afternoon. \nOne thing was that the administration's right hand doesn't know what \nthe left hand is doing.\n  I was called by Mr. Raines on Monday as to the one item that I had \nthat was line-item vetoed. I was told that certain criteria governed \nthe actions of the President in using the line-item veto pen. I was \ntold that the one item that is to be located in West Virginia was, in \nthe face of the governing criteria, to be line-item vetoed. I stated to \nMr. Raines, ``That is an incorrect statement of the case. This item is \nin the Defense Department's 5-year plan, and the design has already \nbeen started. It is under way. So your criteria don't fit this \nproject.'' And he indicated that he would have to take another look, \ntherefore, and asked me to send down the papers from which I was \nreading, which I did, and he indicated that he would get back to me, \nwhich he did not. And I don't fault him for not getting back to me. He \nhas other things to do, I am sure.\n  But what I am saying is that this action on the part of the \nadministration was an abuse even of a bad law; an abuse even of a bad \nlaw.\n  In the very first section of the very first article of the \nConstitution these words are to be found. It is one sentence. Section \n1:\n  All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress \nof the United States which shall consist of a Senate and a House of \nRepresentatives.\n  That is very plain. It says that only the Congress has the \nconstitutional authority to make laws. ``All legislative powers'' --not \n``some powers''; not a ``few powers''; but ``All legislative powers \nherein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.'' It \ndoesn't say the President may share in that. The President doesn't have \nany lawmaking power. He is limited to the veto power insofar as making \nthe laws are concerned--the veto power as set forth in the Constitution \nof the United States.\n  So he has no lawmaking power. The Constitution states the limits of \nhis veto authority.\n  It states in section 7 of article I that, and I read:\n\n       Every bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a \n     Law, be presented to the President of the United States; if \n     he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, \n     with his Objections to that House in which it shall have \n     originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their \n     Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.\n\n  I will not read the rest of the language dealing with the veto.\n  But Congress in the passing of the Line-Item Veto Act went far afield \nfrom the Constitution of the United States. Congress in the Line Item \nVeto Act said, in essence, that when the President signs an \nappropriation bill into law, he has 5 days thereafter during which time \nhe can cancel out certain portions of that bill which has already \nbecome law.\n  So that is what he did in this instance. He signed into law a bill, \nand then, unilaterally, he came along 5 days later and changed that \nlaw. He amended it. He struck out certain items. If that bill were \nbefore the Senate and if Senator Stevens or Senator Grassley or Senator \nBennett or any other Senator wished to move to strike an item in the \nbill, which, in this case, was to be at Camp Dawson in Preston County, \nWV--if any one of those Senators moved to strike that item, they could \ndo it. But before they could succeed in striking that item, they would \nhave to have a majority of the Senate to support them by a vote.\n\n  The vote could be by voice. It could be by division. It could be by \nrollcall. But they would have to have a majority of a quorum in the \nSenate in order to be successful in striking that item. They would not \nyet have fully accomplished their aim, however. A majority of the \nMembers in a quorum of the other body would likewise have to support \nthe striking of that item. If all 100 Senators were present, they would \nhave to have 51 votes. If all 435 Members of the House were present, \nthey would have to have at least 218 votes in order to successfully \nstrike that item. A majority of each House would have to support the \nconference report. But in any event, in the first instance, a majority \nof each body would have to support the amendment in order to strike the \nitem from the bill.\n  Striking an item from a bill is amending a bill. After the President \nhas signed a bill into law, then under this Line-Item Veto Act, a \nPresident--Democrat or Republican, it doesn't make any difference--may \nafter the first 10 minutes, after the first 5 minutes, after the first \n2 days, 3 days, or 4 days, even on the fifth day, he may go back and \nsinglehandedly, unilaterally cancel out an item in the law; in other \nwords, strike it out; change the law. He could, if he wished to, line-\nitem out 90 percent of the law, which in that form, as a bill, would \nprobably not have passed either body. But one man, or woman, if it \nshould be, as the President of the United States may unilaterally amend \na bill. That is amending a bill.\n  The Senator from Iowa if he offers a motion to strike my item from \nthe bill is moving to amend the bill. He is pursuing the legislative \nprocess. That is the lawmaking process. He is amending a bill. As I \nhave already said, he can't do it alone. His vote only counts for 1 out \nof 100. He has to have a majority.\n  But not so with the President. The President may amend unilaterally, \nafter he signs the bill into law. According to the Constitution, if he \napprove the bill, he shall sign it. Well, he must have approved it, or \nhe wouldn't have signed the bill. He approved it. He signed the bill \ninto law. Up to 5 days later, he may go back and change that law \nunilaterally. And that is what he did in this instance. He changed the \nlaw unilaterally. He struck out Camp Dawson.\n  Did Senators really intend to give one man in the White House that \nkind of power, that kind of legislative power? Can they really believe \nthat the Framers who wrote this Constitution would have ever intended \nthat that be done? It is mind-boggling--mind-boggling. It is mind-\nboggling to me to think that a majority of these two Houses would give \nany President--any President, Republican or Democrat--that kind of \npower. And with that kind of power the President, be he Republican or \nDemocrat, holds the sword of Damocles over the head of every Senator \nand every House Member.\n\n[[Page S10803]]\n\n  Am I going to vote against a certain treaty, or some nomination? The \nPresident may say, ``Look, you have an item in the bill. You have done \na great job. You have done a great job for the State of West Virginia. \nI am really proud of you. The people down in your State love you. You \ndid this, you did that. And I want you to have this item. But can we \nbargain a little here? Can we negotiate a little bit? Can you help me \non what I want that is in the bill? Can you help me on this \nnomination?'' Or whatever. ``Maybe we can reach an amicable agreement \nhere where you will get your item, and I will get mine.''\n  Now, I do not want to say that I am not willing to listen to the \nadministration. We do that all the time when the subcommittees bring \nthese bills to the floor. The subcommittees on appropriations work for \nweeks in hearings. They listen to witnesses. They talk with their \nstaffs. They look over the correspondence. They study the needs of the \nvarious agencies and departments. And then they get together and they \nmark up the bill in the subcommittee. Then it goes to the full \ncommittee. Then it comes to the Senate. During all of this time, the \nadministration is telling us what they want and what they don't want. \nWe understand that. We know all about that. We know what they want and \nwhat they don't want. But it may be the collective judgment of the \nsubcommittee to do otherwise. So the subcommittee brings this bill to \nthe full committee, and it is then brought to the Senate. And we act on \nit, and it goes to conference. Then what happens?\n  Well, I have been treated to just a little bit of it lately. This is \nno surprise to me. We pass an amendment like this--a bill like this--\nand give it to any President. He will hold over your head a hammer. So, \nas we go to conference, the administration people come into the \nconference, or they come into our offices, or wherever they meet with \nthe leadership, and they say, ``Look, this item the President will \nveto. If that item is in there, the President is going to veto it. This \nitem we want. This item the President will veto unless you modify it.''\n  I knew that would be the situation in which we were going to find \nourselves once this Line-Item Veto Act was passed.\n  So, as far as I am concerned, it impinges upon a Senator's or a House \nMember's freedom of speech. They have to be a little bit more careful \nabout what they say about any administration.\n  It impinges on a Senator's freedom to act in accordance with the \nwishes of the constituents who send him here. And to that extent he is \nthat much less a free man, less able to exercise his own independence. \nThe distinguished Senator from Alaska has said we do not intend to \nnegotiate. We intend to send this down to the White House if the \nmajority of each body will vote for it.\n  Let me say here what I said in the committee today. If the President \nwants to line-item veto a West Virginia item, I am not going to \nnegotiate with the administration.\n  Negotiating is over as far as I am concerned. When the subcommittee \nworks its will, has its hearings, marks up its legislation, brings it \nto the full committee, the full committee acts, amends, modifies, \nchanges, or whatever, and when the House does the same, when the \ncollective wisdom and judgment of the subcommittee and the full \ncommittee and both Houses has been reached, if the President wants to \nveto it, go to it. Why should we sit down and negotiate in order to \nkeep him from wielding his line-item veto pen? Let him use his veto pen \nonly as instructed in the original Constitution. Let him use it. And \nthen Congress can work its will. It can either sustain his veto or \noverride it, but there should be no negotiating.\n  That is what every administration will want us to do. They want us to \nget in a position where we will continue to negotiate and they will \ncontinue to ratchet us down, they will continue to get what they want, \nbut they want you to negotiate for whatever your constituents need. \nWhatever your constituents need, how you feel about your constituents, \nthat is negotiable. Then they throw out that threat: ``Well, the \nPresident will veto that.'' The President will line item that out. \nWell, so what! ``Lay on, Macduff; And damn'd be him that first cries \n`Hold, enough.' ''\n  We like to know what the administration is thinking. It is worthwhile \nto have their judgment. It helps to guide us in our deliberations. But \nonce both bodies have acted and get into conference, then for the \nadministration to come up here and say, ``Well, this is vetoable, if \nyou don't change that. We don't like it,'' I am not for negotiating \nnow. Let the President use his line-item veto pen. I hope that Senators \nand House Members who voted for the line-item veto will get their \nbellies full. I hope they get a bellyful of it and they probably will, \nbecause this is just a start. There are several other appropriations \nbills coming along.\n  Think of the time that this costs. Senator Stevens held a hearing \ntoday, had a good attendance, a lot of Senators were there. They \nweren't elsewhere doing other things which were important likewise. It \ntook a lot of their time. It took the time of the generals and admirals \nwho were up from the Defense Department, and that is going to be \nrepeated over and over and over again. Look at the time it is taking \nnow. We have already taken time. The subcommittee took time. The full \ncommittee took time. And there are Members on those subcommittees and \nfull committee who have great expertise in legislative areas under the \njurisdiction of those subcommittees. And then all that goes for naught \nbecause a President, Republican or Democrat, wants this or wants that \nor does not want to go along with a Member whose constituents feel \nthere are needs to be met and acts accordingly.\n  The administration has been given a hammer to use over the heads of \nSenators and could threaten anything that a Senator wants as a way to \nget the President's way on unrelated matters. It greatly enhances the \nPresident's bargaining position in the legislative process. Go home \ntonight, all Senators, and before you close your eyes in slumber, think \nof what we have done. We have given one man, who puts his britches on \njust as I put mine on--one leg at a time--we have said you may amend a \nbill unilaterally. You do not have to worry about a majority in the \nother body or a majority here. You may amend a bill all by yourself. \nYou may strike an item out. That is amending a bill. You are the super \nlawmaker.\n  Not by this Constitution he isn't. I cannot understand how, or \nwhatever got into the Members' minds when they voted to give any \nPresident the line-item veto. But it is done. It is done. I hope they \nwill think now and that somebody will bring a case and the Supreme \nCourt will strike down this infernal, pernicious, illegitimate gimmick.\n  But in the meantime, I will follow the Senator from Alaska. If he \ngets ready to introduce legislation to repeal the Line Item Veto Act, I \nam ready. I am ready to join him. Just go home and read once again, \nSenators who are listening, section 1 of article I. ``All legislative \npowers herein granted''--and if those legislative powers are not herein \ngranted, they do not exist. ``All legislative powers herein granted \nshall be vested in a Congress of the United States . . .''\n  And then go over to section 7 of article I and read the language: \n``Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and \nthe Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the \nPresident of the United States; If he approve,'' meaning the bill, the \nresolution, ``he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it.'' It \ndoes not say he may amend it unilaterally. ``If he approve he shall \nsign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that \nHouse in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the objections \nat large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.''\n  Now, that is the Constitution. And we have no right as Members by \nlegislation to give any President the right unilaterally to amend a \nbill. We do not have that power. I do not think Congress has the power. \nI do not think it can give away its constitutional power to make all \nlaws.\n  There is only one other thing I would say, and then I am going to sit \ndown. I have said already there is a strong probability that the Senate \nwill have to consider items that it has already considered in the \ncommittee process over and over again, amounting to a tremendous waste \nof precious time. Senator Inouye cited a number of vital\n\n[[Page S10804]]\n\nsystems that have been added by the Congress to the defense bill over \nthe years such as greatly increasing the purchase of stealth fighters, \nthe Osprey helicopter, C-130 aircraft, C-17's and other systems which \nat the time were opposed by the administration and probably would have \nbeen subject to the line-item veto and killed. Where would we then have \nbeen during Desert Storm?\n  This is a strong case that the administration does not have a corner \non wisdom, and that if it uses the line-item veto to simply protect its \nbudget as delivered, we will lose the great benefit of that wisdom and \nshortchange the historic contributions that have been made over the \nyears.\n  I thank all Senators for indulging me. I have fought this battle over \nand over and over again. And I am willing to fight it over and over and \nover again. I do not believe that I took an oath to support and defend \nthe Constitution, then only to turn around and vote, in violation of \nthat Constitution, to give any President the unilateral right, power or \nprerogative to, in essence, amend a law by striking an item.\n  I hope more than anything else, before God sees fit to call me home, \nthat the line-item veto will be struck down either by the Supreme Court \nor by the Congress itself. That is my prayer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1293. A bill to improve the performance outcomes of the child \nsupport enforcement program in order to increase the financial \nstability and well-being of children and families; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n         the child support performance improvement act of 1997\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague and \nfriend, Senator Snowe, in introducing the Child Support Performance \nImprovement Act of 1997. I have long been impressed with Senator \nSnowe's commitment to the health, safety, and well-being of children, \nand I believe that this legislation will go far to improve the \nfinancial security of thousands of American children.\n  As a country, our most fundamental measure of success is how well we \ntreat our children. We have a responsibility as Members of Congress and \nas a community to do our utmost to make sure that American children \nlive happy, healthy, and stable lives. At the same time, we must \nacknowledge that much of the responsibility in ensuring children's \nhappiness and security falls squarely at the feet of their parents. \nSadly, many parents neglect their emotional and financial \nresponsibilities, maintaining that because they are no longer living in \nthe same house as their children, they no longer have to support them.\n  It is estimated that each year, $15 to $25 billion in child support \ngo uncollected. One study reported that four out of five parents have \nattempted to shirk their court-ordered child support responsibilities \nat one time or another. In many of these cases, families, already \nfragile from the absence of one parent, are forced to turn to welfare \nas the only reliable source of monetary support. In 1975, Congress \ncreated the Child Support Enforcement Program to help stop this \ndisturbing pattern. The goal of that program was and still remains to \nreduce public welfare expenditures by forcing absent parents to provide \nchild support as a regular and reliable source of income for their \nchildren. As part of this goal, the Federal Government provides \nincentive payments to encourage State child support agencies to enforce \nchild support collections as efficiently and effectively as possible. \nUnfortunately, in the past several years, these incentives have become \ndisincentives; handsomely rewarding even the most poorly performing \nStates with the most dismal collection rates.\n  Last year, the welfare reform bill took a positive step by \ncommissioning a task force composed of child support experts from the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and State child support \nagencies to come up with a new set of incentives that would put State \nagencies back on the road to efficient collections. The Child Support \nPerformance Improvement Act of 1997 incorporates the consensus findings \nof this working group. For the first time, the new incentive structure \ntakes into account, not just a State's cost effectiveness in collecting \nchild support, but that State's overall success is establishing \npaternity and child support orders as well as collecting current and \nback child support.\n  The bill also requires the Secretary of HHS to create and implement a \nsixth incentive: a medical support incentive. As we are all aware, \nhealth care is an essential part of any financial package provided for \na child. For the first time, this bill requires the implementation of a \nmedical incentive which will require States to seek medical and health \ncoverage as part of the overall child support order. All children \ndeserve comprehensive health coverage, and there is no reason it should \nbe a public expenditure when a child's parent is perfectly able to pay \nfor it.\n  The Child Support Performance Improvement Act of 1997 also takes an \nimportant step in requiring States to pay families back first. The bill \nensures that States will not be allowed to count toward incentive \npayments the collection of arrearages that are not first returned to \nformer welfare families who need such payments to remain financially \nindependent. While the overall incentive structure rewards the States \nfor good performance, the families first provision keeps the States \nfrom receiving a double bonus--allowing them to keep arrearages to \nreimburse themselves and then getting an incentive payment for it.\n  Finally, the bill adds tough but reasonable data requirements to make \nsure child support incentive payments are based on complete and \nreliable data from the States. States that do not have accurate data on \ntheir child support collections and on other aspects of child support \nenforcement should not be qualified to receive incentives. This \nprovision will encourage States to make their collection systems even \nmore efficient and, in turn, this will mean millions of additional \ndollars being directed to the children who need it.\n  The Child Support Performance Improvement Act of 1997 is the first \nvital step in assuring that the States have the most efficient and \neffective ways possible of collecting child support from parents who \nhave the responsibility to care for their children. Increasing child \nsupport collections will not only save Federal and State Governments \nand taxpayers billions of dollars each year in public expenditures, it \nwill accomplish the most important goal of all: improving the financial \nstability and general well-being of thousands of American children.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being, no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1293\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to allow \nthe consolidation of student loans the Federal Family Loan Program and \nthe Direct Loan Program; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n          THE EMERGENCY STUDENT LOAN CONSOLIDATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Emergency \nStudent Loan Consolidation Act of 1997. This bill will provide \nemergency relief to the nearly 70,000 students nationwide whose efforts \nto consolidate their student loans have been thwarted by the collapse \nof the Department of Education's Direct Loan Consolidation Program. In \naddition this bill makes conforming changes in the Higher Education Act \nto ensure that students who receive the Hope Tax Credit are able to \nreceive all of the financial aid to which they are entitled. The \nEmergency Student Loan Consolidation Act of 1997 is the companion bill \nto H.R. 2535 which was favorably reported by the House Committee on \nEducation and the Workforce on September 24, 1997, by a bipartisan vote \nof 43-0.\n  The rapidly rising cost of attending college is producing students \nwith overwhelming student loan debt loads. The College Board reports \nthat tuition at 4-year private institutions has risen by 89 percent \nover the past 15 years while median family income has risen by only 5 \npercent. Students are responding by borrowing at record levels--in \nfact, student borrowing under Title IV since 1990 exceeds student \nborrowing in the 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's combined. Between 1993 and \n1995, graduate and professional student borrowing increased by over 74 \npercent.\n  In order to ease the burden of repaying these debts, Congress created \nthe student loan consolidation program. This program allows students to \nconsolidate their student loans into a single loan that has a variety \nof repayment options. Current law allows students to consolidate all of \ntheir Direct Student Loans and their Federal Family Education Loan \nProgram [FFELP] loans into a Direct Lending Consolidation loan \nadministered by the Department of Education. A student may consolidate \nhis or her FFELP loans into a FFELP Consolidation Loan but may not \nconsolidate his or her Direct Loans into the FFELP Program. As a \nresult, borrowers who wish to consolidate both Direct Student Loans and \nFFELP loans into a single loan must go to the Department of Education.\n  Last August, the Department of Education announced that it had \naccumulated a backlog of 85,000 applications for consolidated loans and \nwould cease accepting new applications until this backlog was \neliminated. This decision places more than 70,000 students in limbo \nwith no place to turn for help. This bill will provide temporary \nauthority to allow them to consolidate all of their loans, both FFELP \nand Direct through the FFELP program.\n  In addition, this legislation makes technical corrections to the need \nanalysis provisions of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to conform with \nchanges made to the Tax Code earlier this year which provide students \nand parents with higher education tax credits. The bill addresses an \noversight in the tax legislation which will result in some students \nreceiving reduced student aid under Title IV of the Higher Education \nAct simply because they qualify for and receive the new tax credits. By \nadopting this change to the need analysis formula now, the Department \ncan begin the process of revising the student aid application forms \nwell in advance of the 1999 academic year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Washington Post article \ndetailing the problems with the loan consolidation program be included \nin the Record.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legisation.\n\n[[Page S10808]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Education Department Suspends Program for Restructuring Student Loans\n\n                           (By Rene Sanchez)\n\n       The Education Department, long maligned by congressional \n     Republicans who say its management is a mess, has just give \n     its critics new reason to howl.\n       The department announced last week that it will not accept \n     any more applications from recent college graduates trying to \n     consolidate or refinance their tuition loans until the \n     contractor it hired for the job clears up an enormous backlog \n     of those requests.\n       There are more than 70,000 college students nationwide \n     whose loan payments may soon be in limbo because of the \n     lengthy processing delays, and the waiting list has been \n     growing longer each month. The department said that it had no \n     choice but to suspend the popular program indefinitely in \n     order to begin fixing the problem.\n       ``It's a terrible embarrassment,'' said David Longanecker, \n     the assistant secretary for postsecondary education. ``We \n     were falling farther and farther behind, but by doing this we \n     are confident that we'll get on top of the problem soon.''\n       The department faced a similar predicament last year when \n     more than 900,000 student aid applications handled by private \n     contractors it hired were delayed because of serious \n     management problems. The incidents are raising new questions \n     about the department's ability to manage its direct lending \n     program, which allows students to get tuition loans straight \n     from the federal government and offers them a range of \n     repayment options.\n       Direct lending, one of President Clinton's most important \n     education initiatives, has been under fire from Republicans \n     and many private lenders--who no longer have a monopoly on \n     the nations' massive student loan industry--ever since it was \n     created five years ago. There have been several campaigns in \n     Congress to abolish or severely limit the program, but it is \n     still largely intact, serving more than 1,200 universities. \n     Many college officials say they have been quite pleased with \n     the program so far.\n       But to some Republican leaders, the latest trouble is proof \n     that the department is not up to the task of handling the \n     complexities of managing college loans at a time when a \n     record number of students--at last count, more than 7 \n     million--depend on them.\n       ``From the very start of the program, I doubted the \n     department's ability to become one of the largest banks in \n     this country,'' Rep. William F. Goodline (R-Pa), chairman of \n     the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, said last \n     week. He called the department's inability to consolidate \n     student loans quickly and efficiently ``irresponsible.''\n       With tuition costs at most campuses continuing to exceed \n     inflation, and college loan debt soaring, more and more \n     students are taking advantage of new opportunities to \n     restructure their loans over longer periods of time or in \n     ways that are based on what they earn after graduation.\n       Education department officials said that often in the last \n     year they have received nearly 150,000 applications a month \n     from students to consolidate loans, a rate that is nearly \n     twice what they said they had expected when the program \n     began.\n       But they adamantly reject criticism that direct lending is \n     in shambles.\n       ``I can understand the frustration, but I think we have to \n     keep it in perspective,'' Longanecker. ``One reason we have \n     this problem is because of the great popularity of the \n     program.''\n       Longanecker said that the department is disappointed with \n     the work of the contractor that it hired last year for the \n     job. Electronic Data Systems, which was founded by \n     billionaire Ross Perot. Longanecker said there were start-up \n     problems in processing student requests, and that ever since \n     the volume of applications has overwhelmed the system.\n       Some officials said that it had been taking more than seven \n     months in same cases--an unpaid student loan falls into \n     default after six months--to process applications. Because \n     recent steps to improve performance had only put a small dent \n     in the backlog of applications, Longanecker said the \n     department decided instead to stop taking them for a while.\n       ``It was like we were trying to fix a 747 while it was \n     still in their air,'' he said.\n       The department has no estimates yet as to when the loan-\n     consolidation program will be re-opened. But Longanecker said \n     that he expects it certainly will be before December, which \n     is a peak time for applications from students because that is \n     when the most recent class of college graduates are supposed \n     to start repaying their tuition loans.\n       That is hardly satisfying some critics, however. And some \n     lawmakers say they are also losing confidence in how the \n     department chooses its contractors, suggesting that the \n     process does not seem as rigorous as it should be.\n       Education Department leaders scoff at much of the criticism \n     coming from Republicans about direct lending, saying that \n     many of them have never wanted the program to succeed anyway. \n     But alarm over the latest management problem extends well \n     beyond Capitol Hill.\n       ``Up to now, they've done a pretty good job on this,'' said \n     Terry Hartle, a vice president for the American Council on \n     Education, a Washington group that represents more than 1,500 \n     universities. ``But what we have here is a huge embarrassment \n     in one of the president's signature education programs.''\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Americans should not have to choose \nbetween love and money. In a country that values families, the Federal \nTax Code shouldn't punish people for being married. The number of \nunmarried-couple households increased 80 percent from 1980 to 1990, \naccording to census figures. The percentage of people who never marry \nhas doubled, from 5 percent in the 1950's to 10 percent today.\n  Today, I am pleased to introduce legislation with Senators Faircloth \nand Mack that will abolish the Federal income tax marriage penalty. \nUnder this legislation, families will have the choice of filing as \nsingle or married, depending on which method works best for them.\n  There is something wrong with a law that imposes higher taxes on \nmarried people with two incomes than on single people. The hallmark of \na fair tax system is even-handedness, and the current law flunks this \ntest. From 1913 through 1969, the Federal income tax treated married \ncouples either better or as well as if single. Since then, progressive \ntax rates have meant that married couples with two incomes have to pay \nmore in Federal taxes than they would as individuals. The Congressional \nBudget Office reports that in 1996, more than 21 million married \ncouples paid the marriage penalty. The average couple now pays $1,400 \nin additional income tax simply because they're married. One thousand \nfour hundred dollars could mean six or seven car payments, a family \nvacation, or a computer for the family.\n  For example, a single person earning $24,000 a year is taxed at the \nrate of 15 percent. But, by taxing them on their combined income, the \nIRS collects 28 percent in tax from a working couple in which each \nspouse earns $24,000. It is wrong for two people living together to pay \nless taxes than if they were married.\n  Because American families increasingly have had two breadwinners, \ninstead of one, more Americans are impacted by the marriage penalty. In \n1969, 52 percent of American families had only one bread winner. Today \nthat figure is 28 percent.\n  Mr. President, under current law, the only way to avoid the marriage \npenalty is not to marry or to leave your spouse if already married. \nThis is wrong. We need a Tax Code to encourage marriage, not penalize \nit. This legislation is supported by Americans for Tax Reform and the \nNational Taxpayers Union. We are introducing this bill with 34 co-\nsponsors, including every Member of the Republican leadership. I am \nvery pleased to be working with Senators Faircloth and Mack and I hope \nMembers from both sides of the aisle will join us in rectifying this \nunfair tax treatment of married couples.\n\n

and\n       (B) take steps to bring about the implementation of the \n     resolution on Conventional Arms Transparency and Confidence \n     Building in the Americas relating to conventional arms \n     acquisitions adopted by the OAS on June 5, 1997;\n       (6) the United States should increase the number of \n     civilian and military personnel in foreign policy and \n     defense-related training, education, and exchange programs \n     from and to eligible countries in the Western Hemisphere and \n     encourage similar programs between countries in the region;\n       (7) the United States should conduct an in-depth study of \n     the roles, requirements, missions, and priorities of the \n     United States Armed Forces in the Western Hemisphere in the \n     post-Cold War environment, including recommendations for \n     additional steps that should be taken to improve Hemispheric \n     security and areas of possible cooperation with the armed \n     forces of other countries in the region;\n       (8) the study should be completed within 12 months of the \n     date of adoption of this resolution, and the appropriate \n     committees of Congress should be notified of the findings of \n     the study upon its completion; and\n       (9) the President should submit a report to Congress every \n     90 days on progress towards achieving the policy goals stated \n     in this resolution.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution, \ntogether with my friend and colleague Senator Lugar, which expresses \nthe sense of the Senate that the United States should give high \npriority to working with our partners in the Americas to address shared \nforeign policy and security problems in the Western Hemisphere.\n  Over the past several years we have witnessed unprecedented progress \nin our hemisphere. This sweeping wave of democratization and free \nmarket economics now provides us with a unique opportunity to \nconsolidate these gains and to create a new security regime in the \nAmericas. This new regime must be based upon the premise that we will \nwork with our neighbors as equal partners to address security-related \nmatters of mutual concern.\n  On August 1, 1997, the President revised the unilateral policy \nprohibiting the sale or transfer of advanced weapons systems to \ncountries of South America, Central America, and the Caribbean, and \nrestored the policy based on a case-by-case analysis comparable to that \nused in other regions of the world. This alone is not a security \npolicy. It is an action that must be wrapped in a broader security \npolicy for the region. This resolution urges the President to work \ntowards such a broader policy and provides some direction for that \npolicy.\n  We must recognize the great progress that the democratically elected \ncivilian governments of the region have made. For this they deserve to \nbe treated as we treat our other democratic friends and allies. At the \nsame time, we must work with them to find ways to enhance security \nthrough defense cooperation, transparency, and confidence and security \nbuilding measures. We urge the President to emphasize these themes in \nhis meetings with our hemisphere partners.\n   Mr. President, I urge all of our colleagues to join Senator Lugar \nand myself in supporting this resolution. It will provide the President \nwith the support of the Congress as he pursues these objectives, and \ndemonstrate to our partners that we remain committed to building a \nsecure environment so that all nations of the hemisphere can prosper in \npeace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10810-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10810-S10811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 135--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRODUCTION OF RECORDS BY THE \n                 COMMITTEE ON RULES AND ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, late last month, the Subcommittee \non Manufacturing and Competitiveness held a hearing to examine the \nimpact of EPA's new air quality standards on American manufacturing, \nespecially small manufacturers.\n  On July 18 of this year, the Environmental Protection Agency \nannounced new air quality standards that call for more severe \nrestrictions on ground-level ozone and microscopic dust particles \ncalled particulate matter. These new standards are the most far-\nreaching--and potentially the most costly--regulatory mandates \nimplemented in U.S. history.\n  Despite the administration's having promulgated these regulations, I \nbelieve a number of questions remain unanswered. To begin with, are \nthese standards necessary? It seems clear that the scientific community \nis not of one mind on the EPA's new standards. Indeed, from the reading \nI have done it seems clear that a substantial amount of scientific \nevidence exists to the effect that the new rules will have negligible \npositive impact whatsoever on the public health. Not even the EPA's own \nScience Advisory Committee could conclude that public health would be \nsubstantially improved by adopting new standards more stringent than \nthose already in effect. Moreover, Kay Jones, President Jimmy Carter's \ntop air quality adviser, says there are serious flaws in the studies \ncited by the EPA to justify these new regulatory mandates.\n  Nevertheless, the EPA wants Americans to incur substantial costs in \nimplementing their new standards. By the EPA's own estimate, \nimplementing the new standards will cost Americans almost $50 billion. \nAnd that estimate is very low if we are to believe some of the \nestimates made by other organizations. The highly regarded Reason \nFoundation, as an example, has determined that the costs of the new \nclean air rules should be conservatively pegged at $122 billion. If \nthis figure is correct, then the economic cost of EPA's new regulations \nwill wipe out the entire economic benefit of the tax relief that we \njust enacted for America. In my judgment, this would not bode well for \nour Nation's financial health, or for the economic well-being of our \nworking families.\n  We must also keep in mind that there are alternative means by which \nwe can save lives. Taking the EPA's own estimates, the new standards \nwill save the equivalent of 1,100 lives, at a cost of $2,400,000 per \nlife year saved. Meanwhile, universal influenza vaccination would save \n7,100,000 equivalent lives at a cost of only $140 per life year saved. \nAnd mammography for women over 50, an issue which many Members of this \nSenate have been personally involved with, would save 1,500,000 \nequivalent lives at a cost of $810 per life year saved. This is \naccording to an article in the journal ``Risk Analysis'' by a group of \nresearchers led by Dr. Tengs. These discrepancies in lives saved and \nprograms' bang for the buck if you will, should not be ignored.\n  Furthermore, if the Reason Foundation cost estimate is correct, \n70,000 Michiganites could lose their jobs under these new regulations. \nMany of those jobs--well-paying, blue-collar jobs--would be in my \nState's crucial manufacturing sector. That is one reason the president \nof Flint's United Auto Workers Local 599, Arthur McGee, testified in \nopposition to the new standards. UAW Local 599 notes that workers at \nthe Buick complex in that city already are fighting for their jobs.\n  In a full page advertisement taken out in the Wall Street Journal, \nLocal 599 proclaims that by working carefully, quickly, and \nefficiently, these workers have earned for themselves and their \nfamilies a ``healthy way of life for their families and their \ncommunity.'' Good pay, good health care benefits, and safe \nneighborhoods, all of which promote healthy children, would be lost if \nthe new EPA standards forced plant closings in Flint. After evaluating \nthe new standards and their potential impact, UAW Local 599 has \nconcluded, ``Poverty is more dangerous to our children than the current \nlow levels of air pollution.''\n  However, perhaps most surprising, some of the latest studies actually \nshow that many more jobs would be lost in the service than in the \nmanufacturing sector. Dry cleaning establishments, hair salons, and \nother small businesses will not be able to absorb the increased costs \nimposed by these regulations. According to Decision Focus, leading \nenvironmental policy consultants, compliance with the new ozone and \nparticulate levels will cost 200,000 jobs nationwide, with the bulk of \nthe loss occurring in small service and retail businesses. This kind of \njob loss would cause a particular problem for this Nation's larger \nurban areas.\n\n[[Page S10814]]\n\n  I worry when I hear Harry Alford, president of the National Black \nChamber of Commerce, say that ``EPA's new rules will create such an air \nof economic uncertainty that they might well be the last straw for \ninner-city investments.'' In my view, Mr. Alford's warning should lead \nus to proceed very cautiously. It seems to me that the burden of proof \nis on the EPA to demonstrate conclusively that the costs to be borne, \nin particular by our job creating enterprises, can be borne without \nsignificant damage to those businesses and to our workers. It also \nseems to me that this burden, in the case of these regulations, is \nconsiderable.\n  The effects of the clean air standards, however, will not be limited \nto America's cities. There are a number of reports that the new \nregulations may bar farmers from plowing during the dry summer months \nfor fear of stirring up dust, that is, particulate matter. The EPA has \nsignaled farmers that they need not worry about complying with the \nrules, but it is the States, not EPA, that will have the burden of \ncontrolling emissions and targeting their sources. And this begs a \nseparate question: Who will bear the costs if the EPA, in order to \nquell likely opposition, keeps telling various groups that they needn't \nworry about complying with the new rules?\n  Many within the agriculture community fear that much of these likely \ncosts--increased energy and fuel expenses--will be borne by them. As \none witness, a member of the Kansas Farm Bureau, testified, many U.S. \ncommodity prices are tied to world markets, so farmers will not be able \nto pass these costs on to consumers and could be forced to concede some \ncrop production to foreign competitors.\n  Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector fears that small businessowners \nwill lack the resources to pay the cost of expensive pollution \nreduction equipment and will be unwilling or unable to comply with \nstill more regulations. Most experts acknowledge that heavy industries \nwill likely face significant additional regulatory controls to reduce \nNOx and other particulates. Small business owners, however, \nmaintain they will shoulder a similarly heavy load because they \ntypically lack the technical expertise and the financial and human \nresources to consistently engage with State officials to shape the \noutcome of emissions control plans. During the hearing, two different \nsmall businessowners testified that the new standards could result in a \ndramatic reduction in business expansion--or stop it altogether--in \nmany U.S. cities. These owners admitted that they were unlikely to go \nout of business as a result of the NAAQS, but they noted that their \nincreased costs could be reflected in reduced hiring and the reduction, \nor elimination, of some employee benefits.\n  We are all concerned with making our country a more healthy place for \nour children and grandchildren to live. The key is striking a \nresponsible balance. Not only should our children have clean air, clean \nwater, and safe food in their future, they must also have good jobs, \nhigh wages, and good benefits, and a robust economy waiting for them \nwhen they grow up, enter the work force, and start their own families.\n  The new air quality standards have been the subject of intense \nscrutiny and often acrimonious debate over the course of this year. In \nthe face of such uncertainty, I believe it is incumbent upon the \nadministration to consider again its plans for enacting these \nregulations. The current implementation process seeks to give the \nNation ample time to adjust to the new standards. I applaud the \nPresident for this approach: It is a step in the right direction. \nHowever, I believe EPA's implementation plan will last only as long as \nthe first lawsuit and result in the immediate enforcement of the new \nstandards.\n  If, as the President says, these new standards are not intended to \nharm this Nation's economy then I urge the President to support the \nlegislation offered in both the House and the Senate to codify a 5-year \ndelay of the regulations. This postponement will allow for continued \nresearch into the cause and effects of pollution and allow the 1990 \namendments to the Clean Air Act to continue to clean the air and make \nthe effects of any future new standards less drastic. I hope that other \nMembers will join in urging the administration to consider this \napproach.\n  These are my concerns. I am worried about my children's health and \nwant to make sure we are doing everything we can to protect it. But I \nam also concerned whether the new rules represent the best means by \nwhich we can protect that health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10813-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WORLD FOOD DAY AND RUSSELL ULREY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate World Food \nDay. World Food Day takes place on October 16 and in the words of \nCatherine Bertini, executive Director of the U.N. World Food Program, \nis an opportunity to ``not only rededicate ourselves to the battle \nagainst hunger and poverty but also acknowledge that millions of people \nhave been saved from the scourge of famine because of the commitment of \nthe United States and other members of the international community.'' I \nwould also like to honor the many humanitarian relief workers who often \nrisk their lives to deliver assistance.\n  Natural disasters and civil unrest can produce countless refugees \nwith no way of feeding themselves. Humanitarian relief workers often \nbrave grave dangers in these situations to deliver food to the hungry. \nOne of the many heroes who risk their lives to feed the needy is, \nRussell Ulrey, of Detroit, MI. In 1993, Mr. Ulrey served as emergency \nlogistics coordinator in southern Sudan for the World Food Program, the \nlargest international food aid organization in the world. During his \ntime in Sudan, Russell Ulrey led a barge trip up the Nile to feed \nhungry Sudanese. This dangerous trip led Ulrey through the heart of \nthat nation's bloody civil war. Ulrey's mission came under fire several \ntimes but succeeded in delivering eight barges carrying 2,600 tons of \nfood. Ulrey's trip up the Nile was the first of 25 that WFP made, \ndelivering 65,000 tons of food.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to highlight the exploits of Russell \nUlrey and the thousands of other relief workers that risk their lives \ndaily to feed the world's needy. I know my Senate colleagues join me in \nhonoring their efforts and World Food Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10814-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10814-S10815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       U.S. RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as Congress prepares to leave \nfor the Columbus Day recess, I notice that there are other celebrations \ngoing on around Washington, including ``National Day'' celebrations in \nChinatown. These celebrations brought to mind several issues that I \nwanted to share with my colleagues regarding United States relations \nwith Taiwan.\n  As Washington prepares for the State visit of President Jiang Zemin \nof the People's Republic of China, some press reports have speculated \nthat the issue of Taiwan might be on the summit agenda. First, let me \nsay that I welcome the visit of President Jiang. High-level dialogue \nwith the Chinese should be regular and routine, and this summit \npresents an opportunity to discuss many issues of mutual concern to our \ntwo countries. But let me add that improving relations with the PRC \nneed not, and indeed, should not, come at the expense of our \nrelationship with Taiwan.\n  Therefore, I sent a letter, signed by 10 of my colleagues including \nMajority Leader Trent Lott, Minority Leader Tom Daschle, chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee Jesse Helms; and East Asia and the \nPacific Subcommittee Chairman Craig Thomas, to President Clinton urging \nhim to oppose any efforts at the summit by the PRC leadership to \ndiminish American support for Taiwan.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a copy of that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. President, I wish President Clinton and his administration \nsuccess at the upcoming summit, and I urge him to respect the views of \nme and my colleagues, which I think represents the views of many \nAmericans, that our support for Taiwan's democracy and freedom cannot \nbe sacrificed.\n  I also want to use this opportunity to express my gratitude to \nSecretary of State Madeleine Albright for her efforts to consult more \nclosely with Members of Congress with regard to issues related to \nTaiwan. I refer specifically to consultations regarding the recent \nselection of Richard Clarence Bush III as Chairman of the American \nInstitute in Taiwan [AIT].\n  Some of my colleagues, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman \nJesse Helms, in particular, will remember that the consultation process \ndid not work when the prior AIT Chairman, Mr. James Wood, was selected.\n\n[[Page S10815]]\n\n Mr. James Wood resigned from his position on January 1997 among \nvarious charges and countercharges with regard to foreign contributions \nduring the election campaign. I leave the legitimacy of those charges \nto the investigators, but I simply wanted to note that congressional \nconcerns regarding Mr. Wood were ignored by our State Department.\n  In response to this incident, I considered offering an amendment to \nthe State Department authorization legislation that would have required \nestablishing a post within the State Department that would be directly \nresponsible for Taiwan Affairs. As part of negotiations over that \namendment, I had the opportunity to discuss with the Secretary my \ndissatisfaction with the consultation process on matters relating to \nTaiwan.\n  The Secretary promised that she would rectify this situation and \nwould in the future consult with Congress prior to naming future \nofficers of AIT. She followed up on this oral promise with a letter \ndated July 30, 1997, that states that if the Foreign Relations \nCommittee ``expresses reservations about a prospective trustee, we will \nundertake to discuss and resolve the matter fully with the Committee \nbefore proceeding.''\n  Mr. President, I ask that a copy of the July 30 letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The Secretary held to her word and consulted with me and others prior \nto the selection of Richard Bush. I must admit, Mr. President, that \nthis was an easy case. Mr. Bush is a talented individual who is well \nqualified to take this sensitive position. I had the opportunity to \nnegotiate with Mr. Bush when he was advising Congressman Lee Hamilton \non Taiwan-related issues, and I found him well-spoken and honest. I \nlook forward to the opportunity to continue to work with him in his new \nrole.\n  I hope that Mr. Bush will use his new position to further strengthen \nand enhance United States relations with the people and the Government \nof Taiwan. Taiwan is our eighth largest trading partner, and I am \nconfident that trade will increase further when Taiwan joins the World \nTrade Organization. In addition, I encourage the administration to send \nhigh-level officials to Taiwan to further strengthen our relationship \nand to work out the occasional disputes that cloud our relationship.\n  The letters follow:\n\n\n                                                   U.S. Senate\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 1997.\n     Hon.

Clinton,\n     The President, The White House.\n       Dear Mr. President: As you prepare for your summit with the \n     President of the People's Republic of China, we thought it \n     appropriate to share with you our thoughts regarding U.S. \n     relations with the people and the government of Taiwan. We \n     believe Taiwan has made extraordinary progress in recent \n     years as the Republic of China has moved to establish a \n     vibrant democracy with free elections, free press, strong \n     trade unions and improved trading practices.\n       We believe the American people are united in their support \n     for freedom and democracy on Taiwan. Time and again, Congress \n     has made clear our commitment to Taiwan, beginning with the \n     1979 Taiwan Relations Act, and through many resolutions and \n     bills since then.\n       With your important meetings in Washington with the \n     leadership of the People's Republic of China scheduled for \n     late October, there has been much discussion about how the \n     U.S. government would respond to possible demands by the PRC \n     Government regarding U.S. relations with the people and the \n     government of Taiwan.\n       Mr. President, we urge you to oppose any efforts at the \n     summit by the PRC leadership to diminish American support for \n     Taiwan. We urge you to reject any plans for a ``Fourth \n     Communique'' on issues related to Taiwan; to not weaken our \n     defensive arms sales commitment to Taiwan; and, to not make \n     any commitment to limit future visits by the elected \n     representatives of the Republic of China.\n       We in Congress are prepared to reiterate the commitment of \n     the American people to freedom and democracy for the people \n     and government of Taiwan. We look forward to working with you \n     and your Administration team on these issues in the weeks \n     ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n         Frank H.

Frank Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: I refer to our conversation of June \n     17, in which you underscored the concern of the Foreign \n     Relations Committee about the role of the Senate in \n     monitoring our Taiwan policy and the Committee's specific \n     desire that the Department consult with the Committee before \n     appointing to the Board of Trustees of the American Institute \n     in Taiwan (AIT) a Chairman/Managing Director for AIT.\n       As you know, under the bylaws of the American Institute in \n     Taiwan, the Secretary of State appoints and removed trustees \n     of the Institute. The Department continues to hold the view, \n     expressed by Secretary Vance in his letter to then-Chairman \n     Church at the time of AIT's establishment in 1979, that \n     because the Institute is not an agency or instrumentality of \n     the Government, and because its trustees are not officers of \n     the United States, it would not be appropriate for the Senate \n     to advise and consent to the appointment of trustees or \n     officers. However, let me assure you, as did Secretary Vance, \n     that the names of prospective trustees will be forwarded to \n     the Foreign Relations Committee. If the Committee expresses \n     reservations about a prospective trustee, we will undertake \n     to discuss and resolve the matter fully with the Committee \n     before proceeding.\n       This arrangement will enable the Institute to retain its \n     character as a private corporation and assist the Senate in \n     fulfilling its responsibilities for monitoring the \n     implementation of the Taiwan Relations Act and the operation \n     of the Institute.\n           Sincerely,\n     Madeleine K. Albright.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10814-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10815-S10816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, October has been designated National \nDomestic Violence Awareness Month, and I rise today to speak briefly \nabout our need to continue our struggle against this national problem.\n  Mr. President, over the past several years, the Congress, the Clinton \nadministration, our State and local governments, and our community-\nbased organizations have taken enormous steps toward eradicating the \nscourge of domestic violence--a scourge that for too long had been \nignored as a family problem outside the scope of government \nresponsbility. Congress' passage of the Violence Against Women Act \n[VAWA] as part of the 1994 crime bill, and the wide variety of \nenforcement and prevention grants available under that legislation, has \nensured that our Federal, State, and local authorities have at their \ndisposal the resources and legal authority needed to educate our \ncitizens about domestic violence, and to prosecute those who have \nchosen to engage in such reprehensible conduct. The administration's \ndevelopment of informational initiatives, such as a toll-free \nnationwide domestic violence hotline and a Violence Against Women \ninformation homepage, have buttressed Congress' efforts, and provided \nlaw enforcement officials with a direct link to those who need \nassistance.\n  My State of Maryland has been at the forefront of these national \nefforts to combat domestic violence. With the assistance of over \n$400,000 in grant funds made available under the 1994 crime bill, \nMaryland has formulated its Stop Violence Against Women plan, under \nwhich the State identifies cases of domestic abuse, safeguards victims, \nand coordinates and funds local community responses to incidents of \ndomestic violence. To implement this plan, the Governor's office has \nestablished a statewide Family Violence Council, headed by Maryland's \nattorney general and Lieutenant Governor, which will continue to keep \nthis issue in the public eye and to formulate additional initiatives in \nthis area.\n  The Federal authorities in Maryland have been no less vigilant in \ntheir efforts to combat domestic violence. Maryland's U.S. attorney's \noffice has developed a specific training program for prosecutors on \nVAWA, has drafted a VAWA manual now available to local law enforcement \nand community groups, and is in the process of prosecuting only the \nsecond interstate stalking case brought under that law.\n  In short, Federal, State, and local authorities in Maryland, as \nelsewhere, have embarked on a cooperative effort designed to educate \nour citizens about the plague of domestic violence, and to bring to \njustice those who violate our increasingly strict laws in this area.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, we still have a long way to go \nbefore domestic violence is evicted from our homes and communities. \nLast year alone, almost 4 million women were physically abused by their \nhusbands or boyfriends. Women continue to be the victims of domestic \nabuse more frequently than they are victims of burglary, muggings, and \nall other physical\n\n[[Page S10816]]\n\ncrimes combined. The damage done by such abuse extends directly to the \nmost vulnerable in our society--our children, who are subject to abuse \nin 75 percent of the cases in which their mothers are subject to abuse.\n  Mr. President, I have long supported efforts to stamp out domestic \nviolence in our communities. I once again urge my colleagues to \ncontinue on the path on which we embarked in 1994, and to ensure \ncontinued full funding for VAWA in future years. I also urge my \ncolleagues on the Appropriations Committee to preserve the $10 million \nprovided for community police to combat domestic violence in this \nyear's Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations bill. This money, \nexpressly authorized under the 1994 crime law, is essential if we are \nto address the domestic violence problem at its local, root level.\n  While October is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, no month \nshould go by without our attention to this issue. Domestic violence is \ndirectly contrary to the community and family values we hold most dear, \nand its eradication should continue to be one of our most pressing \nnational priorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10815-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN RECOGNITION OF THE 41ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE HUNGARIAN REVOLUTION\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise in honor of the 41st \nanniversary of the Hungarian Revolution. On October 19, the Hungarian-\nAmerican community will commemorate that fall day in 1956 when \nHungarians attempted to throw off the shackles of oppression and gain \nfreedom.\n  In an era of Soviet domination, the brave citizens of Hungary rose \nagainst the Communist regime. Although the revolution was unsuccessful, \nit set a precedent that the Hungarian people wanted freedom. It was not \nuntil some 30 years later, with the reforms of the late 1980's, that \nHungary greatly increased freedom. The most dramatic example occurred \nin May 1989 when the border between Austria and Hungary was opened. \nThousands streamed across and spontaneous celebrations broke out on \nboth sides of the border as Hungarians displayed their freedom to the \nworld.\n  A few years ago on a fall day in November, the entire world watched \nthe most imposing symbol of the cold war tumble down. The Berlin Wall \nhad been torn asunder. Had those individuals so many years ago not \nstood against the tanks that rumbled through the streets of Budapest, \nthe momentous occasion in Berlin might not have occurred. Their bravery \nproved that freedom cannot be suppressed.\n  I am proud of the Hungarian-American community's continual efforts to \nfoster relationships of goodwill. These efforts will go far in \nenhancing and promoting the community's image and understanding \nthroughout the United States and beyond. We can all be proud of these \nefforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10816-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PAT BARR'S CRUSADE\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, October is Breast Cancer Awareness \nMonth. I would like bring to the attention of the Senate a breast \ncancer survivor in Vermont who has poured herself into reaching out to \nothers who are dealing with this devastating disease, and who has made \nfinding a cure her lifetime crusade.\n  Pat Barr of Bennington, VT, is a true example of one person being \nable to make a difference.\n  It was a visit in early 1992 from Pat and several other Vermont \nwomen--grassroots organizers and survivors of breast cancer--that led \nto my long involvement in working with others to address the urgent \nneed for more intensive research on breast cancer, which has taken the \nlives of more than 1 million women over the past 35 years.\n  Soon after that visit I was joined by several Members of Congress in \nstarting a congressional campaign to help eradicate breast cancer. We \nbegan by introducing a resolution urging the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to declare breast cancer a public health emergency. The \nresolution raised public awareness about breast cancer and sent a \nstrong message that we needed to accelerate the investigation into the \ncauses, treatments, and prevention of this illness.\n  Pat Barr's support, energy, and determination to make a difference \nhas immeasurably helped me in efforts to elevate breast cancer research \nas a Federal priority, including in the annual Department of Defense \nbudget, where we have been able to allocate $737.5 million for breast \ncancer research over the past 6 years.\n  She also worked closely with Congressman Sanders and with me in \nenvisioning and crafting a new tool in the struggle to find a cure for \nall cancers: the National Program for Cancer Registries. Cancer \nregistries serve as a foundation for a national, comprehensive \nprevention strategy. They monitor trends in the incidence of breast \ncancers and other cancers and in mortality rates, as well as offering a \nsource for population-based epidemiologic research at NIH and other \nresearch institutions.\n  For a decade, Pat has tirelessly volunteered her time and energy to \nthis effort. Pat is the founder of the Breast Cancer Network of \nVermont. She has been a board member of the National Breast Cancer \nCoalition since its inception in 1991. She has served as a consumer \nadvocate on panels at the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for \nDisease Control, and the Army Breast Cancer Research Program.\n  Earlier this year, Vermonters honored Pat by dedicating the annual \nVermont Race for the Cure in her honor.\n  A recent editorial in the Bennington Banner said it best: ``Pat Barr \nis a hero worth honoring.''\n  I ask that the text of the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                   Pat Barr Is a Hero Worth Honoring\n\n       You can make a difference. One local woman has shown the \n     way. Pat Barr of Shaftsbury has taken her experience with the \n     disease of breast cancer and turned it into a crusade for \n     better research with impacts from Bennington to Washington, \n     D.C.\n       And because of that personal achievement, the Annual Susan \n     G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation Vermont Race for the Cure \n     was dedicated this year to Barr. The Sunday race is designed \n     to raise funds for breast cancer research, with 75 percent of \n     the money staying in Vermont.\n       Barr's own experience with breast cancer began in 1987, \n     when she was diagnosed. It has reoccurred since then, but \n     despite that Barr has not turned from her decade of tireless \n     work.\n       Barr founded the Breast Cancer Network, a Vermont advocacy \n     and service organization based in Bennington and also serving \n     New York and Massachusetts. The network helps area women get \n     tests, information and services.\n       She joined Vermont's U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy and U.S. Rep. \n     Bernard Sanders in developing the National Cancer Registry. \n     She worked with Leahy in his fight to secure an additional \n     $300 million toward breast cancer research in 1992.\n       Her efforts eventually took her to Washington with 2.6 \n     million signatures to convince President Clinton to approve a \n     national action plan to fight breast cancer.\n       Barr, a mother, attorney and businesswoman, has also been \n     active in the Vermont Civil Liberties Union and the Vermont \n     Bar Association and was a member of the State Board of \n     Education.\n       Barr has kept her faith--she is a member of the \n     Congregation Beth El in Bennington and was instrumental in \n     its resurgence.\n       She is a role model and a credit to this community.\n       Barr is a local hero who cannot be honored enough for her \n     work for Vermont women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10816-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10816-S10817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, when the Tennessee Valley Authority \nformed in 1933, the region suffered under the weight of economic \ndespair and the unforgiving forces of nature. The great Depression and \nrural isolation served to keep much of the valley's population in \npoverty and without some of the basic tools to sustain even a marginal \nexistence. The mighty Tennessee River and its tributaries, which have \nsustained life and commerce along their banks since prehistory, wreaked \nhavoc on life and property as the unpredictable and uncontrollable \nfloods rushed from the slopes of the southern Appalachians and \nCumberland Plateau. Flooding and poor farming practices were of nearly \nepidemic proportions as loss of topsoil and low crop yields reached \ncatastrophic levels. Access to electricity was both expensive and \nlimited to only a few metropolitan areas, thus serving to even further \nwiden the gap between the Tennessee Valley and the rest of the country \nas the already hamstrung national economy passed the region by.\n  President Roosevelt designed the Tennessee Valley Authority as a \nunique Federal agency whose mission was defined by providing a range of \nessential services to the entire region\n\n[[Page S10817]]\n\nrather than fulfilling a single, specific function nationwide. TVA \nundertook many duties that other Federal agencies were actively \npursuing in other parts of the country, just as it does today, but TVA \nalso undertook services which addressed the economic and natural \nproblems unique to the Tennessee River watershed. TVA's charter was \nvery broad and designed to give the agency leeway to address the \nregion's interrelated needs of flood control, improved farming methods \nand conservation, rural electrification, and economic development as a \nsingle coordinating and executing body.\n  TVA undertook ambitious conservation, economic development, flood \ncontrol, and electrification projects. The Tennessee River was tamed \nand became more readily navigable; topsoil loss and declining \nagricultural productivity had been stopped or even reversed; isolated \nfamilies received electricity in their homes and workplaces; and the \neconomy was expanding. By the 1950's the Nation's economy was strong \nand growing, and the economic gap between the Tennessee Valley region \nand the Nation as a whole was narrowing. By the 1980's, that gap no \nlonger existed.\n  In a region that boasted a strong independent tradition and a general \nskepticism about the benefits of the Federal Government, the TVA had \nbecome viewed as more than just a benevolent hand providing economic \nopportunity and security to the depressed region, it became an integral \npart of the region's identity. In the minds of Tennesseans, TVA was \ncredited with bringing the region out of poverty, depression, and \nexistence at the mercy of nature.\n  Since its inception, TVA's mission has evolved, and the organization \ntoday is very different than in 1933. In 1959 the TVA Act was amended \nto fully separate the U.S. Treasury from the rapidly expanding TVA \npower program, which had seen an initial round of growth associated \nwith the national security activities in Oak Ridge during the Second \nWorld War, but had continued to expand its size and revenues for \nregional industrial and residential consumption. TVA power would no \nlonger rely on the support of taxpayers nationwide, but was thereafter \ndependent on the ratepayers and lenders to provide all operation \nexpenses. TVA's power program far eclipsed the other original missions \nof conservation, flood control, and navigation from which had been \nseparated. Today, TVA is one of the largest electric utilities in the \nworld, with a revenue stream in excess of $5 billion per year.\n\n  That's an impressive growth, but it didn't come without associated \nproblems--some of them very serious. In the 1960's and 1970's, TVA \nbegan an ambitious nuclear powerplant construction program, borrowing \nheavily from public and private sources. Like other utilities that \ninvested in nuclear power, TVA overextended itself badly as the costs \nof construction and fueling the plants rose dramatically and the \nregulatory bar moved ever higher. TVA continued to go further into \ndebt, and today its liability now exceeds a truly staggering $27 \nbillion.\n  TVA's benevolent role in the life of the region has also come into \nquestion. Decisions and behavior that many Tennesseans are now viewing \nas simply an extension of a grossly overgrown Federal bureaucracy in \ngeneral, and a betrayal of the original benevolent mission envisioned \nfor TVA in the formative act, served to end an era of trust between \nratepayers and TVA. More worrisome, though, is that the errors in \nstrategy and judgment have put the health, liability, and even the \nexistence of TVA in jeopardy.\n  At its root, I believe, is the fact that TVA was allowed to \nfundamentally change its mission and to begin operating as a self-\nfinancing electric utility without the necessary structural changes. \nWhile TVA power grew rapidly as consequence, it still maintained the \nmanagement and corporate structure of its original Depression-era \nmission of conservation, flood control, navigation, and economic \ndevelopment.\n  Yesterday, I introduced legislation to address those problems, and to \nmake changes in the decisionmaking body of TVA that will more closely \nreflect its needs and the demands of the ratepayers and taxpayers. \nThese are changes which, in truth, should have been incorporated into \nthe TVA Act the day TVA became a self-financing corporation in 1959.\n  Under my TVA Modernization Act, the board of directors will grow from \nthree full-time members to nine part-time members, and each member must \nhave corporate management or a strong strategic decisionmaking \nbackground. My bill also shortens the members' terms from the current 9 \nyears to staggered 5-year terms.\n  The expanded board would establish long-range goals and policies for \nTVA, as well as approve the annual budget and conduct public hearings \non policies that have a major effect on ratepayers in the valley. The \nboard will also determine electricity rates and ensure that independent \naudits of the corporation's management are conducted.\n  But unlike the current board, the expanded board will not be involved \nin the day-to-day management of TVA. Instead, it will appoint an \nindependent chief executive officer to manage the corporation--much \nlike businesses of its size throughout the country have done for \ndecades.\n  While the President will retain the sole authority to appoint new \nboard members, my bill will ensure that candidates have the business \nbackground necessary to take this $6 billion corporation into the 21st \ncentury and a new era of deregulation. By requiring that no more than \nfive members come from a single party affiliation, it will also help \nensure that the board never becomes politicized. Together with an \nindependent CEO, we can help avoid the type of decisions and missteps \nthat have saddled TVA with more than $27 billion in debt over the \nyears.\n  Once enacted, the bill would take effect on May 18, 1999--exactly 66 \nyears after the original TVA Act took effect. Current board members \nwhose terms don't expire until after 1999 may remain on the board as \npart-time members, along with the President's seven new appointees. \nPart-time board members will receive an annual stipend and per diem pay \nfor their services, the total of which will not exceed $35,000 per \nyear. And instead of having a Presidentially designated chairman of the \nboard, members will elect their chairman.\n  TVA has experienced enormous growth over the years, from a \nDepression-era conservation and public works program to a multibillion-\ndollar electric utility. It's time we give TVA and ratepayers in the \nvalley a management structure that's more responsive and stable and \nthat can help this important agency face the upcoming dramatic changes \nin the electric utilities industry as effectively and efficiently as \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10816-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      EXPLANATION OF VOTES ON THE AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my final \nvote on the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill. The last amendment to \nthis legislation was a second attempt by Senator Harkin to fully fund \nFDA efforts to prevent underage smoking. Specifically, the amendment \nsought to fully fund a program which was established to punish \nestablishments that sell tobacco to individuals under 18 years of age.\n  I support efforts to curb underage smoking. Unfortunately, I was \nforced to vote against Senator Harkin's first attempt to fund this \nprogram because the amendment's offset would have imposed a new, $34 \nmillion tax. The majority of Senators shared my concerns and the \namendment failed by a 52 to 48 margin. In recognition of that \nshortfall, the amendment which Senator Harkin reintroduced identified a \nnew, noncontroversial offset from a minor USDA program. In light of \nthis new funding source, I was pleased to vote in support of the Harkin \namendment. The motion to table the Harkin amendment subsequently failed \nby a 28 to 70 margin and the amendment was agreed to.\n  It is my hope, Mr. President, that the conferees can move quickly to \nresolve the differences between the House and Senate bills and allow us \nto vote on the conference report in the coming weeks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10817-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10817-S10818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOJOURNER TRUTH\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Sojourner \nTruth, a leader in the abolitionist movement and a ground breaking \nspeaker on behalf of equality for women. The 200th\n\n[[Page S10818]]\n\nanniversary of Sojourner Truth's birth is being celebrated this year \nthroughout the United States.\n  Sojourner Truth was born Isabella Baumfree in 1797 in Ulster County, \nNY and served as a slave under several different masters. She bore four \nchildren who survived infancy, and all except one daughter were sold \ninto slavery. Baumfree became a freed slave in 1828 when New York State \noutlawed slavery. She remained in New York and instituted successful \nlegal proceedings to secure the return of her son, Peter, who had been \nillegally sold to a slave-owner from Alabama.\n  In 1843, Baumfree, in response to a perceived command from God, \nchanged her name to Sojourner Truth and dedicated her life to traveling \nand lecturing. She began her migration west in 1850, where she shared \nthe stage with other abolitionist leaders such as Frederick Douglass. \nIn October 1856, Truth came to Battle Creek, MI, with Quaker leader \nHenry Willis to speak at a Friends of Human Progress meeting. She \neventually bought a house and settled in the area. Her antislavery, \nwomen's rights, and temperance arguments brought Battle Creek both \nregional and national recognition. Sojourner Truth died at her home in \nBattle Creek, November 26, 1883, having lived quite an extraordinary \nlife.\n  Sojourner Truth was a powerful voice in the women's suffrage \nmovement, playing a pivotal role in ensuring the right of all women to \nvote. She was a political activist who personally conversed with \nPresident Abraham Lincoln on behalf of freed, unemployed slaves, and \ncampaigned for Ulysses S. Grant in the Presidential election in 1868. \nSojourner was a woman of great passion and determination who was \nspiritually motivated to preach and teach in ways that have had a \nprofound and lasting imprint on American history.\n  In 1851, Sojourner delivered her famous ``Ain't I a Woman?'' speech \nat the Women's Convention in Akron, OH. She spoke from her heart about \nthe most troubling issues of her time.

I think that 'twixt the negroes of \n     the South and the women at the North, all talking about \n     rights, the white men will be in a fix pretty soon. But \n     what's all this here talking about?\n       That man over there says women need to be helped into \n     carriages, and lifted over ditches and to have the best place \n     everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud \n     puddles, or gets me any best place!\n       And Ain't I a Woman?\n       Look at me! Look at my arm! I have ploughed, and planted, \n     and gathered into barns, and no man could head me!\n       And Ain't I a Woman?\n       I could work as much and eat as much as a man--when I could \n     get it--and bear the lash as well!\n       And Ain't I a Woman?\n       I have borne five children and seen most all sold off to \n     slavery, and when I cried out with a mother's grief, none but \n     Jesus heard me.\n       And Ain't I a Woman?\n       Then they talk about this thing in the head; what's this \n     they call it? (member of the audience whispers ``intellect'') \n     That's it, honey.\n       What's that got to do with women's right or negroes' \n     rights?

Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join my \ncolleague, Senator Rockefeller, in introducing the Child Support \nPerformance Improvement Act of 1997. This bill establishes a new \nformula for State child support incentive payments, in order to reward \nthose States which truly excel at collecting child support. Over the \nyears, Senator Rockefeller has shown an extraordinary commitment to \nchildren and families across America, and his leadership on this bill \nrepresents more of the same.\n  Mr. President, States need to crack down on deadbeat parents who \nrenege on their financial responsibilities to their children. While \nnoncustodial parents owed $47 billion in child support in 1995, States \ncollected only $14 billion. Collections increased to approximately $16 \nbillion in 1996, and are likely to further increase as the result of \ntough new child support reforms which I authored and which were \ncontained in the Welfare Reform Act.\n  States performance in collecting child support varies tremendously. \nFor example, Maine has worked very hard to successfully improve its \nchild support collections. While Maine has collected over $580 million \nsince 1975, half of that amount--$286 million--was collected within the \npast 5 years. Last year alone, Maine collected almost $72 million, \nrepresenting a 10-percent increase over the previous year. This \nconsiderable improvement is due to comprehensive State reforms \npioneered under Governor John McKernan in 1993, and Federal child \nsupport reforms contained in the Welfare Act. But not all States share \nthis heightened commitment to collecting support. That is why my child \nsupport provisions in the Welfare Reform Act required the Secretary of \nHHS, in consultation with the States, to develop a new formula for \nState incentive payments that is based on performance, in order to \nfurther improve State collections, and to report back to Congress on \nthe subject. The bill that Senator Rockefeller and I introduce today is \nbased on that report.\n  Under current law, the Federal Government provides States with an \nextra incentive payment in order to increase child support collections. \nThe current formula for incentive payments is based on the cost-\neffectiveness of a State's child support collection program--the \ncollection-to-cost ratio--meaning that States are rewarded for bringing \nin more dollars for each dollar they invest in the program. Incentive \npayments start at 6 percent of collections, and rise as high as 10 \npercent for the most cost-effective States. In fiscal year 1995, \nFederal incentive payments to States were $400 million, nearly 33 \npercent of the gross Federal share of child support collections.\n  Mr. President, the current system does not make sense in that every \nState, no matter how dismal its record in collecting child support, \nreceives a minimum incentive payment. This perpetuates mediocrity and \ndoes not serve children. Instead, States should be rewarded on the \nbasis of performance outcomes that will help children, such as \nestablishing paternity and support orders quickly, obtaining medical \nsupport, and collecting support on a regular basis so families can rely \non it.\n  The Child Support Performance Improvement Act establishes a formula \nwhich takes into account performance-based measures and standards in \nfive areas: establishing of paternity; establishing child support \norders; collecting currently-owed support; cost-effectiveness; and \ncollection of past-due support. The first three measures receive the \nmost weight in the formula because they translate most directly into \nsupport that helps keep families financially self-sufficient. Giving \nthem more weight will help concentrate State efforts where they matter \nmost.\n  Under our bill, States would only qualify for incentive payments if \nthey meet threshold performance requirements in these five areas. \nStates that perform below the threshold level can qualify for minimum \nincentive payments only if they significantly improve their performance \ncompared to performance in a prior year. The bill also requires the \nSecretary of HHS to establish standards for collecting medical support \nto be implemented later, to ensure that children of divorced parents \nhave health insurance. Finally, the bill requires States, for the first \ntime, to reinvest their incentive payments back into the child support \nsystem, so they can further improve collections and better serve \nchildren.\n\n[[Page S10819]]\n\n  Mr. President, this bill will significantly help families to obtain \nthe child support owed to them so they can remain financially self-\nsufficient. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10818-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SENATOR WILLIAM B. SPONG, JR.\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Bill Spong and I go back a long \nway. We were the only Democrats elected to the Senate in 1966. Back \nthen, new Senators were expected to be seen and not heard. Bill and I \nwere dutiful--we took the last two seats on the back row of the \nDemocratic side of the Senate floor and swapped afternoons and evenings \npresiding as Speaker Pro Tempore. In those days they gave Golden Gavels \nto members who presided over the Senate for more than 100 hours; Bill \nand I each received one.\n  Bill Spong was one of the quietest and most thoughtful men ever to \nserve in the Senate. He brought his considerable experience in law and \nbanking to bear on every issue before the Senate and carefully analyzed \neach piece of legislation on which he voted. He set an example of what \na Senator in a deliberative democracy should be.\n  The Senate was a different place then. Republicans and Democrats \nworked closely together in a collegial atmosphere. Though they differed \non many issues, a majority of Senators from both parties came together \nto produce legislation for the good of the Nation. Now the Members of \nthe two parties meet only to ambush one another. In today's climate of \npartisan warfare, it is hard to find anyone who can match Bill Spong's \ncivility.\n  Senator Spong made many friends for Virginia in his 6 years of \nservice. He was an outstanding and committed representative of the \npeople of his state. His election loss in 1972 deprived Virginia and \nthe United States of an able and promising Senator. Undoubtedly, \nSenator Spong would have won reelection and served for many more years \nhad the public confusion and division caused by Vietnam and his seat on \nthe Foreign Relations Committee not placed him in an untenable \nposition.\n  After leaving the Senate, he served with great distinction as a noted \nmediator and as Dean of the School of Law at William and Mary. In these \ncapacities, he continued to serve his community.\n  Bill Spong's death yesterday shocked and saddened us all. It deprives \nus of a much-needed model of dedication, service, and leadership. Let \nus all hope that his great qualities will find their incarnation in \nfuture servants of the public good.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10819-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL LITERACY MONTH\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to comment on an issue \nwhich concerns my home State of Michigan and the entire country. It \nseems as though every year another study is published which concludes \nAmerican children are behind other nations of the world in subjects \nsuch as math and science. Often, when concern is expressed with such \nfindings a more basic issue is overlooked: literacy.\n  From the youngest schoolchild to the most senior adult, I believe \neveryone should be able to read and write. Besides serving as the \nfoundation of education, reading provides new opportunities and expands \nhorizons. Through reading, an individual can visit exotic lands, travel \nin time, participate in fantastic adventures, and learn of events \nhappening in both their hometown and around the globe. Reading allows a \nperson to soar, with only their imagination to limit them. As the \nfather of three young children, one of my favorite activities is \nreading a story to my children, or as the older ones now do, read the \nstory to me. Helping a child learn to read is one of the most \npleasurable activities I know.\n  Ensuring America's children are literate is one of the most important \ngoals this Nation should have. Rather than involving the heavy hand of \nthe Federal Government, I believe local governments are in the best \nposition to accomplish this goal. But, I also think the Federal \nGovernment has a role in helping to eradicate illiteracy from among the \nNation's youth. For this reason, Congress has allocated $260 million to \nthe Department of Education to disburse to the states for carrying out \na child literacy initiative beginning in October 1998.\n  I strongly believe every child in America should be literate. \nHowever, we cannot and must not concern ourselves solely with the \nyoung. It is a sad fact that many adults across the country do not \npossess the ability to read and write. While some individuals have \nrudimentary skills, many cannot read well enough to fill out a job \napplication. Without these needed skills, advancement in the workplace \nis almost impossible. Fortunately, Congress is taking strong steps \ntoward remedying this problem. Presently, Federal adult literacy \nprograms have been funded at over $350 million. Given to States in the \nform of grants, these funds help provide community-based agencies with \nthe money necessary to reduce and hopefully eliminate illiteracy.\n  In recognition of the efforts to educate both children and adults, I \njoin in honoring those individuals who dedicate themselves to this \nnoble pursuit. I am pleased to have this opportunity to express my \nappreciation for their hard work, and encourage my colleagues to \ndemonstrate their support of National Literacy Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10819-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PETER KARMANOS, JR.\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievements of Mr. Peter Karmanos, Jr., Peter who is being honored on \nNovember 4, 1997, by the Detroit B'nai B'rith Foundation with the 1997 \nGreat American Traditions Award.\n  B'nai B'rith is awarding its highest honor, the Great American \nTraditions Award, to Peter Karmanos for ``. . . his concern for the \nsick, for his understanding of the abused, and for the quiet, \nunassuming way he provides for others.''\n  Peter Karmanos is a name with which many people around the Nation are \nfamiliar. Some know him because he is the chairman, CEO, and cofounder \nof Compuware Corp., which is one of the largest independent software \nvendors in the world. Peter helped to make a small startup company into \nMichigan's fifth largest exporter, a company with more than 7,000 \nemployees worldwide. Peter has striven to make Compuware a healthy and \nfriendly place to work, providing a company-subsidized cafeteria, day-\ncare center, and wellness center, as well as racquetball and basketball \ncourts at its world headquarters in Farmington Hills, MI.\n  Others know of Peter Karmanos because he co-owns the Carolina \nHurricanes of the National Hockey League and the Plymouth Whalers of \nthe Ontario Hockey League. Peter's passion for hockey has led him to \nsponsor youth hockey teams, which have given countless young people the \nopportunity to play the sport Peter loves so much.\n  Peter Karmanos has earned a reputation as an outstanding leader in \nhis industry and in the world of sports. But he is perhaps most \nremarkable for the extraordinary support he has given to efforts to \nmake his community a healthier and safer place. In 1995, Peter made the \nsingle largest contribution in Michigan history to fight cancer, \ndonating $15 million to establish the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer \nInstitute, in honor of his first wife. The institute integrated the \nefforts of the major cancer-fighting organizations in Detroit--the \nMichigan Cancer Foundation, the Meyer L. Prentis Comprehensive Cancer \nCenter, the Detroit Medical Center, and Wayne State University. Peter \nand his wife, Debra, have involved Compuware in the nationwide cancer \nresearch fundraiser ``A Race for the Cure.'' Debra and Peter also \ncochaired the first ever major fundraiser for HAVEN, a shelter for \nabused women.\n  Mr. President, Peter Karmanos truly exemplifies the spirit of the \nB'nai B'rith Great American Traditions Award. His corporate citizenship \nand dedication to improving the lives of others are truly an \ninspiration. I hope my colleagues will join with me in offering \ncongratulations and best wishes to Peter Karmanos on this important \noccasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10819-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10819-S10821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WELFARE TO WORK\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nOttawa County, MI, for moving all, by which I mean a full 100 percent, \nof its welfare recipients to work. As in so many other things, Ottawa \nCounty should be an inspiration to us all as we seek fundamental \nwelfare reform that will end\n\n[[Page S10820]]\n\ndependence on government by putting people in real jobs with real \nfutures.\n  When we debated welfare reform in this Chamber, there were those who \nsaid that returning greater welfare policy control to our States and \nlocalities would produce only hardship and failure. The naysayers \nclaimed that healthy people on welfare could not or would not take \njobs--or that jobs could not be found for them. The naysayers claimed \nthat America's local communities lacked the resources and the \ncompassion to meet the challenge of helping welfare recipients end \ntheir dependence on government and work their way into decent jobs and \nan independent life.\n  The naysayers claimed it would be cruel to impose work requirements \nand limit benefits because this would simply hurt the self-esteem of \nrecipients and take food out of the mouths of their children. \nCompassion, they claimed, dictated the status quo.\n  Well, Mr. President, Ottawa County has proved the naysayers wrong. \nThe good people of Holland and surrounding communities in Ottawa County \nhave shown what real compassion can do. Real compassion--compassion \naimed at helping people rebuild productive, independent lives--works. \nIt has worked in Ottawa County and it can work throughout our country \nif we will give our States and local communities the freedom they need \nto put their compassion in action.\n  Welfare numbers fluctuate and new applications are filed all the \ntime, but Ottawa County last month reached the point where none of its \nresidents was receiving a welfare check without earning some income. \nHow did Ottawa County accomplish this? By expecting more of people. By \ninstituting work requirements. By doing everything necessary to make \nwork available for welfare recipients. And by tapping into the vast \nreservoir of skill and good will available in our faith-based \ncharities.\n  Ottawa County is in a particularly good position from which to deal \nwith welfare issues. Its Dutch and German communities are, in the words \nof one USA Today reporter ``infused with conservative values and a \nstrong work ethic.'' They have produced a thriving economy with a low \nunemployment rate. They also have opened their arms to recent \nimmigrants, including a significant number of Asians and Hispanics, and \nhave set about, in a determined manner, to give welfare recipients a \nchance to work. The rare combination of hard work and generosity we in \nMichigan have come to expect of the people of Ottawa County once again \nhas produced great results.\n  County officials have contracted to expand subsidized day care for \nworking and job-seeking mothers. The county also hired a firm to \nprovide 24-hour shuttle buses to take welfare recipients to work. And \nthey hired Kan Du Industries, a local picture-frame manufacturer that \nalso runs vocational programs for the disabled, to provide training and \nhelp in job placement skills. The county has engaged in a truly \ncomprehensive effort to help people become self-supporting.\n  The State of Michigan also deserves credit for this accomplishment. \nThrough its Project Zero, Michigan has spent more than $5 million in \nOttawa County to provide transportation, mentoring, and day-care \nservices to help welfare recipients get and keep jobs. But this is not \njust a handout. Those who refuse to comply with work requirements have \ntheir welfare checks cut by 25 percent, and face the prospect of losing \naid altogether if they do not find work in 3 months.\n  Mr. President, this policy has worked. It has gotten people off \nwelfare and into jobs. It has changed lives. Particularly effective has \nbeen Ottawa County's decision to look to local churches for help. For \nexample, a cover story in USA Today reports on Maria Gonzalez. Miss \nGonzalez went through a painful divorce, two out-of-wedlock births, a \nbreakdown, and homelessness, all before she reached the age of 27. \nThen, according to the newspaper, she ``found salvation . . . Through \nan increasingly common government ally: the church.''\n  Miss Gonzalez receives assistance from the State. State programs \nhelped her find work and continue to give aid in the form of day care \nand transportation to and from work. But, as a struggling, working \nmother of four, she has emotional needs as well. That is why Ottawa \nCounty paired her with Jan Tuls, a mentor from Calvary Christian \nReformed Church. Miss Gonzalez continues to attend her own Pentecostal \nChurch--no one has tried to change her faith. But the guidance she has \nreceived from Jan Tuls makes her believe that Miss Tuls is ``more of a \nmom to me than my own.''\n  Or take the case of Sylvia Ornelas. Mrs. Ornelas moved herself and \nher four children to Holland 6 months ago, in the midst of severe \nmarital difficulties. As a front page story in the Washington Post \ntells the story, Mrs. Ornelas went to the local welfare office. But \ninstead of simply a check, Holland gave her a community of friends and \nmentors.\n\n       Neighbors took her children shopping for school clothes. \n     Executives for a local manufacturer helped her find work. Bob \n     and Mary Ann Baker bought her a used car to get around. Ginny \n     Weerstra helped her find an apartment. Parishioners at \n     Hardewyk Reformed Christian Church took up a collection to \n     get her phone installed, and when her husband reentered her \n     life, Pastor Andrew Gorter provided the couple with marital \n     counselling.\n\n  Or take Gloria Garcia. This 27-year old mother of five young children \nwas homeless and jobless when her caseworker asked if she would like to \nbe coupled with mentors from one of the area churches. Miss Garcia \nagreed, and parishioners at Hardewyk Christian Reformed Church stepped \nin to help.\n  Miss Garcia had lost her job because she had missed too many days of \nwork in caring for her children. Ginny Weerstra, a parishioner at \nHardewyk, put a call in to the temporary employment service at which \nMiss Garcia had worked and asked that she be given a second chance. Now \nthat she had people behind her, willing to sit for her children when \nnecessary, Miss Garcia was rehired, and has been working full time \nsince September. The church also lent Miss Garcia $2,000--since paid \nback--for bad debts, and sent a parishioner who is an auto mechanic to \nhelp her buy a used car. Parishioners even helped Miss Garcia find an \naffordable home.\n  And these are not isolated incidents, Mr. President. Literally \nhundreds of residents of Ottawa County have been helped off welfare by \na community committed to helping them rebuild their lives. A community \nthat has been freed to call on its churches, to implement innovative \nday care, transportation, and job training and placement programs by \nour welfare reform legislation. A community that knows that neighbors \ncan do far more to help people in need than a simple check from the \ngovernment.\n  The close-knit relationships fostered in communities like Holland, \nMr. President, are helping welfare recipients find their way to a \nbetter life--to stable jobs, stable homes, and the stable habits needed \nto keep both together. State-fostered training centers can provide job \nskills, but it takes a more personal relationship to spur the drive to \npull one's life together in the way needed to lead a good, settled \nlife.\n  It is my hope, Mr. President, that other States will follow \nMichigan's example in sponsoring programs like Project Zero. The result \nwould be a more stable and prosperous America. It is my hope that we \nwill protect and expand our welfare reforms so that Ottawa County can \nbecome an example followed by communities all over the country.\n  Already today, Ottawa is not the only site involved in Project Zero. \nFive other sites--Alpena, Menominee, and Midland Counties and Romulus \nand Tireman in Wayne County all have participated in Project Zero. And \nall have seen significant progress in getting people off of welfare and \ninto good jobs. Since the program began in July 1996, Mr. President, \ntarget cases without income have declined by 62 percent. That is, \npeople receiving cash assistance who are not exempt, for example for \nhealth reasons, have been targeted to obtain paying jobs, and 62 \npercent of them have.\n  This is the kind of progress we need, Mr. President, to repair the \ndamage done to our local communities by too many years of government \nprograms that fed the bodies but starved the souls of struggling \nAmericans. Tough love--work requirements combined with a determined \neffort to make work possible--can help thousands upon thousands of \nAmericans as they seek a better life. I hope we all will learn from\n\n[[Page S10821]]\n\nthe excellent example provided by Ottawa County. The care and \ngenerosity of her people, the grounding of daily life in faith, and \ntraditional values that are so much a part of this wonderful county \nshould inspire us all to greater efforts.\n  The naysayers are being proved wrong every day. Americans can and \nwill help one another if only the Federal Government will give back the \nfreedom they need to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10819-4", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CHILD SOLDIERS\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the \nattention of the Senate a profoundly disturbing report issued by Human \nRights Watch on July 18 about the abduction of children by a heavily \narmed Ugandan rebel group called the Lord's Resistance Army.\n  While the precise number of children abducted by the Lord's \nResistance Army is unknown, estimates indicate that over the past 2 \nyears, 3 to 5 thousand children have escaped from the rebel group. It \nis reported that an equal number of abducted children remain in \ncaptivity and an unknown number have died.\n  According to Human Rights Watch, abduction is only the beginning of \nthe extreme violence and degradation faced by these children. Often as \nyoung as 8 years old, the children are tortured, raped, and sometimes \nkilled by members of the Lord's Resistance Army. They are forced to \ntake part in combat, serving as front line forces in battles against \nthe Ugandan Army and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army. The \nchildren also tell of being made to beat and kill fellow captives who \nhave been apprehended in their efforts to escape. The physical and \nemotional trauma resulting from such experiences can cause lifelong \nproblems to those children that do survive.\n  The abduction of children for military purposes not only violates the \nprovisions of common article 3 of the Geneva conventions of 1949, \ninternational standards established by protocol II to the Geneva \nconventions of 1949, and the Convention of the Rights of the Child, it \nviolates the most basic principles of human morality.\n  It is reported that the camps established by the Ugandan Government \nto contend with displaced children and their families are extremely \ninadequate. Crowded conditions and a lack of food and sanitation \nfacilities have resulted in malnutrition, disease, and death among \nthose who have sought refuge in these camps. Trauma counseling centers \nfor children who have escaped from the rebels are sorely in need of \nbasic supplies and qualified staff. Human Rights Watch reports that the \nchildren who are told to leave in order to make room for new arrivals \noften have nowhere to go and no means of support.\n  Mr. President, the phenomenon of the child soldier is growing not \nonly in Uganda, but around the world. If a more concerted effort is not \nmade to address the outrageous abuses these children face, Uganda and \nthe rest of the international community will be contending with the \nconsequences far in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10821-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO VERMONT EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS.

The station's impeccable selection of shows provides both an \nentertainment and educational value for all Vermonters.\n  Of noteworthy importance is their efforts to address the needs of \npre-school children through the Ready To Learn and Early Education \nInitiative. In close cooperation with the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting as well as the Department of Education, these programs are \ndesigned to assist children and prepare them for the challenges they \nwill face in school. Vermont ETV is dedicated to providing children, \nfrom a wide array of backgrounds, with the opportunity to start off on \nequal ground.\n  Vermont ETV is one of the finest examples of a successful community \npartnership, with almost 78% of its budget financed through donations \nfrom the public. I believe that Vermont ETV sets the standard similar \nstations in other States should strive to emulate. That is why I have \nbeen an active supporter for over 20 years. I would like to extend my \ncongratulations and best wishes to Vermont ETV, its employees as well \nas its supporters, for many more years of continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10821-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CHARISSE TILLMAN AND THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD FOOD PROGRAM\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on October 13, the United States \nand more than 150 nations will mark the observance of World Food Day. \nEvery year since 1980, World Food Day has been a time to raise \nawareness of worldwide hunger, and recognize those who have dedicated \ntheir lives to help people in need.\n  Many of the individuals who are fighting the war against hunger do so \nthrough the World Food Program [WFP]. The WFP is the largest \ninternational food aid organization in the world. Last year, 45 million \npeople in 84 countries benefited from the 2.2 million tons of food \ndistributed by the WFP.\n  The southern part of Sudan is an example of a region where the WFP \nhelps alleviate the suffering and illnesses caused by hunger. The \nsituation in the Sudan is extremely desperate and countless children \nhave died due to starvation.\n  One person who deserves special mention is Charisse Tillman of Culver \nCity, CA. She is an assessment coordinator for the WFP in Sudan. When a \nvillage or a community is targeted by the WFP for assistance, Ms. \nTillman is one of the first to arrive on the scene. She determines how \nmuch food is needed by the community and much it can actually produce. \nThis is extremely important so that WFP does not in any way discourage \nlocal agricultural production.\n  The World Food Program is home to many dedicated people like Charisse \nTillman. I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring her and all the \nunselfish humanitarians at the WFP.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10821-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10821-S10822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CELEBRATING HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, America's greatest asset is its \npeople, and what makes the American population unlike any other \ncountry's is our diversity. No other nation draws strength from so many \ndifferent cultures, and the American population is a mosaic of the \nworld's many nationalities. Through time, the traditions from these \nmany nations have become part of our own society, enriching our \nnational culture. But our Nation would not be nearly as strong without \nthe contributions of Americans who are of Hispanic descent. In \nrecognition of these contributions, our Nation is currently celebrating \nHispanic Heritage Month.\n  Hispanic Heritage Month provides a wonderful opportunity for us to \nhonor the diverse achievements and contributions of Hispanics in this \ncountry. I know that in my home State of Connecticut there have been \nparades and dances to mark this occasion, as well as readings of works \nby Hispanic authors at public libraries. All of these events give \nHispanic-Americans a deeper appreciation for their roots, and make all \nAmericans more aware of the contributions that Hispanics make to our \nNation.\n  Perhaps the easiest way to understand and appreciate the extent to \nwhich Hispanics have become entwined in the American landscape would \ncome from reading the newspaper. On the front page, you could read an \narticle about our Secretary of Energy or the U.S. Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations who are both Hispanic. In the business section you could \nread an article on the Latino Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration who released\n\n[[Page S10822]]\n\na report showing that the number of new businesses owned by Hispanic \nwomen has grown at three times the overall rate of business growth. In \nthe arts section you could read about a recital by a Spanish guitarist \nplaying flamenco music at a local theater. The food section could have \nan writeup of a new Mexican restaurant that just opened up downtown. \nAnd in the Sports section you could read about the Major League \nBaseball playoffs where every single team has Hispanic players that are \nresponsible for their team's success. In fact, in the Washington Post \nsports pages you could read coverage of World Cup Soccer, in Spanish.\n  When we talk about Hispanics and how their contributions make our \nNation more vibrant and diverse, it is important that we recognize the \ngreat diversity that exists within the Hispanic community itself. \nHispanic-Americans come from a variety of nations, ranging from Central \nAmerica to South America to Europe to the Caribbean.\n  What unites Hispanic-Americans is a fundamental respect for the \ntraditions and values of their native lands combined with a strong \ncommitment to the American dream. Life in America requires that they \nstrike a balance between embracing their roots and assimilating into \nthis new culture. Reaching this balance can be a struggle, but it is a \nstruggle that will leave them enriched as individuals, while at the \nsame time enriching our Nation.\n  Hispanic-Americans should take great pride in their heritage, and I \nam glad that Hispanic Heritage Month gives our Nation an opportunity to \nhonor and celebrate their contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10821-4", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     EXPLANATION OF VOTES ON THE FY98 INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, a few weeks ago the Senate \nfinished consideration of the Fiscal Year 1998 Interior appropriations \nbill. I would like to speak for a moment on the amendments to this \nlegislation.\n  One of the first amendments to be considered was offered by Senator \nBryan of Nevada. The Bryan amendment proposed to cut $10 million from \nthe Forest Service's timber roads construction budget and to eliminate \nthe Purchaser Credit Program. As I understand it, Senator Bryan \nbelieves the monies used by the Forest Service to assist with the \nconstruction and maintenance of roads used by loggers constitutes a \nsubsidy and he targets it accordingly. Proponents of this program, \nhowever, argue that there is no road subsidy because the Forest Service \ntakes possession of the roads after the timber harvest and uses them to \nfight forest fires, manage the forestlands and provide recreational \naccess.\n  The Purchaser Credit Program, meanwhile, credits timber companies for \nthe cost to build roads when it bids out a timber sale. The logging \ncompany will then build the roads, harvest the timber and pay the \nForest Service for the timber minus the cost of the road. Meanwhile, \nthat same company is able to use the credit it received from the first \nsale to bid on other timber sales. The ability to use this credit \ntoward other timber sales benefit is particularly beneficial to small \nlogging companies with limited capital. Elimination of this program, \ntherefore, would do little to reduce logging on federal lands, but \nwould greatly reduce the ability of small timber companies to bid on \ntimber sales.\n  Finally, I am concerned that the Bryan amendment could make it even \nmore difficult to conduct timber sales on Forest Service lands. In the \npast decade, timber sales on federal lands have declined by over two-\nthirds. Timber harvests on private lands have necessarily increased in \norder to make up for the lost wood. Private timber harvests have proven \ninsufficient to meet market demand, however, and the shortfalls are \nincreasingly being made up with imported, Canadian lumber. If this \ntrend continues, I fear that the resulting timber shortages will raise \nthe price per board-foot of lumber and increase housing and furniture \ncosts.\n  Nevertheless, while I opposed the 49-51 vote to table the Bryan \namendment, I reserve the right to reconsider my vote on this issue in \nthe future. At this time, I am concerned, but not convinced, that the \ntimber program represents a subsidy to the timber industry. In order to \nclarify this question, I urge the chairman of the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee to hold hearings on this issue.\n  The Senate next turned to consideration of a Hutchinson amendment to \nauthorize the President to implement the recently announced American \nHeritage Rivers Initiative subject to Congressional approval. The goal \nof this amendment was both to ensure that Congress has a say in such \ndesignation and define what constitutes a river community.\n  Proposed by the President, the American Heritage Rivers Initiative \nseeks to identify polluted rivers which are important to this nation's \nhistory and provide a new avenue for funding cleanup efforts. While I \nbelieve this amendment was well-intentioned, after careful review I \nbecame convinced that the Hutchinson amendment would actually serve to \ngreatly increase the cost for a community to designate their river as \nan American Heritage site. As long as property owners are assured of \ntheir rights, the American Heritage Rivers Initiative could play a \nsignificant role in cleaning up some of this nation's most polluted \nrivers. In order to keep the Heritage River designation a viable option \nfor Michigan's rivers, I voted in support of the motion to table the \nHutchinson amendment which passed on a 57-42 vote.\n  Shortly after dispensing with the Hutchinson amendment, the Senate \ntook up a Kyl Amendment to provide $4.8 million for law enforcement to \ncombat gangs on Indian Tribal Lands. While these gangs have yet to \npresent themselves in Michigan, states such as Arizona are having to \nconfront this problem with increasing frequency. In an effort to \naddress this problem before it becomes a national phenomenon, I \nsupported Senator Kyl's amendment. Nevertheless, it was defeated on a \n34-64 vote.\n  The next legislation to be considered was a Bumpers amendment to \nimpose a royalty of five percent of the net return on the profits from \nmining gold, silver and platinum. In addition, in order to raise funds \nto pay for the cleanup of abandoned mines, the amendment would also \ncharge a reclamation fee for those mines which have patented their \nlands.\n  In his speech on the Senate floor, Senator Bumpers indicated that the \nreclamation fee served as a much needed tax on the industry. Shortly \nafter, a point of order was raised which noted that the introduction of \na tax measure such as this in the Senate was unconstitutional. A vote \nwas called to determine the merit of the point of order. Whether \nSenator Bumpers legislation had merit or not, it was clear to me that \nthe amendment did violate the Constitutional law stating all tax \nmeasures must originate in the House of Representatives. I agreed that \nthe Point of Order was well taken and, on a 59-39 vote, the Bumpers \namendment was deemed out of order.\n  Shortly after disposing of the Bumpers Amendment, the Senate turned \nto final consideration of the FY98 Interior Appropriations bill. I was \npleased to support its 93-3 passage and urge the conferees to work as \nquickly as possible to finalize the conference report before the end of \nthe fiscal year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10822-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, having recommended Anthony W. Ishii to \nPresident Clinton to be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District in \nCalifornia, I am gratified to see his nomination come before the full \nSenate today, and I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm him.\n  Anthony Ishii, a third generation Californian, will be the first \nAsian-American to serve on the Eastern District federal bench. He has \nhad a long and distinguished legal career. Currently, he serves as a \nMunicipal Court Judge for the Central Valley Municipal Court in Fresno, \nCalifornia.\n  For ten years prior to his service on the Municipal Court bench, he \nserved as a Justice Court Judge for the Parlier-Selma Judicial District \nin Fresno County. He was initially appointed to the Justice Court \nposition by the Fresno County Board of Supervisors, and has since stood \nfor election three time. He won his first reelection and has been \nunopposed in each of the two subsequent ones.\n  Judge Ishii received his Juris Doctor from Boalt Hall, the law school \nat the University of California, Berkeley. Early in his career, he was \na Deputy City Attorney in Sacramento and a Deputy Public Defender for \nthe County of Fresno. Prior to his service on the bench, he was an \nattorney in private practice. He has extensive trial experience, \nhandling over 70 jury trials before becoming a judge.\n  For years, Judge Ishii has been involved in numerous professional \nactivities. He was appointed to the prestigious California Judicial \nCouncil by California Supreme Court Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas. \nAdditionally, he served as a member of the Judicial Council Advisory \nCommittee on the Administration of Justice in the rural counties for \nthree years. He served\n\n[[Page S10826]]\n\nfrom 1991 to 1993 on the Commission on the Future of the California \nCourts. From 1983 to 1993, he was a member of the Fresno County Justice \nCourt Judges Association and served a term as president of the \norganization.\n  Judge Ishii is also a leader in his community. He is a member of the \nJapanese American Citizens League, where he has served in numerous \ncapacities for over nineteen years. His community service includes the \nSelma Public Education Foundation, the Selma Hospital Foundation, the \nSelma Delinquency Prevention Committee, and service on the Board of \nValley Public Television. He has been a member of the California Small \nBusiness Development Board, the California Task Force on Rural Economy, \nand the Asian and Pacific Islander Advisory Committee.\n  Judge Ishii has received numerous letters illustrating his broad, \nbipartisan support. The Sheriff of Fresno County, Steve Magarian, who \nhas known Judge Ishii for 15 years, says he ``has earned the deep \nrespect from law enforcement''.\n  The Chief of Police, William Eldridge, of the Livingston Police \nDepartment says Judge Ishii is ``highly respected by both the citizens \nof the community and law enforcement.''\n  The President of the Merced County Sheriff's Employee Association, \nBrian Miller, writes Ishii ``has a strong commitment to law \nenforcement, and has the background and knowledge that makes him an \ninvaluable asset to the Federal Judicial System.''\n  The President of the 700-member Fresno Police Officers Association, \nLarry Bertao, says that Judge Ishii has an ``outstanding reputation \namong local law enforcement . . . and will serve his community in an \neffective and distinguished manner as a federal court judge.''\n  The President of the Fresno Deputy Sheriffs Association, Victor \nWisemer, says Judge Ishii is ``well-respected by his colleagues, has a \nstrong commitment to quality law enforcement, and is equitable in the \ndecisions he renders.''\n  Judge Ishii has the unanimous support of the Fresno County Board of \nSupervisors, an all-Republican Board. Their letter states that Ishii is \n``recognized for his exemplary judicial tenure and has universal \ncommunity support.''\n  The President of the Fresno Chamber of Commerce, Doug Davidian, says \nhe is ``well respected by law enforcement, the judiciary and by the \nlegal and business communities.''\n  I strongly believe Judge Ishii will make an outstanding addition to \nthe federal bench. I believe his intelligence, judicial temperament, \nbroad experience, professional and community service, and deep \ncommitment to justice qualify him to serve on the federal bench with \ngreat distinction.\n  I am very proud to have had the opportunity to recommend Anthony \nIshii for the Federal District Court, and I urge my colleagues to vote \nto approve his nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the majority leader had \ndecided to take up the nomination of Judge Anthony W. Ishii to be a \nUnited States District Judge for the Eastern District of California. \nJudge Ishii is an outstanding nominee. He is currently a municipal \ncourt judge in Fresno, California. The ABA found him to be well-\nqualified, its highest rating.\n  We first received Anthony Ishii's nomination on February 12, 1997, \nalmost eight months ago. He had a confirmation hearing on June 25, \nwhere he was strongly supported by both California Senators. He was \nfavorably reported by the Judiciary Committee back on July 10. There \nhas been no explanation or justification for the delay in bringing this \nnomination forward from the Senate calendar. I am sure that Judge Ishii \nand his family are happy that their long wait is now over. I \ncongratulate them and look forward to his service on the District \nCourt.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican leadership has chosen again to skip \nover the nomination of Margaret Morrow. In spite of the adoption of the \nWysen-Grassley amendment earlier this month, an amendment that calls \nupon Senators to come forward within two days of exercising a hold to \nidentify themselves, Margaret Morrow's nomination has been the subject \nof an anonymous and mysterious hold over a period of two years and most \nrecently since being reported on June 12, almost four months ago.\n  On September 29 Senator Hatch reiterated his continuing support for \nthe nomination of Margaret Morrow and announced that he will vote for \nher. He said: ``I have found her to be qualified and I will support \nher. Undoubtedly, there will be some who will not, but she deserved to \nhave her vote on the floor. I have been assured by the majority leader \nthat she will have her vote on the floor. I intend to argue for and on \nher behalf.''\n  I have looked forward to that debate since June 12. I ask, again, why \nnot now, why not today, why not this week? This is a nomination that \nhas been pending for far too long and that has been stalled here on the \nfloor twice over two years without justification. Last year this \nnomination was unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee and was \nleft to wither without action for over three months. This year, the \nCommittee again reported her nomination favorably and it has been \npending for another four months. There has been no explanation for this \ndelay and no justification. This good woman does not deserve this \nshameful treatment.\n  Meanwhile, the people served by the District Court for the Central \nDistrict of California continue to suffer the affects of this \npersistent vacancy--cases are not heard, criminal cases are not being \ntried. This is one of more than 28 vacancies that have persisted for so \nlong that they are classified as ``judicial emergency'' vacancies by \nthe Administrative Office of the United States Courts.\n  When the President spoke out in his national radio address, he asked \nthat the delay in the consideration of judicial nominees come to an \nend. Unfortunately, the delay continues with respect to too many \nnominations, including that of Margaret Morrow.\n\n\n                   nomination of katharine g. abraham\n\n  Mr. MOYHIHAN. Mr. President, the record should reflect that there is \na growing body of evidence that the Consumer Price Index, as complied \nby the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is not an accurate measure of the \ncost of living. The BLS itself so states in its brochure, \n``Understanding the Consumer Price Index: Answers to Some Questions,'' \nwhich in answer to the question ``Is the CPI a cost of living index?'' \nsays ``No, although it frequently and mistakenly is called a cost of \nliving index.''\n  That the CPI is an upward-biased measure of changes in the cost of \nliving is not in dispute. The Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer \nPrice index appointed by the Finance Committee in 1995 concluded as \nfollows:\n\n       * * * The Commission's best estimate of the size of the \n     upward bias looking forward is 1.1 percentage points per \n     year. The range of plausible values is 0.8 to 1.6 percentage \n     points per year.\n\n  In testimony on February 11, 1997 before the Finance Committee, \nCommissioner Abraham herself acknowledged that the CPI ``gives you an \nupper bound on what is happening to the cost of living.''\n  I would also note that Dr. David Wilcox, who was recently nominated \nto be Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, has \nreached conclusions remarkably similar to those of the Boskin \nCommission. While serving as Senior Economist at the Federal Reserve \nBoard, Dr. Wilcox and Matthew Shapiro, Professor of Economics at the \nUniversity of Michigan, published a study entitled ``Mismeasurement in \nthe Consumer Price Index: An Evaluation'' in which they wrote:\n\n       * * * we [find] the overall bias in the CPI at just under \n     1.0 percentage point per year. We also estimate that the \n     [range] lies between 0.6 percentage point per year and 1.5 \n     percentage points per year.\n\n  So the issue is not whether the CPI an accurate measure of changes in \nthe cost-of-living, but rather how large is the upward bias?\n  Yet despite evidence from experts both inside and outside the \ngovernment, last spring we began to hear repeated the argument that \nquestioning the accuracy of the Consumer Price Index as a measurement \nof the cost of living somehow constituted political interference with \nthe BLS. I hope that in her second term, Commissioner Abraham will help \nto dispel this perception by working closely with price experts inside \nand outside the government. For as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan said in testimony\n\n[[Page S10827]]\n\nbefore the Finance Committee on January 30, 1997:\n\n       * * * assuming zero for the remaining bias is the political \n     fix. On this issue we should let evidence, not politics, \n     drive policy.\n\n  Policies based on inaccurate statistics can have dramatic \nconsequences for the economy. For example, overstating the increase in \nthe cost of living reduces the growth in real wages. With an overstated \ncost of living measure, it appears that real hourly wages have been \nstagnant for the past 30 years. Yet with a one percentage point \ncorrection, it turns out that real hourly earnings have actually \nincreased by 35 percent.\n  It is important that our Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is \ncomprised of many superb professionals, even so be humble enough to \nrecognize that it may not be the repository of all expertise on this \nsubject. There are other views, and they need to be considered \ncarefully by the BLS. Commissioner Abraham would do well to be mindful \nof this in her second term.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/09/senate-section/article/S10825-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. 136) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 136\n\n       Whereas according to the American Cancer Society, in 1997, \n     180,200 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 43,900 \n     women will die from this disease;\n       Whereas in the decade of the 1990's, it is estimated that \n     about 2,000,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, \n     resulting in nearly 500,000 deaths;\n       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with \n     a woman at age 70 having twice as much of a chance of \n     developing the disease as a woman at age 50;\n       Whereas at least 80 percent of the women who get breast \n     cancer have no family history of the disease;\n       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a \n     certified facility, can provide a safe and quick diagnosis;\n       Whereas experts agree that mammography is the best method \n     of earlydetection of breast cancer, and early detection is \n     the key to saving lives;\n       Whereas mammograms can reveal the presence of small cancers \n     up to 2 years or more before a regular clinical breast \n     examination or breast self-examination (BSE), saving as many \n     as 30 percent more lives;\n       Whereas the medicare program will cover mammograms on an \n     annual basis for women over 39 years of age, beginning in \n     January, 1998; and\n       Whereas 47 States have passed legislation requiring health \n     insurance companies to cover mammograms in accordance with \n     recognized screening guidelines: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 17, 1997, as ``National Mammography \n     Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe such \n     day with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.
