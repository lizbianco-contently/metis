We exalt \nYou as Sovereign of our beloved Nation, and we are exhilarated as we \nprepare to witness the divine encounter between You and the Senators-\nelect as they are sworn in. You have destined them for greatness as \nleaders of our Nation. They are here by Your choice and are accountable \nto You for how they lead this Nation under Your guidance. May the \nawesome vows that they take and the immense responsibilities they \nassume bring them to the knees of their hearts with profound humility \nand an unprecedented openness to You. Save them from the seduction of \npower, the addiction of popularity and the aggrandizement of pride. \nLord, keep their priorities straight: You and their families first; the \ngood of our Nation second; consensus around truth third; party \nloyalties fourth; and personal success last of all.\n  May they never forget that they are here to serve and not to be \nserved. Consistently replenish the reserves of strength and courage so \noften drained by pressure and stress. Anoint their minds with Your \nspirit and guide them as they seek to know and do Your will in the \ncrucial issues before our Nation. This can be America's finest hour \nawaiting leaders imbued with Your power. May it be, Lord, in Your holy \nname. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S1-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1-S4]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CERTIFICATE OF ELECTION AND CREDENTIALS\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, today marks the 105th time since 1789 that \nnewly elected Senators have stood before this body's Presiding Officer \nat the start of a new Congress to pledge their support for the \nConstitution of the United States. I would like to take advantage of \nthis special event in the life of each new Congress to comment briefly \nabout the origins of the oath we take.\n  There is a good deal of confusion about the oath and its origin. Some \nbelieve that the Constitution prescribes its specific text and that all \nSenators since 1789 have taken and signed the oath in the form that we \nknow today. Neither is true. While the Constitution specifies a \nseparate oath for the President, it leaves to Congress the \nresponsibility of preparing an oath for its Members and all other \nFederal officeholders.\n  The Oath Act of June 1, 1789, was the first legislation passed by the \nSenate and the first law signed by President George Washington. It \nprescribed the following simple oath: ``I _____ do solemnly swear (or \naffirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States.'' On \nJune 4, 1789, Senate President John Adams administered that new oath to \nall Senators, setting a pattern that future Presiding Officers \nfollowed, without controversy, for the next 74 years.\n  The outbreak of the War Between the States quickly transformed the \nact of oath-taking, which had become a routine procedure after 1789, \ninto one of enormous significance. At a time of uncertain and shifting \nloyalties, President Abraham Lincoln ordered all Federal civilian \npersonnel to retake the prewar oath of allegiance. When Congress \nconvened for a brief emergency session in the summer of 1861, Members \nsupplemented the President's action by passing a law requiring civil \nofficers to take an expanded oath in support of the Union. Although \nCongress did not then apply this August 1861 oath to its own Members, \nits text is the earliest direct predecessor of the oath we take today.\n  When Congress returned for its regular session in December 1861, \nMembers who believed that the Union had more to fear from northern \ntraitors than from southern soldiers fundamentally revised the August \n1861 statute in July 1862 by adding an ``Ironclad Test Oath'' \nprovision. This war-inspired test oath required civil servants and \nmilitary officers to swear not only to future loyalty, as required by \nthe existing oaths, but also to affirm that they had never previously \nsupported hostilities against the United States. Those who failed to \ntake the 1862 test oath would not receive a salary; those who swore \nfalsely would be prosecuted for perjury and forever denied Federal \nemployment.\n  The 1862 oath's second section incorporated a more polished and \ngraceful rendering of the hastily drafted 1861 oath in language that is \nidentical to the oath we take today.\n  Early in 1864, the Senate adopted a rule specifying that all newly \nelected Members must not only orally agree to the test oath, but also \n``subscribe'' to it by signing a printed copy. This condition reflected \na wartime practice in which military and civilian authorities required \nanyone wishing to do business with the Federal Government to sign a \ncopy of the test oath. The requirement included Confederate prisoners \nof war seeking parole and southerners who wished to be reimbursed for \ngoods confiscated by foraging Union troops. Our modern practice of \nsigning the oath comes from this period.\n  At the end of the war in 1865, the test oath stood as a formidable \nbarrier to President Andrew Johnson's moderate reconstruction policies, \ndesigned to allow residents of the South to participate in their own \ngovernment. While the President pushed for a rapid reintegration of \nSouthern States, those in Congress who wished to impose a harsh peace \ninsisted on the test oath, which had been created in part to prevent \nex-Confederates from taking Federal positions. Many of the oath's\n\n[[Page S5]]\n\ndrafters specifically had in mind blocking the return of one of my \ndirect Senate predecessors--Jefferson Davis.\n  The Constitution's 14th amendment, ratified in 1868, permitted \nCongress to remove barriers to service by former Confederates through a \ntwo-thirds vote of both Houses. Congress then enacted an oath for those \nin this category, allowing them to ignore the test oath's first \nsection, regarding past loyalties, and subscribe only to its second \nsection pledging future allegiance. That 1868 oath is identical to the \none we take today.\n  As postwar tensions eased, Congress in 1871 dropped the requirement \nfor a two-thirds vote of both Houses for former Confederates entering \ncongressional service or government employment. For another 13 years, \nhowever, all oath takers who were not former Confederates were required \nto take the full test oath. In 1877, to further complicate matters, the \nSenate amended its rules to require that Senators take not only the \n1862 or the 1868 oath, but also the original oath of 1789.\n  Reflecting the confusion surrounding these multiple requirements, the \nSenate's archives contain no signed oaths for the years between 1871 \nand 1880. From 1880 until 1884, nearly 20 years after the war's \nconclusion, newly elected southern Senators who had participated in \nthat conflict signed the 1868 oath, while all the others signed the \n1862 test oath.\n  On January 11, 1884, as part of a general revision of its rules, the \nSenate replaced specific references to the rules of 1862 and 1868 with \nthe simple statement that is now Rule III of our Standing Rules: ``The \noaths or affirmations required by the Constitution and prescribed by \nlaw shall be taken and subscribed by each Senator, in open Senate, \nbefore entering upon his duties.'' Seven weeks later, bringing to a \nclose nearly a quarter century of confusion and acrimony, the Senate \nrepealed the 1862 test oath. From that day to this, the high solemn \noath ``prescribed by law'' has been the oath of 1868.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S4-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LOUISIANA ELECTION CONTEST\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before the Chair presents the certification \nof election for the swearing in to begin, I would like to take a moment \nto speak about the seating of one of our new colleagues who will be \nsworn in within the next few minutes. I am referring to the seating of \nSenator-elect Landrieu. The Senate has received petitions from the \ncitizens of the State of Louisiana contesting the election of Senator-\nelect Landrieu.\n  As most of you know, direct election of U.S. Senators began as a \nresult of the 17th amendment to the Constitution in 1913. Since that \ntime, the Senate has called into question a number of election results. \nHowever, only on four occasions have the challenges been successful in \npersuading the Senate to overturn the outcome of an election. The U.S. \nConstitution leaves it entirely up to the Senate to decide what \nevidence it deems relevant for overturning an election.\n  At this point, the seating of Senator-elect Landrieu has been called \ninto question as a result of investigative material by the Senate Rules \nCommittee. The Senate Rules Committee is reviewing the evidence, and I \nam confident they will come to a conclusion as to whether the \nallegations should be dismissed or investigated further in a swift and \ntimely manner.\n  With all of that in mind, Senator-elect Landrieu will take the oath \nof office with her colleagues but will be seated without prejudice. The \nseating without prejudice has occurred a number of times in U.S. Senate \nhistory. The term means without prejudice to the right of the Senate to \ndetermine the outcome of the questioned election.\n  I should like to quote from majority leader Taft of Ohio when he \nstated that ``These Senators should be permitted to take the oath and \nto be seated. It is my further view that the oath is taken without \nprejudice to the right of anyone contesting the seat to proceed with \nthe contest and without prejudice to the right of anyone protesting or \nasking expulsion from the Senate to proceed.''\n  In the case of our colleague, Senator-elect Landrieu, she will \nshortly begin her new role as a U.S. Senator from the State of \nLouisiana and the Rules Committee will continue to investigate the \nallegations. I know the Democratic leader concurs with this procedure \nof seating Senator-elect Landrieu without prejudice, and we are both \nhopeful that the Rules Committee will conclude its investigation and \nmake its ruling in a swift and responsible fashion. It is possible that \nlater today, after discussions with the Democratic leader, we will be \nable to reach a further colloquy and perhaps a consent agreement with \nrespect to any motion the Rules Committee may make at a later date in \nresponse to those allegations. After consulting with the Democratic \nleader, I hope to propound a consent agreement that would limit debate \non any motion so that the full Senate would be able to resolve the \nmatter very quickly.\n  I now yield to the Democratic leader for any comments he may wish to \nmake on the subject.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S5-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SWEARING IN OF SENATORS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the \ndistinguished majority leader for his comments and welcoming him to the \n105th Congress, as we welcome all of the newly elected Members to this \nprestigious body. As the Senator also noted, we have a number of former \ncolleagues who have now reached the height of ``citizen,'' and we \nwelcome them in their new positions as well. The families are here. We \nall note their presence and recognize what an important day and a \nmemorable day it is for not only the Senators-elect, but for the \nfamilies as well.\n  We begin this session with much hope and good will. And I think the \nremarks just made by the majority leader concerning Senator Landrieu \nare reflective of that. I would like to believe that the administration \nof the oath of Senator-elect Landrieu will not prejudice in any way the \nSenate's constitutional power to judge the Louisiana election. Neither \nwill the pendency of Mr. Jenkins' petition diminish in any way the \neffect of the oath that will now be administered to Senator-elect \nLandrieu.\n  Just as in recent cases of Senators Coverdell, Packwood, and \nFeinstein, all Senators sworn in today are Senators in every sense of \nthe word. Those were the sentiments of leaders in those instances, and \nI believe they are just as appropriate today.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think we are ready to proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S5-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5-S6]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ADMINISTRATION OF OATH OF OFFICE\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader.\n  For the record, and without being critical of anyone, I am sure that \nwe have followed late precedent in notifying the House and notifying \nthe President after the President pro tempore is elected.\n  When the Senate first met on April 6th, 1789, after having been \ndelayed 34\n\n[[Page S8]]\n\ndays for the lack of a quorum, the first order of business was the \nelection of a President pro tempore, who is a constitutional officer. \nThe Senate is required to elect a Member of the body to serve as the \nPresident pro tempore in the absence of the Vice President.\n  When the Senate met on April 6th, 1789 there was no Vice President. \nThere was no President. And once the President pro tempore was \nelected--his name was John Langdon from New Hampshire--the Senate then \nnotified the House that it was organized and ready to count the \nelectoral ballots.\n  So the selection of the President pro tempore was first because the \nSenate had to have a Presiding Officer. And there was no Vice \nPresident. There was no Vice President until April 21st of 1789 when \nthe Vice President, John Adams, took the oath of office.\n  So I say this because sometimes we vary from precedent without \nthinking about it. And it escaped my notice that this was done, I \nthink, in the last Congress when the President pro tempore was elected.\n  But in any event, for the record, I hope that in the future we will \nfollow the practice of the Members of the Senate of 1789, when a \nPresident pro tempore is to be elected.\n  In the old days they elected a President pro tempore perhaps for the \noccasion, or one for a single day. But the practice now is that we \nelect a President pro tempore, who serves until another is elected--he \nretires, or passes on to another world, or his party loses control and \na new President pro tempore is elected, or until his own term as \nSenator expires and he is reelected, as was the case today.\n  I thank all Senators for their indulgence. And especially I thank our \ntwo fine leaders. I am also very favorably impressed with both leaders. \nI know that they are going to do the Senate proud and do all of us \nproud.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia for that information. And certainly we want to follow the \nprecedents very closely. I will make sure that we look carefully at \nthose and be prepared to elect a President pro tempore first the next \ntime. Certainly, my feeling is that there is no higher honor nor \ngreater responsibility nor greater opportunity than electing the \nSenator from South Carolina as the leader and as President pro tempore \nof the Senate.\n  So I thank Senator Byrd for his comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S7-6", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NOTIFYING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF THE ELECTION OF A \n                         PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

As in the past, these consents have been \ncleared with the Democratic leader. Therefore, I send to the desk 11 \nunanimous-consent requests and ask for their immediate consideration en \nbloc, that the requests be agreed to en bloc, and that the various \nconsents be shown separately in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the duration of the \n105th Congress, the Ethics Committee be authorized to meet during the \nsession of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the duration of the \n105th Congress, there be a limitation of 15 minutes each upon any \nrollcall vote, with the warning signal to be sounded at the midway \npoint, beginning at the last 7\\1/2\\ minutes, and when rollcall votes \nare of 10-minute duration, the warning signal be sounded at the \nbeginning of the last 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the Congress, it \nbe in order for the Secretary of the Senate to receive reports at the \ndesk when presented by a Senator at any time during the day of the \nsession of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority and minority \nleaders may daily have up to 10 minutes each on each calendar day \nfollowing the prayer and disposition of the reading of, or the approval \nof, the Journal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Parliamentarian of \nthe House of Representatives and his three assistants be given the \nprivilege of the floor during the 105th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, notwithstanding the \nprovisions of rule XXVIII, conference reports and statements \naccompanying them not be printed as Senate reports when such conference \nreports and statements have been printed as a House report unless \nspecific request is made in the Senate in each instance to have such a \nreport printed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on \nAppropriations be authorized during the 105th\n\n[[Page S9]]\n\nCongress to file reports during adjournments or recesses of the Senate \non appropriation bills, including joint resolutions, together with any \naccompanying notices of motions to suspend rule XVI, pursuant to rule \nV, for the purpose of offering certain amendments to such bills or \njoint resolutions, which proposes amendments shall be printed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, for the duration of the \n105th Congress, the Secretary of the Senate be authorized to make \ntechnical and clerical corrections in the engrossments of all Senate-\npassed bills and resolutions, Senate amendments to House bills and \nresolutions, Senate amendments to House amendments to Senate bills and \nresolutions, and Senate amendments to House amendments to Senate \namendments to House bills or resolutions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the duration of the \n105th Congress, when the Senate is in recess or adjournment, the \nSecretary of the Senate be authorized to receive messages from the \nPresident of the United States, and--with the exception of House bills, \njoint resolutions, and concurrent resolutions--messages from the House \nof Representatives; and that they be appropriately referred; and that \nthe President of the Senate, the President pro tempore, and the Acting \nPresident pro tempore be authorized to sign duly enrolled bills and \njoint resolutions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the duration of the \n105th Congress, Senators be allowed to leave at the desk with the \njournal clerk the names of two staff members who will be granted the \nprivilege of the floor during the consideration of the specific matter \nnoted, and that the Sergeant at Arms be instructed to rotate such staff \nmembers as space allows.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the duration of the \n105th Congress, it be in order to refer treaties and nominations on the \nday when they are received from the President, even when the Senate has \nno executive session that day.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia for some comments in regard to this particular resolution \nprior to the time we go to the next one.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, have the unanimous consent requests been \nagreed to, en bloc?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). They have been.\n  Mr. BYRD. I had hoped to be recognized before they were agreed to. \nBut I take the floor now just to inquire of the Chair and to inquire of \nboth leaders, during the leader time each day. are we talking about 10 \nminutes for speeches only? I do not think there has been any \ncontroversial motion ever made during the 10 minutes of either leader's \ntime, and I think, for the Record, we ought to clarify this, that the \n10 minutes are to be used for speeches or for unanimous consent \nrequests but that no motion will be in order during those 10 minutes \nfor either leader.\n\n  I say this because it seems to me--and I have not seen it happen, but \nI think it could happen--during the 10 minutes if there were a very \ncontroversial motion and a Senator or group of Senators were attempting \nto hold the floor and not let that motion be made, their leader could \ncome in and claim his time, which he has a right to do, and during the \n10 minutes I am concerned that he might make a controversial motion. \nThis might never happen, and there might be other ways--I am sure there \nwould be--to challenge that, but just in order that we do not have to \nworry about it, I wonder if it is agreed that during the 10 minutes no \ncontroversial motion will be made.\n  What is controversial? I should think we ought to know when either \nleader seeks to make a motion. If the motion is likely to be \ncontroversial, I hope that it would not be made during that period of \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this unanimous consent request is that the \nmajority and minority leaders may have up to 10 minutes each on each \ncalendar day following the prayer and the disposition of the reading of \nor the approval of the Journal. It does not indicate any limitation as \nto what may be done in that 10 minutes. This is the language that has \nbeen used traditionally. It was taken from previous opening day \nunanimous consent requests that are traditionally done en bloc as we \nhave done here today.\n  I know of no incident where this has been abused or any series of \nabuses of this 10-minute time by the leaders, certainly not during my \ntime, and I do not remember it during Senator Dole's time. As far back \nas I have knowledge, I do not think that has been done.\n  I know that the leaders, Senator Daschle and I, will work together \nvery carefully, and we have already indicated to each other we do not \nintend to pull surprises. And certainly if we were going to make any \nmotion during that 10-minute period, we would have, I believe, an \nobligation to notify each other of such a plan.\n  But I do feel that it is not limited to just debate only. I would \nlike to have the opportunity before we limit it in any way to go back \nand look carefully at what the precedents have been and how it has been \ndealt with in the past, and make sure we understand what we could or \ncould not do. We are in no way enlarging upon what has been done in the \npast. Once again, in all due diligence and caution, I would want to \nmake sure we are not giving up a right that in fact the leaders may \nneed in the future.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia makes a very good point. I think the point of his \ninquiry in large measure has to do with whether or not either side will \nsurprise the other with regard to tactics involving the leaders' time \nthat would in some way assist the leaders in doing something for which \nthere has not been proper notification. I believe, as the distinguished \nmajority leader has indicated, both sides are going to make a good \nfaith effort to assure that we are not surprised. I believe in this \ncase that effort will be practiced as well as promised.\n  I think there have been occasions, and I can recall vaguely the \noccasions, where we have been working under a time agreement and, as a \nresult of negotiations between both sides, have come up with a \ncompromise substitute amendment, through a process that involves the \nleaders, that may allow us to expedite the legislative process, wherein \nthe leaders will use their time to make the case involving that \nparticular amendment and then offer the amendment at the end of that \nperiod of time as an alternative to the pending measure.\n  It would be my hope we could continue to work with that understanding \nbecause on some occasions we are out of time, and were it not for the \nleaders' time, we might not be able to address such a compromise. Of \ncourse, we still have the avenue of asking for unanimous consent, but \nthe leaders' time gives us another option in that regard. So I think \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia is right on the mark with \nregard to the concern he raises, and I think I am satisfied that I have \nthe assurances from the majority leader in this case there will not be \nsurprises and we will use this time prudently.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could be recognized for a moment more \nbefore the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia comments.\n  Mr. BYRD. Sure.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think that, once again, as we try very hard to make sure \nwe preserve the decorum we should have in this Chamber and we have kind \nof gotten away from--the Senator from West Virginia has noted that fact \nto me, and I have heard him--we are going to try some things to effect \nthat in fact and in appearance also. We have had a situation where \nmaybe too many staff members are getting in the Chamber and blocking \npassages. We are going to try to address that.\n  Also, if we are going to be able to work together in a cordial and \ncivil manner, it is going to be important we be honest with each other \nand fair and we notify each other when we are fixing to take action and \nwe not have surprises.\n  That is the way I intend to proceed. I am sure we will have some \nbumps along the road. The Senate is an island of tranquility in many \nrespects in this city. We have heavy responsibilities on which we need \nto act, and it is going to take give-and-take, cooperation, and I\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\nam absolutely committed to that approach. That will be the way I will \nproceed with regard to this 10 minutes and everything else that I try \nto do.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank both Senators. I am fully satisfied \nwith the colloquies that have resulted from my inquiry.\n  May I say to the distinguished majority leader that I do not believe \nwe had the 10 minutes for each leader back when I was the majority \nleader the first time in 1977. I think this practice grew up in that \nperiod or soon thereafter. But in any event, as I thought I said \nearlier, I have never known--I cannot remember a time in which such a \nprovocative situation might arise. I have never known that to happen. I \nhave never known any majority leader or minority leader to transgress \nupon the confidence of the membership in giving its acquiescence to the \nrequest. It is just that I thought there could be such a situation. I \nthought we ought to try to clarify it and thus prevent some future \nmisunderstanding. I am satisfied with what has been said.\n  While I have the floor, so that I will not impose upon the leaders \ntoo much, there was a second request made, and it was agreed to, and I \njust rise at this time to compliment the leaders on making this \nunanimous consent request and also on the progress that is being made \nand being discussed to which the majority leader has just referred, \nanent disorder in the Chamber.\n  In recent years, we have allowed too much gathering of staffs and too \nmany conversations to go on in the rear of the Chamber, and it does not \ndo the Senate credit. I can remember when we had no benches; we even \nhad no seats in the rear of the Chamber. The staff stood when they came \nto the floor. They stood or sat on the floor of the Chamber, which I \ndid not like. And it was for that reason that I had, when I was \nmajority whip, chairs brought into the Chamber and a large davenport so \nstaffs would at least have a place to sit.\n  And then, later, I had the gallery--this gallery here to the \nnortheast, I guess it is--assigned to staff. Then I had these handsome \nbenches and the bannister put back here so the staffs could be \nappropriately accommodated. I am glad that the request includes the \nwords, ``and that the Sergeant at Arms be instructed to rotate such \nstaff members as space allows.'' I want to thank the leaders for \nincluding that language.\n  I especially want to take the floor here so that the Sergeant at Arms \nand all Senators--the leaders need our cooperation as well--so that the \nSergeant at Arms and all Senators will be well aware that when more \nstaff members are in the Chamber than the seating accommodations will \nallow, then there is a special gallery for staffs, and I would hope \nthat the Sergeant at Arms would help us to keep the number of staff \npeople in the Chamber down. I assure both leaders they will have my \ncooperation. I try, as I see that there are too many staff people--and \nI have two or three staff persons--I try to send mine out so as to \nleave only one. I am very much heartened by the letters that I have \nreceived from both leaders in response to concerns such as this, that I \nhave expressed.\n  I foresee that we Senators are going to be even more proud of our \nleaders in the future than perhaps we have been at some times in the \npast. I see not only a willingness but a desire on the part of both \nleaders to have Members speak to them about matters that concern us. As \nI have noted, I followed through on that, and that has not been the end \nof it. Both leaders have written to me to let me know that they are \naware of a matter and that they are working on it. I thank both, and I \nthink it is to the credit of the two leaders, and certainly will \nredound to the credit of the Senate, if we can have better order in the \ncoming days.\n  I thank both leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank again the Senator from West Virginia for his \ncomments. I am pleased that he noted this unanimous-consent agreement. \nThe Sergeant at Arms is on the floor. We have discussed this matter, \nand we are undertaking procedures to set up this rotation of staff \nmembers. We are making sure that Senators are informed of that. We will \nremind Senators, probably on the 21st, of a number of these types of \nthings so that they will not be surprised, and call on Members on both \nsides for their cooperation and courtesy. In fact, at the concluding \npart of our unanimous consent request today I will make a few comments \nabout how we are going to try to reestablish some of the proper \nprocedures, respect for each other's needs as Senators, and call on our \nSenators to be aware of that and to assist us as we try to do that. So \nwe are not going to forget and, while we are not going to be \ndictatorial about it, we are going to try our very best to ask our \nSenators to recognize this is in the best interests of the institution \nand will allow us to do our work in a more efficient and effective way, \nI do believe.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the leader. We owe it to the Senate, we owe it to \nthe membership, we owe it to the people of the United States of America \nwith whom the power resides.\n  I thank the leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S8-4", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LEGISLATION ON AN APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, originally I had thought that at this point \nthe Senate would grant a unanimous consent that would in effect make \nnull and void the precedent set in March of 1995 with respect to \nlegislation on an appropriations bill. Having spoken with the \nDemocratic leader, we both feel, now, that the Senate would be better \nserved by conducting a rollcall vote that would overturn the precedent.\n  Needless to say, this vote would occur at the first opportunity the \nSenate has during the appropriations process this year, at least we \nthink that would be the appropriate time for it to occur. The \nDemocratic leader has indicated to me that he would support such an \naction in the early summer of this year as we begin the appropriations \nprocess, and I look forward to his cooperation at that time, when we \nhave the vote which would reinstate the point of order with respect to \nlegislation on an appropriations bill.\n  I believe, and I think the Democratic leader would agree, that the \nprocess has been abused in recent months. There seems to be a growing \nuse of this opportunity, and, in some of the discussions that we had at \nthe end of the session last year, I believe that point was made by the \nSenator from South Dakota and perhaps the Senator from West Virginia. I \nthink it was an unintentioned precedent that was set. I do not think it \nis in the best interests or the long-term interests of the Senate. I \nwould like for us to preserve rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the \nSenate. I think the Senate would be better served if we would do that, \npreserve that rule. So we will look for the opportunity, the best \nopportunity we can find, to consider changing back that precedent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The overturning of the Chair, back in March 1995, had \nfar-reaching consequences, as the majority leader has indicated. By \noverturning the Chair, the Senate no longer had the legislation on \nappropriations point of order to keep legislative riders from being \nadded to crucial appropriations bills. Many on this side of the aisle \nbelieve the point of order should be restored. However, we also believe \nthat this situation should be remedied in the same way that it was \nimposed on the Senate; that is, by rollcall vote. So I intend to work \nwith the majority leader to see if we can, by rollcall vote, restore \nthis point of order at some point in the early months of the 105th \nCongress.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S10-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10-S11]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nintroduction of Senate bills, concurrent, joint, and simple resolutions \nnot be in order prior to Tuesday, January 21.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. This now establishes Tuesday, January 21, as the first day \nin which Members may introduce legislation. I will inform my colleagues \nthat Members may make statements during the next day or two regarding \nany proposed legislation, however all Senators\n\n[[Page S11]]\n\nmust wait until January 21 to formally introduce such legislation.\n  I might note that we have been working very aggressively to get \norganized quickly. We agreed early on the committee ratios. I believe \nboth parties now have decided most of their committee membership. The \ncommittee chairmen will be elected by their respective committees \ntoday, ratified by our conference tomorrow. I assume the same thing \nwill occur or has occurred on the Democratic side. Hopefully, by \nThursday we will have available to the Senate the list of all the \ncommittee membership and we will be ready for business.\n  There are a number of committees that intend to start hearings this \nweek on some issues, as I understand it, like airbags; perhaps some \nearly hearings on confirmations of the President's nominations. Again, \nnext week I understand that there will certainly be hearings on the \nnominees that the President has submitted to the Senate. We are anxious \nto cooperate with the President, work expeditiously on these \nnominations from the Executive Calendar, and the day after \ninauguration, or certainly that week of the inauguration, we hope to \nhave some of these nominations ready for a vote of the full Senate. I \nbelieve the cooperation by the Democratic leader in this effort will \nallow us to concentrate on that. And then we will have our opportunity \nto introduce our first bills on the 21st, make our statements, and get \ngoing for business. So I appreciate your cooperation, Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader will yield for a moment to let me \nmake a comment, I fully share the views expressed by the leader with \nregard to the timeframe within which legislation will be considered and \nintroduced. We will be holding a conference tomorrow to talk in part \nabout the intentions of our caucus to introduce the first 10 bills, \nnumbered S. 11 through S. 20. But let me also emphasize how \nappreciative we are with regard to the early consideration of some of \nthe nominees by the administration. They have emphasized, on a number \nof occasions, their desire to have their people in place as quickly as \npossible. That requires, of course, early consideration and early \nconfirmation of many of these nominees. The distinguished majority \nleader again has reiterated his desire to do that, and I am \nappreciative of that and will work with him to accommodate that \nschedule.\n  So, I think we are doing the very best we can in meeting all of the \ndifferent demands that we have upon us, schedulewise, and I appreciate \nvery much the interest in moving ahead on many of these nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have had some discussion with the \nmajority and minority leaders on this question. I feel very strongly, \nand I think that an overwhelming majority of people in the country \nfeel, that there is no more important thing we can do than to pass a \nreform bill and get a lot of this big money out of politics.\n  In this last election cycle, we saw the worst of the worst on top of \na system that has not worked well for the people in the country. I feel \nlike we should not--go into recess and we ought to get started on this. \nI wonder if the majority leader can make a commitment that within the \nfirst 100 days, we will at least have such a bill on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will say to the distinguished Senator that it is my \nintent to urge early consideration of the issues that came to the \nforefront during the campaign and the election last year. I have asked \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee to be the only committee to take a \nlook at some of the alleged violations that occurred--perhaps some \nillegalities even, in terms of contributions during the campaign--to \nsee if there is anything there that will justify proceeding further. I \nam not prejudging that at all.\n  I also have had an early conversation with the chairman of the Rules \nCommittee and have asked him to have some early hearings--and these are \nnot intended to be dilatory at all--hearings to get into, seriously, \nwhat happened, what needs to be done, to see if we can find a way that \nwe can come to an agreement on a bill that can pass the Senate, one \nthat will not be filibustered by the Democrats or by the Republicans. \nClearly, we have some disagreements on what the solutions are, but I \nfear that if we try to put a specific date on it, it will make the \nlikelihood of our success less likely or more difficult.\n  I think that the Senate should proceed always with thought and \nthoroughness and try to see where we can come together. We can \nestablish right here right now what we can't agree on. The question is \nwhat can we agree on. So we are intent on working on that.\n  The various committees have some things they are going to have to \nwork on. The Rules Committee has an assignment right now that they are \ngoing to have to work on. I am going to urge Senator Warner not to let \nthat interfere with getting together in a bipartisan way to see if we \ncan come up with some agreement.\n  We have the confirmations which we will be trying to do. We have a \nlot of things coming to the forefront. I am hoping, for instance, that \nwe can take up and consider the so-called ISTEA bill, the highway bill, \nbefore the Easter recess. It is a reauthorization we have to do. It is \nvery important all across this country. I am not saying it is as \nimportant or more important than campaign finance reform. I am just \nsaying there is a lot of work we need to do.\n  On the 21st, it is my hope and desire, after notification of the \nDemocratic leader, to inform all Senators what the bills are that we \nhope to deal with before the Easter recess, perhaps on the floor. It \nwill not be all inclusive.\n  I will be happy to talk further with the Senator from Minnesota. We \nare not going to try to shove this aside. I don't think we can. There \nare too many questions raised by this election. There are too many \nquestions about how contributions are made, who makes them, how much \nthey can make. I don't think we have all the answers yet, though, and \nto say we are going to do it in a 100-day demarcation--I have not even \nhad a chance to look at the calendar and see what that means. It might \nbe during the middle of the period that we said we would be out for the \nEaster recess.\n  I have tried working with Senator Daschle to tell Members more this \nyear than has usually been the case what they can expect or anticipate \nin terms of being out. I would like, at least, to have us sit down and \nlook at the calendar and see what this means and how it affects other \nthings, such as budget negotiations, the importance of bringing it up \nbefore the Easter recess. The law requires we act before April 15 on \nthe budget resolution. Why don't we try to do it before April 15 and \ncomply with the law? In order to do that, and the way that time falls, \nthere is only 1 week after the Easter recess before the 15th.\n\n[[Page S12]]\n\n  I am hoping we will do--the House and Senate working with the \nadministration--the budget resolution before the Easter recess so we \ncan come back and get the final agreement on the conference report.\n  That is why I ask the Senator, if he will, to give us the opportunity \nto show our good faith to work seriously on this matter, but without \nany arbitrary deadline before we even have a chance to sit down and see \nwhat it means on the calendar.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, can I also make a comment? Let me, first, \ncompliment the distinguished Senator from Minnesota for his adamant \nendorsement of the need to move ahead on campaign finance reform. I \nshare his utter frustration and extraordinary concern for the current \nmethod with which we finance our campaigns. I share it to the degree \nthat I intend to offer, as the very first bill that I will introduce, \nin consultation, of course, with our conference tomorrow, S. 11, a \ncampaign finance reform bill built upon the remarkable work done by a \nprevious majority leader, Senator Byrd, years ago, as well as Senators \nFeingold, Kerry, and others who have played a key role in this debate \nin the past. I will do so with every expectation that we can succeed, \nat long last, to pass meaningful, comprehensive campaign finance reform \nthis year. And I feel as strongly as the Senator from Minnesota that \nthe legislation should be considered as early as possible. It is long \noverdue.\n  But, as the majority leader has indicated, some of that work is \nalready being done, and there are other issues that must also be \nconsidered on a timely basis. For example, I am concerned--and I \ndiscussed this again with the President as recently as yesterday--about \nthe need to accelerate consideration of the chemical weapons treaty, \nbecause if we are not able to complete our work on that particular \nmeasure prior to the first part of April, we will suffer extraordinary \ndiplomatic and legal consequences in the international community.\n  So not only do we have the budget, but we have the chemical weapons \ntreaty and a number of other issues that will have to be addressed. \nThat does not mean we cannot begin to work and work through all of the \nissues relating to campaign finance reform in a timely, meaningful and, \nhopefully, bipartisan fashion. We must do that, but we don't need \nimmediate floor time necessarily to do that. We do need a commitment on \nboth sides to begin working together to finally enact fair, meaningful \nreform.\n  The majority leader has given me that commitment in the discussions \nwe have had with regard to both the committees, as well as his \nindividual efforts, to come to some resolution on this matter. I am \nhopeful we can do that.\n  So, in working with the Senator from Minnesota, and certainly with \nthe majority leader and others, I believe we are off to a start that \nought to ensure some optimism with regard to our prospects for success \non campaign finance reform this year.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \nappreciate the discussions that I have had with the majority leader and \nminority leader. I was trying to get back to them as they were going \nthrough the resolutions.\n  I guess when I hear the majority leader and minority leader speak \nabout this and other business that we have to transact, while I \nabsolutely am convinced about their commitment, it just brings into \neven sharper focus for me the need for this body to make a commitment: \nthat we will by the end of 100 days have a bill on the floor of the \nSenate. We have been talking about this for a long, long time. I don't \nhave the experience some Senators do. I am just starting my second \nterm. But every single time this has come up, speeches have been made, \nand then we end up not passing a reform bill. I think nothing could be \nmore important than for us to make a commitment.\n  What about within the first 4 months as opposed to the first 3 \nmonths? Can the majority leader make a commitment that he will do \neverything possible to try to have a bill on the floor of the Senate \nwithin a 4-month period? That is reasonable, and that is all I am \nasking for.\n  I think the majority leader is committed to this. I want to say to my \nfriend, and he is a friend, that of course I am not judging what the \nspecific content will be. I am not requesting any commitment to a \nparticular content, but I am requesting a commitment that we go on \nrecord and--you know, if we had to have a vote on this, then I think it \nwould be a vote as to whether or not Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans, are serious about taking action within a 4-month period, \nwhich is very reasonable. I do not know how many votes there would be, \nbut I think that is what it is about. I want to be counted as someone \nwho is willing to make a commitment to this.\n  Would the majority leader be willing to make a commitment that \ncertainly with his considerable skill and ability he will, along with \nthe minority leader with his skill and ability, that the two of them \ntogether as leadership, will make a commitment that within the first 4 \nmonths they will do everything possible to take action and have the \ndebate that the people in the country are ready for and pass--and \npass--the piece of legislation? We do not have to say ``pass,'' but at \nleast bring a bill to the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just a bit of history, as I recall it. Of \ncourse, we have passed campaign finance reform bills in the past. I \nvoted for the one that is in law now. I believe, in more recent \nhistory, there have been occasions when maybe--I know the Senate passed \na bill one year. I think it wound up languishing in the House. And then \nthe reverse, I think, has happened. I really believe from my time in \nwatching the Senate that some time is your ally, giving things an \nopportunity to be carefully considered and percolate along a little \nbit.\n  Last year a lot of people talked about how we were able to get a lot \nof legislation passed at the end of the session. One of the reasons is \na lot of those bills had been in the mill for months, some of them 2 \nyears, some of them 10 years. But they finally were ready, and they, in \nmost instances, had broad support. So there is a history of our making \na run at it. We make a stand, we make a statement; we get nothing. Are \nwe interested in making a statement about our concern, or are we \ninterested in getting something done? I think the latter is the case.\n  When you talk about 4 months, for instance, are you talking about \nApril? Once again, if you are--January, February, March, April--you are \nnot talking about much difference from the first request. When you add \nagain, when you look at the budget issue, when you look at the \npotential for when we deal with the Chemical Weapons Treaty, if we do \ncome to that agreement, that understanding, I believe there is a \nsignificance to April 15 for that.\n  I just again implore my colleague from Minnesota not to try to set a \nspecific date. This is not going to be your last opportunity. This is \nonly your first opportunity. You will have an opportunity to witness \nour conduct and judge whether or not it is being seriously discussed. \nThere are a lot of people with a lot of different interests here that \nSenators have who have worked on it in the past, like Senator Feingold \nor Senator McCain and Senator McConnell, and others who feel more \nconcerned about it this year than they did even a year ago.\n  I have talked with a lot of Senators already and outside groups that \nare concerned in all kinds of ways about how we do this. We are not \nignoring it at all. You are working on it. We are working on it. We are \nalready making progress. You have a bill that perhaps is the same bill, \nperhaps with some modification, as the bill last year sponsored by \nSenators Feingold, McCain and others. But let us get started. Let us \nsee how we do. And the Senator can witness our advent.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I could just also respond to a couple \nthings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. First of all, let me say I have not had the opportunity \nto talk with Senator Feingold and Senator McCain and Senator John Kerry\n\n[[Page S13]]\n\nand others, including Senator Levin, who expressed a real interest in \nthis issue as to what timeframe they would propose.\n  I would like to seize on the phrase that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Minnesota used just a moment ago. That is ``make your best \neffort.'' He said, ``Will you make your best effort?'' And he suggested \na timeframe. I think I can say on behalf of both leaders--certainly for \nmyself--that we are going to make our best effort. He knows my resolve \nto get this effort accomplished in a successful way. I think the \ndistinguished majority leader has also expressed a determined interest \nin finding ways to do it.\n  We will make our best effort and we will do everything possible to \nbring this to the floor at the earliest possible time with the greatest \ndegree of expectation that we will succeed. It is my hope that we will \nsucceed in 100 days or 4 months or at some timeframe within the first \npart of this year. I wish we had succeeded in previous Congresses. And \nI have a very strong sense of urgency about reforming the system as \nsoon as possible so that we can restore some public faith in our \nelectoral system and get on with other pressing business. Still, I \nthink what is more important than the day we start floor consideration \nis the sincerity of the effort itself and a commitment to that effort \non the part of both sides. I think that you have heard that \ndemonstrated again this morning.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will not drag this on. I have some \nmixed feelings. I think I will have to object because, again, I have \ntremendous respect for both leaders, but when I hear language about \n``best effort,'' ``within as reasonable a time period as possible,'' it \njust represents really not any kind of specific commitment at all.\n  I will just say that those who have worked on the reform--and the \nSenator mentioned many; the Senator mentioned Republicans as well as \nDemocrats--every one of them has said, if we let this drag on, we are \ngoing to have more and more acrimony, given all sorts of hearings and \nwhatnot coming up, and we are going to make a huge mistake. We need to \nmake this a priority of this 105th Congress, and we need to focus on \nthis, and we need to get the job done. I think a 4-month period is more \nthan reasonable just to have a commitment from the leadership to make \nevery effort possible. I am willing to go with that language to have \nsuch a piece of legislation on the floor of the Senate, understanding \nthat this is the core issue.\n  I think really this is an issue that people are talking about more \nthan any other issue in the country right now. I do not think it is \nunreasonable. I thought 100 days, and I thought 4 months. I do not \nthink it would be unreasonable at all for me to make this request. I do \nnot know why the leadership would not be able to say we will make every \neffort possible to have this bill on the floor within the next 4 \nmonths. And if not, then I think I will object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before the objection is heard, I would like \nto make one additional point.\n  If the Senator objects, then we will have to put in a quorum and go \nwith another alternative, which would be to basically have to recess \nover until every 3 days and the House and the Senate then will have to \nmake arrangements to come in every third day, to call our staff to be \nhere, and to go through the costs of doing that. I just do not think \nthat is the way we want to begin the year, going through an exercise \nthat is not necessary, that does cost time and money, without \naccomplishing anything.\n  I again implore the Senator to think about what we have had to say, \nand I ask him not to object at this point on our opening day. This is \njust the kickoff. Let us not fumble on the first play and look at the \nalternative.\n  The alternative, if the Senator objects--we are not going to get a \nrecorded vote on it. We are going to go to another alternative, which \nwill lead to inconvenience and costs without any positive results. I \nhope the Senator will also factor that into his feelings. The Senator \nhas not, and I have not, allowed this to become acrimonious or \npartisan. I do not want it to be. But the Senator would leave us no \noption at this point on our first day but to consider another route.\n  So I remind the Senator one more time, too, that last year there were \nenough different times that I made some commitments to him that were \nnot necessarily well received on my side. But we kept our word. We got \nthe job done. I may not be able to do just that same sort of thing this \ntime. But I hope that the majority leader's assurances on opening day, \nbased on my relatively short time but the record that I have, would \nhave weight with the Senator from Minnesota. We are asking the Senator, \nboth of us, the leaders, to give us this opportunity to show our good \nintentions. Then if the Senator is not satisfied with it, come back \nagain.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I could also add, the majority leader \nhas referenced times when we have very willingly accommodated the \nSenator from Minnesota. I can recall on a number of occasions over the \nlast 24 months requests made by the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota that we have been able to accommodate to suit schedules and \nto suit other legislative needs. I will certainly look forward to \naccommodating his needs and requests during the 105th Congress.\n  I hope that Senators who have objections will notify me personally \nprior to the time they are going to come to the floor with indications \nof this kind. It is cumbersome and certainly has created difficulties \nfor Senators who are not here. So it is my hope, too, to accommodate \nSenators, to demonstrate again a willingness to work together, again, \nwith the clear understanding that I am every bit as committed as he has \nindicated he is to campaign finance reform. I also urge the Senator to \ncooperate and to work with us on this particular matter.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, finally, and so we can move forward, \njust one more time for the context, this is the core issue. That is why \nI come to the floor. I know other Senators feel the same. I do not lay \nany claim to more righteousness about it. This is a core issue.\n  People in the country have just absolutely lost their confidence in \nthis political process. I do not think they are real optimistic about \nour taking any action. In all due respect to the leadership, I have \nheard too many of my own colleagues talk about reform and then dismiss \nit, saying it is not going to really happen. I already hear the \ndiscussions of how people can raise money for the next cycle.\n  The only request I made of leadership today--and the wording really \nis, I think, very modest. It was just a commitment from the leadership. \nI started out 100 days, at least within the next 4 months, that the \nleadership would make a commitment to do everything possible to get a \nreform bill on the floor of the Senate. That is all I asked for.\n  Now, Mr. President, the majority leader said, well, the only \nalternative is to go into recess. That is not the only alternative. \nThat is not my alternative. We have a vote. We can have a vote on \nadjournment. I know what the vote will be. I am sure there will be an \noverwhelming vote for adjournment. But if there are only two people, \none, or three that say, ``No, we are ready to take on this reform and \nget to work,'' I am proud to be counted as the one or two or three. \nThis is not the only alternative.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I withhold for a moment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I was watching on television the \ndiscussion going on here. I just urge my colleague from Minnesota to \nlet us go ahead with the ordinary historical business of the Senate. He \nand I share the same zeal, dedication, and effort toward getting this \nissue done. I appreciate the comments of the majority leader and of the \ndistinguished Democrat leader.\n  I think at this point it would not be appropriate for us to begin the \nvery first day of the U.S. Senate, the first day of the new term, for \nus to begin on this note. I think we will have plenty of time to adopt \nthat strategy and tactic. I do not like for us to discomfort our \ncolleagues on this day of celebration for both new and reelected \nMembers. I think that the issue has to be addressed as quickly as \npossible. I believe that American public opinion will\n\n[[Page S14]]\n\ndemand that we move forward. I do not think there is any doubt about \nit.\n  I urge my friend from Minnesota to let the Senate move forward on \nthis day, this very important day, before we have to start calling \npeople back here and going into quorum calls and that kind of thing. \nThis is, if I may say in all due respect to my friend from Minnesota, \nnot appropriate on this day. I urge my friend from Minnesota allow the \nSenate to move forward, again, reemphasizing my commitment to him that \nwe will move forward in a bipartisan fashion on this compelling issue.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Could I ask my colleague from Arizona--I do not think \nit puts him on the spot--I have no question about his commitment or the \ncommitment of any number of other Senators. I find it puzzling that the \nonly thing I asked for today--because I do have a real fear this is \njust going to get put off and we are not going to take action--the only \nthing I asked for, and maybe my colleague did not hear this, was a \ncommitment from the leadership to do everything possible, I used that \nword, and I started with 100 days, within 4 months, and get a bill on \nthe floor. That is all I ask for.\n  I think it would be very important to get that kind of a leadership \ncommitment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I had suggested the absence of quorum. I \nthink we need to have the opportunity----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I join the distinguished Democratic leader \nin suggesting the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have listened to my three colleagues, \nand having been sworn in today I understand their point about the \noccasion. So what I want to do, in the spirit of the special day today, \nI withdraw my objection, but I want to go on record, I am going on \nrecord today that I am going to have the same amendment dealing with \nour recess in February if we do not get to work on this. We should not \nbe taking a recess in February if we are not going to take up this \npiece of legislation of reform as soon as possible, that we are \ndragging it out, and I can see what is going to happen.\n  So today I will not object, but I will come out with a similar \ninitiative, I say to my colleague from Arizona, and maybe we should be \nworking today and saying we should not be in recess in February.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Minnesota for his cooperation this afternoon. He feels very, very \nstrongly about this issue and has confirmed that again in a colloquy \nover the last half hour. I appreciate very much his resolve and intend \nto work with him very carefully and closely to see that we \nexpeditiously consider this very important legislation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, did the Chair rule that the unanimous-\nconsent request was approved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous-consent request has been \napproved.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 3) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                             S. Con.

Byrd for his years of public service, that \nthe clerk read the resolution, that upon its reading, it be agreed to \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 7\n\n       Whereas, the Honorable Robert C. Byrd has dutifully and \n     faithfully served the people of West Virginia since January \n     8, 1947;\n       Whereas, for 50 years, he had dedicated himself to \n     improving the lives and welfare of the people of West \n     Virginia and the United States,\n       Whereas, his 50-year commitment to public service has been \n     one of total dedication to serving the people of his beloved \n     state and to the highest ideals of public service,\n       Whereas, he has held more legislative offices than anyone \n     else in the history of his state, and is the longest serving \n     Senator in the history of his state: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the U.S. Senate congratulates the Honorable \n     Robert C. Byrd, the senior Senator from West Virginia, for \n     his 50 years of public service to the people of West Virginia \n     and to the United States of America.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to Senator Robert C. Byrd.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the resolution is agreed \nto.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 7) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to heartily endorse this resolution. \nI thank the people of West Virginia for electing Senator Robert C. Byrd \nto these many offices, both in West Virginia and here in the U.S. \nSenate. He is truly a monumental Senator in terms of importance and \nperspective in the history of the Senate. I sat here in my chair a \nmonth ago and listened to Senator Byrd speak to the new Senators about \nthis institution, about its history and the importance of it and the \nsignificance that it has played in the role of this country. It was \nextremely interesting and, also, in some respects, intimidating because \nhe made us aware of what an awesome responsibility we have here in the \nU.S. Senate. I enjoyed it thoroughly.\n  I appreciate his friendship. I have found that he is one that you can \ngo to for counsel and for advice. Even sometimes when he does not agree \nwith what you are trying to do, he will give you a straight answer as \nto what you could do under the rules. He has a lighter side you don't \nalways see here, but we know he has been seen playing a little fiddle \nand talking about Billy Byrd, his dog. He is quite a Senator. We \nappreciate so much his contribution to this institution. I am delighted \nthat we are doing this resolution recognizing his 50 years of \noutstanding service to West Virginia and the United States.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, tomorrow marks the momentous day in the \nlife and career of one of this Chamber's most esteemed and respected \nMembers. Fifty years ago, on January 8, 1947, Robert C. Byrd took his \nseat in the West Virginia State Legislature, thus beginning a \nremarkable half century of public service. I have quite an extensive \nstatement that I wish to make following the completion of our \nresolution and consideration. I must again congratulate our \ndistinguished Senator for a remarkable career. We saw another \ndemonstration of his intellect and his institutional memory and the \nremarkable contribution he makes to that just this afternoon as he \ntalked about the early days of this Senate and how the President pro \ntempore was selected and the length of time it took and the degree to \nwhich we followed procedure in ensuring that we notify both the \nPresident and the House of Representatives in proper order. It was a \nsmall yet very significant contribution to our dialog this morning and,\n\n[[Page S15]]\n\nagain, a reminder of what an invaluable and remarkable Senator Robert \nC. Byrd is.\n  I will have much more to say after we complete our work. I commend \nhim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the resolution is agreed \nto.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 7) was agreed to.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very, very proud to be a part of \nthis resolution and to thank Senator Robert C. Byrd on behalf of the \npeople of West Virginia certainly, but also, frankly, the people of the \nUnited States and the whole process of order, which is the way we \ngovern ourselves. I think extraordinary in history, he is the third \nSenator to be elected to seven 6-year terms--a remarkable \naccomplishment.\n  The Almanac of American Politics says that Robert C. Byrd is the kind \nof Senator that the Founding Fathers had in mind when they, in fact, \nwrote the Constitution about the way the Senate ought to be. That \nshould not come as a surprise to any of us who know him well.\n  We have heard so many times the fact of his being a truly self-made \nperson, something which his junior colleague could not claim in quite \nthe same fashion. But we know that he is the son of a coal miner, and \nwe know about the law degree while he was in the House of \nRepresentatives. What we have to keep emphasizing, though, is what he \nmeans not just to the State, not just to the country, but to this \ninstitution, because more than any other person that I have read about \nin history, or know about, he is the conscience of the Senate. When we \nhave a lack of civility, when we lose our sense of bipartisanship, when \nthere is anger on the floor of the Senate, when the process breaks \ndown, he grieves. He grieves not on behalf of himself, but on behalf of \nthis thing called ``governance,'' which is pretty fundamental for the \nfuture of our country. I think he worries about that. I know that he \nplaces the U.S. Senate as a particularly responsible body for what is \ngoing to happen to our future and how it will happen. Will it be done \nin a way that is bipartisan and civil--the business of civility in this \ngreatest deliberative body in the world?\n  I will more or less conclude on this. I really think of him in moral \nterms. From time to time, when I give speeches, I like to refer to when \nyou are really doing your best work, you are following an inner moral \ncompass. I think that I started talking about that after watching \nSenator Byrd, not only when I was Governor of West Virginia and before, \nbut also here in the U.S. Senate. He really operates out of a moral \ncompass. He does what he thinks is right. He has a very strict sense of \nthe discipline of what ought to happen in this body. Sometimes he \nlectures us on that, and sometimes people are briefly impatient with \nthat, but they always stand back because they know he is right. They \nknow he is right. They know he speaks for the U.S. Senate, which he \nreveres so much.\n  Let me close by saying that on this coming Saturday there is going to \nbe a statue inside the West Virginia Capitol, which is not really much \nsmaller than the one we stand in at the present moment. It is a statue \nof Senator Byrd. There is no other statue of any other political person \nin the West Virginia State Capitol. There will be a lot of people \nthere, and for good reason--because the relationship and the chemistry \nbetween Senator Byrd and the people of West Virginia is something that \nis profoundly moving and important and refreshing, frankly.\n  We honor him for serving for 50 years, which means he has been out \namongst the people all this time. He has never changed. The people of \nWest Virginia have really never changed. He is a man of values speaking \nto a people of values. It is interesting. As he begins to talk, you see \npeople fall silent. They realize they don't want to miss what Senator \nByrd might be saying because they know it is not going to be trivial or \npolitical, and it is going to be important. It is going to have to do \nwith fundamental values and the fundamental nature of the way this \ncountry ought to be and the way the State of West Virginia ought to be.\n  So I look forward to being with him this coming Saturday. I join with \nthe distinguished majority leader, the Democratic leader, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada in praising and being grateful to my \nsenior colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the two leaders \nallowing me to speak. I can say that it has been somewhat of an \ninconvenience for me to wait until the business of the body has been \ncompleted before we got to this matter. But the inconvenience to this \nSenator is so minor compared to the service that has been rendered in \nthis body to the people of West Virginia, and to this country, by the \nSenator from West Virginia, that it is hardly worth talking about.\n  I am happy to be here to talk about somebody for whom I have great \nfeelings. I have served in public office since 1964. My first public \noffice was 33 years ago. During that period of time I have had the good \nfortune to serve with great men and women, but I can honestly say I \nhave never served with the likes of Senator Robert C. Byrd.\n  As far as this Senator is concerned, he is a unique individual. I \nhope some day that Senator Byrd will complete what I understand he is \nworking on, and that is the story about his life. I know a little bit \nabout the life of Senator Byrd. I am an avid history fan, and every bit \nand piece I can find, and have found, about Senator Byrd I have tried \nto comprehend and understand.\n  With someone of this magnitude, we sometimes wonder how he arrived at \nthe point where he has such accolades pushed in his direction every \nday.\n  I know that his first election was an interesting election, one \nwhere, seated often, as I understand, in the West Virginia State \nlegislature were many, many people who were running for that office. \nSenator Byrd, being the person that he is, decided he needed to be a \nlittle bit different, to kind of stand out in the crowd, to be elected. \nSo he decided that he would be different from the rest. The people \nwould give long speeches telling why they should be elected to the \nState legislature. Senator Byrd would get their attention by playing a \ntune on his fiddle and singing a song. Senator Byrd was elected.\n  Early in his career he decided to run for the West Virginia State \nSenate. But, as happens in a lot of States, there are kingmakers \nsaying, ``You run for this, you don't run for this, this isn't the \nappropriate time to run.'' Someone who was a national figure thought \nthat there would be other people who would be better qualified to serve \nin the West Virginia State Legislature. The great John L. Lewis, \npresident of the Mine Workers, got word to Senator Byrd that he should \nnot run. Of course, we all know now Senator Byrd, and that was the \nwrong thing to say to this man from the hills of West Virginia. He took \non the leader of the Mine Workers, someone that literally brought the \ncountry to a standstill. But this man could not bring Robert Byrd to a \nstandstill. He ran and was elected.\n  Everyone knew that this man was close to the miners--may not have \nbeen close to labor, but he was close to the miners. And he was \nelected.\n  Well, his career is outstanding. I can truly say that one of the most \npleasant moments of my life was when I came to the Senate some 10 years \nago and was notified that I could be on the Appropriations Committee. \nThat, to me, was so memorable that I will never forget it. I have done \nmy best to serve on the Appropriations Committee in a manner that I \nthink is good for the State of Nevada, and hopefully good for the \ncountry. One person I look to as an example in that committee has been \nthe person who was chairman, and is now ranking member of that \ncommittee, Senator Robert C. Byrd.\n  I learned early on that the man carried in his pocket, as I now do, a \ncopy of the United States Constitution. He carries that Constitution \nwith him, not because he probably couldn't recite to the Presiding \nOfficer, and to this Senator, every word in the Constitution from \nmemory, if he chose to do so. But I think the reason he carries it \nthere, next to his heart, is because he believes the Constitution is as \nimportant as any document in this country.\n\n  We all know the rules that guide this body, and the person that knows \nthem better than anyone else in this body--and probably knows them \nbetter than anyone else in the history of this\n\n[[Page S16]]\n\nbody--is the Senator from West Virginia, who we are honoring today with \nthis resolution.\n  Mr. President, I had the good fortune to be a member of a delegation \nthat met in West Virginia with British Parliamentarians. We had the \nministers from Great Britain. We had other leaders. We met in West \nVirginia. After having been there, I understand some of the songs that \ncome out of West Virginia, such as, ``The West Virginia hills where I \nwas born, and all is beautiful there.''\n  What I am about to tell the Senate, and even though I was there, I \nfind hard to believe. We had some entertainment, some music--blue-grass \nmusic. It was exciting. They asked Senator Byrd, ``Tell us a song you \nwould like to hear.'' And he said, ``There are more pretty girls than \none.'' They played that song. It was a great song. I have heard it many \ntimes since.\n  Then he handed out notebooks to the Members of the Senate and to the \nParliamentarians. From memory, without a note, he proceeded to recite \nthe reign of the British monarchs, the date they served office, their \nnames, and what they did. That took about 40 minutes or so for him to \ndo, or maybe an hour. The British Parliamentarians were flabbergasted. \nThey had never heard anything like this in their lives. But, as happens \nin this body, there are many times that we hear things that we have not \nheard any time in our lives, except from the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  I could tell you about the remarks he made on the Senate floor about \nthe Roman Empire, about which a course at the University of Nevada at \nLas Vegas is now being taught, using the text of his lectures here on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, the people of West Virginia should know that whether \nhe was leading the debate on the Panama Canal treaty, or other \ninternational or domestic matters, that his No. 1 priority has always \nbeen the people of West Virginia. It has been a great example for all \nof us: to be involved in international and national affairs, but to \nnever lose sight of the fact that you are elected by the people from \nyour State and that the people in your State should have first \npriority. That is the most important lesson I have learned from the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  I express to the Senator, through the Presiding Officer, my \naffection, my admiration, and my respect, and I hope that, in some \nmanner, my public service to the people of the State of Nevada will be \nas well-served as the Senator from West Virginia has served the people \nof West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Plato thanked the gods for having been born \na man, and he thanked them for the good fortune of having been born a \nGreek. He thanked them for having permitted him to live in the age of \nSophocles.\n  Mr. President, I am very thankful for many things. I am thankful for \nthe respect of my colleagues. My colleagues upon more than one \noccasion--undoubtedly many of them--have been angered by things that I \nhave said. I am sure they have been frustrated with me from time to \ntime over the many years. But they have always been forgiving, \nunderstanding, and most considerate. And I thank them. I thank, of \ncourse, the Supreme Governor of the World for having let me live to \nserve for 50 years the people of West Virginia.\n  The psalmist tells us, ``the days of our years are threescore years \nand ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is \ntheir strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly \naway.'' I thank God for his mercy and his kindness and his love, for \nhaving let me live to serve the people of West Virginia 50 years.\n  I thank the people of West Virginia for having demonstrated the faith \nand confidence in me to reelect me these many times over a period of a \nhalf century.\n  Queen Mary I of England lost the port of Calais to the French. Mary \nserved from 1553 to 1558. She said, ``When I am dead and opened, you \nwill find `Calais' written on my heart.'' I say to the people of West \nVirginia, ``West Virginia'' will always be indelibly engraved with \nblood upon my heart until it returns to the dust.\n  I must thank a very understanding and forgiving and considerate \nwoman--my wife Erma--who has served with me these 50 years. I think \nthat our spouses sacrifice beyond what people generally know when we \nserve in this body. Come next May 29, we will have been married 60 \nyears. I had to have a forgiving and understanding and cooperative wife \nwho was as dedicated to the people of West Virginia as I, to have done \nit.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me thank my staff. I have always been \nblessed with a good staff. I was once told by the chief chaplain of \nGeneral Patch's army in World War II that a true mark of genius is to \nbe able to surround oneself with able, committed people. I have had \nthat kind of staff over these many years, a staff that likewise has \noverlooked my foibles, idiosyncrasies, and has been cooperative and \nkind and has helped me when I had to walk through the valley of \ndespair--at my grandson's death. They, too, have served the people of \nWest Virginia and the people of the Nation.\n  I apologize to the leaders for imposing on their valuable time. I \nknow how it works. They have other things to do, other demands are made \nupon them and other business is there to take care of, other errands to \nrun, and other services to perform, but always there is some straggling \nSenator who comes to the floor who wants to take some time and talk. \nBut I thank them, and I hope that over the years, whatever \ndisappointments I bring upon them, I can have the opportunity to make \namends and to support them in the good work that they do.\n  And so I thank all today for the privilege and the honor that have \nbeen bestowed upon me by the Senators on both sides of the aisle. I \nhave also been very fortunate in having had two good colleagues in \nthese 38 years. I had Senator Randolph to begin with and now I have \nSenator Rockefeller, who is a very fine colleague. I could not ask for \na better colleague than either of them. Senator Rockefeller has been \nespecially supportive and deferential and kind to me. And so I have \nmany things, Mr. President, for which to be grateful.\n  Harry Reid has impressed me in the years he has been in the Senate. \nAs a member of the Appropriations Committee, many times I have asked \nhim to chair subcommittee hearings when I could not be there to do so, \nand he has always done an excellent job.\n  He, too, is a Senate man. He is dedicated to the institution. I have \nhad many conversations with him. I feel highly privileged to have him \nas my friend.\n  Tennyson said, ``I am a part of all that I have met.'' How rich I am \nin that I am a part of Harry Reid and Jay Rockefeller and Tom Daschle \nand Trent Lott.\n  I thank both leaders again for their consideration in giving me this \ntime. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S14-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GRANTING FLOOR PRIVILEGES\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I am sure he will read them in the Record, Mr. President, \nand will have some comment later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S16-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17-S19]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is customary on this opening day of \nCongress to lay out the highlights of the legislative schedule ahead of \nus and discuss whatever procedural problems or changes might be in the \noffing.\n  First of all, I am not going to give today a finite list, or a list \nthat we will have on the agenda that we will try to complete before the \nEaster recess, but I will do that on the 21st. I do want to mention \nsome of the bills that I think have a high priority that we will be \ntaking up early on in this session.\n  It is no great secret that I would like to make the schedule of the \nSenate more predictable. I think that will help us all do a better job. \nOne of the things that I could not understand when I first came to the \nSenate was the inability to make any kind of plans as to when we would \nbegin; when would we end; could I get home for supper with my family; \nwould I be able to go back to my State and be with my constituents. The \nuncertainty is killing in many respects, and so I am going to work very \nhard as majority leader this year to try to give some greater degree of \npredictability. I will not always be able to do it, but I will work \nwith the minority leader as he leads the Democrats to try to make that \ninformation available as to when we will come in. We will try not to go \nlate every night.\n  We will try not to go late every night. In fact, my hope is we will \nfinish up at a very reasonable hour, hopefully 6 o'clock every week, \nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We may have to go late to some extent on \nThursday. We will need to be in on some Fridays and some Mondays, but I \nwill try my best, again cooperating with the Members of the other side \nof the aisle and their leadership, to make that information known to \nthe Members as early as possible so they can make some plans as to when \nthey can be with their families or be with their constituents.\n  As a first step in that effort, last month I provided the Democratic \nleader and to all the Members on the Republican side of the aisle and \nto the Democratic Members, a calendar outlining the recess periods for \nthe first session of the 105th Congress. I strongly intend to follow \nthat calendar. But, obviously, any Senator who tries to delay our \nsession or cause us problems can mess up those good intentions. But, \nbarring emergencies, there is no reason why the Senate should not be \nable to function with a high degree of predictability about the \ntimetable. That will require cooperation from our colleagues all \nthroughout the year, as we get ready to have the President's Day recess \nperiod, or as we go to the Easter period, or even later on in the year.\n  With that in mind, I want to mention, in a general way, several \nmatters I hope the Senate will be able to consider prior to the \nscheduled Easter recess. It is not inclusive, and it may not be that we \nwill be able to get to these issues. It will depend on conversations on \nboth sides of the aisle, communication with the leadership on both \nsides, meetings with the chairmen, and it will also depend on the \nability of committees to act. I will be more specific later on this \nmonth, as I indicated.\n  By early February, the President should have submitted to us a \ndetailed budget for fiscal year 1998. How that will take shape--and \nwhat degree of cooperation might be involved there--remains to be seen. \nBut, one way or the other, the Senate will have to consider a budget \nfor the year ahead. I hope that we will come to an agreement on \nbalanced budget over a period of years. It will take a lot of effort, \nbut a lot of progress, I believe, was made last year and the gap \nbetween the Congress and the President was closed perceptibly over \nthose past months there, the last months of 1995 and early 1996. We \nought to pick up where that ended and see if we cannot come to an \nagreement that would lead us to a balanced budget over a period of \nyears. Needless to say, that budget is going to be one that will be \nnegotiated between the parties in the House and the Senate, and with \nthe President.\n  Toward the same goal the Senate should, I believe, in due course, \nconsider, again, a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I \nknow there are those who do not agree with that here in the Senate and \nthey will certainly have ample opportunity to be heard and make their \ncase. But I have noticed that good intentions do not accomplish the \njob. Even a plan to get us to a balanced budget does not always get us \nthere, and we have not had a balanced budget now in some, I guess, 28 \nyears or so; 1969 was the last balanced budget. So it looks like it \nwill have been 30 years that we will have gone as a Federal Government \nwithout a balanced budget. I think the plan is not enough. I think that \nthe constitutional amendment will add a great deal of weight to that \ndesire and, in fact, require us to have a balanced budget.\n  The Senate will, also in due course, consider the numerous \nnominations in the executive branch as the President restructures his \nadministration for a second term. It is my intention to deal with those \nnominations expeditiously and fairly. I think the President is entitled \nto make his selections for Cabinet Secretaries and other administration \npositions and expect them to be considered early and in a fair manner \nby the Senate. We will do that. As I indicated earlier, we will begin \nhearings, either this week or certainly next week, and we hope to begin \nto have votes on those the week of January the 20th and 21st, right \nafter the inauguration. Some of them may have some difficulty, may take \nmore time, but, we are going to move forward as rapidly as we can.\n  On both sides of the aisle there is considerable interest in taking \nup some of the reauthorizations that come due this year. These should \nnot be diminished. They are very important. Certainly one of those is \nthe ISTEA or Inter-service Transportation Efficiency Act; that is the \nhighway bill. This legislation is as complicated as it is important. It \nwill not be partisan. It will not be regional. It will not even be \nphilosophical. It will vary from State to State. Sometimes you have \nStates right next to each other that have different views on how those \nfunds should be distributed between highways or mass transit, and what \nthe formula would be for distribution between the States. I think a lot \nof work needs to be done, but it is very important. Transportation and \ninfrastructure in America is essential to our economic growth and \ndevelopment, and the free movement of Americans all over this country. \nI hope we can get this done, out of committee and on the floor of the \nSenate and completed by the Easter recess. It will take an \nextraordinary degree of cooperation and consensus, but the only way you \nget that done is to get started.\n\n  Also, in the same area of transportation, there are a number of other \nproposals we need to consider such as the problems that we are finding \nwith airbags in passenger vehicles. Parents throughout America now are \nconcerned about the safety of their children in their cars. How do we \ngo as long as we have without realizing the danger that they impose? \nNow it seems like every week we hear of another incident where some \nchild was injured as a result of the airbag. There are, I presume, some \nsolutions. But we need to think about that and work on it.\n  We should also address the crisis in American education. I am a \nproduct of what I think was a good public education system in America. \nMy mother was a schoolteacher for 11 years. I worked for the University \nof Mississippi for 3 years, in their placement\n\n[[Page S18]]\n\nand financial aid office and in the alumni office. I worked with the \nstudent loan programs. I worked with the work-study program. I know the \nimportance of financial aid. I know the importance of good, quality \neducation.\n  But over the years, since the 1960's, as we spent more and more \nmoney, it seems that the quality of education has continued to go down. \nYou have children in high school who cannot read. You have children who \ndo not have discipline. You have children assaulting teachers. You have \ndrugs in junior high school. I am sure it is even in elementary school. \nThese are major concerns. We may not have the answers in Washington. I \nthink probably the answers really are at the local level. But we need \nto think about this problem and work with State officials and local \nofficials, administrators, teachers, parents, and children to see if we \ncannot find some ways to improve education, the accessibility of \neducation in America, the safety of education in America. We cannot \ntolerate violence and drugs in our public schools, so we need to focus \non this issue and we need to do it soon.\n  The Senate should affirm as a matter of principle that no child has \nto attend a school where he or she is in danger of assault or is \nexposed to narcotics. I therefore hope that we will bring legislation \nto the Senate soon that gives youngsters and their families the same \nchoice in education that more affluent families enjoy in America.\n  The Senate should also consider ways to give families the flexibility \nthey need to balance their responsibilities at home and on the job. \nEmployers and employees should be able to arrange comp time, flex time, \nand family-wage provisions without interference from Government. The \nPresident has indicated that he supports the flextime and the comp \ntime, at least the flextime, and I think we ought to find out exactly \nwhat we can do in terms that have flexibility for parents on the job, \nbut work with the employers and employees together to find these \nsolutions.\n  By the same token, employees should have the flexibility to work in \nconcert with management for their mutual benefit. They should not be \nlocked into an approach to labor relations that presumes conflict and \ndiscourages cooperation. So I hope we will be able to bring the TEAM \nAct to a vote in the near future.\n  Other legislative items that we might be able to work on during the \nnext 2 months should include reauthorization of IDEA, the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act. This legislation is a very difficult \nbalancing of conflicting interests. To his great credit, Senator Frist \ncame close to working it out last fall, but, frankly, the clock kind of \njust ran out and we could not complete the job. This time I am \nconfident that we will bring in more consideration of various views and \ncomplete this very important legislation.\n  In the area of criminal justice, the Senate should allow the death \npenalty for drug kingpins. There continue to be tremendous problems in \nthis area and this is one place where we can provide some additional \npenalties that will hopefully allow us to deal with the drugs that are \npushed upon our children.\n  For small businesses, we should permit the electronic filing of forms \nwith SBA and other Government agencies. This is the 20th century. It is \nalmost the next millennium. Let us get with modern technology. It saves \nmoney, it saves time, and it probably saves jobs, if we will move to \nthis opportunity for small businesses.\n  For adoptive families, we should make it easier and more secure for \nadoption to occur. Senator DeWine and others have been working along \nthose lines.\n  Finally, to fulfill a provision of the omnibus appropriations bill of \nlast September, the Senate will vote sometime during the month of \nFebruary on a Presidential recommendation concerning the AID's \npopulation program. This vote is locked in and required by law.\n  This is not--again I repeat--not an exclusive list. By the time the \nSenate settles down to legislative business on January 21st, it is \nlikely to be revised after I have had the benefit of the views of \nMembers on both sides of the aisle and the committee chairmen and \ncommittee leaders on both sides.\n  We might add other items or delete some I mentioned as being just too \ntime consuming as we try to deal, certainly, with the budget agreement \nand other issues that are going to be required by law or by their \nurgency, in terms of possible treaties, as well as confirmations.\n  Both the Democratic leader and I are hopeful this can begin a pattern \nof advance notification of recesses and floor agenda. But we have to \nstress that its successful implementation will require all Members to \nact in a cooperative and courteous manner with respect to the needs of \nall other Members.\n  Let me mention one case in point. Members should be aware there is a \n15-minute limitation with respect to rollcall votes. Past practice has \nallowed for an additional 5 minutes, so-called overtime, for Members \nwho are running late. However, the 5-minute overtime soon turns into 7 \nminutes, 8 minutes, 9 minutes, or even more. The entire Senate \nrepeatedly has been inconvenienced in that way.\n  We try to be reasonable: Senators don't hear the bells; sometimes \nthey get caught on the subway; sometimes the elevators are not \noperating; sometimes for very good and valid reasons they are out in \nthe city or across State lines and they are trying very hard to get \nback here, and we have had to use some judgment.\n  But, as we try to allow that latitude, it continues to grow and \nexpand, and the time to take a vote can easily run up to 30 minutes, \nand that inconveniences all the other Senators who are here ready to do \nbusiness and go on to the next amendment or perhaps the next vote.\n  So we are going to try very hard to stick with the 15-minute vote \nwith a 5-minute overtime. Once again, the leaders will have to be \nwilling sometimes to say, ``We have to cut this vote off.'' I have had \nto do that when it has involved Senators on this side of the aisle, as \nwell as the other side. I think maybe if we make it clear we mean \nbusiness a couple of times, Senators will be more inclined to come over \nand vote when the time begins and within the allotted time. But, again, \nwe will use discretion wherever it is really necessary.\n  I hope we can continue to provide all Senators advance information \nabout scheduling, especially such matters as evening sessions and \nMondays and Fridays. If we all are able to plan in advance, our work \nwill be better, I believe, because we will have certainty and will not \nbe as exhausted as we sometimes get when we go late into the night. Our \nconstituents will be better served, and our families will be much \nhappier as a result of it.\n  I look forward to the challenges we have before us in the Senate. I \nhad some people say when I was home in Mississippi, ``You must get \ntired thinking of getting back and getting to work.''\n  I said, ``Absolutely not.'' This is what it is all about. This is a \ngreat opportunity to try to make a contribution for the people you \nlove, your family, your community, your State, and your country. If we \napproach it that way, if we decide we are going to work together, hard \ngoing as it may be sometimes, to do what is right for our country, \nthere will be no limit to what we can accomplish.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished majority \nleader on the speech that he has made outlining what he hopes to \nachieve in a general way, without going into specifics, in the months \nand weeks and days ahead.\n  May I say, as one who has been majority leader, who has been minority \nleader, who has been President pro tempore, who has been a chairman of \na committee, who has been a Senator like all 100 Senators, that I am \nparticularly encouraged by these two leaders that we now have in the \nSenate.\n  I think that with respect to the minority leader, no one could be \nmore considerate of his colleagues, more thoughtful, more eager to \nreach out and to bring them in to hear what they have to say, to work \nwith them. No one is more eager to work with the majority leader than \nour current minority leader.\n  And may I say with respect to our current majority leader, I think we\n\n[[Page S19]]\n\nhave a leader who is interested in the Senate, who is interested in \nputting the Senate where it ought to be--first--and who is interested \nin improving the decorum in the Senate so that the people who view this \nSenate, through that all-seeing electronic eye, will see a truly \npremier upper House.\n  We have students, we have professors, we have young people in high \nschool, we have lawyers, State legislators, and people in all walks of \nlife watching the Senate daily when it is in session, and they expect \nto see the best.\n  I have been a member of the State legislature in West Virginia, in \nboth houses, but even in the State legislatures--and they are closest \nto the people--even there they will look to the U.S. Senate and to the \nother body across the way for inspiration.\n  It saddens me to see a Presiding Officer in this Senate reading \nmagazines or a newspaper or books when he is supposed to be presiding. \nMillions of people are watching, as well as visitors in the galleries, \nand I wonder if they go away thinking the Presiding Officer doesn't \nhave much interest in the body if he is not listening to what is being \nsaid. He should be aware and alert to what is going on and ready to \nprotect the rights of every Senator while debate is under way.\n  I think we have a majority leader now and a minority leader who are \ngoing to bring these things to the attention of the Members. We, all \n100 of us, owe these leaders our very best support when they are trying \nto do the right thing: Trying to make the Senate what the framers \nintended it to be.\n  I really am encouraged, because I think that Senator Lott is a man in \nthat mold. He is bright, he has an endearing personality, he has an art \nof persuasiveness that will win many battles. He is considerate, he is \npatient, and a leader has to have all of these attributes. I thank him \nfor all of these things.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I renew my great appreciation for the \nSenator from West Virginia, and I appreciate very much his remarks. I \nhope we can live up to his comments and expectations; we are going to \nwork very hard to do that. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I, too, would like, again, to express my \ngratitude to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for his kind \nremarks throughout the day, again most recently. I appreciate very much \nthe manner with which he has expressed himself. It is an honor for me \nto be complimented in public by the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, and he has done so generously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S17-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, let me first congratulate, again, all of \nour new colleagues and their families for this very momentous occasion. \nIt is one of the most thrilling things for me to watch new Senators \ncome down the aisle, accompanied by a colleague, to raise their right \nhand and to take the oath of office. I can recall so vividly my own \nexperience in that regard now twice. I know, having had that \nexperience, what a remarkable and what a memorable opportunity it is \nfor any woman or man.\n\n  Let me also again reiterate my gratitude to the majority leader for \nhis remarks and for the kindnesses that he has shown to me and to our \ncaucus as we have worked through the schedule, worked through the \ncommittees, worked through the many procedural matters that we had to \ndiscuss today. We begin the 105th Congress with renewed hope, with \noptimism, with good will.\n  There is much to do, and there is much need to do it together. We \nhave had many months of competitive political effort, and now it is \ntime to govern. Franklin Roosevelt once said, ``The future lies with \nthose wise political leaders who recognize that the great public is \ninterested more in government than in politics.'' Let us recognize that \nand seize the future. Let us summon the best in all of those around us \nas we call upon the best within ourselves to join in common purpose and \nin common cause. I have no doubt that our efforts here during the \ncourse of the 105th Congress will, by any standard, then be judged a \nsuccess.\n  Mr. President, I indicated when I introduced the resolution relating \nto Senator Byrd that I had a statement. I would like at this time to \nmake that statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S19-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19-S20]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ROBERT C. BYRD'S 50 YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, tomorrow, January 8, 1997, will mark a \nmomentous day in the life and career of one of this chamber's most \nesteemed and respected Members.\n  Fifty years ago, on January 8, 1947, before this Senator was born, \nRobert C. Byrd took his seat in the West Virginia State Legislature, \nthus beginning a remarkable half-century of public service.\n  On this golden anniversary of the beginning of a remarkable career, I \nwant to take a few minutes to call attention to this achievement, to \ncongratulate him for it, and to thank him for his service to the people \nof West Virginia and the United States.\n  Fifty years of public service. That is a long time. Perhaps I can \nillustrate.\n  It translates into two terms in the West Virginia House of Delegates, \none term in the West Virginia State Senate, three terms in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, and seven terms in the U.S. Senate.\n  Since Robert Byrd began serving the people of West Virginia, 10 \nPresidents have occupied the White House--that is nearly one-fourth of \nall Presidents in American history. Robert Byrd began serving the \npeople of West Virginia before 20 Members of this Chamber, including \nthis Member, were born. Before there was a CIA; before there was a \nMarshall plan; before the Korean war.\n  When Robert Byrd began his political career, Harry Truman had not yet \nupset Dewey or dismissed Gen. Douglas MacArthur. Senator Joe McCarthy \nhad not yet begun his infamous Red-baiting. Lyndon Johnson was still in \nthe House of Representatives, and he was being joined by John Kennedy \nand Richard Nixon, both of whom were taking their first congressional \nseats.\n  When Robert Byrd began his remarkable half-century career in public \nservice, it was 2 years before the Soviet Union had tested its first \natomic bomb, 10 years before the Soviet Union launched sputnik, and 12 \nyears before there were 50 States in our Union.\n  Five decades is indeed a long time, but it is not for longevity alone \nthat we recognize and applaud the senior Senator from West Virginia. We \nrecognize our esteemed and respected colleague for the quality as well \nas the quantity of his public service. His life-long commitment to \npublic service has been one of total dedication to serving the people \nof his beloved State and to the highest ideals of public service. And \nthe people of West Virginia have honored him for it.\n  In Robert Byrd's 50 years in public service, he has won every \nelection in which he has been a participant. In 1970, he received the \nlargest percentage of the total vote ever accorded a person running for \nthe Senate in a contested election in the State of West Virginia.\n  In 1976, he was the first person in West Virginia history to win a \nSenate seat without opposition in a general election. He has held more \nlegislative offices than anyone else in the history of his State. He is \none of only three U.S. Senators in history to be elected to seven 6-\nyear terms. He is the longest-serving Senator in the history of his \nState. And, on January 13, Senator Byrd will have served 38 years and \n10 days in the Senate, becoming the fourth-longest-serving Senator in \nU.S. history--behind Senators Hayden, Thurmond, and Stennis.\n  West Virginians are not only pleased with their man in Washington; \nthey are proud of him. They have honored him with nearly every honor \nthe State has to offer; this includes being selected as the West \nVirginian of the Year three different times--the only person ever \nselected more than once.\n\n[[Page S20]]\n\n  This Saturday, January 11, a 10-foot, 1,500-pound statue of Senator \nByrd will be unveiled and formally dedicated in his honor in the West \nVirginia State Capitol. No other person in the history of the State has \nhad such an honor bestowed upon him or her. The statue appropriately \ndepicts Senator Byrd holding the Constitution and pointing to the \nsection of the document that provides Congress with the power of the \npurse.\n  Of course, West Virginians are in the process of renaming the State \nafter him. Every town you go into, it seems you can find something \nnamed after Robert C. Byrd. His name is prominently displayed on \nhospitals, university buildings, roads, and bridges throughout the \nState. There is the Robert C. Byrd High School in Harrison County, and \nthe U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd Center for Legislative Studies at \nSheperd College, in beautiful Sheperdstown. There is the Robert C. Byrd \nCommunity Center in Pine Grove, the Robert C. Byrd Visitor Center in \nhistoric Harpers Ferry, and the much-needed Robert C. Byrd Cancer \nResearch Center.\n  Last year, the Governor of West Virginia, Gaston Caperton, called \nSenator Byrd ``West Virginia's most beloved son * * * truly a legend in \nhis own time.'' Truly he is, Mr. President, and Robert C. Byrd has \nbecome a legend in the U.S. Senate, as well.\n  More than two-thirds of his 50 years of public service has been in \nthis Chamber. The standards he has set here, the principles for which \nhe has stood, the service he has rendered to this Chamber and every \nmember in it, have all been in the best traditions of American \ngovernment. For this reason, the ``Almanac of American Politics'' could \nwrite that Robert Byrd ``may come closer to the kind of Senator the \nFounding Fathers had in mind than any other.''\n  He is the Senate's foremost historian--``the custodian of the \nSenate's ideals and values,'' as Senator Nunn has called him.\n  He has held more leadership positions in the U.S. Senate than any \nother Senator in history, and he has cast more votes than any other \nSenator in history.\n  He was the first man in the history of the Senate to hold the job of \nSenate majority leader, lose it, and then gain it back again. ``That \nfact,'' wrote Michael Barone, ``tells us something about the \ndetermination, the combination of hard work and ambition which have \npropelled this coal miner's son to the top ranks of the American \nCongress.''\n  I love that description, so I want to repeat it: ``the combination of \nhard work and ambition which have propelled this coal miner's son to \nthe top ranks of the American Congress.'' This is a remarkable \nstatement about a remarkable man. An orphan boy who was raised by a \ncoal miner in the hills of West Virginia, who once pumped gas at a \nfilling station and worked as a produce salesman to make a living, who \nworked as a meat cutter and a welder in the shipyards of Baltimore and \nTampa in order to feed his family, has risen to and succeeded at the \nvery top of our government.\n  His life, in the words of President Clinton, is a ``testament to the \nidea that public discourse and public life can be a thing of very high \nhonor.''\n  One of Senator Byrd's favorite quotes is Horace Greeley's observance \nthat:\n\n     Fame is a vapor;\n     Popularity an accident;\n     Riches take wing;\n     Those who cheer today may curse tomorrow;\n     Only one thing endures: character.\n\n  Mr. President, as Senate Democratic Leader, I salute the enduring \ncharacter of Robert C. Byrd while I congratulate him for 50 years of \noutstanding public service. And I thank the people of West Virginia for \ntheir wisdom in keeping him here with us.\n  Mr. President, I now yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I think it is important today as we \nsee a transference of power in Congress after duly-held elections that \nwe pause to support the people who are standing, as we speak, in a \nfrozen public square in Serbia, who are trying to have the same rights \nthat we enjoy today in America. I think we must stand with the people \nof Serbia who have for 8 weeks been standing in the freezing cold to \ndemand the results of their recent elections be implemented.\n  Mr. President, the world watches in awe at the display of popular \nsovereignty in the former Yugoslavian Republic of Serbia. In 8 weeks it \nhas built from a few thousand to over 400,000 people who have risen up \nin peaceful opposition to the regime of Slobodan Milosevic on whom the \nClinton administration has pinned part of its hopes in the Balkans.\n  We cannot help but admire the courage, the bravery, the commitment of \nthe young people and the young at heart who are standing up for \ndemocracy. They are trying to bring about change through moral suasion \nand the strength of their convictions. As they do that, they remind the \nworld that all governments everywhere borrow power from the people they \nserve, and the people can take that power back when they determine that \nthey must.\n  We have had many debates on this floor regarding the future in that \nmost unfortunate part of the world. Today, we have tens of thousands of \nAmericans on the ground in and around Bosnia to try to keep a tenuous \npeace, to keep the military factions apart that only recently were at \nwar.\n  We are in Bosnia at great cost. Our Balkans policy is confused. We \nhave spent $5 billion and the meter is still running. Our troops will \nbe on the ground for at least another year. At the same time, in \nneighboring Serbia, we are seeing the best example of peaceful self-\ndetermination. The people of Serbia are united on the principle of fair \nand democratic elections. The Milosevic regime is hanging on to an Old \nWorld order that will not remain. It will not remain because of the \nstrength of the people.\n  The United States should not stand idly by. The administration needed \nPresident Milosevic to reach the peace agreement in Dayton. So there \nhas been a tendency to turn a blind eye to his faults, his protection \nof war criminals, his antidemocratic actions. But it is clear the \npeople of Serbia are rising up and they are saying, ``No more.'' \nBecause the administration helped create this situation in the Balkans, \nI think we have a special responsibility to exercise our influence on \nPresident Milosevic to honor the will of the Serbian people.\n  Last month, representatives from the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe were invited to Serbia to investigate the \nelection crisis. They attempted in vain to persuade President Milosevic \nto accept the municipal election results in 14 of 19 of Serbia's \nlargest cities.\n  The people are protesting to send a clear message that their votes \nmatter and that no regime has the right to nullify the will of the \npeople, from whom all governments borrow power.\n  Mr. President, we pray that President Milosevic will accept the will \nof his people. We pray that this crisis will be resolved peacefully, \nand we pray that democracy will triumph in Serbia.\n  Mr. President, I am urging President Clinton today to speak out with \na clear, strong voice that the United States stands behind the Serbian \npeople and that the results of the free elections that were held should \nbe implemented. It is time for the peaceful demonstrators in Belgrade, \nin their fight for a self-determined nation and freedom, to prevail. I \nurge the President to use his influence with President Milosevic to \nstand down and let the results of those elections go forward.\n  Mr. President, we are beginning a new session of Congress. We had \nelections, and now we are implementing the will of the people. It has \nbeen thus for over 200 years in this country. Maybe some of us take \nthat right for granted--the right to vote and the right to know that \nour vote will be counted fairly.\n  Mr. President, it is the time for Americans to ask everyone in the\n\n[[Page S21]]\n\nworld to salute the people who are standing today, this very minute, \nfreezing in Republic Square in Belgrade, standing for the right to do \nwhat we have done in the last few hours in Congress, and that is have a \npeaceful transition of power after duly held elections.\n  Mr. President, the people of Serbia have spoken. It is time that all \nthe people in the world stand behind them so that their spoken word \nwill prevail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S20-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S21]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LOUISIANA CONTESTED ELECTION\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I have discussed with Majority Leader Lott the procedures \nhe proposed today with regard to the seating of Senator Landrieu and \nthe review of Mr. Jenkins' petition contesting the election of Senator \nLandrieu.\n  I agree with and fully support the actions taken by the majority \nleader. I would like to take a moment to explain the actions the Rules \nCommittee has taken thus far concerning this contest and those \nprocedures which we anticipate following in the future.\n  The Senate is the Constitutional judge of the qualifications of each \nSenator. Article I, section 5 of the U.S. Constitution, states that the \nSenate is the ``Judge of the Elections, Returns, and Qualifications of \nits own Members. . . .''\n  The Secretary of State of Louisiana has certified that Mary Landrieu \ndefeated Louis ``Woody'' Jenkins by 5,788 votes in the 1996 U.S. Senate \nrace, and this morning Senator Landrieu was sworn in ``without \nprejudice.'' This action is in accordance with the precedents of the \nSenate, which recognize that the Senate generally defers to the \ncertification of the State until the Senate has had the opportunity to \nreview such petitions and evidence as may be submitted by the \ncontestants or gathered by the committee.\n  On December 5, 1996, Mr. Jenkins exercised his right to file a \npetition of election contest with the Vice President of the United \nStates. That petition was referred to the Senate Committee on Rules and \nAdministration, chaired by myself with the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky Mr. Ford, serving as the ranking Democrat.\n  On December 18, 1996, Mr. Jenkins submitted an amended petition along \nwith considerable documents related to the allegations in his petition. \nThese allegations go to the heart of the integrity of the election \nprocess on November 5 in Louisiana, and Mr. Jenkins' steps, thus far, \nmerit thorough consideration by the Rules Committee.\n  In consultation with Committee members, and consistent with \nprecedent, Senator Ford and I engaged two attorneys to serve as outside \ncounsel for the Committee, and their letters of engagement are attached \nfor the record. Bill Canfield was selected by the Republicans, and Bob \nBauer was chosen by the Democrats. Their assignment is to review the \npetition and all documents submitted to the Committee relating to the \npetition and to advise the Committee as to whether the petition should \nbe dismissed or, if not, what further courses of action the Committee \nshould consider.\n  As a means to providing equity to both candidates, the committee \nadvised then Senator-elect Landrieu of her right to file material for \nconsideration, and a copy of the letter from the committee to her \ncounsel is attached for the record. Senator Landrieu's attorney has \nindicated that she will respond by January 17, 1997.\n  Mr. Jenkins will then be given time to examine any material submitted \nby Senator Landrieu and provide the committee with a surrebuttal. After \nreviewing all of the filings, our outside counsel will promptly provide \nthe committee with their respective opinions. I anticipate the two \ncounsel will have some areas of their opinions reflecting a concurrence \nof views and recommendations.\n  It is my intention to then hold a committee business meeting on \ncounsels' reports immediately thereafter and determine the next step in \nthis process. I am hopeful that we will be able to hold this meeting \nearly in February.\n  These procedures will allow and ensure a fair and equitable review of \nthe allegations. Senator Landrieu, Mr. Jenkins, and the citizens of \nLouisiana, as well as the entire country, expect and deserve no less.\n  The above outline of committee procedures, so far, parallels the \nactions of the Rules Committee in the Huffington-Feinstein contested \nelection in 1995.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S21-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S21-S23]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATOR BYRD'S ADDRESS TO NEW SENATORS--AND RETURNING SENATORS, TOO\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on December 3 as part of the orientation \nprogram for new Senators, our distinguished colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Robert C. Byrd, delivered an eloquent address in this \nchamber emphasizing the indispensable role of the Senate in American \ndemocracy.\n  Senator Byrd is well known as a scholar and historian of the Senate. \nI believe his address will be of interest and importance to all \nSenators as we begin the new session, and I ask unanimous consent that \nit be printed in the Record.\n\n   Remarks by U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd at the Orientation of New \n                       Senators, December 3, 1996\n\n       Good afternoon and welcome to the United States Senate \n     Chamber. You are presently occupying what I consider to be \n     ``hallowed ground.''\n       You will shortly join the ranks of a very select group of \n     individuals who have been honored with the title of United \n     States Senator since 1789 when the Senate first convened. The \n     creator willing, you will be here for at least six years.\n       Make no mistake about it, the office of United States \n     Senator is the highest political calling in the land. The \n     Senate can remove from office Presidents, members of the \n     Federal judiciary, and other Federal officials but only the \n     Senate itself can expel a Senator.\n       Let us listen for a moment to the words of James Madison on \n     the role of the Senate.\n       ``These [reasons for establishing the Senate] were first to \n     protect the people against their rulers: secondly to protect \n     the people against the transient impression into which they \n     themselves might be led. [through their representatives in \n     the lower house] A people deliberating in a temperate moment, \n     and with the experience of other nations before them, on the \n     plan of government most likely to secure their happiness, \n     would first be aware, that those charged with the public \n     happiness, might betray their trust. An obvious precaution \n     against this danger would be to divide the trust between \n     different bodies of men, who might watch and check each other \n     . . . . It would next occur to such a people, that they \n     themselves were liable to temporary errors, through want of \n     information as to their true interest, and that men chosen \n     for a short term, [House members], . . . might err from the \n     same cause. This reflection would naturally suggest that the \n     Government be so constituted, as that one of its branches \n     might have an opportunity of acquiring a competent knowledge \n     of the public interests. Another reflection equally becoming \n     a people on such an occasion, would be that they themselves, \n     as well as a numerous body of Representatives, were liable to \n     err also, from fickleness and passion. A necessary fence \n     against this danger would be to select a portion of \n     enlightened citizens, whose limited number, and firmness \n     might seasonably interpose against impetuous councils, . . . \n     .''\n       Ladies and gentlemen, you are shortly to become part of \n     that all important, ``necessary fence,'' which is the United \n     States Senate. Let me give you the words of Vice President \n     Aaron Burr upon his departure from the Senate in 1805. ``This \n     house,'' said he, ``is a sanctuary; a citadel of law, of \n     order, and of liberty; and it is here--it is here, in this \n     exalted refuge; here, if anywhere, will resistance be made to \n     the storms of political phrensy and the silent arts of \n     corruption; and if the Constitution be destined ever to \n     perish by the sacrilegious hand of the demagogue or the \n     usurper, which God avert, its expiring agonies will be \n     witnessed on this floor.'' Gladstone referred to the Senate \n     as ``that remarkable body--the most remarkable of all the \n     inventions of modern politics.''\n       This is a very large class of new Senators. There are \n     fifteen of you. It has been sixteen years since the Senate \n     welcomed a larger group of new members. Since 1980, the \n     average size class of new members has been approximately ten. \n     Your backgrounds vary. Some of you may have served in the \n     Executive Branch. Some may have been staffers here on the \n     Hill. Some of you have never held federal office before. Over \n     half of you have had some service in the House of \n     Representatives.\n       Let us clearly understand one thing. The Constitution's \n     Framers never intended for the Senate to function like the \n     House of Representatives. That fact is immediately apparent \n     when one considers the length of a Senate term and the \n     staggered nature of Senate terms. The Senate was intended to \n     be a continuing body. By subjecting only one-third of the \n     Senate's membership to reelection every two years, the \n     Constitution's framers ensured that two-thirds of the \n     membership would always carry over from one Congress to the \n     next to give the Senate an enduring stability.\n       The Senate and, therefore, Senators were intended to take \n     the long view and to be able\n\n[[Page S22]]\n\n     to resist, if need be, the passions of the often intemperate \n     House. Few, if any, upper chambers in the history of the \n     western world have possessed the Senate's absolute right to \n     unlimited debate and to amend or block legislation passed by \n     a lower House.\n       Looking back over a period of 208 years, it becomes obvious \n     that the Senate was intended to be significantly different \n     from the House in other ways as well. The Constitutional \n     Framers gave the Senate the unique executive powers of \n     providing advice and consent to presidential nominations and \n     to treaties, and the sole power to try and to remove \n     impeached officers of the government. In the case of \n     treaties, the Senate, with its longer terms, and its ability \n     to develop expertise through the device of being a continuing \n     body, has often performed invaluable service.\n       I have said that as long as the Senate retains the power to \n     amend and the power of unlimited debate, the liberties of the \n     people will remain secure.\n       The Senate was intended to be a forum for open and free \n     debate and for the protection of political minorities. I have \n     led the majority and I have led the minority, and I can tell \n     you that there is nothing that makes one fully appreciate the \n     Senate's special role as the protector of minority interests \n     like being in the minority. Since the Republican Party was \n     created in 1854, the Senate has changed hands 14 times, so \n     each party has had the opportunity to appreciate first-hand \n     the Senate's role as guardian of minority rights. But, almost \n     from its earliest years the Senate has insisted upon its \n     members' right to virtually unlimited debate.\n       When the Senate reluctantly adopted a cloture rule in 1917, \n     it made the closing of debate very difficult to achieve by \n     requiring a super majority and by permitting extended post-\n     cloture debate. This deference to minority views sharply \n     distinguishes the Senate from the majoritarian House of \n     Representatives. The Framers recognized that a minority can \n     be right and that a majority can be wrong. They recognized \n     that the Senate should be a true deliberative body--a forum \n     in which to slow the passions of the House, hold them up to \n     the light, examine them, and, thru informed debate, educate \n     the public. The Senate is the proverbial saucer intended to \n     cool the cup of coffee from the House. It is the one place in \n     the whole government where the minority is guaranteed a \n     public airing of its views. Woodrow Wilson observed that the \n     Senate's informing function was as important as its \n     legislating function, and now, with televised Senate debate, \n     its informing function plays an even larger and more critical \n     role in the life of our nation.\n       Many a mind has been changed by an impassioned plea from \n     the minority side. Important flaws in otherwise good \n     legislation have been detected by discerning minority members \n     engaged in thorough debate, and important compromise which \n     has worked to the great benefit of our nation has been forged \n     by an intransigent member determined to filibuster until his \n     views were accommodated or at least seriously considered.\n       The Senate is often soundly castigated for its \n     inefficiency, but in fact, it was never intended to be \n     efficient. Its purpose was and is to examine, consider, \n     protect, and to be a totally independent source of wisdom and \n     judgment on the actions of the lower house and on the \n     executive. As such, the Senate is the central pillar of our \n     Constitutional system. I hope that you, as new members will \n     study the Senate in its institutional context because that is \n     the best way to understand your personal role as a United \n     States Senator. Your responsibilities are heavy. Understand \n     them, live up to them, and strive to take the long view as \n     you exercise your duties. This will not always be easy.\n       The pressures on you will, at times, be enormous. You will \n     have to formulate policies, grapple with issues, serve the \n     constituents in your state, and cope with the media. A \n     Senator's attention today is fractured beyond belief. \n     Committee meetings, breaking news, fundraising, all of these \n     will demand your attention, not to mention personal and \n     family responsibilities. But, somehow, amidst all the noise \n     and confusion, you must find the time to reflect, to study, \n     to read, and, especially, to understand the absolutely \n     critically important institutional role of the Senate.\n       May I suggest that you start by carefully reading the \n     Constitution and the Federalist papers. In a few weeks, you \n     will stand on the platform behind me and take an oath to \n     support and defend the Constitution of the United States \n     against all enemies, foreign and domestic; to bear true faith \n     and allegiance to the same; and take this obligation freely, \n     without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and to \n     well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on \n     which you are about to enter: So help you God.''\n       Note especially the first 22 words, ``I do solemnly swear \n     that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United \n     States against all enemies foreign and domestic . . .''\n       In order to live up to that solemn oath, one must clearly \n     understand the deliberately established inherent tensions \n     between the 3 branches, commonly called the checks and \n     balances, and separation of powers which the framers so \n     carefully crafted. I carry a copy of the Constitution in my \n     shirt pocket. I have studied it carefully, read and reread \n     its articles, marveled at its genius, its beauty, its \n     symmetry, and its meticulous balance, and learned something \n     new each time that I partook of its timeless wisdom. Nothing \n     will help you to fully grasp the Senate's critical role in \n     the balance of powers like a thorough reading of the \n     Constitution and the Federalist papers.\n       Now I would like to turn for a moment to the human side of \n     the Senate, the relationship among Senators, and the way that \n     even that faced of service here is, to a degree, governed by \n     the constitution and the Senate's rules.\n       The requirement for super majority votes in approving \n     treaties, involving cloture, removing impeached federal \n     officers, and overriding vetoes, plus the need for unanimous \n     consent before the Senate can even proceed in many instances, \n     makes bipartisanship and comity necessary if members wish to \n     accomplish much of anything. Realize this. The campaign is \n     over. You are here to be a Senator. Not much happens in this \n     body without cooperation between the two parties.\n       In this now 208-year-old institution, the positions of \n     majority and minority leaders have existed for less than 80 \n     years. Although the positions have evolved significantly \n     within the past half century, still, the only really \n     substantive prerogative the leaders possess is the right of \n     first recognition before any other member of their respective \n     parties who might wish to speak on the Senate Floor.\n       Those of you who have served in the House will now have to \n     forget about such things as the Committee of the Whole, \n     closed rules, and germaneness, except when cloture has been \n     invoked, and become well acquainted with the workings of \n     unanimous consent agreements. Those of you who took the \n     trouble to learn Deschler's Procedure will now need to set \n     that aside and turn in earnest to Riddick's Senate Procedure.\n       Senators can lose the Floor for transgressing the rules. \n     Personal attacks on other members or other blatantly \n     injudicious comments are unacceptable in the Senate. Again to \n     encourage a cooling of passions, and to promote a calm \n     examination of substance, Senators address each other through \n     the Presiding Officer and in the third person. Civility is \n     essential here for pragmatic reasons as well as for public \n     consumption. It is difficult to project the image of a \n     statesmanlike, intelligent, public servant, attempting to \n     inform the public and examine issues, if one is behaving and \n     speaking in a manner more appropriate to a pool room brawl \n     than to United States Senate debate. You will also find that \n     overly zealous attacks on other members or on their states \n     are always extremely counterproductive, and that you will \n     usually be repaid in kind.\n       Let us strive for dignity. When you rise to speak on this \n     Senate Floor, you will be following in the tradition of such \n     men as Calhoun, Clay, and Webster. You will be standing in \n     the place of such Senators as Edmund Ross (KS) and Peter Van \n     Winkle (WEST VIRGINIA), 1868, who voted against their party \n     to save the institution of the presidency during the Andrew \n     Johnson impeachment trial.\n       Debate on the Senate Floor demands thought, careful \n     preparation and some familiarity with Senate Rules if we are \n     to engage in thoughtful and informed debate. Additionally, \n     informed debate helps the American people have a better \n     understanding of the complicated problems which besiege them \n     in their own lives. Simply put, the Senate cannot inform \n     American citizens without extensive debate on those very \n     issues.\n       We were not elected to raise money for our own reelections. \n     We were not elected to see how many press releases or TV \n     appearances we could stack up. We were not elected to set up \n     staff empires by serving on every committee in sight. We need \n     to concentrate,  focus, debate, inform, and, I hope, engage \n     the public, and thereby forge consensus and direction. \n     Once we engage each other and the public intellectually, \n     the tough choices will be easier.\n       I thank each of you for your time and attention and I \n     congratulate each of you on your selection to fill a seat in \n     this August body. Service in this body is a supreme honor. It \n     is also a burden and a serious responsibility. Members' lives \n     become open for inspection sand are used as examples for \n     other citizens to emulate. A Senator must really be much more \n     than hardworking, much more than conscientious, much more \n     than dutiful. A Senator must reach for noble qualities--\n     honor, total dedication, self-discipline, extreme \n     selflessness, exemplary patriotism, sober judgment, and \n     intellectual honesty. The Senate is more important than any \n     one or all of us--more important than I am; more important \n     than the majority and minority leaders; more important than \n     all 100 of us; more important than all of the 1,843 men and \n     women who have served in this body since 1789. Each of us has \n     a solemn responsibility to remember that, and to remember it \n     often.\n       Let me leave you with the words of the last paragraph of \n     Volume II, of The Senate: 1789-1989: ``Originally consisting \n     of only twenty-two members, the Senate had grown to a \n     membership of ninety-eight by the time I was sworn in as a \n     new senator in January 1959. After two hundred years, it is \n     still the anchor of the Republic, the morning and evening \n     star in the American constitutional constellation. It has had \n     its giants and its little men, its Websters and its Bilbos, \n     its Calhouns and its McCarthys. It has been the stage of high \n     drama, of comedy and of tragedy, and its players have been \n     the great and the near-great, those who think they are great, \n     and those who will never be great. It has weathered the \n     storms of adversity withstood the barbs of cynics and the \n     attacks of\n\n[[Page S23]]\n\n     critics, and provided stability and strength to the nation \n     during periods of civil strife and uncertainty, panics and \n     depressions. In war and in peace, it has been the sure refuge \n     and protector of the rights of the states and of a political \n     minority. And, today, the Senate still stands--the great \n     forum of constitutional American liberty!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S21-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S23]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LARRY PRESSLER\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

However, I do want to take a \nmoment to pay tribute to the gentleman he succeeded--a man of \nintegrity, of kindness, and of singular achievement--Senator Larry \nPressler.\n  I have known Larry Pressler throughout his entire 22 year career of \npublic service in the Congress, beginning with his first election to \nthe House of Representatives in 1974. Though a young man when he first \ntook the oath of Office, he already had distinguished himself in other \nfields--as student body president at the University of South Dakota, a \nRhodes Scholar, a U.S. Army Lieutenant in Vietnam, and a Harvard Law \nand Kennedy School graduate.\n  I knew then that the people of South Dakota had sent an exceptional \nhuman being. I didn't realize how right I was at the time. In 1978, he \nwas elected to the Senate--the first of several Vietnam veterans we are \nhonored to call our Senate colleagues. For 18 years--three terms in \noffice--he served the Senate, his State and his country ably and \nresponsibly.\n  All who know or have known Larry Pressler are keenly aware how much \nhe holds public service in high regard. He considers it his life's \ncalling, and he certainly responded well to the call. He knows that \neffective public service begins with public trust at home--the faith \nthat he chose to represent their views and interests in Washington will \ndo so with honor and integrity. Little did Larry know that not long \nafter he came to the Senate, that basic principle of public trust would \nbe put to the test. It would come in the form of FBI agents posing as \nArab sheiks who attempted to bribe Larry as part of their so-called \nABSCAM investigation. Larry strongly refused. His response drew \nnational acclaim. The Federal District Judge who presided over the \ntrial singled out Larry's action, stating that he ``acted as citizens \nhave a right to expect their elected representatives to act.''\n  That single act, perhaps more than any other, capsulized and defined \nthe values of Larry Pressler--the values he was brought up to practice \nfirst on his father's farm in Humboldt, SD, and the same values he \npracticed every day for 22 years in Congress. Just as important, his \naction during ABSCAM reminded all of us of that vital link between \neffective public service and sustained public trust.\n  Public trust was not just a core value Larry Pressler practiced in \nhis own life, but a basic principle he sought to instill in government \npractice. He worked overtime to be sure South Dakotans were treated \nfairly by the Federal Government, whether it was as routine as a timely \nSocial Security check, or as complex as environmental protection \nenforcement.\n  Larry was the first to oppose President Clinton's nomination of Zoe \nBaird because he sensed early on that her past actions damaged the \nlevel of public trust needed in our Nation's chief law enforcement \nofficer. He was right.\n  Larry has been a superb watchdog of Federal agencies that oversee air \nsafety because of his concern both for the safety and security of air \ntravelers, and the faith travelers place in these agencies and carriers \nto ensure their safety. He was right on the mark again.\n  Larry also has been an outspoken champion of our efforts to reform \nthe cancerous corruption and waste that has infected the United Nations \nto the point of near ineffectiveness. As a supporter of the United \nNations, Larry is concerned that continued United Nations mismanagement \nwould erode the public's support and trust in the world body. Some \npeople in the United Nations are listening. Indeed, largely because of \nthe persistence and diligence of our friend and former colleague from \nSouth Dakota, the United Nations today now has an inspector general to \ninvestigate waste, fraud and abuse, and is beginning to take seriously \nthis body's demands for real, concrete reform.\n\n  Persistence and diligence--that best describes the style of Larry \nPressler's approach to public service, and it has paid off for the \nState of South Dakota and the Nation. His last campaign slogan was \n``Fighting and Winning for South Dakota.'' That's a good example of \ntruth in advertising. Whether it was rail service or air service, wheat \nprices or cattle prices, Ellsworth Air Force Base in Rapid City or the \nEROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, Larry Pressler fought and won for \nSouth Dakota.\n  Internationally, Larry Pressler is known and respected for his \nefforts on nuclear nonproliferation, and human rights causes in China, \nCyprus, Armenia, Turkey, and Kosova. I'm sure there are many around the \nworld who will miss Larry Pressler's commitment to these and other \nimportant causes.\n  But perhaps Larry Pressler's greatest achievements as a Senator came \nin his last 2 years in office, when he served as chairman of the \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. Chairman Pressler \npresided over one of the most productive and bipartisan periods of \nlegislating by a single Senate committee perhaps in the history of this \nbody. At the end of the 104th Congress, I had the opportunity to detail \nthis extraordinary record of accomplishment. Chairman Pressler reported \n97 bills and resolutions out of the Commerce Committee--more than any \nother Senate Committee during the 140th Congress. Of those, 87 became \nlaw.\n  Of that 87, perhaps the most heralded was the Telecommunications Act \nof 1996, the most important economic growth legislation to become law \nin a decade. This piece of legislation was Larry Pressler's life for \nwell over a year.\n  It's fair to say that the Telecommunications Act would not be law \ntoday if not for Larry Pressler. It passed with extraordinary support \nbecause Larry Pressler took the time to work with virtually every \nMember of Congress--House and Senate--to see that their concerns were \naddressed. He demonstrated bipartisanship, fairness as well as \ntoughness, but perhaps most important are the two qualities I mentioned \nearlier--persistence and diligence.\n  Those qualities also were shared by Larry Pressler's staff. Indeed, \nboth his personal and committee staff deserve a tribute and our thanks \nas well. They were a great team. Many are from South Dakota. Many have \nserved with Larry Pressler for more than a decade. Several for as long \nas he was a Senator and a select few even worked for him in the House. \nLarry, one of our more regular participants at our weekly Senate Bible \nstudy, often joked that Abraham died leaning on his staff. Well, it's \nsafe to say Larry Pressler succeeded leaning on his staff. I know Larry \nPressler is very proud of all his dedicated staff. I also know that all \nthe staff are proud of Larry Pressler--proud to have worked with him \nand for the people of South Dakota.\n  They are not alone. All of us are proud to have worked with our \ndistinguished colleague from South Dakota. I say this not just as a \ncolleague, but as a dear friend. My wife, Tricia, and I have enjoyed \nthe countless times we have spent with Larry, his lovely wife, Harriet \nand their wonderful daughter, Laura. I am hopeful there will be many \nmore good times ahead.\n  F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote: ``Vitality shows in not only the \nability to persist but the ability to start over.'' I have seen the \nvitality of Larry Pressler as a persistent and dedicated public servant \nfor his state and nation. I am confident Larry will demonstrate that \nsame vitality as he starts a new, a private life that will bring \nprofessional success and personal satisfaction.\n  So today, Larry Pressler finds himself in a position all of us will \nbe placed in--a point where past service is subject not to the approval \nof voters but to the scrutiny of history. Mr. President, it is safe to \nsay history will treat Larry Pressler quite well, and will see him as \nwe do--as a model public servant. To paraphrase the words of Saint Paul \nknown and referred to often by my friend from South Dakota, Larry \nPressler stayed the course, fought the good fight and kept the faith.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S23-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S24]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S24]]\n\n\n\n                    APPOINTMENTS DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate seated Senator \nMary L. Landrieu without prejudice to the Senate's constitutional power \nto be the judge of the election of its Members. In so seating Senator \nLandrieu, the rights of any person or entity involved in the election \ncontest petition are also preserved.\n  As a practical matter, what this means is that Senator Landrieu has \nthe same rights and privileges as any other Senator with no limitation. \nHowever, her election has been contested and, as in other cases in \nrecent history, depending on the resolution of this dispute in the \nRules Committee, the Senate may ultimately be required to consider a \nreport from the Rules Committee or not once they find out the details \nof what transpired.\n  Senator Warner, the chairman of the Rules Committee, and Senator \nWendell Ford, ranking member, have met and discussed this matter. \nSenator Daschle and I have discussed it. They have retained counsel who \nare reviewing the material that is available, and at some point, once \nthey have had an opportunity to review that and hear from the \ninterested parties, namely Senator Landrieu and the candidate, Woody \nJenkins, then they will make a determination depending on the facts as \nto whether or not an investigation and subsequent action would be \nrequired by the Rules Committee.\n  The Senate may take any of several courses of action. It may dismiss \nthe petition at that time; it may declare the election to be set aside \nand call for a special election to fill the seat; or the Senate may \ndeclare the petitioner the winner of the election and replace the \nSenator already seated. Each one of those have been done at various \ntimes in the past.\n  But again, I think it is very important that we not prejudge \nanything. I do not think any Senator knows many of the details of what \nis involved. The committee of jurisdiction is working on it, and we \nshould allow them to proceed in a careful but thorough and bipartisan \nway.\n  Obviously, we are removed from making any determination today, and we \nshould be. We are just seeing that the allegations are being \ninvestigated and, as soon as possible, the Senate Rules Committee, \nthen, will make a formal decision on whether to go forward. It is my \nintention, and I know it is the intention of the Democratic leader and \nSenator Warner and Senator Ford, that the investigation will be \nthorough and fair, and that it will be handled expeditiously, and that \nit will be in accordance with all the rules that are established in the \npast with regard to what the Senate protocol is in these matters.\n  Not only should the investigation be fair, it should be conducted in \na manner that allows us to do the people's business. That is the \nprimary reason for seating Senator Landrieu without prejudice. We want \nto allow the Senate to proceed to its business with all 100 Senators \npresent, accounted for, and involved in the process, while we gather \nwhatever facts that are there and are available and need to be known. \nAt such time as the Rules Committee makes a recommendation of \ndisposition, the report is highly privileged and will then be subject \nto the Senate for consideration.\n  I think it is important that we apply the same fair principles to the \nconsideration of the Rules Committee report, should one be issued. \nUnder ordinary procedures, as with most business of the Senate, such a \nreport would be fully debatable and subject to the usual rules and \nfilibusters and cloture votes. However, I believe that the American \npeople, and particularly this institution, would be better served if we \nagree in advance that ample opportunity will be given to all Senators \nfor debate and consideration of any such Rules Committee report, but \nthat ultimately debate will draw to a close, the matter will be \ndecided, and we can move on to other business of our country that we \nhave been sent here to accomplish.\n  I know, in the case a few years ago, maybe it was in the 1970's, \nthere was a matter that was contested based, as I recall it, purely on \nthe closeness of the election. The Senate spent 6 months and over 40 \nvotes until it was finally resolved by setting aside the election, \ncalling for another election, and that occurred and Senator Durkin was \nelected. I hope we do not have anything like that occur this year. My \npresumption at the beginning is nothing of that kind. There may be no \nfurther action on this, other than what happened in the Feinstein \nmatter and in the Coverdell matter, but I would feel a need to clarify \nwhat the rules would be, or to identify what the rules will be as we \nproceed. I will, therefore, offer a unanimous-consent agreement which \nincorporates my desire to be fair to all parties but also to ensure \nthat the matter does not become mired in a lengthy or purely partisan \nsituation.\n  So, I ask unanimous consent that any resolution reported by the \nCommittee on Rules recommending a disposition of the matter of the \nLouisiana Senate election of 1996 be laid before the Senate for \nimmediate consideration following the request of the majority leader, \nafter notification of the minority leader.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that time for debate on such \nresolution be limited to not more than 30 hours, equally divided in the \nusual form, and that at the conclusion of that time the Senate proceed \nimmediately to a vote on the Rules Committee resolution, with no \namendments being in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished majority \nleader for the manner with which he has brought this matter to the \nfloor. We have had a number of opportunities to consult with regard to \nhis intention to make this unanimous-consent request. He has ably \noutlined the options available to the Rules Committee just now. He has \nalso indicated his desire to ensure that we expedite the consideration \nof the report of the Rules Committee at the appropriate time.\n  I share his confidence in the leadership of the Rules Committee. \nSenator Warner is a man of impeccable credibility, and Senator Ford has \nalso led that committee in a similar manner. I know that he and Senator \nWarner have talked about this matter already and I know that both of \nthem are determined to bring this matter to, not only a successful \nconclusion, but an objective consideration at the earliest possible \ndate.\n  There is no desire, let me emphasize, there is no desire to hinder \nthe progress of the Rules Committee or the Senate itself, as we \nexpeditiously consider the resolution and the ultimate seating of \nSenator Landrieu. As the distinguished majority leader has said, \nSenator Landrieu was seated today without prejudice, as were Senator \nCoverdell and Senator Feinstein in previous Congresses. So, it is with \nevery expectation that Senator Landrieu will continue to present \nherself to the Senate with all the credibility of any other Senator \nthat I am sure this matter will be resolved in a fair\n\n[[Page S25]]\n\nand expeditious manner at the appropriate time.\n  I am concerned, however, that this particular consent request would \nrequire that the minority give up the motion to proceed to the debate \nand the right to debate the resolution fully if we see some need to go \nbeyond the 30 hours. And it does not allow amendments. So, with every \nassurance to the majority leader that we intend to work with him in \nexpediting this matter in an objective and fair way, I will object this \nafternoon to the unanimous-consent request and pledge my support in \nworking with him to resolve this matter without the need for such an \nagreement today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The unanimous-consent \nrequest is not agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do want to say I appreciate the \ndistinguished Democratic leader's comments. I know he is sincere in \nthose and he knows that I will keep him informed of what is happening \nin the Rules Committee. It could be that the Rules Committee would come \nto the same conclusion that they did in the so-called Feinstein and the \nCoverdell matters. My only goal in asking this unanimous consent is \nthat, if it does go beyond that, that there be some way it be brought \nto a reasonable conclusion with ample time for Senators to be able to \nhave debate and discussion of the issues that are involved but without \nit being endlessly debated, or filibustered, if you will. But my hope \nis we can work through that. It may not even come to that, but I \nunderstand the Senator's position and I heard what he said and I am \nsatisfied that, if we do need to work out some arrangement as to how \nsomething would be considered in the future, we will find a way to come \nto an amicable agreement. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S24-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S25-S30]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Background\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA'' or \n     ``Act'') was enacted into law on January 23, 1995. In \n     general, the CAA applies the rights and protections of eleven \n     federal labor and employment law statutes to covered \n     employees and employing offices within the legislative \n     branch. Section 303 of the CAA directs that the Executive \n     Director of the Office of Compliance (''Office'') shall, \n     subject to the approval of the Board of Directors (``Board'') \n     of the Office, adopt rules governing the procedures for the \n     Office, and may amend those rules in the same manner. The \n     procedural rules currently in effect, approved by the Board \n     and adopted by the Executive Director, were published \n     December 22, 1995 in the Congressional Record (141 Cong. R. \n     S19239 (daily ed., Dec. 22, 1995)). Amendments to these \n     rules, approved by the Board and adopted by the Executive \n     Director, were published September 19, 1996 in the \n     Congressional Record (142 Cong. R. H10672 and S10980 (daily \n     ed., Sept. 19, 1996)). The proposed revisions and additions \n     that follow establish procedures for consideration of matters \n     arising under Parts B and C of title II of the CAA, which are \n     generally effective January 1, 1997.\n       A summary of the proposed amendments is set forth below in \n     Section II; the text of the provisions that are proposed to \n     be added or revised is found in Section III. The Executive \n     Director invites comment from interested persons on the \n     content of these proposed amendments to the procedural rules.\n\n       II. Summary of Proposed Amendments to the Procedural Rules\n\n       (A) Several revisions are proposed to provide for \n     consideration of matters arising under sections 210 and 215 \n     (Parts B and C of title II) of the CAA. For example, \n     technical changes in the procedural rules will be necessary \n     in order to provide for the exercise of various rights and \n     responsibilities under sections 210 and 215 of the Act by the \n     General Counsel, charging individuals and entities \n     responsible for correcting violations. These proposed \n     revisions are as follows:\n       Section 1.01 is proposed to be amended by inserting \n     references to Parts B and C of title II of the CAA in order \n     to clarify that the procedural rules now govern procedures \n     under those Parts of the Act.\n       Section 1.02(i) is proposed to be amended to redefine the \n     term ``party'' to include, as appropriate, a charging \n     individual or an entity alleged to be responsible for \n     correcting a violation.\n       Section 1.03(a)(3) is to be revised to provide for, as \n     appropriate, the filing of documents with the General \n     Counsel.\n       Section 1.04(d) is proposed to be amended to provide for \n     appropriate disclosure to the public of decisions under \n     section 210 of the CAA and to provide, in accordance with \n     section 416(f) of the CAA, that the Board may, at its \n     discretion, make public decisions which are not otherwise \n     required to be made public.\n       Section 1.05(a) is to be revised to allow for a charging \n     individual or party or an entity alleged to be responsible \n     for correcting a violation to designate a representative.\n       Sections 1.07(a), 5.04 and 7.12 are to be revised to make \n     clear that Section 416(c), relating to confidentiality \n     requirements, does not apply to proceedings under section 215 \n     of the Act, but does apply to the deliberations of hearing \n     officers and the Board under section 215.\n       Section 5.01(a)(2), (b)(2), (c)(2) and (d) is proposed to \n     be amended to allow for the filing of complaints alleging \n     violation of sections 210 and 215 of the CAA.\n       Section 7.07(f), relating to conduct of hearings, is to be \n     revised to provide that, if the representative of a charging \n     party or an entity alleged to be responsible for correcting a \n     violation has a conflict of interest, that representative may \n     be disqualified.\n       Section 8.03(a) relating to compliance with final decisions \n     is to be revised to implement sections 210 and 215 of the \n     CAA.\n       Section 8.04 ``Judicial Review'' is proposed to be revised \n     to state that the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Federal Circuit shall have jurisdiction, as appropriate, over \n     petitions under sections 210(d)(4) and 215(c)(5) of the Act.\n       (B) Proposed Subpart D of these regulations implements the \n     provisions of section 215(c) of the CAA, which sets forth the \n     procedures for inspections, citations, notices, and \n     notifications, hearings and review, variance procedures, and \n     compliance regarding enforcement of rights and protections of \n     the Occupational Safety and Health Act, as applied by the \n     CAA. Under section 215(c), any employing office or covered \n     employee may request the General Counsel to inspect and \n     investigate places of employment under the jurisdiction of \n     employing offices. A citation or notice may be issued by the \n     General Counsel to any employing office that is responsible \n     for correcting a violation of section 215, or that has failed \n     to correct a violation within the period permitted for \n     correction. A notification may be issued to any employing \n     office that has failed to correct a violation within the \n     permitted time. If a violation remains uncorrected, the \n     General Counsel may file a complaint against the employing \n     office with the Office, which is submitted to a hearing \n     officer for decision, with subsequent review by the Board. \n     Under section 215(c)(4), an employing office may apply to \n     the Board for a variance from an applicable health and \n     safety standard. In considering such application, the \n     Board shall exercise the authority of the Secretary of \n     Labor under sections 6(b) and 6(d) of the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Act of 1970 (``OSHAct'') to issue either \n     a temporary or permanent variance, if specified conditions \n     are met.\n       The Executive Director has modeled these proposed rules \n     under section 215(c), to the greatest extent practicable, on \n     the enforcement procedures set forth in the regulations\n\n[[Page S26]]\n\n     of the Secretary of Labor to implement comparable provisions \n     of the OSHAct (29 C.F.R., parts 1903 and 1905). The proposed \n     rules do not follow provisions of the Secretary's regulations \n     that are inapplicable, incompatible with the structure of the \n     Office of Compliance, and/or inconsistent with the express \n     statutory procedures of section 215(c) of the CAA. In \n     addition, the Secretary has identified some provisions of \n     Part 1903 as ``general enforcement policies rather than \n     substantive or procedural rules, [and thus] such policies may \n     be modified in specific circumstances where the Secretary or \n     his designee determines that an alternative course of action \n     would better serve the objectives of the Act.'' 29 CFR \n     Sec. 1903.1. These enforcement policies (such as the \n     Secretary's policy regarding employee rescue activities, 29 \n     C.F.R. Sec. 1903.14(f)) are not included in these rules. \n     Enforcement policies, if any, should be issued by the General \n     Counsel, to whom investigatory and enforcement authorities \n     are assigned under section 215.\n       The Board finds that the proposed rules govern ``procedures \n     of the Office.'' Thus, they may appropriately be issued under \n     section 303 of the CAA.\n\n          III. Text of proposed amendments to procedural rules\n\n     Sec. 1.01  Scope and Policy\n       These rules of the Office of Compliance govern the \n     procedures for consideration and resolution of alleged \n     violations of the laws made applicable under Parts A, B, C, \n     and D of title II of the Congressional Accountability Act of \n     1995. The rules include procedures for counseling, mediation, \n     and for electing between filing a complaint with the Office \n     of Compliance and filing a civil action in a district court \n     of the United States. The rules also address the procedures \n     for variances and compliance, investigation and enforcement \n     under Part C of title II and procedures for the conduct of \n     hearings held as a result of the filing of a complaint and \n     for appeals to the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance from Hearing Officer decisions, as well as other \n     matters of general applicability to the dispute resolution \n     process and to the operations of the Office of Compliance. It \n     is the policy of the Office that these rules shall be applied \n     with due regard to the rights of all parties and in a manner \n     that expedites the resolution of disputes.\n     Sec. 1.02(i)\n       (i) Party. The term ``party'' means: (1) an employee or \n     employing office in a proceeding under Part A of title II of \n     the Act; (2) a charging individual, an entity alleged to be \n     responsible for correcting a violation, or the General \n     Counsel in a proceeding under Part B of title II of the Act; \n     (3) an employee, employing office, or as appropriate, the \n     General Counsel in a proceeding under Part C of title II of \n     the Act; or (4) a labor organization, individual employing \n     office or employing activity, or, as appropriate, the General \n     Counsel in a proceeding under Part D of title II of the Act.\n     Sec. 1.03(a)(3)\n       (3) Faxing documents. Documents transmitted by FAX machine \n     will be deemed filed on the date received at the Office at \n     202-426-1913, or, in the case of any document to be filed or \n     submitted to the General Counsel, on the date received at the \n     Office of the General Counsel at 202-426-1663. A FAX filing \n     will be timely only if the document is received no later than \n     5:00 PM Eastern Time on the last day of the applicable filing \n     period. Any party using a FAX machine to file a document \n     bears the responsibility for ensuring both that the document \n     is timely and accurately transmitted and confirming that the \n     Office has received a facsimile of the document. The party or \n     individual filing the document may rely on its FAX status \n     report sheet to show that it filed the document in a timely \n     manner, provided that the status report indicates the date of \n     the FAX, the receiver's FAX number, the number of pages \n     included in the FAX, and that transmission was completed.\n     Sec. 1.04(d)\n       (d) Final decisions. Pursuant to section 416(f) of the Act, \n     a final decision entered by a Hearing Officer or by the Board \n     under section 405(g) or 406(e) of the Act, which is in favor \n     of the complaining covered employee, or in favor of the \n     charging party under section 210 of the Act, or reverses a \n     Hearing Officer's decision in favor of a complaining covered \n     employee or charging party, shall be made public, except as \n     otherwise ordered by the Board. The Board may make public \n     any other decision at its discretion.\n     Sec. 1.05(a)\n       (a) An employee, other charging individual or party, a \n     witness, a labor organization, an employing office, or an \n     entity alleged to be responsible for correcting a violation \n     wishing to be represented by another individual must file \n     with the Office a written notice of designation of \n     representative. The representative may be, but is not \n     required to be, an attorney.\n     Sec. 1.07(a)\n       (a) In General. Section 416(a) of the CAA provides that \n     counseling under section 402 shall be strictly confidential, \n     except that the Office and a covered employee may agree to \n     notify the employing office of the allegations. Section \n     416(b) provides that all mediation shall be strictly \n     confidential. Section 416(c) provides that all proceedings \n     and deliberations of hearing officers and the Board, \n     including any related records shall be confidential, except \n     for release of records necessary for judicial actions, access \n     by certain committees of Congress, and publication of certain \n     final decisions. Section 416(c) does not apply to proceedings \n     under section 215 of the Act, but does apply to the \n     deliberations of hearing officers and the Board under section \n     215. See also sections 1.06, 5.04 and 7.12 of these rules.\n\n     SUBPART D COMPLIANCE, INVESTIGATION, ENFORCEMENT AND VARIANCE \nPROCEDURES UNDER SECTION 215 OF THE CAA (OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH \n                              ACT OF 1970)\n\n                 Inspections, Citations, and Complaints\n\n     Sec.\n     4.01 Purpose and scope\n     4.02 Authority for inspection\n     4.03 Request for inspections by employees and employing \n         offices\n     4.04 Objection to inspection\n     4.05 Entry not a waiver\n     4.06 Advance notice of inspection\n     4.07 Conduct of inspections\n     4.08 Representatives of employing offices and employees\n     4.09 Consultation with employees\n     4.10 Inspection not warranted; informal review\n     4.11 Imminent danger\n     4.12 Citations\n     4.13 Posting of citations\n     4.14 Failure to correct a violation for which a citation has \n         been issued; notice of failure to correct violation; \n         complaint\n     4.15 Informal conferences\n\n Rules of Practice for Variances, Limitations, Variations, Tolerances, \n                             and Exemptions\n\n     4.20 Purpose and scope\n     4.21 Definitions\n     4.22 Effect of variances\n     4.23 Public notice of a granted variance, limitation, \n         variation, tolerance, or exemption\n     4.24 Form of documents\n     4.25 Applications for temporary variances and other relief\n     4.26 Applications for permanent variances and other relief\n     4.27 Modification or revocation of orders\n     4.28 Action on applications\n     4.29 Consolidation of proceedings\n     4.30 Consent findings and rules or orders\n     4.31 Order of proceedings and burden of proof\n\n\n                 Inspections, Citations and Complaints\n\n     Sec. 4.01  Purpose and scope.\n       The purpose of sections 4.01 through 4.15 of this subpart \n     is to prescribe rules and procedures for enforcement of the \n     inspection and citation provisions of section 215(c)(1) \n     through (3) of the CAA. For the purpose of sections 4.01 \n     through 4.15, references to the ``General Counsel'' include \n     any designee of the General Counsel.\n     Sec. 4.02  Authority for inspection.\n       Under section 215(c)(1) of the CAA, upon written request of \n     any employing office or covered employee, the General Counsel \n     is authorized to enter without delay and at reasonable times \n     any place of employment under the jurisdiction of an \n     employing office; to inspect and investigate during regular \n     working hours and at other reasonable times, and within \n     reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, any such place \n     of employment, and all pertinent conditions, structures, \n     machines, apparatus, devices, equipment and materials \n     therein; to question privately any employing office, \n     operator, agent or employee; and to review records required \n     by the CAA and regulations promulgated thereunder, and other \n     records which are directly related to the purpose of the \n     inspection.\n     Sec. 4.03  Requests for inspections by employees and covered \n         employing offices.\n       (a) By covered employees and representatives.\n       (1) Any covered employee or representative of covered \n     employees who believes that a violation of section 215 of the \n     CAA exists in any place of employment under the jurisdiction \n     of employing offices may request an inspection of such place \n     of employment by giving notice of the alleged violation to \n     the General Counsel. Any such notice shall be reduced to \n     writing, shall set forth with reasonable particularity the \n     grounds for the notice, and shall be signed by the \n     employee or the representative of the employees. A copy \n     shall be provided to the employing office or its agent by \n     the General Counsel or the General Counsel's designee no \n     later than at the time of inspection, except that, upon \n     the written request of the person giving such notice, his \n     or her name and the names of individual employees referred \n     to therein shall not appear in such copy or on any record \n     published, released, or made available by the General \n     Counsel.\n       (2) If upon receipt of such notification the General \n     Counsel's designee determines that the notice meets the \n     requirements set forth in subparagraph (1) of this section, \n     and that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the \n     alleged violation exists, he or she shall cause an inspection \n     to be made as soon as practicable, to determine if such \n     alleged violation exists. Inspections under this section \n     shall not be limited to matters referred to in the notice.\n       (3) Prior to or during any inspection of a place of \n     employment, any covered employee or representative of \n     employees may notify the General Counsel's designee, in \n     writing, of any violation of section 215 of the CAA which he \n     or she has reason to believe exists in such place of \n     employment. Any such notice shall comply with the \n     requirements of subparagraph (1) of this section.\n       (b) By employing offices. Upon written request of any \n     employing office, the General\n\n[[Page S27]]\n\n     Counsel or the General Counsel's designee shall inspect and \n     investigate places of employment under the jurisdiction of \n     employing offices under section 215(c)(1) of the CAA. Any \n     such requests shall be reduced to writing on a form available \n     from the Office.\n     Sec. 4.04  Objection to inspection.\n       Upon a refusal to permit the General Counsel's designee, in \n     exercise of his or her official duties, to enter without \n     delay and at reasonable times any place of employment or any \n     place therein, to inspect, to review records, or to question \n     any employing office, operator, agent, or employee, in \n     accordance with section 4.02 or to permit a representative of \n     employees to accompany the General Counsel's designee during \n     the physical inspection of any workplace in accordance with \n     section 4.07, the General Counsel's designee shall terminate \n     the inspection or confine the inspection to other areas, \n     conditions, structures, machines, apparatus, devices, \n     equipment, materials, records, or interviews concerning which \n     no objection is raised. The General Counsel's designee shall \n     endeavor to ascertain the reason for such refusal, and shall \n     immediately report the refusal and the reason therefor to the \n     General Counsel, who shall take appropriate action.\n     Sec. 4.05  Entry not a waiver.\n       Any permission to enter, inspect, review records, or \n     question any person, shall not imply or be conditioned upon a \n     waiver of any cause of action or citation under the CAA.\n     Sec. 4.06  Advance notice of inspections.\n       Advance notice of inspections may be given under \n     circumstances determined appropriate by the General Counsel.\n     Sec. 4.07  Conduct of inspections.\n       (a) Subject to the provisions of section 4.02, inspections \n     shall take place at such times and in such places of \n     employment as the General Counsel may direct. At the \n     beginning of an inspection, the General Counsel's designee \n     shall present his or her credentials to the operator of the \n     facility or the management employee in charge at the place of \n     employment to be inspected; explain the nature and purpose of \n     the inspection; and indicate generally the scope of the \n     inspection and the records specified in section 4.02 which he \n     or she wishes to review. However, such designation of records \n     shall not preclude access to additional records specified in \n     section 4.02.\n       (b) The General Counsel's designee shall have authority to \n     take environmental samples and to take or obtain photographs \n     related to the purpose of the inspection, employ other \n     reasonable investigative techniques, and question privately, \n     any employing office, operator, agent or employee of a \n     covered facility. As used herein, the term ``employ other \n     reasonable investigative techniques'' includes, but is not \n     limited to, the use of devices to measure employee exposures \n     and the attachment of personal sampling equipment such as \n     dosimeters, pumps, badges and other similar devices to \n     employees in order to monitor their exposures.\n       (c) The conduct of inspections shall be such as to preclude \n     unreasonable disruption of the operations of the employing \n     office.\n       (d) At the conclusion of an inspection, the General \n     Counsel's designee shall confer with the employing office or \n     its representative and informally advise it of any apparent \n     safety or health violations disclosed by the inspection. \n     During such conference, the employing office shall be \n     afforded an opportunity to bring to the attention of the \n     General Counsel's designee any pertinent information \n     regarding conditions in the workplace.\n       (e) Inspections shall be conducted in accordance with the \n     requirements of this subpart.\n     Sec. 4.08  Representatives of employing offices and \n         employees.\n       (a) The General Counsel's designee shall be in charge of \n     inspections and questioning of persons. A representative of \n     the employing office and a representative authorized by its \n     employees shall be given an opportunity to accompany the \n     General Counsel's designee during the physical inspection of \n     any workplace for the purpose of aiding such inspection. The \n     General Counsel's designee may permit additional employing \n     office representatives and additional representatives \n     authorized by employees to accompany the designee where he or \n     she determines that such additional representatives will \n     further aid the inspection. A different employing office and \n     employee representative may accompany the General Counsel's \n     designee during each different phase of an inspection if this \n     will not interfere with the conduct of the inspection.\n       (b) The General Counsel's designee shall have sole \n     authority to resolve all disputes as to who is the \n     representative authorized by the employing office and \n     employees for the purpose of this section. If there is no \n     authorized representative of employees, or if the General \n     Counsel's designee is unable to determine with reasonable \n     certainty who is such representative, he or she shall consult \n     with a reasonable number of employees concerning matters of \n     safety and health in the workplace.\n       (c) The representative(s) authorized by employees shall be \n     an employee(s) of the employing office. However, if in the \n     judgment of the General Counsel's designee, good cause has \n     been shown why accompaniment by a third party who is not an \n     employee of the employing office (such as an industrial \n     hygienist or a safety engineer) is reasonably necessary to \n     the conduct of an effective and thorough physical inspection \n     of the workplace, such third party may accompany the General \n     Counsel's designee during the inspection.\n       (d) The General Counsel's designee may deny the right of \n     accompaniment under this section to any person whose conduct \n     interferes with a fair and orderly inspection. With regard to \n     information classified by an agency of the U.S. Government in \n     the interest of national security, only persons authorized to \n     have access to such information may accompany the General \n     Counsel's designee in areas containing such information.\n     Sec. 4.09  Consultation with employees.\n       The General Counsel's designee may consult with employees \n     concerning matters of occupational safety and health to the \n     extent they deem necessary for the conduct of an effective \n     and thorough inspection. During the course of an inspection, \n     any employee shall be afforded an opportunity to bring any \n     violation of section 215 of the CAA which he or she has \n     reason to believe exists in the workplace to the attention of \n     the General Counsel's designee.\n     Sec. 4.10  Inspection not warranted; informal review.\n       (a) If the General Counsel's designee determines that an \n     inspection is not warranted because there are no reasonable \n     grounds to believe that a violation or danger exists with \n     respect to a notice of violation under section 4.03(a), he or \n     she shall notify the party giving the notice in writing of \n     such determination. Upon the request of the complaining party \n     or the employing office, the General Counsel, at his or her \n     discretion, may hold an informal conference in which the \n     complaining party and the employing office may present their \n     views orally and in writing. After considering all written \n     and oral views presented, the General Counsel may affirm, \n     modify, or reverse the designee's determination and furnish \n     the complaining party and the employing office with written \n     notification of this decision and the reasons therefor. The \n     decision of the General Counsel shall be final and not \n     reviewable.\n       (b) If the General Counsel's designee determines that an \n     inspection is not warranted because the requirements of \n     section 4.03(a)(1) have not been met, he or she shall notify \n     the complaining party in writing of such determination. Such \n     determination shall be without prejudice to the filing of a \n     new complaint meeting the requirements of section 4.03(a)(1).\n     Sec. 4.11  Citations.\n       (a) If, on the basis of the inspection, the General Counsel \n     believes that a violation of any requirement of section 215 \n     of the CAA, or of any standard, rule or order promulgated \n     pursuant to section 215 of the CAA, has occurred, he or she \n     shall issue a citation to the employing office responsible \n     for correction of the violation, as determined under section \n     1.106 of the Board's regulations implementing section 215 of \n     the CAA. A citation may be issued even though after being \n     informed of an alleged violation by the General Counsel, the \n     employing office immediately abates, or initiates steps to \n     abate, such alleged violation. Any citation shall be issued \n     with reasonable promptness after termination of the \n     inspection.\n       (b) Any citation shall describe with particularity the \n     nature of the alleged violation, including a reference to the \n     provision(s) of the CAA, standard, rule, regulation, or order \n     alleged to have been violated. Any citation shall also fix a \n     reasonable time or times for the abatement of the alleged \n     violation.\n       (c) If a citation is issued for a violation alleged in a \n     request for inspection under section 4.03(a)(1), or a \n     notification of violation under section 4.03(a)(3), a copy of \n     the citation shall also be sent to the employee or \n     representative of employees who made such request or \n     notification.\n       (d) After an inspection, if the General Counsel determines \n     that a citation is not warranted with respect to a danger or \n     violation alleged to exist in a request for inspection under \n     section 4.03(a)(1) or a notification of violation under \n     section 4.03(a)(3), the informal review procedures prescribed \n     in 4.15 shall be applicable. After considering all views \n     presented, the General Counsel shall affirm the previous \n     determination, order a reinspection, or issue a citation if \n     he or she believes that the inspection disclosed a violation. \n     The General Counsel shall furnish the party that submitted \n     the notice and the employing office with written notification \n     of the determination and the reasons therefor. The \n     determination of the General Counsel shall be final and not \n     reviewable.\n       (e) Every citation shall state that the issuance of a \n     citation does not constitute a finding that a violation of \n     section 215 has occurred.\n     Sec. 4.12  Imminent danger.\n       (a) Whenever and as soon as a designee of the General \n     Counsel concludes on the basis of an inspection that \n     conditions or practices exist in any place of employment \n     which could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious \n     physical harm immediately or before the imminence of such \n     danger can be eliminated through the enforcement procedures \n     otherwise provided for by section 215(c), he or she shall \n     inform the affected employees and employing offices of the \n     danger and that he or she is recommending the filing of a \n     petition to restrain such conditions or practices and for \n     other appropriate relief in accordance with section 13(a) of \n     the OSHAct, as applied by section 215(b) of the\n\n[[Page S28]]\n\n     CAA. Appropriate citations may be issued with respect to an \n     imminent danger even though, after being informed of such \n     danger by the General Counsel's designee, the employing \n     office immediately eliminates the imminence of the danger and \n     initiates steps to abate such danger.\n     Sec. 4.13  Posting of citations.\n       (a) Upon receipt of any citation under section 215 of the \n     CAA, the employing office shall immediately post such \n     citation, or a copy thereof, unedited, at or near each place \n     an alleged violation referred to in the citation occurred, \n     except as provided below. Where, because of the nature of the \n     employing office's operations, it is not practicable to post \n     the citation at or near each place of alleged violation, such \n     citation shall be posted, unedited, in a prominent place \n     where it will be readily observable by all affected \n     employees. For example, where employing offices are engaged \n     in activities which are physically dispersed, the citation \n     may be posted at the location to which employees report each \n     day. Where employees do not primarily work at or report to a \n     single location, the citation may be posted at the location \n     from which the employees operate to carry out their \n     activities. The employing office shall take steps to ensure \n     that the citation is not altered, defaced, or covered by \n     other material.\n       (b) Each citation, or a copy thereof, shall remain posted \n     until the violation has been abated, or for 3 working days, \n     whichever is later. The pendency of any proceedings regarding \n     the citation shall not affect its posting responsibility \n     under this section unless and until the Board issues a final \n     order vacating the citation.\n       (c) An employing office to whom a citation has been issued \n     may post a notice in the same location where such citation is \n     posted indicating that the citation is being contested before \n     the Board, and such notice may explain the reasons for such \n     contest. The employing office may also indicate that \n     specified steps have been taken to abate the violation.\n     Sec. 4.14  Failure to correct a violation for which a \n         citation has been issued; notice of failure to correct \n         violation; complaint.\n       (a) If the General Counsel determines that an employing \n     office has failed to correct an alleged violation for which a \n     citation has been issued within the period permitted for its \n     correction, he or she may issue a notification to the \n     employing office of such failure prior to filing a complaint \n     against the employing office under section 215(c)(3) of the \n     CAA. Such notification shall fix a reasonable time or times \n     for abatement of the alleged violation for which the citation \n     was issued and shall be posted in accordance with section \n     4.13 of these rules. Nothing in these rules shall require the \n     General Counsel to issue such a notification as a \n     prerequisite to filing a complaint under section 215(c)(3) of \n     the CAA.\n       (b) If after issuing a citation or notification, the \n     General Counsel believes that a violation has not been \n     corrected, the General Counsel may file a complaint with the \n     Office against the employing office named in the citation or \n     notification pursuant to section 215(c)(3) of the CAA. The \n     complaint shall be submitted to a Hearing Officer for \n     decision pursuant to subsections (b) through (h) of section \n     405, subject to review by the Board pursuant to section 406. \n     The procedures of sections 7.01 through 7.16 of these rules \n     govern complaint proceedings under this section.\n     Sec. 4.15  Informal conferences.\n       At the request of an affected employing office, employee, \n     or representative of employees, the General Counsel may hold \n     an informal conference for the purpose of discussing any \n     issues raised by an inspection, citation, or notice issued by \n     the General Counsel.

TDD: (202) 426-\n     1912.\n\n\n                       supplementary information\n\n                         Background and Summary\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA''), \n     P.L. 104-1, was enacted into law on January 23, 1995. 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301 et seq. In general, the CAA applies the \n     rights and protections of eleven federal labor and employment \n     statutes to covered employees and entities within the \n     legislative branch. Section 210(b) provides that the rights \n     and protections against discrimination in the provision of \n     public services and accommodations established by the \n     provisions of Titles II and III (sections 201 through 230, \n     302, 303, and 309) of the Americans With Disabilities Act of \n     1990, 42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and \n     12189 (``ADA'') shall apply to specified Legislative Branch \n     entities. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(b). Title II of the ADA \n     generally prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability \n     in the provision of services, programs, or activities by any \n     ``public entity.'' Section 210(b)(2) of the CAA defines the \n     term ``public entity'' for Title II purposes as any entity \n     listed above that provides public services, programs, or \n     activities. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(b)(2). Title III of the ADA \n     generally prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability \n     by public accommodations and requires places of public \n     accommodation and commercial facilities to be designed, \n     constructed, and altered in compliance with accessibility \n     standards.\n       Section 210(e) of the CAA requires the Board of Directors \n     of the Office of Compliance established under the CAA to \n     issue regulations implementing the section. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(e). Section 210(e) further states that such \n     regulations ``shall be the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     Transportation to implement the statutory provisions referred \n     to in subsection (b) except to the extent that the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown and stated together with the \n     regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.'' Id. Section 210(e) further \n     provides that the regulations shall include a method of \n     identifying, for purposes of this section and for different \n     categories of violations of subsection (b), the entity \n     responsible for correction of a particular violation. 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e).\n       On September 19, 1996, the Board published in the \n     Congressional Record a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (``NPR'') (142 Cong. Rec. S11019 (daily ed., Sept. 19, \n     1996)). In response to the NPR, the Board received three \n     written comments.\\1\\ After full consideration of the comments \n     received in response to the proposed regulations, the Board \n     has adopted and is submitting these regulations for approval \n     by the Congress.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ One of these commenters made no comments regarding any \n     specific portion of the proposed rules, except to encourage \n     the Board to ensure that the anti-retaliation provisions of \n     section 207 of the CAA are applied to the statutory and \n     regulatory proceedings under section 210. As the Board noted \n     in NPR, although section 207 provides a comprehensive \n     retaliation protection for employees (including applicants \n     and former employees who may invoke their rights under \n     section 210), section 207 does not apply to nonemployees who \n     may enjoy rights and protections against discrimination under \n     section 210.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n             I. Summary of Comments and Board's Final Rules\n\n            A. Request for additional rulemaking proceedings\n\n       One commenter requested that the Board withdraw its \n     proposed regulations and engage in what it termed \n     ``investigative rulemaking,'' which apparently is to include \n     discussions with involved parties regarding the nature and \n     scope of the regulations. This request was also made by the \n     commenter regarding the proposed rules under section 215, \n     which the Board has discussed in the preamble to the final \n     rules submitted concurrently with these rules. The Board \n     determines that further rulemaking proceedings are not \n     required for the reasons set forth in\n\n[[Page S31]]\n\n     the preamble to the final rules under section 215.\n\n B. Specific issues regarding adoption of the Attorney General's title \n                             II regulations\n\n       1. Self-evaluation, notice, and designation of responsible \n     employee and adoption of grievance provisions (sections \n     35.105, 35.106, and 35.107).--The Board proposed adoption of \n     the Attorney General's regulations at sections 35.106 through \n     35.107, which require covered entities to conduct a self-\n     evaluation of their facilities for compliance with disability \n     access requirements and to provide notice to individuals \n     informing them of their rights and protections under the ADA \n     and, for entities that employ 50 or more employees, to \n     maintain the self-evaluation on file and available for \n     inspection for three years, designate a responsible \n     employee, and adopt a grievance procedure.\n       One commenter argued that, although these sections are \n     within the scope of regulations to be adopted under section \n     210(e), there is ``good cause'' not to adopt the self-\n     evaluation requirements of section 35.105. In the commenter's \n     view, the General Counsel's inspections under section 210(f) \n     of the CAA serve the same purpose as the self-evaluation \n     under section 35.105 of the Attorney General's regulations. \n     The Board does not agree.\n       In order to modify an adopted regulation, the Board must \n     have good cause to believe that the modification would be \n     ``more effective'' for the implementation of the rights and \n     responsibilities under section 210. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331. That \n     a regulatory requirement may arguably serve the same purpose \n     as other statutory requirements of the CAA does not establish \n     that its elimination would result in a ``more effective'' \n     implementation of section 210 rights and protections.\n       On the contrary, requiring entities to conduct a self-\n     evaluation after January 1, 1997 (the effective date of \n     section 210), and requiring larger entities to retain a \n     record of that self-evaluation, would likely assist the \n     General Counsel in conducting the section 210(f) inspections \n     for the 105th Congress in an expeditious manner. Moreover, it \n     is conceivable that a self-evaluation might reveal \n     information or raise accessibility issues that may not arise \n     from the General Counsel's inspections. Thus, in the Board's \n     view, requiring entities to proactively investigate their \n     facilities and activities for compliance, rather than placing \n     sole reliance on the General Counsel's inspections, would \n     enhance overall compliance with section 210. Because there is \n     no ``good cause'' to modify section 35.105, the Board adopts \n     it, as proposed in the NPR.\n       2. Employment discrimination provisions (section 35.140).--\n     The Board proposed adoption of the employment discrimination \n     provisions of section 35.140 as part of its regulations under \n     section 210(e) of the CAA. But the Board also proposed to add \n     a statement that, pursuant to section 210(c) of the CAA, \n     section 201 provided the exclusive remedy for any such act of \n     employment discrimination.\n       Two commenters recommended that the Board not adopt section \n     35.140. One commenter argued that section 35.140 implements \n     title I of the ADA (which is not incorporated into section \n     210 of the CAA). The two commenters also argued that the \n     Board's adoption of section 35.140 might be misinterpreted as \n     an adoption of the ADA regulations of the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission (``EEOC'') and, therefore, constitute \n     improper executive branch enforcement of the CAA.\n       The Board has carefully considered these comments and, \n     after doing so, has determined that adoption of section \n     35.140, as proposed, is appropriate. Contrary to the \n     commenter's statement, section 35.140 was promulgated by the \n     Attorney General to implement title II of the ADA, which the \n     Attorney General has interpreted to apply to all activities \n     of a public entity, including employment. See 56 Fed. Reg. at \n     35707 (preamble to final rule regarding part 35). \n     Accordingly, since section 35.140 implements a provision of \n     title II of the ADA that is made applicable to covered \n     entities under section 210(b) of the CAA, it is within the \n     scope of Board rulemaking authority and mandate under section \n     210(e) of the CAA.\n       The EEOC's ADA regulations referenced in section 35.140 are \n     effective only insofar as such regulations are relevant to a \n     covered employee's claim under title II of the ADA, as \n     applied by section 210. By adopting section 35.140, the Board \n     does not intend to establish rights or provide substantive \n     legal rules applicable to any claim under title I of the ADA, \n     as applied by section 201 of the ADA; however, the Board \n     recognizes that this distinction between titles I and II of \n     the ADA may, as a practical matter, be blurred since both \n     types of claims might conceivably be brought in a single \n     employment discrimination case under section 201 of the CAA. \n     Moreover, adoption of section 35.106 would not constitute \n     executive branch enforcement since any claim (and the \n     resulting interpretation of the law thereof) would be in a \n     proceeding under section 201 of the CAA before the hearing \n     officer of the Office and/or before the Board.\n       Accordingly, section 35.106 will be included within the \n     Board's final regulations.\n       3. Substitution of the terms ``disability'' for \n     ``handicaps'' and ``TTY's'' for ``TDD's'' (sections 35.150, \n     and sections 35.104 and 35.161).--The Board will substitute \n     the term ``disability'' for ``handicap'' in section \n     35.150(b)(2)(ii) of the regulations, as recommended by a \n     commenter.\n       In sections 35.104 and 35.161 and elsewhere in the proposed \n     regulations, the Board substituted the term ``text \n     telephones'' (``TTY's'') for ``telecommunication devices for \n     the deaf'' (``TDD's''), which was used in the text of the \n     regulations. The Board will use the terms used by the \n     Attorney General in the regulations, as recommended by one \n     commenter.\n       4. Subpart F (compliance procedures).--In the NPR, the \n     Board determined that Subpart F, which sets forth \n     administrative enforcement procedures under title II of the \n     ADA, implements provisions of the ADA which are applied by \n     section 210(b) of the CAA and, therefore, is within the \n     Board's rulemaking authority under section 210(e)(2). The \n     Board expressed its intention to adopt Subpart F as \n     regulations under section 210(e), but also to incorporate \n     those provisions into the Office's procedural rules, with \n     appropriate modification to conform to section 210 and \n     preexisting provisions of the Office's procedural rules.\n       Two commenters have requested that the provisions of \n     Subpart F, with the Board's intended modifications to conform \n     to the statute, be included within the Board's regulations \n     herein so that the text of those regulations may be \n     considered and approved by the Congress. As the Board \n     determined in the NPR, Subpart F is within the scope of \n     rulemaking under section 210(e). Moreover, the provisions of \n     Subpart F apply only to claims under section 210 of the CAA \n     and are in no way duplicative of other procedures already \n     adopted under section 303 of the CAA. Accordingly, the final \n     regulations include Subpart F, with appropriate modification \n     to conform to the statutory procedures of section 210(e). The \n     Board will renumber Subpart F as new Part 2 of the final \n     regulations to make clear that such procedures govern \n     proceedings under section 210, including those brought under \n     title II or title III. There is ``good cause'' to have one \n     set of procedures governing claims under section 210.\n\n     C. Specific issues regarding the Attorney General's title III \n                              regulations\n\n       1. Section 36.104 (definitions).--One commenter recommended \n     that the definition of ``place of public accommodation'' in \n     proposed section 36.104, which lists the kinds of facilities \n     or activities that may meet the definition, delete references \n     to terms such as ``inn,'' ``hotel,'' ``motel,'' ``motion \n     picture house,'' etc., since such facilities do not exist \n     within the Legislative Branch. But the definition of ``place \n     of public accommodation'' contained in section 36.104 tracks \n     the statutory language of section 301(7) of the ADA. The \n     terms used in section 36.104 are merely representative \n     examples of the types of facilities that fall within the 12 \n     categories of ``places of public accommodation'' in the \n     statute. See 56 Fed. Reg. at 7458 (preamble to Attorney \n     General's title III regulations). The Board finds no basis \n     for concluding that deletion of these references would be \n     ``more effective'' for the implementation of title II to \n     covered entities. Accordingly, the Board will not alter this \n     definition.\n       2. Section 36.207 (places of public accommodation in \n     private residences).--The Board proposed adoption of section \n     36.207 of the Attorney General's title III regulations, which \n     deal with the situation where all or part of a residence may \n     be used as a place of public accommodation. One commenter \n     requested that the Board exempt House Members' residences \n     from this regulation because, in the commenter's view, it \n     would be unnecessary and burdensome for a Member, potentially \n     in office for only two years, to be required to incur large \n     financial expenses in making modifications to his/her home to \n     comply with section 210.\n       The commenter's concern is apparently based on the \n     erroneous assumption that compliance with section 210 would, \n     in all cases, require a Member using his/her residence as a \n     District Office to make expensive and extensive physical \n     alterations in the residence to meet the law's requirements. \n     On the contrary, as the General Counsel made clear in his \n     Report to the Congress on compliance with section 210, \n     ``[a]lthough it is sometimes the case that accessibility \n     requires barrier removal as the only effective option, most \n     covered entities can meet ADA requirements by modifying the \n     way their programs are operated to ensure that individuals \n     with disabilities may have access to them.'' General \n     Counsel's Report at p. 5. Moreover, to the Board's knowledge, \n     no Member is required to use his/her residence as a location \n     for the Member's public activity. Thus, one option for that \n     Member would be to locate his/her public activity (the \n     District Office, constituent meetings, public gatherings, \n     etc.) in a separate office or other appropriate facility. \n     Still other compliance options in this context (including \n     technical assistance to meet accessibility standards) may be \n     acceptable to the General Counsel, who has enforcement \n     authority regarding compliance under section 210.\n       In any event, the Board may not entertain a request to \n     exempt any entity by regulation from the coverage of the CAA, \n     in whole or in part, without statutory authorization. Nothing \n     in section 210, the provisions of the ADA applied thereunder, \n     or the Attorney General's regulations adopted by the Board, \n     authorizes the Board to provide regulatory exemptions from \n     the public accommodations accessibility requirements. See \n     White v. INS, 75 F.3d 213, 215 (5th Cir. 1996) (agency cannot \n     promulgate even substantive rules that are contrary to \n     statute).\n       The Board also declines the commenter's suggestion that the \n     Board modify section 35.207 to impose section 210 \n     requirements only if the Member uses the home as a public\n\n[[Page S32]]\n\n     accommodation ``regularly or on a day-to-day basis.'' If an \n     entity's facility or activity constitutes a ``place of public \n     accommodations'' under the provisions of title III of the \n     ADA, as applied by section 210 of the CAA, the duty to meet \n     accessibility requirements applies, regardless of whether the \n     operator of the public accommodation maintains the \n     accommodation on a permanent, temporary, seasonal, or \n     intermittent basis. Under the statute, once the conditions of \n     coverage are met, the obligation to ensure accessibility \n     attaches so long as the portion of the facility at issue \n     continues to constitute a ``place of public accommodation.'' \n     This statutory requirement cannot be altered by the Board.\n       3. Section 36.305(c) (access to multiplex cinemas).--The \n     Board will delete proposed section 36.305(c) (relating to \n     accessibility standards for multiplex cinemas) from its final \n     regulations, as recommended by two commenters, because it \n     does not appear to have any conceivable applicability to \n     facilities in the Legislative Branch.\n       4. Capitol buildings and grounds as historical \n     properties.--One commenter has requested that the Board issue \n     regulations declaring the Capitol Buildings and grounds as \n     historical properties for section 210 purposes, based on \n     statutes the commenter contends establish the recognition of \n     the historic nature of such properties by Congress. See, \n     e.g., 40 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 71a, 162-63. However, neither \n     section 210 of the CAA, the provisions of the ADA applied \n     thereunder, nor the Attorney General's regulations adopted by \n     the Board authorizes the Board to declare in its regulations \n     any particular properties as historic. The historic nature of \n     such properties, if relevant in a proceeding under section \n     210, may be raised and established by the appropriate \n     responding entity before the General Counsel in an \n     investigatory proceeding and/or before the hearing officer or \n     the Board in an appropriate adjudicatory proceeding.\n\n        D. Future changes in text of disability access standards\n\n       The commenters generally agreed with the Board's proposed \n     approach regarding future changes in the regulations of the \n     Attorney General and/or the Secretary of Transportation. \n     However, one commenter suggested that the Board expressly \n     state the manner and frequency by which it and the Office \n     plan to inform covered entities and employees of such changes \n     in such rules and materials. As stated in the NPR, the Board \n     will make any changes in the regulations under the procedures \n     of section 304 of the CAA. Those changes will be made as \n     frequently as needed and it is impossible in the abstract for \n     the Board to establish a pre-set schedule under which as yet \n     unanticipated and unknown changes to regulations will be \n     made.\n       One commenter expressed concern that the Board not make \n     changes to any external documents or standards without \n     following the rulemaking procedures of section 304 of the \n     CAA. The Board agrees that any changes to the regulations \n     themselves should be subject to ordinary rulemaking \n     procedures under section 304. However, adoption of changes to \n     the text of external documents, such as the ADA Accessibility \n     Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities included as an \n     appendix to the Attorney General's part 36 regulations, \n     should not be subject to notice and comment under section 304 \n     unless the Attorney General makes changes to such external \n     documents pursuant to a notice and comment procedures of the \n     APA. Where changes in those standards are adopted by the \n     Attorney General without notice and comment under the \n     Administrative Procedure Act, such changes are not within the \n     Board's definition of ``substantive regulations to \n     implement'' the ADA and thus the notice and comment \n     procedures would not be required to make such changes under \n     the CAA. See 142 Cong. Rec. at S11020. Of course, if changes \n     in the appendices and other external documents are made by \n     the Attorney General pursuant to the notice and comment \n     procedures of the APA, the Board would likewise be required \n     to follow the procedures of section 304 of the CAA to adopt \n     those changes.\n\n                 E. Technical and nomenclature changes\n\n       One commenter has suggested a number of technical and \n     nomenclature changes to the text of the proposed regulations. \n     The Board has considered each of the suggested changes and, \n     where appropriate, incorporated them into the final \n     regulations. However, unless otherwise expressly stated, by \n     making such changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     change in the meaning of the regulations.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ An example of one technical or nomenclature change that \n     the Board does not adopt is the suggestion that the term \n     ``public'' be deleted from proposed section \n     35.102(a)(modifying ``services, programs, or activities''), \n     since it does not appear in the text of the Attorney \n     General's regulations. However, in contrast to title II of \n     the ADA, which applies to all activities of a covered public \n     entity (whether public or nonpublic), section 210(b)(2) makes \n     clear that a Legislative Branch entity is a defined covered \n     entity if it ``provides public services, programs, or \n     activities.'' Thus, the addition of the term ``public'' in \n     proposed section 35.102(a) is a ``technical'' change in the \n     Attorney General's regulations required by the language of \n     section 210(b) of the CAA.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                         II. Method of Approval\n\n       The Board received no comments on the method of approval \n     for these regulations. Therefore, the Board continues to \n     recommend that (1) the version of the proposed regulations \n     that shall apply to the Senate and employees of the Senate \n     should be approved by the Senate by resolution; (2) the \n     version of the proposed regulations that shall apply to the \n     House of Representatives and employees of the House of \n     Representatives should be approved by the House of \n     Representatives by resolution; and (3) the version of the \n     proposed regulations that shall apply to other covered \n     employees and entities should be approved by the Congress by \n     concurrent resolution.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C. on this 20th day of December, \n     1996\n\n                                                Glen D.

Enacted into law on January 23, \n     1995, the Congressional Accountability Act (``CAA'') directly \n     applies the rights and protections of eleven federal labor \n     and employment law and public access statutes to covered \n     employees and employing offices within the legislative \n     branch. Section 210(b) of the CAA provides that the rights \n     and protections against discrimination in the provision of \n     public services and accommodations established by the \n     provisions of Title II and III (sections 201 through 230, \n     302, 303, and 309) of the Americans With Disabilities Act of \n     1990, 42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and \n     12189 (``ADA'') shall apply to the following entities:\n       (1) each office of the Senate, including each office of a \n     Senator and each committee;\n       (2) each office of the House of Representatives, including \n     each office of a Member of the House of Representatives and \n     each committee;\n       (3) each joint committee of the Congress;\n       (4) the Capitol Guide Service;\n       (5) the Capitol Police;\n       (6) the Congressional Budget Office;\n       (7) the Office of the Architect of the Capitol (including \n     the Senate Restaurants and the Botanic Garden);\n       (8) the Office of the Attending Physician and\n       (9) the Office of Compliance.\n\n     2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(b). Title II of the ADA generally \n     prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the \n     provision of public services, programs, activities by any \n     ``public entity.'' Section 210(b)(2) of the CAA provides that \n     for the purpose of applying Title II of the ADA the term \n     ``public entity'' means any entity listed above that provides \n     public services, programs, or activities. Title III of the \n     ADA generally prohibits discrimination on the basis of \n     disability by public accommodations and requires places of \n     public accommodation and commercial facilities to be \n     designed, constructed, and altered in compliance with \n     accessibility standards. Section 225(f) of the CAA provides \n     that, ``[e]xcept where inconsistent with definitions and \n     exemptions provided in this Act, the definitions and \n     exemptions of the [ADA] shall apply under this Act.'' 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1361(f)(1).\n       Section 210(f) of the CAA requires that the General Counsel \n     of the Office of Compliance on a regular basis, and at least \n     once each Congress, conduct periodic inspections of all \n     covered facilities and to report to Congress on compliance \n     with disability access standards under section 210. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(f).\n       (b) Purpose and scope of regulations. The regulations set \n     forth herein (Parts 1, 35, 36, 37, and 38) are the \n     substantive regulations that the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance has promulgated pursuant to section \n     210(e) of the CAA. Part 1 contains the general provisions \n     applicable to all regulations under section 210, including \n     the method of identifying entities responsible for correcting \n     a violation of section 210. Part 35 contains the provisions \n     regarding nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in the \n     provision of public services, programs, or activities of \n     covered entities. Part 36 contains the provisions regarding \n     nondiscrimination on the basis of disability by public \n     accommodations. Part 37 contains the provisions regarding \n     transportation services for individuals with disabilities. \n     Part 38 contains the provisions regarding accessibility \n     specifications for transportation vehicles.\n     Sec. 1.102  Definitions.\n       Except as otherwise specifically provided in these \n     regulations, as used in these regulations:\n       (a) Act or CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-\n     1438).\n       (b) ADA means the provisions of the Americans With \n     Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, \n     12182, 12183, and 12189) applied to covered entities by \n     Section 210 of the CAA.\n\n[[Page S33]]\n\n       (c) The term covered entity includes any of the following \n     entities that either provides public services, programs, or \n     activities, and/or that operates a place of public \n     accommodation within the meaning of section 210 of the CAA: \n     (1) each office of the Senate, including each office of a \n     Senator and each committee; (2) each office of the House \n     of Representatives, including each office of a Member of \n     the House of Representatives and each committee; (3) each \n     joint committee of the Congress; (4) the Capitol Guide \n     Service; (5) the Capitol Police; (6) the Congressional \n     Budget Office; (7) the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol (including the Senate Restaurants and the Botanic \n     Garden); (8) the Office of the Attending Physician; and \n     (9) the Office of Compliance.\n       (d) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (e) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n       (f) General Counsel means the General Counsel of the Office \n     of Compliance.\n     Sec. 1.103  Notice of protection.\n       Pursuant to section 301(h) of the CAA, the Office shall \n     prepare, in a manner suitable for posting, a notice \n     explaining the provisions of section 210 of the CAA. Copies \n     of such notice may be obtained from the Office of Compliance.\n     Sec. 1.104  Authority of the Board.\n       Pursuant to sections 210 and 304 of the CAA, the Board is \n     authorized to issue regulations to implement the rights and \n     protections against discrimination on the basis of disability \n     in the provision of public services and accommodations under \n     the incorporated provisions of the ADA. Section 210(e) of the \n     CAA directs the Board to promulgate regulations implementing \n     section 210 that are ``the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     Transportation to implement the statutory provisions referred \n     to in subsection (b) except to the extent that the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown and stated together with the \n     regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e). The \n     regulations issued by the Board herein are on all matters for \n     which section 210 of the CAA requires a regulation to be \n     issued. Specifically, it is the Board's considered judgment, \n     based on the information available to it at the time of \n     promulgation of these regulations, that, with the exception \n     of the regulations adopted and set forth herein, there are no \n     other ``substantive regulations promulgated by the Attorney \n     General and the Secretary of Transportation to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (b) [of \n     section 210 of the CAA]'' that need be adopted.\n       In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary. \n     Such changes are intended to make the provisions adopted \n     accord more naturally to situations in the Legislative \n     Branch. However, by making these changes, the Board does not \n     intend a substantive difference between these regulations and \n     those of the Attorney General and/or the Secretary from which \n     they are derived. Moreover, such changes, in and of \n     themselves, are not intended to constitute an interpretation \n     of the regulations or of the statutory provisions of the CAA \n     upon which they are based.\n     Sec. 1.105  Method for identifying the entity responsible for \n         correction of violations of section 210.\n       (a) Purpose and Scope. Section 210(e)(3) of the CAA \n     provides that regulations under section 210(e) include a \n     method of identifying, for purposes of this section and for \n     categories of violations of section 210(b), the entity \n     responsible for correcting a particular violation. This \n     section 1.105 sets forth the method for identifying \n     responsible entities for the purpose of allocating \n     responsibility for correcting violations of section 210(b).\n       (b) Categories of violations. Violations of the rights and \n     protections established in section 210(b) of the CAA that may \n     form the basis for a charge filed with the General Counsel \n     under section 210(d)(1) of the CAA or for a complaint filed \n     by the General Counsel under section 210(d)(3) of the CAA \n     fall into one (or both) of two categories:\n       (i) Title II violations. A covered entity may violate \n     section 210(b) if it discriminates against a qualified \n     individual with a disability within the meaning of those \n     provisions of Title II of the ADA (sections 210 through 230), \n     applied to Legislative Branch entities under section 210(b) \n     of the CAA.\n       (ii) Title III violations. A covered entity may also \n     violate section 210(b) if it discriminates against a \n     qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of \n     those provisions of Title III of the ADA (sections 302, 303, \n     and 309) applied to Legislative Branch entities under section \n     210(b) of the CAA.\n       (c) Entity Responsible for Correcting a Violation of Title \n     II Rights and Protections. Correction of a violation of the \n     rights and protections against discrimination under Title II \n     of the ADA, as applied by section 210(b) of the CAA, is the \n     responsibility of any entity listed in subsection (a) of \n     section 210 of the CAA that is a ``public entity,'' as \n     defined by section 210(b)(2) of the CAA, and that provides \n     the specific public service, program, or activity that forms \n     the basis for the particular violation of Title II rights and \n     protections set forth in the charge of discrimination filed \n     with the General Counsel under section 210(d)(1) of the CAA \n     or the complaint filed by the General Counsel with the Office \n     under section 210(d)(3) of the CAA. As used in this section, \n     an entity provides a public service, program, or activity \n     if it does so itself, or by a person or other entity \n     (whether public or private and regardless of whether that \n     entity is covered under the CAA) under a contractual or \n     other arrangement or relationship with the entity.\n       (d) Entity Responsible for Correction of Title III Rights \n     and Protections. Correction of a violation of the rights and \n     protections against discrimination under Title III of the \n     ADA, as applied by section 210(b) of the CAA, is the \n     responsibility of any entity listed in subsection (a) of \n     section 210 of the CAA that ``operates a place of public \n     accommodation'' (as defined in this section) that forms the \n     basis, in whole or in part, for the particular violation of \n     Title III rights and protections set forth in the charge \n     filed with the General Counsel under section 210(d)(1) of the \n     CAA and/or the complaint filed by the General Counsel with \n     the Office under section 210(d)(3) of the CAA.\n       (i) Definitions.\n       As used in this section:\n       Public accommodation has the meaning set forth in Part 36 \n     of these regulations.\n       Operates, with respect to the operations of a place of \n     public accommodation, includes the superintendence, control, \n     management, or direction of the function of the aspects of \n     the public accommodation that constitute an architectural \n     barrier or communication barrier that is structural in \n     nature, or that otherwise forms the basis for a violation of \n     the rights and protections of Title III of the ADA as applied \n     under section 210(b) of the CAA.\n       (ii) As used in this section, an entity operates a place of \n     public accommodation if it does so itself, or by a person or \n     other entity (whether public or private and regardless of \n     whether that entity is covered under the CAA) under a \n     contractual or other arrangement or relationship with the \n     entity.\n       (e) Allocation of Responsibility for Correction of Title II \n     and/or Title III Violations. Where more than one entity is \n     deemed an entity responsible for correction of a violation of \n     Title II and/or Title III rights and protections under the \n     method set forth in this section, as between those parties, \n     allocation of responsibility for complying with the \n     obligations of Title II and/or Title III of the ADA as \n     applied by section 210(b), and for correction of violations \n     thereunder, may be determined by contract or other \n     enforceable arrangement or relationship.\n\n\n            Part 2 INVESTIGATION AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES\n\n     Sec.\n     2.101 Charge filed with the General Counsel\n     2.102 Service of charge or notice of charge\n     2.103 Investigations by the General Counsel\n     2.104 Mediation\n     2.105 Dismissal of charge\n     2.106 Complaint by the General Counsel\n     2.107 Settlement of complaints\n     2.108 Compliance date\n     Sec. 2.101 Charge filed with the General Counsel.\n       (a) Who may file.\n       (1) Any qualified individual with a disability, as defined \n     in section 201(2) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990 (42 U.S.C. 12131(2)), as applied by section 210 of the \n     CAA and section 35.104 of the Board's regulations thereunder, \n     who believes that he or she has been subjected to \n     discrimination on the basis of a disability in violation of \n     section 210 of the CAA by a covered entity, may file a charge \n     against any entity responsible for correcting the violation \n     with the General Counsel. A charge may not be filed under \n     section 210 of the CAA by a covered employee alleging \n     employment discrimination on the basis of disability; the \n     exclusive remedy for such discrimination are the procedures \n     under section 201 of the CAA and subpart B of the Office's \n     procedural rules.\n       (b) When to file. A charge under this section must be filed \n     with the General Counsel not later than 180 days from the \n     date of the alleged discrimination.\n       (c) Form and Contents.

All charges shall \n     be signed and verified by the qualified individual with a \n     disability (hereinafter referred to as the ``charging \n     party''), or his or her representative, and shall contain the \n     following information:\n       (i) the full name, mailing address, and telephone number(s) \n     of the charging party;\n       (ii) the name, address, and telephone number of the covered \n     entit(ies) against which the charge is brought, if known \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``respondent'');\n       (iii) the name(s) and title(s) of the individual(s), if \n     known, involved in the conduct that the charging party claims \n     is a violation of section 210 and/or the location and \n     description of the places or conditions within covered \n     facilities that the charging party claims is a violation of \n     section 210;\n       (iv) a description of the conduct, locations, or conditions \n     that form the basis of the charge, and a brief description of \n     why the charging party believes the conduct, locations, or \n     conditions is a violation of section 210; and\n       (v) the name, address, and telephone number of the \n     representative, if any, who will act on behalf of the \n     charging party.\n     Sec. 2.102  Service of charge or notice of charge\n       Within ten (10) days after the filing of a charge with the \n     General Counsel's Office (excluding weekends or holidays), \n     the General Counsel shall serve the respondent with a\n\n[[Page S34]]\n\n     copy of the charge, by certified mail, return receipt \n     requested, or in person, except when it is determined that \n     providing a copy of the charge would impede the law \n     enforcement functions of the General Counsel. Where a copy of \n     the charge is not provided, the respondent will be served \n     with a notice of the charge within ten (10) days after the \n     filing of the charge. The notice shall include the date, \n     place and circumstances of the alleged violation of section \n     210. Where appropriate, the notice may include the identity \n     of the person filing the charge.\n     Sec. 2.103  Investigations by the General Counsel\n       The General Counsel or the General Counsel's designated \n     representative shall promptly investigate each complaint \n     alleging violations of section 210 of the CAA. As part of the \n     investigation, the General Counsel will accept any statement \n     of position or evidence with respect to the charge which the \n     charging party or the respondent wishes to submit. The \n     General Counsel will use other methods to investigate the \n     charge, as appropriate.\n     Sec. 2.104  Mediation\n       If, upon investigation, the General Counsel believes that a \n     violation of section 210 may have occurred and that mediation \n     may be helpful in resolving the dispute, the General Counsel \n     may request, but not participate in, mediation under \n     subsections (b) through (d) of section 403 of the CAA and the \n     Office's procedural rules thereunder, between the charging \n     party and any entity responsible for correcting the alleged \n     violation.\n     Sec. 2.105  Dismissal of charge\n       Where the General Counsel determines that a complaint will \n     not be filed, the General Counsel shall dismiss the charge.\n     Sec. 2.106  Complaint by the General Counsel\n       (a) After completing the investigation, and where mediation \n     under section 2.104, if any, has not succeeded in resolving \n     the dispute, and where the General Counsel has not settled or \n     dismissed the charge, and if the General Counsel believes \n     that a violation of section 210 may have occurred, the \n     General Counsel may file with the Office a complaint against \n     any entity responsible for correcting the violation.\n       (b) The complaint filed by the General Counsel under \n     subsection (a) shall be submitted to a hearing officer for \n     decision pursuant to subsections (b) through (h) of section \n     405 of the CAA.

Sec. 35.141-35.148  [Reserved]\n\n                    Subpart D--Program Accessibility\n\n     Sec. 35.149  Discrimination prohibited.\n       Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 35.150, no qualified \n     individual with a disability shall, because a public entity's \n     facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals \n     with disabilities, be excluded from participation in, or be \n     denied the benefits of the public services, programs, or \n     activities of a public entity, or be subjected to \n     discrimination by any public entity.\n     Sec. 35.150  Existing facilities.\n       (a) General. A public entity shall operate each public \n     service, program, or activity so that the public service, \n     program, or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily \n     accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. \n     This paragraph does not--\n       (1) Necessarily require a public entity to make each of its \n     existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals \n     with disabilities;\n       (2) Require a public entity to take any action that would \n     threaten or destroy the historic significance of an historic \n     property; or\n       (3) Require a public entity to take any action that it can \n     demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the \n     nature of a public service, program, or activity or in undue \n     financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances \n     where personnel of the public entity believe that the \n     proposed action would fundamentally alter the public service, \n     program, or activity or would result in undue financial and \n     administrative burdens, a public entity has the burden of \n     proving that compliance with Sec. 35.150(a) of this part \n     would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that \n     compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be \n     made by the head of a public entity or his or her designee \n     after considering all resources available for use in the \n     funding and operation of the service, program, or activity, \n     and must be accompanied by a written statement of the \n     reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would \n     result in such an alteration or such burdens, a public \n     entity shall take any other action that would not result \n     in such an alteration or such burdens but would \n     nevertheless ensure that individuals with disabilities \n     receive the public benefits or services provided by the \n     public entity.\n       (b) Methods--(1) General. A public entity may comply with \n     the requirements of this section through such means as \n     redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible \n     buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, \n     delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, \n     alteration of existing facilities and construction of new \n     facilities, use of accessible rolling stock or other \n     conveyances, or any other methods that result in making its \n     public services, programs, or activities readily accessible \n     to and usable by individuals with disabilities. A public \n     entity is not required to make structural changes in existing \n     facilities where other methods are effective in achieving \n     compliance with this section. A public entity, in making \n     alterations to existing buildings, shall meet the \n     accessibility requirements of Sec. 35.151. In choosing among \n     available methods for meeting the requirements of this \n     section, a public entity shall give priority to those methods \n     that offer public services, programs, and activities to \n     qualified individuals with disabilities in the most \n     integrated setting appropriate.\n       (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the \n     requirements of Sec. 35.150(a) in historic preservation \n     programs, a public entity shall give priority to methods that \n     provide physical access to individuals with disabilities. In \n     cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is \n     not required because of paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this \n     section, alternative methods of achieving program \n     accessibility include--\n       (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict \n     those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise \n     be made accessible;\n       (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with \n     disabilities into or through portions of historic properties \n     that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or\n       (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.\n       (c) Time period for compliance. Where structural changes in \n     facilities are undertaken to comply with the obligations \n     established under this section, such changes shall be made by \n     within three years of January 1, 1997, but in any event as \n     expeditiously as possible.\n       (d) Transition plan. (1) In the event that structural \n     changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program \n     accessibility, a public entity that employs 50 or more \n     persons shall develop, within six months of January 1, 1997, \n     a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to \n     complete such changes. A public entity shall provide an \n     opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with \n     disabilities or organizations representing individuals with \n     disabilities, to participate in the development of the \n     transition plan by submitting comments. A copy of\n\n[[Page S37]]\n\n     the transition plan shall be made available for public \n     inspection.\n       (2) If a public entity has responsibility or authority over \n     streets, roads, or walkways, its transition plan shall \n     include a schedule for providing curb ramps or other sloped \n     areas where pedestrian walks cross curbs, giving priority to \n     walkways serving entities covered by the CAA, including \n     covered offices and facilities, transportation, places of \n     public accommodation, and employers, followed by walkways \n     serving other areas.\n       (3) The plan shall, at a minimum--\n       (i) Identify physical obstacles in the public entity's \n     facilities that limit the accessibility of its public \n     programs or activities to individuals with disabilities;\n       (ii) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to \n     make the facilities accessible;\n       (iii) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary \n     to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time \n     period of the transition plan is longer than one year, \n     identify steps that will be taken during each year of the \n     transition period; and\n       (iv) Indicate the official responsible for implementation \n     of the plan.\n     Sec. 35.151  New construction and alterations.\n       (a) Design and construction. Each facility or part of a \n     facility constructed by, on behalf of, or for the use of a \n     public entity shall be designed and constructed in such \n     manner that the facility or part of the facility is readily \n     accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, if \n     the construction was commenced after January 1, 1997.\n       (b) Alteration. Each facility or part of a facility altered \n     by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity in a \n     manner that affects or could affect the usability of the \n     facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent \n     feasible, be altered in such manner that the altered portion \n     of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by \n     individuals with disabilities, if the alteration was \n     commenced after January 1, 1997.\n       (c) Accessibility standards. Design, construction, or \n     alteration of facilities in conformance with the Uniform \n     Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) (Appendix B to Part 36 \n     of these regulations) or with the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities \n     (ADAAG) (Appendix A to Part 36 of these regulations) shall be \n     deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with \n     respect to those facilities, except that the elevator \n     exemption contained at 4.1.3(5) and 4.1.6(1)(j) of ADAAG \n     shall not apply. Departures from particular requirements of \n     either standard by the use of other methods shall be \n     permitted when it is clearly evident that equivalent \n     access to the facility or part of the facility is thereby \n     provided.\n       (d) Alterations: Historic properties. (1) Alterations to \n     historic properties shall comply, to the maximum extent \n     feasible, with section 4.1.7 of UFAS or section 4.1.7 of \n     ADAAG.\n       (2) If it is not feasible to provide physical access to a \n     historic property in a manner that will not threaten or \n     destroy the historic significance of the building or \n     facility, alternative methods of access shall be provided \n     pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 35.150.\n       (e) Curb ramps. (1) Newly constructed or altered streets, \n     roads, and highways must contain curb ramps or other sloped \n     areas at any intersection having curbs or other barriers to \n     entry from a street level pedestrian walkway.\n       (2) Newly constructed or altered street level pedestrian \n     walkways must contain curb ramps or other sloped areas at \n     intersections to streets, roads, or highways.\n     Sec.

The international symbol for accessibility shall \n     be used at each accessible entrance of a public facility.\n     Sec. 35.164  Duties.\n       This subpart does not require a public entity to take any \n     action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental \n     alteration in the nature of a public service, program, or \n     activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In \n     those circumstances where personnel of the public entity \n     believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter \n     the public service, program, or activity or would result in \n     undue financial and administrative burdens, a public entity \n     has the burden of proving that compliance with this subpart \n     would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that \n     compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be \n     made by the head of the public entity or his or her designee \n     after considering all resources available for use in the \n     funding and operation of the public service, program, or \n     activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of \n     the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action \n     required to comply with this subpart would result in such an \n     alteration or such burdens, a public entity shall take any \n     other action that would not result in such an alteration or \n     such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the \n     maximum extent possible, individuals with disabilities \n     receive the public benefits or services provided by the \n     public entity.\n     Sec.

A public accommodation shall afford goods, \n     services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and \n     accommodations to an individual with a disability in the most \n     integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the \n     individual.\n       (b) Opportunity to participate. Notwithstanding the \n     existence of separate or different programs or activities \n     provided in accordance with this subpart, a public \n     accommodation shall not deny an individual with a disability \n     an opportunity to participate in such programs or activities \n     that are not separate or different.\n       (c) Accommodations and services. (1) Nothing in this part \n     shall be construed to require an individual with a disability \n     to accept an accommodation, aid, service, opportunity, or \n     benefit available under this part that such individual \n     chooses not to accept.\n        (2) Nothing in the CAA or this part authorizes the \n     representative or guardian of an individual with a disability \n     to decline food, water, medical treatment, or medical \n     services for that individual.\n     Sec. 36.204  Administrative methods.\n       A public accommodation shall not, directly or through \n     contractual or other arrangements, utilize standards or \n     criteria or methods of administration that have the effect of \n     discriminating on the basis of disability, or that perpetuate \n     the discrimination of others who are subject to common \n     administrative control.\n     Sec. 36.205  Association.\n       A public accommodation shall not exclude or otherwise deny \n     equal goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, \n     accommodations, or other opportunities to an individual or \n     entity because of the known disability of an individual with \n     whom the individual or entity is known to have a relationship \n     or association.\n     Sec. 36.206  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 36.207  Places of public accommodation located in \n         private residences.\n       (a) When a place of public accommodation is located in a \n     private residence, the portion of the residence used \n     exclusively as a residence is not covered by this part, but \n     that portion used exclusively in the operation of the place \n     of public accommodation or that portion used both for the \n     place of public accommodation and for residential purposes is \n     covered by this part.\n       (b) The portion of the residence covered under paragraph \n     (a) of this section extends to those elements used to enter \n     the place of public accommodation, including the homeowner's \n     front sidewalk, if any, the door or entryway, and hallways; \n     and those portions of the residence, interior or exterior, \n     available to or used by customers or clients, including \n     restrooms.\n     Sec. 36.208 Direct threat.\n       (a) This part does not require a public accommodation to \n     permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the \n     goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages \n     and accommodations of that public accommodation when that \n     individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety \n     of others.\n       (b) Direct threat means a significant risk to the health or \n     safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification \n     of policies, practices, or procedures, or by the provision of \n     auxiliary aids or services.\n       (c) In determining whether an individual poses a direct \n     threat to the health or safety of others, a public \n     accommodation must make an individualized assessment, based \n     on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical \n     knowledge or on the best available objective evidence, to \n     ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; \n     the probability that the potential injury will actually \n     occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, \n     practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk.\n     Sec. 36.209  Illegal use of drugs.\n       (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of \n     this section, this part does not prohibit discrimination \n     against an individual based on that individual's current \n     illegal use of drugs.\n       (2) A public accommodation shall not discriminate on the \n     basis of illegal use of drugs against an individual who is \n     not engaging in current illegal use of drugs and who\n       (i) Has successfully completed a supervised drug \n     rehabilitation program or has otherwise been rehabilitated \n     successfully;\n       (ii) Is participating in a supervised rehabilitation \n     program; or\n       (iii) Is erroneously regarded as engaging in such use.\n       (b) Health and drug rehabilitation services.

(1) This part does not prohibit a public \n     accommodation from adopting or administering reasonable \n     policies or procedures, including but not limited to drug \n     testing, designed to ensure that an individual who formerly \n     engaged in the illegal use of drugs is not now engaging in \n     current illegal use of drugs.\n       (2) Nothing in this paragraph (c) shall be construed to \n     encourage, prohibit, restrict, or authorize the conducting of \n     testing for the illegal use of drugs.\n     Sec. 36.210  Smoking.\n       This part does not preclude the prohibition of, or the \n     imposition of restrictions on, smoking in places of public \n     accommodation.\n     Sec. 36.211  Maintenance of accessible features.\n       (a) A public accommodation shall maintain in operable \n     working condition those features of facilities and equipment \n     that are required to be readily accessible to and usable by \n     persons with disabilities by the CAA or this part.\n       (b) This section does not prohibit isolated or temporary \n     interruptions in service or access due to maintenance or \n     repairs.\n     Sec. 36.212  Insurance.\n       (a) This part shall not be construed to prohibit or \n     restrict--\n       (1) A covered entity that administers benefit plans from \n     underwriting risks, classifying risks, or administering such \n     risks that are based on or not inconsistent with applicable \n     law; or\n       (2) A person or organization covered by this part from \n     establishing, sponsoring, observing or administering the \n     terms of a bona fide benefit plan that are based on \n     underwriting risks, classifying risks, or administering such \n     risks that are based on or not inconsistent with applicable \n     law; or\n       (3) A person or organization covered by this part from \n     establishing, sponsoring, observing or administering the \n     terms of a bona fide benefit plan that is not subject to \n     applicable laws that regulate insurance.\n       (b) Paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section shall \n     not be used as a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the CAA \n     or this part.\n       (c) A public accommodation shall not refuse to serve an \n     individual with a disability because its insurance company \n     conditions coverage or rates on the absence of individuals \n     with disabilities.\n     Sec. 36.213  Relationship of subpart B to subparts C and D of \n         this part.\n       Subpart B of this part sets forth the general principles of \n     nondiscrimination applicable to all entities subject to this \n     part.

Sec. 36.214-36.299  [Reserved]\n\n                    Subpart C--Specific Requirements\n\n     Sec. 36.301  Eligibility criteria.\n       (a) General. A public accommodation shall not impose or \n     apply eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen \n     out an individual with a disability or any class of \n     individuals with disabilities from fully and equally enjoying \n     any goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or \n     accommodations, unless such criteria can be shown to be \n     necessary for the provision of the goods, services, \n     facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations being \n     offered.\n       (b) Safety. A public accommodation may impose legitimate \n     safety requirements that are necessary for safe operation. \n     Safety requirements must be based on actual risks\n\n[[Page S40]]\n\n     and not on mere speculation, stereotypes, or generalizations \n     about individuals with disabilities.\n       (c) Charges. A public accommodation may not impose a \n     surcharge on a particular individual with a disability or any \n     group of individuals with disabilities to cover the costs of \n     measures, such as the provision of auxiliary aids, barrier \n     removal, alternatives to barrier removal, and reasonable \n     modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, that are \n     required to provide that individual or group with the \n     nondiscriminatory treatment required by the CAA or this part.\n     Sec. 36.302  Modifications in policies, practices, or \n         procedures.\n       (a) General. A public accommodation shall make reasonable \n     modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when the \n     modifications are necessary to afford goods, services, \n     facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to \n     individuals with disabilities, unless the public \n     accommodation can demonstrate that making the modifications \n     would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, services, \n     facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations.\n       (b) Specialties--(1) General. A public accommodation may \n     refer an individual with a disability to another public \n     accommodation, if that individual is seeking, or requires, \n     treatment or services outside of the referring public \n     accommodation's area of specialization, and if, in the normal \n     course of its operations, the referring public accommodation \n     would make a similar referral for an individual without a \n     disability who seeks or requires the same treatment or \n     services.\n       (2) Illustration--medical specialties. A health care \n     provider may refer an individual with a disability to another \n     provider, if that individual is seeking, or requires, \n     treatment or services outside of the referring provider's \n     area of specialization, and if the referring provider would \n     make a similar referral for an individual without a \n     disability who seeks or requires the same treatment or \n     services. A physician who specializes in treating only a \n     particular condition cannot refuse to treat an individual \n     with a disability for that condition, but is not required to \n     treat the individual for a different condition.\n       (c) Service animals--(1) General. Generally, a public \n     accommodation shall modify policies, practices, or procedures \n     to permit the use of a service animal by an individual with a \n     disability.\n       (2) Care or supervision of service animals. Nothing in this \n     part requires a public accommodation to supervise or care for \n     a service animal.\n       (d) Check-out aisles. A store with check-out aisles shall \n     ensure that an adequate number of accessible check-out aisles \n     is kept open during store hours, or shall otherwise modify \n     its policies and practices, in order to ensure that an \n     equivalent level of convenient service is provided to \n     individuals with disabilities as is provided to others. If \n     only one check-out aisle is accessible, and it is generally \n     used for express service, one way of providing equivalent \n     service is to allow persons with mobility impairments to make \n     all their purchases at that aisle.\n     Sec. 36.303  Auxiliary aids and services.\n       (a) General. A public accommodation shall take those steps \n     that may be necessary to ensure that no individual with a \n     disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or \n     otherwise treated differently than other individuals because \n     of the absence of auxiliary aids and services, unless the \n     public accommodation can demonstrate that taking those steps \n     would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, services, \n     facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations being \n     offered or would result in an undue burden, i.e., significant \n     difficulty or expense.\n       (b) Examples. The term ``auxiliary aids and service'' \n     includes\n       (1) Qualified interpreters, notetakers, computer-aided \n     transcription services, written materials, telephone handset \n     amplifiers, assistive listening devices, assistive listening \n     systems, telephones compatible with hearing aids, closed \n     caption decoders, open and closed captioning, \n     telecommunications devices for deaf persons (TDD's), \n     videotext displays, or other effective methods of making \n     aurally delivered materials available to individuals with \n     hearing impairments;\n       (2) Qualified readers, taped texts, audio recordings, \n     Brailled materials, large print materials, or other effective \n     methods of making visually delivered materials available to \n     individuals with visual impairments;\n       (3) Acquisition or modification of equipment or devices; \n     and\n       (4) Other similar services and actions.\n       (c) Effective communication. A public accommodation shall \n     furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where \n     necessary to ensure effective communication with individuals \n     with disabilities.\n       (d) Telecommunication devices for the deaf (TDD's). (1) A \n     public accommodation that offers a customer, client, patient, \n     or participant the opportunity to make outgoing telephone \n     calls on more than an incidental convenience basis shall \n     make available, upon request, a TDD for the use of an \n     individual who has impaired hearing or a communication \n     disorder.\n       (2) This part does not require a public accommodation to \n     use a TDD for receiving or making telephone calls incident to \n     its operations.\n       (f) Alternatives. If provision of a particular auxiliary \n     aid or service by a public accommodation would result in a \n     fundamental alteration in the nature of the goods, services, \n     facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations being \n     offered or in an undue burden, i.e., significant difficulty \n     or expense, the public accommodation shall provide an \n     alternative auxiliary aid or service, if one exists, that \n     would not result in such an alteration or such burden but \n     would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent \n     possible, individuals with disabilities receive the goods, \n     services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or \n     accommodations offered by the public accommodation.\n     Sec. 36.304  Removal of barriers.\n       (a) General. A public accommodation shall remove \n     architectural barriers in existing facilities, including \n     communication barriers that are structural in nature, where \n     such removal is readily achievable, i.e., easily \n     accomplishable and able to be carried out without much \n     difficulty or expense.\n       (b) Examples. Examples of steps to remove barriers include, \n     but are not limited to, the following actions--\n       (1) Installing ramps;\n       (2) Making curb cuts in sidewalks and entrances;\n       (3) Repositioning shelves;\n       (4) Rearranging tables, chairs, vending machines, display \n     racks, and other furniture;\n       (5) Repositioning telephones;\n       (6) Adding raised markings on elevator control buttons;\n       (7) Installing flashing alarm lights;\n       (8) Widening doors;\n       (9) Installing offset hinges to widen doorways;\n       (10) Eliminating a turnstile or providing an alternative \n     accessible path;\n       (11) Installing accessible door hardware;\n       (12) Installing grab bars in toilet stalls;\n       (13) Rearranging toilet partitions to increase maneuvering \n     space;\n       (14) Insulating lavatory pipes under sinks to prevent \n     burns;\n       (15) Installing a raised toilet seat;\n       (16) Installing a full-length bathroom mirror;\n       (17) Repositioning the paper towel dispenser in a bathroom;\n       (18) Creating designated accessible parking spaces;\n       (19) Installing an accessible paper cup dispenser at an \n     existing inaccessible water fountain;\n       (20) Removing high pile, low density carpeting; or\n       (21) Installing vehicle hand controls.\n       (c) Priorities. A public accommodation is urged to take \n     measures to comply with the barrier removal requirements of \n     this section in accordance with the following order of \n     priorities.\n       (1) First, a public accommodation should take measures to \n     provide access to a place of public accommodation from public \n     sidewalks, parking, or public transportation. These measures \n     include, for example, installing an entrance ramp, widening \n     entrances, and providing accessible parking spaces.\n       (2) Second, a public accommodation should take measures to \n     provide access to those areas of a place of public \n     accommodation where goods and services are made available to \n     the public. These measures include, for example, adjusting \n     the layout of display racks, rearranging tables, providing \n     Brailled and raised character signage, widening doors, \n     providing visual alarms, and installing ramps.\n       (3) Third, a public accommodation should take measures to \n     provide access to restroom facilities. These measures \n     include, for example, removal of obstructing furniture or \n     vending machines, widening of doors, installation of ramps, \n     providing accessible signage, widening of toilet stalls, and \n     installation of grab bars.\n       (4) Fourth, a public accommodation should take any other \n     measures necessary to provide access to the goods, services, \n     facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of a \n     place of public accommodation.\n       (d) Relationship to alterations requirements of subpart D \n     of this part. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of \n     this section, measures taken to comply with the barrier \n     removal requirements of this section shall comply with the \n     applicable requirements for alterations in Sec. 36.402 and \n     Sec. Sec. 36.404-36.406 of this part for the element being \n     altered. The path of travel requirements of Sec. 36.403 shall \n     not apply to measures taken solely to comply with the barrier \n     removal requirements of this section.\n       (2) If, as a result of compliance with the alterations \n     requirements specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, \n     the measures required to remove a barrier would not be \n     readily achievable, a public accommodation may take other \n     readily achievable measures to remove the barrier that do not \n     fully comply with the specified requirements. Such measures \n     include, for example, providing a ramp with a steeper slope \n     or widening a doorway to a narrower width than that mandated \n     by the alterations requirements. No measure shall be taken, \n     however, that poses a significant risk to the health or \n     safety of individuals with disabilities or others.\n       (e) Portable ramps. Portable ramps should be used to comply \n     with this section only when installation of a permanent ramp \n     is not readily achievable. In order to avoid any significant \n     risk to the health or safety of individuals with disabilities \n     or others in using portable ramps, due consideration shall be \n     given to safety features such as nonslip surfaces, railings, \n     anchoring, and strength of materials.\n       (f) Selling or serving space. The rearrangement of \n     temporary or movable structures, such as furniture, \n     equipment, and display racks is not readily achievable to the \n     extent\n\n[[Page S41]]\n\n     that it results in a significant loss of selling or serving \n     space.\n       (g) Limitation on barrier removal obligations. (1) The \n     requirements for barrier removal under Sec. 36.304 shall not \n     be interpreted to exceed the standards for alterations in \n     subpart D of this part.\n       (2) To the extent that relevant standards for alterations \n     are not provided in subpart D of this part, then the \n     requirements of Sec. 36.304 shall not be interpreted to \n     exceed the standards for new construction in subpart D of \n     this part.\n       (3) This section does not apply to rolling stock and other \n     conveyances to the extent that Sec. 36.310 applies to rolling \n     stock and other conveyances.\n     Sec. 36.305  Alternatives to barrier removal.\n       (a) General. Where a public accommodation can demonstrate \n     that barrier removal is not readily achievable, the public \n     accommodation shall not fail to make its goods, services, \n     facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations \n     available through alternative methods, if those methods are \n     readily achievable.\n       (b) Examples. Examples of alternatives to barrier removal \n     include, but are not limited to, the following actions--\n       (1) Providing curb service or home delivery;\n       (2) Retrieving merchandise from inaccessible shelves or \n     racks;\n       (3) Relocating activities to accessible locations.\n     Sec. 36.306 Personal devices and services.\n       This part does not require a public accommodation to \n     provide its customers, clients, or participants with personal \n     devices, such as wheelchairs; individually prescribed \n     devices, such as prescription eyeglasses or hearing aids; or \n     services of a personal nature including assistance in eating, \n     toileting, or dressing.\n     Sec. 36.307 Accessible or special goods.\n       (a) This part does not require a public accommodation to \n     alter its inventory to include accessible or special goods \n     that are designed for, or facilitate use by, individuals with \n     disabilities.\n       (b) A public accommodation shall order accessible or \n     special goods at the request of an individual with \n     disabilities, if, in the normal course of its operation, it \n     makes special orders on request for unstocked goods, and if \n     the accessible or special goods can be obtained from a \n     supplier with whom the public accommodation customarily does \n     business.\n       (c) Examples of accessible or special goods include items \n     such as Brailled versions of books, books on audio cassettes, \n     closed-captioned video tapes, special sizes or lines of \n     clothing, and special foods to meet particular dietary needs.\n      Sec. 36.308  Seating in assembly areas.\n       (a) Existing facilities. (1) To the extent that it is \n     readily achievable, a public accommodation in assembly areas \n     shall--\n       (i) Provide a reasonable number of wheelchair seating \n     spaces and seats with removable aisle-side arm rests; and\n       (ii) Locate the wheelchair seating spaces so that they--\n       (A) Are dispersed throughout the seating area;\n        (B) Provide lines of sight and choice of admission prices \n     comparable to those for members of the general public;\n       (C) Adjoin an accessible route that also serves as a means \n     of egress in case of emergency; and\n       (D) Permit individuals who use wheelchairs to sit with \n     family members or other companions.\n       (2) If removal of seats is not readily achievable, a public \n     accommodation shall provide, to the extent that it is readily \n     achievable to do so, a portable chair or other means to \n     permit a family member or other companion to sit with an \n     individual who uses a wheelchair.\n       (3) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall \n     not be interpreted to exceed the standards for alterations in \n     subpart D of this part.\n       (b) New construction and alterations. The provision and \n     location of wheelchair seating spaces in newly constructed or \n     altered assembly areas shall be governed by the standards for \n     new construction and alterations in subpart D of this part.\n     Sec. 36.309  Examinations and courses.\n       (a) General. Any covered entity that offers examinations or \n     courses related to applications, licensing, certification, or \n     credentialing for secondary or postsecondary education, \n     professional, or trade purposes shall offer such examinations \n     or courses in a place and manner accessible to persons with \n     disabilities or offer alternative accessible arrangements for \n     such individuals.\n       (b) Examinations. (1) Any covered entity offering an \n     examination covered by this section must assure that--\n       (i) The examination is selected and administered so as to \n     best ensure that, when the examination is administered to an \n     individual with a disability that impairs sensory, manual, or \n     speaking skills, the examination results accurately reflect \n     the individual's aptitude or achievement level or whatever \n     other factor the examination purports to measure, rather than \n     reflecting the individual's impaired sensory, manual, or \n     speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors \n     that the examination purports to measure);\n       (ii) An examination that is designed for individuals with \n     impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills is offered at \n     equally convenient locations, as often, and in as timely a \n     manner as are other examinations; and\n       (iii) The examination is administered in facilities that \n     are accessible to individuals with disabilities or \n     alternative accessible arrangements are made.\n       (2) Required modifications to an examination may include \n     changes in the length of time permitted for completion of the \n     examination and adaptation of the manner in which the \n     examination is given.\n       (3) A covered entity offering an examination covered by \n     this section shall provide appropriate auxiliary aids for \n     persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills, \n     unless that covered entity can demonstrate that offering a \n     particular auxiliary aid would fundamentally alter the \n     measurement of the skills or knowledge the examination is \n     intended to test or would result in an undue burden. \n     Auxiliary aids and services required by this section may \n     include taped examinations, interpreters or other effective \n     methods of making orally delivered materials available to \n     individuals with hearing impairments, Brailled or large print \n     examinations and answer sheets or qualified readers for \n     individuals with visual impairments or learning disabilities, \n     transcribers for individuals with manual impairments, and \n     other similar services and actions.\n       (4) Alternative accessible arrangements may include, for \n     example, provision of an examination at an individual's home \n     with a proctor if accessible facilities or equipment are \n     unavailable. Alternative arrangements must provide comparable \n     conditions to those provided for nondisabled individuals.\n       (c) Courses. (1) Any covered entity that offers a course \n     covered by this section must make such modifications to that \n     course as are necessary to ensure that the place and manner \n     in which the course is given are accessible to individuals \n     with disabilities.\n       (2) Required modifications may include changes in the \n     length of time permitted for the completion of the course, \n     substitution of specific requirements, or adaptation of the \n     manner in which the course is conducted or course materials \n     are distributed.\n       (3) A covered entity that offers a course covered by this \n     section shall provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services \n     for persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking \n     skills, unless the covered entity can demonstrate that \n     offering a particular auxiliary aid or service would \n     fundamentally alter the course or would result in an undue \n     burden. Auxiliary aids and services required by this section \n     may include taped texts, interpreters or other effective \n     methods of making orally delivered materials available to \n     individuals with hearing impairments, Brailled or large print \n     texts or qualified readers for individuals with visual \n     impairments and learning disabilities, classroom equipment \n     adapted for use by individuals with manual impairments, and \n     other similar services and actions.\n       (4) Courses must be administered in facilities that are \n     accessible to individuals with disabilities or alternative \n     accessible arrangements must be made.\n       (5) Alternative accessible arrangements may include, for \n     example, provision of the course through videotape, \n     cassettes, or prepared notes. Alternative arrangements must \n     provide comparable conditions to those provided for \n     nondisabled individuals.\n     Sec. 36.310  Transportation provided by public \n         accommodations.\n       (a) General. (1) A public accommodation that provides \n     transportation services, but that is not primarily engaged in \n     the business of transporting people, is subject to the \n     general and specific provisions in subparts B, C, and D of \n     this part for its transportation operations, except as \n     provided in this section.\n       (2) Examples. Transportation services subject to this \n     section include, but are not limited to, shuttle services \n     operated between transportation terminals and places of \n     public accommodation and customer shuttle bus services \n     operated by covered entities\n       (b) Barrier removal. A public accommodation subject to this \n     section shall remove transportation barriers in existing \n     vehicles and rail passenger cars used for transporting \n     individuals (not including barriers that can only be removed \n     through the retrofitting of vehicles or rail passenger cars \n     by the installation of a hydraulic or other lift) where such \n     removal is readily achievable.\n       (c) Requirements for vehicles and systems. A public \n     accommodation subject to this section shall comply with the \n     requirements pertaining to vehicles and transportation \n     systems in the regulations issued by the Board of Directors \n     of the Office of Compliance.\n     Sec. Sec. 36.311--36.400  [Reserved]\n\n              Subpart D--New Construction and Alterations\n\n     Sec. 36.401  New construction.\n       (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and \n     (c) of this section, discrimination for purposes of this part \n     includes a failure to design and construct facilities for \n     first occupancy after July 23, 1997, that are readily \n     accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.\n       (2) For purposes of this section, a facility is designed \n     and constructed for first occupancy after July 23, 1997, \n     only--\n       (i) If the last application for a building permit or permit \n     extension for the facility is certified to be complete, by an \n     appropriate governmental authority after January 1, 1997 (or, \n     in those jurisdictions where the government does not certify \n     completion of applications, if the last application for a \n     building permit or permit extension for the facility is \n     received by the appropriate governmental authority after \n     January 1, 1997 ); and\n\n[[Page S42]]\n\n       (ii) If the first certificate of occupancy for the facility \n     is issued after July 23, 1997.\n       (b) Place of public accommodation located in private \n     residences.\n       (1) When a place of public accommodation is located in a \n     private residence, the portion of the residence used \n     exclusively as a residence is not covered by this subpart, \n     but that portion used exclusively in the operation of the \n     place of public accommodation or that portion used both for \n     the place of public accommodation and for residential \n     purposes is covered by the new construction and alterations \n     requirements of this subpart.\n       (2) The portion of the residence covered under paragraph \n     (b)(1) of this section extends to those elements used to \n     enter the place of public accommodation, including the \n     homeowner's front sidewalk, if any, the door or entryway, and \n     hallways; and those portions of the residence, interior or \n     exterior, available to or used by employees or visitors of \n     the place of public accommodation, including restrooms.\n       (c) Exception for structural impracticability. (1) Full \n     compliance with the requirements of this section is not \n     required where an entity can demonstrate that it is \n     structurally impracticable to meet the requirements. Full \n     compliance will be considered structurally impracticable only \n     in those rare circumstances when the unique characteristics \n     of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility \n     features.\n       (2) If full compliance with this section would be \n     structurally impracticable, compliance with this section is \n     required to the extent that it is not structurally \n     impracticable. In that case, any portion of the facility that \n     can be made accessible shall be made accessible to the extent \n     that it is not structurally impracticable.\n       (3) If providing accessibility in conformance with this \n     section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those \n     who use wheelchairs) would be structurally impracticable, \n     accessibility shall nonetheless be ensured to persons with \n     other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches or \n     who have sight, hearing, or mental impairments) in accordance \n     with this section.\n       (d) Elevator exemption. (1) For purposes of this paragraph \n     (d)--\n       Professional office of a health care provider means a \n     location where a person or entity regulated by a State to \n     provide professional services related to the physical or \n     mental health of an individual makes such services available \n     to the public. The facility housing the ``professional office \n     of a health care provider'' only includes floor levels \n     housing at least one health care provider, or any floor level \n     designed or intended for use by at least one health care \n     provider.\n       (2) This section does not require the installation of an \n     elevator in a facility that is less than three stories or has \n     less than 3000 square feet per story, except with respect to \n     any facility that houses one or more of the following:\n       (i) A professional office of a health care provider.\n       (ii) A terminal, depot, or other station used for specified \n     public transportation. In such a facility, any area housing \n     passenger services, including boarding and debarking, loading \n     and unloading, baggage claim, dining facilities, and other \n     common areas open to the public, must be on an accessible \n     route from an accessible entrance.\n       (3) The elevator exemption set forth in this paragraph (d) \n     does not obviate or limit in any way the obligation to comply \n     with the other accessibility requirements established in \n     paragraph (a) of this section. For example, in a facility \n     that houses a professional office of a health care provider, \n     the floors that are above or below an accessible ground floor \n     and that do not house a professional office of a health care \n     provider, must meet the requirements of this section but \n     for the elevator.\n     Sec. 36.402  Alterations.\n       (a) General. (1) Any alteration to a place of public \n     accommodation, after January 1, 1997, shall be made so as to \n     ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the altered \n     portions of the facility are readily accessible to and usable \n     by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who \n     use wheelchairs.\n       (2) An alteration is deemed to be undertaken after January \n     1, 1997, if the physical alteration of the property begins \n     after that date.\n       (b) Alteration. For the purposes of this part, an \n     alteration is a change to a place of public accommodation \n     that affects or could affect the usability of the building or \n     facility or any part thereof.\n       (1) Alterations include, but are not limited to, \n     remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, \n     historic restoration, changes or rearrangement in structural \n     parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement in the plan \n     configuration of walls and full-height partitions. Normal \n     maintenance, reroofing, painting or wallpapering, asbestos \n     removal, or changes to mechanical and electrical systems are \n     not alterations unless they affect the usability of the \n     building or facility.\n       (2) If existing elements, spaces, or common areas are \n     altered, then each such altered element, space, or area shall \n     comply with the applicable provisions of appendix A to this \n     part.\n       (c) To the maximum extent feasible. The phrase ``to the \n     maximum extent feasible,'' as used in this section, applies \n     to the occasional case where the nature of an existing \n     facility makes it virtually impossible to comply fully with \n     applicable accessibility standards through a planned \n     alteration. In these circumstances, the alteration shall \n     provide the maximum physical accessibility feasible. Any \n     altered features of the facility that can be made accessible \n     shall be made accessible. If providing accessibility in \n     conformance with this section to individuals with certain \n     disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would not be \n     feasible, the facility shall be made accessible to persons \n     with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use \n     crutches, those who have impaired vision or hearing, or those \n     who have other impairments).\n     Sec. 36.403  Alterations: Path of travel.\n       (a) General. An alteration that affects or could affect the \n     usability of or access to an area of a facility that contains \n     a primary function shall be made so as to ensure that, to the \n     maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered \n     area and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains \n     serving the altered area, are readily accessible to and \n     usable by individuals with disabilities, including \n     individuals who use wheelchairs, unless the cost and scope of \n     such alterations is disproportionate to the cost of the \n     overall alteration.\n       (b) Primary function. A ``primary function'' is a major \n     activity for which the facility is intended. Areas that \n     contain a primary function include, but are not limited to, \n     the customer services lobby of a bank, the dining area of a \n     cafeteria, the meeting rooms in a conference center, as well \n     as offices and other work areas in which the activities of \n     the public accommodation or other covered entity using the \n     facility are carried out. Mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, \n     supply storage rooms, employee lounges or locker rooms, \n     janitorial closets, entrances, corridors, and restrooms are \n     not areas containing a primary function.\n       (c) Alterations to an area containing a primary function. \n     (1) Alterations that affect the usability of or access to an \n     area containing a primary function include, but are not \n     limited to--\n       (i) Remodeling merchandise display areas or employee work \n     areas in a department store;\n       (ii) Replacing an inaccessible floor surface in the \n     customer service or employee work areas of a bank;\n       (iii) Redesigning the assembly line area of a factory; or\n       (iv) Installing a computer center in an accounting firm.\n       (2) For the purposes of this section, alterations to \n     windows, hardware, controls, electrical outlets, and signage \n     shall not be deemed to be alterations that affect the \n     usability of or access to an area containing a primary \n     function.\n       (d) Path of travel. (1) A ``path of travel'' includes a \n     continuous, unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means \n     of which the altered area may be approached, entered, and \n     exited, and which connects the altered area with an exterior \n     approach (including sidewalks, streets, and parking areas), \n     an entrance to the facility, and other parts of the facility.\n       (2) An accessible path of travel may consist of walks and \n     sidewalks, curb ramps and other interior or exterior \n     pedestrian ramps; clear floor paths through lobbies, \n     corridors, rooms, and other improved areas; parking access \n     aisles; elevators and lifts; or a combination of these \n     elements.\n       (3) For the purposes of this part, the term ``path of \n     travel'' also includes the restrooms, telephones, and \n     drinking fountains serving the altered area.\n       (e) Disproportionality. (1) Alterations made to provide an \n     accessible path of travel to the altered area will be deemed \n     disproportionate to the overall alteration when the cost \n     exceeds 20% of the cost of the alteration to the primary \n     function area.\n       (2) Costs that may be counted as expenditures required to \n     provide an accessible path of travel may include:\n       (i) Costs associated with providing an accessible entrance \n     and an accessible route to the altered area, for example, the \n     cost of widening doorways or installing ramps;\n       (ii) Costs associated with making restrooms accessible, \n     such as installing grab bars, enlarging toilet stalls, \n     insulating pipes, or installing accessible faucet controls;\n       (iii) Costs associated with providing accessible \n     telephones, such as relocating the telephone to an accessible \n     height, installing amplification devices, or installing a \n     telecommunications device for deaf persons (TDD);\n       (iv) Costs associated with relocating an inaccessible \n     drinking fountain.\n       (f) Duty to provide accessible features in the event of \n     disproportionality. (1) When the cost of alterations \n     necessary to make the path of travel to the altered area \n     fully accessible is disproportionate to the cost of the \n     overall alteration, the path of travel shall be made \n     accessible to the extent that it can be made accessible \n     without incurring disproportionate costs.\n       (2) In choosing which accessible elements to provide, \n     priority should be given to those elements that will provide \n     the greatest access, in the following order:\n       (i) An accessible entrance;\n       (ii) An accessible route to the altered area;\n       (iii) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a \n     single unisex restroom;\n       (iv) Accessible telephones;\n       (v) Accessible drinking fountains; and\n       (vi) When possible, additional accessible elements such as \n     parking, storage, and alarms.\n       (g) Series of smaller alterations. (1) The obligation to \n     provide an accessible path of travel\n\n[[Page S43]]\n\n     may not be evaded by performing a series of small alterations \n     to the area served by a single path of travel if those \n     alterations could have been performed as a single \n     undertaking.\n       (2) (i) If an area containing a primary function has been \n     altered without providing an accessible path of travel to \n     that area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a \n     different area on the same path of travel, are undertaken \n     within three years of the original alteration, the total cost \n     of alterations to the primary function areas on that path of \n     travel during the preceding three year period shall be \n     considered in determining whether the cost of making that \n     path of travel accessible is disproportionate.\n       (ii) Only alterations undertaken after January 1, 1997, \n     shall be considered in determining if the cost of providing \n     an accessible path of travel is disproportionate to the \n     overall cost of the alterations.\n     Sec. 36.404  Alterations: Elevator exemption.\n       (a) This section does not require the installation of an \n     elevator in an altered facility that is less than three \n     stories or has less than 3,000 square feet per story, except \n     with respect to any facility that houses the professional \n     office of a health care provider, a terminal, depot, or other \n     station used for specified public transportation.\n       For the purposes of this section, ``professional office of \n     a health care provider'' means a location where a person or \n     entity employed by a covered entity and/or regulated by a \n     State to provide professional services related to the \n     physical or mental health of an individual makes such \n     services available to the public. The facility that houses a \n     ``professional office of a health care provider'' only \n     includes floor levels housing by at least one health care \n     provider, or any floor level designed or intended for use by \n     at least one health care provider.\n       (b) The exemption provided in paragraph (a) of this section \n     does not obviate or limit in any way the obligation to comply \n     with the other accessibility requirements established in this \n     subpart. For example, alterations to floors above or below \n     the accessible ground floor must be accessible regardless of \n     whether the altered facility has an elevator.\n     Sec. 36.405  Alterations: Historic preservation.\n       (a) Alterations to buildings or facilities that are \n     eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic \n     Places under the National Historic Preservation Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 470 et seq.), or are designated as historic under \n     State or local law, shall comply to the maximum extent \n     feasible with section 4.1.7 of appendix A to this part.\n       (b) If it is determined under the procedures set out in \n     section 4.1.7 of appendix A that it is not feasible to \n     provide physical access to an historic property that is a \n     place of public accommodation in a manner that will not \n     threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building \n     or facility, alternative methods of access shall be provided \n     pursuant to the requirements of subpart C of this part.\n     Sec. 36.406  Standards for new construction and alterations.\n       (a) New construction and alterations subject to this part \n     shall comply with the standards for accessible design \n     published as appendix A to this part (ADAAG).\n       (b) The chart in the appendix to this section provides \n     guidance to the user in reading appendix A to this part \n     (ADAAG) together with subparts A through D of this part, when \n     determining requirements for a particular facility.\n\n                        Appendix to Sec. 36.406\n\n       This chart has no effect for purposes of compliance or \n     enforcement. It does not necessarily provide complete or \n     mandatory information.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     Subparts A-D            ADAAG\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nApplication, General............  36.102(b)(3):       1,2,3,4.1.1.\n                                   public\n                                   accommodations.\n                                  36.102(c):\n                                   commercial\n                                   facilities\n                                  36.102(e): public\n                                   entities\n                                  36.103 (other\n                                   laws)\n                                  36.401 (``for\n                                   first\n                                   occupancy'')\n                                  36.402(a)(alterati\n                                   ons)\nDefinitions.....................  36.104: facility,   3.5 Definitions,\n                                   place of public     including;\n                                   accommodation,      addition,\n                                   public              alteration,\n                                   accommodation,      building,\n                                   public entity.      element,\n                                                       facility, space,\n                                                       story.\n                                  36.401(d)(1)(i),    4.1.6(i),\n                                   36.404(a)(1):       technical\n                                   professional        infeasibility.\n                                   office of a\n                                   health care\n                                   provider\n                                  36.402:\n                                   alteration;\n                                   usability\n                                  36.402(c): to the\n                                   maximum extent\n                                   feasible\n                                  36.401(a) General   4.1.2.\n                                   . .\nNew Construction: General.......  36.207 Places of    4.1.3.\n                                   public\n                                   accommodation in\n                                   private\n                                   residences.\nWork Areas......................  ..................  4.1.1(3).\nStructural Impracticability.....  36.401(c).........  4.1.1(5)(a).\nElevator Exemption..............  36.401(d).........  4.1.3(5).\n                                  36.404............\nOther Exceptions................  ..................  4.1.1(5), 4.1.3(5)\n                                                       and throughout.\nAlterations: General............  36.402............  4.1.6(1).\nAlterations Affecting an Area     36.403............  4.1.6(2).\n Containing A Primary Function;\n Path of Travel;\n Disproportionality.\nAlterations: Special Technical    ..................  4.1.6(3).\n Provisions.\nAdditions.......................  36.401-36.405.....  4.1.5.\nHistoric Preservation...........  36.405............  4.1.7.\nTechnical Provisions............  ..................  4.2 through 4.35.\nFacilities......................  ..................  6.\nBusiness and Mercantile.........  ..................  7.\nLibraries.......................  ..................  8.\nTransient Lodging (Hotels,        ..................  9.\n Homeless Shelters Etc.).\nTransportation Facilities.......  ..................  10.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     Sec. 36.407  Temporary suspension of certain detectable \n         warning requirements.\n       The detectable warning requirements contained in sections \n     4.7.7, 4.29.5, and 4.29.6 of appendix A to this part are \n     suspended temporarily until July 26, 1998.\n     Sec.

Such services are subject to the requirements of \n     section 201 of the CAA.\n     Sec. 37.39  [Reserved]\n\n                  Subpart C--Transportation Facilities\n\n     Sec. 37.41  Construction of transportation facilities by \n         public entities.\n       A public entity shall construct any new facility to be used \n     in providing designated public transportation services so \n     that the facility is readily accessible to and usable by \n     individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use \n     wheelchairs. For purposes of this section, a facility or \n     station is ``new'' if its construction begins (i.e., issuance \n     of notice to proceed) after December 31, 1996.\n     Sec. 37.43  Alteration of transportation facilities by public \n         entity.\n       (a)(1) When a public entity alters an existing facility or \n     a part of an existing facility used in providing designated \n     public transportation services in a way that affects or could \n     affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility, \n     the entity shall make the alterations (or ensure that the \n     alterations are made) in such a manner, to the maximum extent \n     feasible, that the altered portions of the facility are \n     readily accessible to and usable by individuals with \n     disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, upon \n     the completion of such alterations.\n       (2) When a public entity undertakes an alteration that \n     affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area \n     of a facility containing a primary function, the entity shall \n     make the alteration in such a manner that, to the maximum \n     extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area and \n     the bathrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the \n     altered area are readily accessible to and usable by \n     individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use \n     wheelchairs, upon completion of the alterations. Provided, \n     that alterations to the path of travel, drinking fountains, \n     telephones and bathrooms are not required to be made readily \n     accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, \n     including individuals who use wheelchairs, if the cost and \n     scope of doing so would be disproportionate.\n       (3) The requirements of this paragraph also apply to the \n     alteration of existing intercity or commuter rail stations by \n     the responsible person for, owner of, or person in control of \n     the station.\n       (4) The requirements of this section apply to any \n     alteration which begins (i.e., issuance of notice to proceed \n     or work order, as applicable) after December 31, 1996.\n       (b) As used in this section, the phrase to the maximum \n     extent feasible applies to the occasional case where the \n     nature of an existing facility makes it impossible to comply \n     fully with applicable accessibility standards through a \n     planned alteration. In these circumstances, the entity shall \n     provide the maximum physical accessibility feasible. Any \n     altered features of the facility or portion of the facility \n     that can be made accessible shall be made accessible. If \n     providing accessibility to certain individuals with \n     disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would not be \n     feasible, the facility shall be made accessible to \n     individuals with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who \n     use crutches, those who have impaired vision or hearing, or \n     those who have other impairments).\n       (c) As used in this section, a primary function is a major \n     activity for which the facility is intended. Areas of \n     transportation facilities that involve primary functions \n     include, but\n\n[[Page S47]]\n\n     are not necessarily limited to, ticket purchase and \n     collection areas, passenger waiting areas, train or bus \n     platforms, baggage checking and return areas and employment \n     areas (except those involving non-occupiable spaces accessed \n     only by ladders, catwalks, crawl spaces, vary narrow \n     passageways, or freight [non-passenger] elevators which are \n     frequented only by repair personnel).\n       (d) As used in this section, a path of travel includes a \n     continuous, unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means \n     of which the altered area may be approached, entered, and \n     exited, and which connects the altered area with an exterior \n     approach (including sidewalks, parking areas, and streets), \n     an entrance to the facility, and other parts of the facility. \n     The term also includes the restrooms, telephones, and \n     drinking fountains serving the altered area. An accessible \n     path of travel may include walks and sidewalks, curb ramps \n     and other interior or exterior pedestrian ramps, clear floor \n     paths through corridors, waiting areas, concourses, and other \n     improved areas, parking access aisles, elevators and lifts, \n     bridges, tunnels, or other passageways between platforms, or \n     a combination of these and other elements.\n       (e)(1) Alterations made to provide an accessible path of \n     travel to the altered area will be deemed disproportionate to \n     the overall alteration when the cost exceeds 20 percent of \n     the cost of the alteration to the primary function area \n     (without regard to the costs of accessibility modifications).\n       (2) Costs that may be counted as expenditures required to \n     provide an accessible path of travel include:\n       (i) Costs associated with providing an accessible entrance \n     and an accessible route to the altered area (e.g., widening \n     doorways and installing ramps);\n       (ii) Costs associated with making restrooms accessible \n     (e.g., grab bars, enlarged toilet stalls, accessible faucet \n     controls);\n       (iii) Costs associated with providing accessible telephones \n     (e.g., relocation of phones to an accessible height, \n     installation of amplification devices or TTYs);\n       (iv) Costs associated with relocating an inaccessible \n     drinking fountain.\n       (f)(1) When the cost of alterations necessary to make a \n     path of travel to the altered area fully accessible is \n     disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration, then \n     such areas shall be made accessible to the maximum extent \n     without resulting in disproportionate costs;\n       (2) In this situation, the public entity should give \n     priority to accessible elements that will provide the \n     greatest access, in the following order:\n       (i) An accessible entrance;\n       (ii) An accessible route to the altered area;\n       (iii) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a \n     single unisex restroom (where there are one or more \n     restrooms);\n       (iv) Accessible telephones;\n       (v) Accessible drinking fountains;\n       (vi) When possible, other accessible elements (e.g., \n     parking, storage, alarms).\n       (g) If a public entity performs a series of small \n     alterations to the area served by a single path of travel \n     rather than making the alterations as part of a single \n     undertaking, it shall nonetheless be responsible for \n     providing an accessible path of travel.\n       (h)(1) If an area containing a primary function has been \n     altered without providing an accessible path of travel to \n     that area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a \n     different area on the same path of travel, are undertaken \n     within three years of the original alteration, the total cost \n     of alteration to the primary function areas on that path of \n     travel during the preceding three year period shall be \n     considered in determining whether the cost of making that \n     path of travel is disproportionate;\n       (2) For the first three years after January 1, 1997, only \n     alterations undertaken between that date and the date of the \n     alteration at issue shall be considered in determining if the \n     cost of providing accessible features is disproportionate to \n     the overall cost of the alteration.\n       (3) Only alterations undertaken after January 1, 1997, \n     shall be considered in determining if the cost of providing \n     an accessible path of travel is disproportionate to the \n     overall cost of the alteration.\n     Sec. 37.45  Construction and alteration of transportation \n         facilities by covered entities.\n       In constructing and altering transit facilities, covered \n     entities shall comply with the regulations of the Board \n     implementing title III of the ADA, as applied by section 210 \n     of the CAA (part 36).\n     Sec. 37.47  Key stations in light and rapid rail systems.\n       (a) Each public entity that provides designated public \n     transportation by means of a light or rapid rail system shall \n     make key stations on its system readily accessible to and \n     usable by individuals with disabilities, including \n     individuals who use wheelchairs. This requirement is separate \n     from and in addition to requirements set forth in Sec. 37.43 \n     of this part.\n       (b) Each public entity shall determine which stations on \n     its system are key stations. The entity shall identify key \n     stations, using the planning and public participation process \n     set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, and taking into \n     consideration the following criteria:\n       (1) Stations where passenger boardings exceed average \n     station passenger boardings on the rail system by at least \n     fifteen percent, unless such a station is close to another \n     accessible station;\n       (2) Transfer stations on a rail line or between rail lines;\n       (3) Major interchange points with other transportation \n     modes, including stations connecting with major parking \n     facilities, bus terminals, intercity or commuter rail \n     stations, passenger vessel terminals, or airports;\n       (4) End stations, unless an end station is close to another \n     accessible station; and\n       (5) Stations serving major activity centers, such as \n     employment or government centers, institutions of higher \n     education, hospitals or other major health care facilities, \n     or other facilities that are major trip generators for \n     individuals with disabilities.\n       (c)(1) Unless an entity receives an extension under \n     paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the public entity shall \n     achieve accessibility of key stations as soon as practicable, \n     but in no case later than January 1, 2000, except that an \n     entity is not required to complete installation of detectable \n     warnings required by section 10.3.2(2) of appendix A to this \n     part until January 1, 2001.\n       (2) The General Counsel may grant an extension of this \n     completion date for key station accessibility for a period up \n     to January 1, 2025, provided that two-thirds of key stations \n     are made accessible by January 1, 2015. Extensions may be \n     granted as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.\n       (d) The public entity shall develop a plan for compliance \n     for this section. The plan shall be submitted to the General \n     Counsel's office by July 1, 1997.\n       (1) The public entity shall consult with individuals with \n     disabilities affected by the plan. The public entity also \n     shall hold at least one public hearing on the plan and \n     solicit comments on it. The plan submitted to General Counsel \n     shall document this public participation, including summaries \n     of the consultation with individuals with disabilities and \n     the comments received at the hearing and during the comment \n     period. The plan also shall summarize the public entity's \n     responses to the comments and consultation.\n       (2) The plan shall establish milestones for the achievement \n     of required accessibility of key stations, consistent with \n     the requirements of this section.\n       (e) A public entity wishing to apply for an extension of \n     the January 1, 2000, deadline for key station accessibility \n     shall include a request for an extension with its plan \n     submitted to the General Counsel under paragraph (d) of this \n     section. Extensions may be granted only with respect to key \n     stations which need extraordinarily expensive structural \n     changes to, or replacement of, existing facilities (e.g., \n     installations of elevators, raising the entire passenger \n     platform, or alterations of similar magnitude and cost). \n     Requests for extensions shall provide for completion of key \n     station accessibility within the time limits set forth in \n     paragraph (c) of this section. The General Counsel may \n     approve, approve with conditions, modify, or disapprove any \n     request for an extension.\n     Sec. Sec. 37.49-37.59  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 37.61  Public transportation programs and activities in \n         existing facilities.\n       (a) A public entity shall operate a designated public \n     transportation program or activity conducted in an existing \n     facility so that, when viewed in its entirety, the program or \n     activity is readily accessible to and usable by individuals \n     with disabilities.\n       (b) This section does not require a public entity to make \n     structural changes to existing facilities in order to make \n     the facilities accessible by individuals who use wheelchairs, \n     unless and to the extent required by Sec. 37.43 (with respect \n     to alterations) or Sec. 37.47 of this part (with respect to \n     key stations). Entities shall comply with other applicable \n     accessibility requirements for such facilities.\n       (c) Public entities, with respect to facilities that, as \n     provided in paragraph (b) of this section, are not required \n     to be made accessible to individuals who use wheelchairs, are \n     not required to provide to such individuals services made \n     available to the general public at such facilities when the \n     individuals could not utilize or benefit from the services.\n     Sec. Sec. 37.63-37.69  [Reserved]\n\n   Subpart D--Acquisition of Accessible Vehicles by Public Entities.\n\n     Sec. 37.71  Purchase or lease of new non-rail vehicles by \n         public entities operating fixed route systems.\n       (a) Except as provided elsewhere in this section, each \n     public entity operating a fixed route system making a \n     solicitation after January 31, 1997, to purchase or lease a \n     new bus or other new vehicle for use on the system, shall \n     ensure that the vehicle is readily accessible to and usable \n     by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who \n     use wheelchairs.\n       (b) A public entity may purchase or lease a new bus that is \n     not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with \n     disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, if \n     it applies for, and the General Counsel grants, a waiver as \n     provided for in this section.\n       (c) Before submitting a request for such a waiver, the \n     public entity shall hold at least one public hearing \n     concerning the proposed request.\n       (d) The General Counsel may grant a request for such a \n     waiver if the public entity demonstrates to the General \n     Counsel's satisfaction that--\n       (1) The initial solicitation for new buses made by the \n     public entity specified that all new buses were to be lift-\n     equipped and were to be otherwise accessible to and usable by \n     individuals with disabilities;\n       (2) Hydraulic, electromechanical, or other lifts for such \n     new buses could not be provided\n\n[[Page S48]]\n\n     by any qualified lift manufacturer to the manufacturer of \n     such new buses in sufficient time to comply with the \n     solicitation; and\n       (3) Any further delay in purchasing new buses equipped with \n     such necessary lifts would significantly impair \n     transportation services in the community served by the public \n     entity.\n       (e) The public entity shall include with its waiver request \n     a copy of the initial solicitation and written documentation \n     from the bus manufacturer of its good faith efforts to obtain \n     lifts in time to comply with the solicitation, and a full \n     justification for the assertion that the delay in bus \n     procurement needed to obtain a lift-equipped bus would \n     significantly impair transportation services in the \n     community. This documentation shall include a specific date \n     at which the lifts could be supplied, copies of \n     advertisements in trade publications and inquiries to trade \n     associations seeking lifts, and documentation of the public \n     hearing.\n       (f) Any waiver granted by the General Counsel under this \n     section shall be subject to the following conditions:\n       (1) The waiver shall apply only to the particular bus \n     delivery to which the waiver request pertains;\n       (2) The waiver shall include a termination date, which will \n     be based on information concerning when lifts will become \n     available for installation on the new buses the public entity \n     is purchasing. Buses delivered after this date, even \n     though procured under a solicitation to which a waiver \n     applied, shall be equipped with lifts;\n        (3) Any bus obtained subject to the waiver shall be \n     capable of accepting a lift, and the public entity shall \n     install a lift as soon as soon as one becomes available;\n        (4) Such other terms and conditions as the General Counsel \n     may impose.\n        (g)(1) When the General Counsel grants a waiver under this \n     section, he/she shall promptly notify any appropriate \n     committees of Congress.\n        (2) If the General Counsel has reasonable cause to believe \n     that a public entity fraudulently applied for a waiver under \n     this section, the General Counsel shall:\n        (i) Cancel the waiver if it is still in effect; and\n        (ii) Take other appropriate action.\n      Sec. 37.73  Purchase or lease of used non-rail vehicles by \n         public entities operating a fixed route system.\n       (a) Except as provided elsewhere in this section, each \n     public entity operating a fixed route system purchasing or \n     leasing, after January 31, 1997, a used bus or other used \n     vehicle for use on the system, shall ensure that the vehicle \n     is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with \n     disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs.\n       (b) A public entity may purchase or lease a used vehicle \n     for use on its fixed route system that is not readily \n     accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities if, \n     after making demonstrated good faith efforts to obtain an \n     accessible vehicle, it is unable to do so.\n       (c) Good faith efforts shall include at least the following \n     steps:\n       (1) An initial solicitation for used vehicles specifying \n     that all used vehicles are to be lift-equipped and otherwise \n     accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, \n     or, if an initial solicitation is not used, a documented \n     communication so stating;\n       (2) A nationwide search for accessible vehicles, involving \n     specific inquiries to used vehicle dealers and other transit \n     providers; and\n       (3) Advertising in trade publications and contacting trade \n     associations.\n       (d) Each public entity purchasing or leasing used vehicles \n     that are not readily accessible to and usable by individuals \n     with disabilities shall retain documentation of the specific \n     good faith efforts it made for three years from the date the \n     vehicles were purchased. These records shall be made \n     available, on request, to the General Counsel and the public.\n      Sec. 37.75  Remanufacture of non-rail vehicles and purchase \n         or lease of remanufactured non-rail vehicles by public \n         entities operating fixed route systems.\n       (a) This section applies to any public entity operating a \n     fixed route system which takes one of the following actions:\n       (1) After January 31, 1997, remanufactures a bus or other \n     vehicle so as to extend its useful life for five years or \n     more or makes a solicitation for such remanufacturing; or\n       (2) Purchases or leases a bus or other vehicle which has \n     been remanufactured so as to extend its useful life for five \n     years or more, where the purchase or lease occurs after \n     January 31, 1997, and during the period in which the useful \n     life of the vehicle is extended.\n       (b) Vehicles acquired through the actions listed in \n     paragraph (a) of this section shall, to the maximum extent \n     feasible, be readily accessible to and usable by individuals \n     with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs.\n       (c) For purposes of this section, it shall be considered \n     feasible to remanufacture a bus or other motor vehicle so as \n     to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with \n     disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, \n     unless an engineering analysis demonstrates that including \n     accessibility features required by this part would have a \n     significant adverse effect on the structural integrity of the \n     vehicle.\n       (d) If a public entity operates a fixed route system, any \n     segment of which is included on the National Register of \n     Historic Places, and if making a vehicle of historic \n     character used solely on such segment readily accessible to \n     and usable by individuals with disabilities would \n     significantly alter the historic character of such vehicle, \n     the public entity has only to make (or purchase or lease a \n     remanufactured vehicle with) those modifications to make the \n     vehicle accessible which do not alter the historic character \n     of such vehicle, in consultation with the National Register \n     of Historic Places.\n       (e) A public entity operating a fixed route system as \n     described in paragraph (d) of this section may apply in \n     writing to the General Counsel for a determination of the \n     historic character of the vehicle. The General Counsel shall \n     refer such requests to the National Register of Historic \n     Places, and shall rely on its advice in making determinations \n     of the historic character of the vehicle.\n      Sec. 37.77  Purchase or lease of new non-rail vehicles by \n         public entities operating a demand responsive system for \n         the general public.\n       (a) Except as provided in this section, a public entity \n     operating a demand responsive system for the general public \n     making a solicitation after January 31, 1997, to purchase or \n     lease a new bus or other new vehicle for use on the \n     system, shall ensure that the vehicle is readily \n     accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, \n     including individuals who use wheelchairs.\n        (b) If the system, when viewed in its entirety, provides a \n     level of service to individuals with disabilities, including \n     individuals who use wheelchairs, equivalent to the level of \n     service it provides to individuals without disabilities, it \n     may purchase new vehicles that are not readily accessible to \n     and usable by individuals with disabilities.\n        (c) For purposes of this section, a demand responsive \n     system, when viewed in its entirety, shall be deemed to \n     provide equivalent service if the service available to \n     individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use \n     wheelchairs, is provided in the most integrated setting \n     appropriate to the needs of the individual and is equivalent \n     to the service provided other individuals with respect to the \n     following service characteristics:\n        (1) Response time;\n        (2) Fares;\n       (3) Geographic area of service;\n        (4) Hours and days of service;\n       (5) Restrictions or priorities based on trip purpose;\n       (6) Availability of information and reservations \n     capability; and\n       (7) Any constraints on capacity or service availability.\n       (d) A public entity, which determines that its service to \n     individuals with disabilities is equivalent to that provided \n     other persons shall, before any procurement of an \n     inaccessible vehicle, make a certificate that it provides \n     equivalent service meeting the standards of paragraph (c) of \n     this section.

However, only the cost of service to CAA \n     paratransit eligible individuals may be considered in a \n     public entity's request for an undue financial burden waiver \n     under Sec. Sec. 37.151-37.155 of this part.\n       (e) The following individuals are CAA paratransit eligible:\n       (1) Any individual with a disability who is unable, as the \n     result of a physical or mental impairment (including a vision \n     impairment), and without the assistance of another individual \n     (except the operator of a wheelchair lift or other boarding \n     assistance device), to board, ride, or disembark from any \n     vehicle on the system which is readily accessible to and \n     usable by individuals with disabilities.\n       (2) Any individual with a disability who needs the \n     assistance of a wheelchair lift or other boarding assistance \n     device and is able, with such assistance, to board, ride and \n     disembark from any vehicle which is readily accessible to and \n     usable by individuals with disabilities if the individual \n     wants to travel on a route on the system during the hours of \n     operation of the system at a time, or within a reasonable \n     period of such time, when such a vehicle is not being used to \n     provide designated public transportation on the route.\n       (i) An individual is eligible under this paragraph with \n     respect to travel on an otherwise accessible route on which \n     the boarding or disembarking location which the individual \n     would use is one at which boarding or disembarking from the \n     vehicle is precluded as provided in Sec. 37.167(g) of this \n     part.\n       (ii) An individual using a common wheelchair is eligible \n     under this paragraph if the individual's wheelchair cannot be \n     accommodated on an existing vehicle (e.g., because the \n     vehicle's lift does not meet the standards of part 38 of \n     these regulations), even if that vehicle is accessible to \n     other individuals with disabilities and their mobility \n     wheelchairs.\n       (iii) With respect to rail systems, an individual is \n     eligible under this paragraph if the individual could use an \n     accessible rail system, but\n       (A) there is not yet one accessible car per train on the \n     system; or\n       (B) key stations have not yet been made accessible.\n       (3) Any individual with a disability who has a specific \n     impairment-related condition which prevents such individual \n     from traveling to a boarding location or from a disembarking \n     location on such system.\n       (i) Only a specific impairment-related condition which \n     prevents the individual from traveling to a boarding location \n     or from a disembarking location is a basis for eligibility \n     under this paragraph. A condition which makes traveling to \n     boarding location or from a disembarking location more \n     difficult for a person with a specific impairment-related \n     condition than for an individual who does not have the \n     condition, but\n\n[[Page S50]]\n\n     does not prevent the travel, is not a basis for eligibility \n     under this paragraph.\n       (ii) Architectural barriers not under the control of the \n     public entity providing fixed route service and environmental \n     barriers (e.g., distance, terrain, weather) do not, standing \n     alone, form a basis for eligibility under this paragraph. The \n     interaction of such barriers with an individual's specific \n     impairment-related condition may form a basis for eligibility \n     under this paragraph, if the effect is to prevent the \n     individual from traveling to a boarding location or from a \n     disembarking location.\n       (f) Individuals accompanying a CAA paratransit eligible \n     individual shall be provided service as follows:\n       (1) One other individual accompanying the CAA paratransit \n     eligible individual shall be provided service.\n       (i) If the CAA paratransit eligible individual is traveling \n     with a personal care attendant, the entity shall provide \n     service to one other individual in addition to the attendant \n     who is accompanying the eligible individual.\n       (ii) A family member or friend is regarded as a person \n     accompanying the eligible individual, and not as a personal \n     care attendant, unless the family member or friend registered \n     is acting in the capacity of a personal care attendant;\n       (2) Additional individuals accompanying the CAA paratransit \n     eligible individual shall be provided service, provided that \n     space is available for them on the paratransit vehicle \n     carrying the CAA paratransit eligible individual and that \n     transportation of the additional individuals will not result \n     in a denial of service to CAA paratransit eligible \n     individuals.\n       (3) In order to be considered as ``accompanying'' the \n     eligible individual for purposes of this paragraph, the other \n     individual(s) shall have the same origin and destination as \n     the eligible individual.\n     Sec. 37.125  CAA paratransit eligibility: process.\n       Each public entity required to provide complementary \n     paratransit service by Sec. 37.121 of this part shall \n     establish a process for determining CAA paratransit \n     eligibility.\n       (a) The process shall strictly limit CAA paratransit \n     eligibility to individuals specified in Sec. 37.123 of this \n     part.\n       (b) All information about the process, materials necessary \n     to apply for eligibility, and notices and determinations \n     concerning eligibility shall be made available in accessible \n     formats, upon request.\n       (c) If, by a date 21 days following the submission of a \n     complete application, the entity has not made a determination \n     of eligibility, the applicant shall be treated as eligible \n     and provide service until and unless the entity denies the \n     application.\n       (d) The entity's determination concerning eligibility shall \n     be in writing. If the determination is that the individual is \n     ineligible, the determination shall state the reasons for the \n     finding.\n       (e) The public entity shall provide documentation to each \n     eligible individual stating that he or she is ``CAA \n     Paratransit Eligible.'' The documentation shall include the \n     name of the eligible individual, the name of the transit \n     provider, the telephone number of the entity's paratransit \n     coordinator, an expiration date for eligibility, and any \n     conditions or limitations on the individual's eligibility \n     including the use of a personal care attendant.\n       (f) The entity may require recertification of the \n     eligibility of CAA paratransit eligible individuals at \n     reasonable intervals.\n       (g) The entity shall establish an administrative appeal \n     process through which individuals who are denied eligibility \n     can obtain review of the denial.\n       (1) The entity may require that an appeal be filed within \n     60 days of the denial of an individual's application.\n       (2) The process shall include an opportunity to be heard \n     and to present information and arguments, separation of \n     functions (i.e., a decision by a person not involved with the \n     initial decision to deny eligibility), and written \n     notification of the decision, and the reasons for it;\n       (3) The entity is not required to provide paratransit \n     service to the individual pending the determination on \n     appeal. However, if the entity has not made a decision within \n     30 days of the completion of the appeal process, the entity \n     shall provide paratransit service from that time until and \n     unless a decision to deny the appeal is issued.\n       (h) The entity may establish an administrative process to \n     suspend, for a reasonable period of time, the provision of \n     complementary paratransit service to CAA eligible individuals \n     who establish a pattern or practice of missing scheduled \n     trips.\n       (1) Trips missed by the individual for reasons beyond his \n     or her control (including, but not limited to, trips which \n     are missed due to operator error) shall not be a basis for \n     determining that such a pattern or practice exists.\n       (2) Before suspending service, the entity shall take the \n     following steps:\n       (i) Notify the individual in writing that the entity \n     proposes to suspend service, citing with specificity the \n     basis of the proposed suspension and setting forth the \n     proposed sanction;\n       (ii) Provide the individual an opportunity to be heard and \n     to present information and arguments;\n       (iii) Provide the individual with written notification of \n     the decision and the reasons for it.\n       (3) The appeals process of paragraph (g) of this section is \n     available to an individual on whom sanctions have been \n     imposed under this paragraph. The sanction is stayed pending \n     the outcome of the appeal.\n       (i) In applications for CAA paratransit eligibility, the \n     entity may require the applicant to indicate whether or not \n     he or she travels with a personal care attendant.\n     Sec. 37.127  Complementary paratransit service for visitors.\n       (a) Each public entity required to provide complementary \n     paratransit service under Sec. 37.121 of this part shall make \n     the service available to visitors as provided in this \n     section.\n       (b) For purposes of this section, a visitor is an \n     individual with disabilities who does not reside in the \n     jurisdiction(s) served by the public entity or other entities \n     with which the public entity provides coordinated \n     complementary paratransit service within a region.\n       (c) Each public entity shall treat as eligible for its \n     complementary paratransit service all visitors who present \n     documentation that they are CAA paratransit eligible, under \n     the criteria of Sec. 37.125 of this part, in the jurisdiction \n     in which they reside.\n       (d) With respect to visitors with disabilities who do not \n     present such documentation, the public entity may require the \n     documentation of the individual's place of residence and, if \n     the individual's disability is not apparent, of his or her \n     disability. The entity shall provide paratransit service to \n     individuals with disabilities who qualify as visitors under \n     paragraph (b) of this section. The entity shall accept a \n     certification by such individuals that they are unable to use \n     fixed route transit.\n       (e) A public entity shall make the service to a visitor \n     required by this section available for any combination of 21 \n     days during any 365-day period beginning with the visitor's \n     first use of the service during such 365-day period. In no \n     case shall the public entity require a visitor to apply for \n     or receive eligibility certification from the public entity \n     before receiving the service required by this section.\n     Sec. 37.129  Types of service.\n       (a) Except as provided in this section, complementary \n     paratransit service for CAA paratransit eligible persons \n     shall be origin-to-destination service.\n       (b) Complementary paratransit service for CAA paratransit \n     eligible persons described in Sec. 37.123(e)(2) of this part \n     may also be provided by on-call bus service or paratransit \n     feeder service to an accessible fixed route, where such \n     service enables the individual to use the fixed route bus \n     system for his or her trip.\n       (c) Complementary paratransit service for CAA eligible \n     persons described in Sec. 37.123 (e)(3) of this part also may \n     be provided by paratransit feeder service to and/or from an \n     accessible fixed route.\n     Sec. 37.131 Service criteria for complementary paratransit.\n       The following service criteria apply to complementary \n     paratransit required by Sec. 37.121 of this part.\n       (a) Service Area--(1) Bus. (i) The entity shall provide \n     complementary paratransit service to origins and destinations \n     within corridors with a width of three-fourths of a mile on \n     each side of each fixed route. The corridor shall include an \n     area with a three-fourths of a mile radius at the ends of \n     each fixed route.\n       (ii) Within the core service area, the entity also shall \n     provide service to small areas not inside any of the \n     corridors but which are surrounded by corridors.\n       (iii) Outside the core service area, the entity may \n     designate corridors with widths from three fourths of a mile \n     up to one and one half miles on each side of a fixed route, \n     based on local circumstances.\n       (iv) For purposes of this paragraph, the core service area \n     is that area in which corridors with a width of three-fourths \n     of a mile on each side of each fixed route merge together \n     such that, with few and small exceptions, all origins and \n     destinations within the area would be served.\n       (2) Rail. (i) For rail systems, the service area shall \n     consist of a circle with a radius of \\3/4\\ of a mile around \n     each station.\n       (ii) At end stations and other stations in outlying areas, \n     the entity may designate circles with radii of up to 1\\1/2\\ \n     miles as part of its service area, based on local \n     circumstances.\n       (3) Jurisdictional Boundaries. Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this paragraph, an entity is not required to \n     provide paratransit service in an area outside the boundaries \n     of the jurisdiction(s) in which it operates, if the entity \n     does not have legal authority to operate in that area. The \n     entity shall take all practicable steps to provide \n     paratransit service to any part of its service area.\n       (b) Response Time. The entity shall schedule and provide \n     paratransit service to any CAA paratransit eligible person at \n     any requested time on a particular day in response to a \n     request for service made the previous day. Reservations may \n     be taken by reservation agents or by mechanical means.\n       (1) The entity shall make reservation service available \n     during at least all normal business hours of the entity's \n     administrative offices, as well as during times, comparable \n     to normal business hours, on a day when the entity's offices \n     are not open before a service day.\n       (2) The entity may negotiate pickup times with the \n     individual, but the entity shall not require a CAA \n     paratransit eligible individual to schedule a trip to begin \n     more than one hour before or after the individual's desired \n     departure time.\n\n[[Page S51]]\n\n       (3) The entity may use real-time scheduling in providing \n     complementary paratransit service.\n       (4) The entity may permit advance reservations to be made \n     up to 14 days in advance of a CAA paratransit eligible \n     individual's desired trips. When an entity proposes to change \n     its reservations system, it shall comply with the public \n     participation requirements equivalent to those of \n     Sec. 37.131(b) and (c).\n       (c) Fares. The fare for a trip charged to a CAA paratransit \n     eligible user of the complementary paratransit service shall \n     not exceed twice the fare that would be charged to an \n     individual paying full fare (i.e., without regard to \n     discounts) for a trip of similar length, at a similar time of \n     day, on the entity's fixed route system.\n       (1) In calculating the full fare that would be paid by an \n     individual using the fixed route system, the entity may \n     include transfer and premium charges applicable to a trip of \n     similar length, at a similar time of day, on the fixed route \n     system.\n       (2) The fares for individuals accompanying CAA paratransit \n     eligible individuals, who are provided service under \n     Sec. 37.123(f) of this part, shall be the same as for the CAA \n     paratransit eligible individuals they are accompanying.\n       (3) A personal care attendant shall not be charged for \n     complementary paratransit service.\n       (4) The entity may charge a fare higher than otherwise \n     permitted by this paragraph to a social service agency or \n     other organization for agency trips (i.e., trips guaranteed \n     to the organization).\n       (d) Trip Purpose Restrictions. The entity shall not impose \n     restrictions or priorities based on trip purpose.\n       (e) Hours and Days of Service. The complementary \n     paratransit service shall be available throughout the same \n     hours and days as the entity's fixed route service.\n       (f) Capacity Constraints. The entity shall not limit the \n     availability of complementary paratransit service to CAA \n     paratransit eligible individuals by any of the following:\n       (1) Restrictions on the number of trips an individual will \n     be provided;\n       (2) Waiting lists for access to the service; or\n       (3) Any operational pattern or practice that significantly \n     limits the availability of service to CAA paratransit \n     eligible persons.\n       (i) Such patterns or practices include, but are not limited \n     to, the following:\n       (A) Substantial numbers of significantly untimely pickups \n     for initial or return trips;\n       (B) Substantial numbers of trip denials or missed trips;\n       (C) Substantial numbers of trips with excessive trip \n     lengths.\n       (ii) Operational problems attributable to causes beyond the \n     control of the entity (including, but not limited to, weather \n     or traffic conditions affecting all vehicular traffic that \n     were not anticipated at the time a trip was scheduled) shall \n     not be a basis for determining that such a pattern or \n     practice exists.\n       (g) Additional Service. Public entities may provide \n     complementary paratransit service to CAA paratransit eligible \n     individuals exceeding that provided for in this section. \n     However, only the cost of service provided for in this \n     section may be considered in a public entity's request for an \n     undue financial burden waiver under Sec. Sec. 37.151-37.155 \n     of this part.\n     Sec. 37.133  Subscription Service.\n       (a) This part does not prohibit the use of subscription \n     service by public entities as part of a complementary \n     paratransit system, subject to the limitations in this \n     section.\n       (b) Subscription service may not absorb more than fifty \n     percent of the number of trips available at a given time of \n     day, unless there is excess non-subscription capacity.\n       (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the \n     entity may establish waiting lists or other capacity \n     constraints and trip purpose restrictions or priorities for \n     participation in the subscription service only.\n     Sec. 37.135  Submission of paratransit plan.\n       (a) General.

Except as provided in Sec. 37.141 \n     of this part, each entity shall submit its initial plan for \n     compliance with the complementary paratransit service \n     provision by June 1, 1998, to the appropriate location \n     identified in paragraph (f) of this section.\n       (c) Annual Updates. Except as provided in this paragraph, \n     each entity shall submit its annual update to the plan on \n     June 1 of each succeeding year.\n       (1) If an entity has met and is continuing to meet all \n     requirements for complementary paratransit in \n     Sec. Sec. 37.121-37.133 of this part, the entity may submit \n     to the General Counsel an annual certification of continued \n     compliance in lieu of a plan update. Entities that have \n     submitted a joint plan under Sec. 37.141 may submit a joint \n     certification under this paragraph. The requirements of \n     Sec. Sec. 37.137(a) and (b), 37.138 and 37.139 do not apply \n     when a certification is submitted under this paragraph.\n       (2) In the event of any change in circumstances that \n     results in an entity which has submitted a certification of \n     continued compliance falling short of compliance with \n     Sec. Sec. 37.121-37.133, the entity shall immediately notify \n     the General Counsel in writing of the problem. In this case, \n     the entity shall also file a plan update meeting the \n     requirements of Sec. Sec. 37.137-37.139 of this part on the \n     next following June 1 and in each succeeding year until the \n     entity returns to full compliance.\n       (3) An entity that has demonstrated undue financial burden \n     to the General Counsel shall file a plan update meeting the \n     requirements of Sec. Sec. 37.137-37.139 of this part on each \n     June 1 until full compliance with Sec. Sec. 37.121-37.133 is \n     attained.\n       (4) If the General Counsel reasonably believes that an \n     entity may not be fully complying with all service criteria, \n     the General Counsel may require the entity to provide an \n     annual update to its plan.\n       (d) Phase-in of Implementation. Each plan shall provide for \n     full compliance by no later than June 1, 2003, unless the \n     entity has received a waiver based on undue financial burden. \n     If the date for full compliance specified in the plan is \n     after June 1, 1999, the plan shall include milestones, \n     providing for measured, proportional progress toward full \n     compliance.\n       (e) Plan Implementation. Each entity shall begin \n     implementation of its plan on June 1, 1998.\n       (f) Submission Locations. An entity shall submit its plan \n     to the General Counsel's office\n     Sec. 37.137  Paratransit plan development.\n       (a) Survey of existing services.

Each submitting entity shall solicit \n     participation in the development of its plan by the widest \n     range of persons anticipated to use its paratransit service. \n     Each entity shall develop contacts, mailing lists and other \n     appropriate means for notification of opportunities to \n     participate in the development of the paratransit plan.\n       (2) Consultation with individuals with disabilities. Each \n     entity shall contact individuals with disabilities and groups \n     representing them in the community. Consultation shall begin \n     at an early stage in the plan development and should involve \n     persons with disabilities in all phases of plan development. \n     All documents and other information concerning the planning \n     procedure and the provision of service shall be available, \n     upon request, to members of the pubic, except where \n     disclosure would be an unwarranted invasion of personal \n     privacy.\n       (3) Opportunity for public comment. The submitting entity \n     shall make its plan available for review before the plan is \n     finalized. In making the plan available for public review, \n     the entity shall ensure that the plan is available upon \n     request in accessible formats.\n       (4) Public hearing. The entity shall sponsor at a minimum \n     one public hearing and shall provide adequate notice of the \n     hearing, including advertisement in appropriate media, such \n     as newspapers of general and special interest circulation and \n     radio announcements; and\n       (5) Special requirements. If the entity intends to phase-in \n     its paratransit service over a multi-year period, or request \n     a waiver based on undue financial burden, the public hearing \n     shall afford the opportunity for interested citizens to \n     express their views concerning the phase-in, the request, and \n     which service criteria may be delayed in implementation.\n       (c) Ongoing requirement. The entity shall create an ongoing \n     mechanism for the participation of individuals with \n     disabilities in the continued development and assessment of \n     services to persons with disabilities. This includes, but is \n     not limited to, the development of the initial plan, any \n     request for an undue financial burden waiver, and each annual \n     submission.\n     Sec. 37.139  Plan contents.\n       Each plan shall contain the following information:\n       (a) Identification of the entity or entities submitting the \n     plan, specifying for each--\n       (1) Name and address; and\n       (2) Contact person for the plan, with telephone number and \n     facsimile telephone number (FAX), if applicable.\n       (b) A description of the fixed route system as of January \n     1, 1997 (or subsequent year for annual updates), including--\n       (1) A description of the service area, route structure, \n     days and hours of service, fare structure, and population \n     served.

An entity \n     wishing to join with other entities after its initial \n     submission may do so by meeting the filing requirements of \n     this section.\n     Sec. 37.143  Paratransit plan implementation.\n       (a) Each entity shall begin implementation of its \n     complementary paratransit plan, pending notice from the \n     General Counsel. The implementation of the plan shall be \n     consistent with the terms of the plan, including any \n     specified phase-in period.\n       (b) If the plan contains a request for a waiver based on \n     undue financial burden, the entity shall begin implementation \n     of its plan, pending a determination on its waiver request.\n     Sec. 37.145  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 37.147  Considerations during General Counsel review.\n       In reviewing each plan, at a minimum the General Counsel \n     will consider the following:\n       (a) Whether the plan was filed on time;\n       (b) Comments submitted by the state, if applicable;\n       (c) Whether the plan contains responsive elements for each \n     component required under Sec. 37.139 of this part;\n       (d) Whether the plan, when viewed in its entirety, provides \n     for paratransit service comparable to the entity's fixed \n     route service;\n       (e) Whether the entity complied with the public \n     participation efforts required by this part; and\n       (f) The extent to which efforts were made to coordinate \n     with other public entities with overlapping or contiguous \n     service areas or jurisdictions.\n     Sec. 37.149  Disapproved plans.\n       (a) If a plan is disapproved in whole or in part, the \n     General Counsel will specify which provisions are \n     disapproved. Each entity shall amend its plan consistent with \n     this information and resubmit the plan to the General \n     Counsel's office within 90 days of receipt of the disapproval \n     letter.\n       (b) Each entity revising its plan shall continue to comply \n     with the public participation requirements applicable to the \n     initial development of the plan (set out in Sec. 37.137 of \n     this part).\n     Sec. 37.151  Waiver for undue financial burden.\n       If compliance with the service criteria of Sec. 37.131 of \n     this part creates an undue financial burden, an entity may \n     request a waiver from all or some of the provisions if the \n     entity has complied with the public participation \n     requirements in Sec. 37.137 of this part and if the following \n     conditions apply:\n       (a) At the time of submission of the initial plan on June \n     1, 1998--\n       (1) The entity determines that it cannot meet all of the \n     service criteria by June 1, 2003; or\n       (2) The entity determines that it cannot make measured \n     progress toward compliance in any year before full compliance \n     is required. For purposes of this part, measured progress \n     means implementing milestones as scheduled, such as \n     incorporating an additional paratransit service criterion or \n     improving an aspect of a specific service criterion.\n       (b) At the time of its annual plan update submission, if \n     the entity believes that circumstances have changed since its \n     last submission, and it is no longer able to comply by June \n     1, 2003, or make measured progress in any year before 2003, \n     as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n     Sec. 37.153  General Counsel waiver determination.\n       (a) The General Counsel will determine whether to grant a \n     waiver for undue financial burden on a case-by-case basis, \n     after considering the factors identified in Sec. 37.155\n\n[[Page S53]]\n\n     of this part and the information accompanying the request. If \n     necessary, the General Counsel will return the application \n     with a request for additional information.\n       (b) Any waiver granted will be for a limited and specified \n     period of time.\n       (c) If the General Counsel grants the applicant a waiver, \n     the General Counsel will do one of the following:\n       (1) Require the public entity to provide complementary \n     paratransit to the extent it can do so without incurring an \n     undue financial burden. The entity shall make changes in its \n     plan that the General Counsel determines are appropriate to \n     maximize the complementary paratransit service that is \n     provided to CAA paratransit eligible individuals. When making \n     changes to its plan, the entity shall use the public \n     participation process specified for plan development and \n     shall consider first a reduction in number of trips provided \n     to each CAA paratransit eligible person per month, while \n     attempting to meet all other service criteria.\n       (2) Require the pubic entity to provide basic complementary \n     paratransit services to all CAA paratransit eligible \n     individuals, even if doing so would cause the public entity \n     to incur an undue financial burden. Basic complementary \n     paratransit service shall include at least complementary \n     paratransit service in corridors defined as provided in \n     Sec. 37.131(a) along the public entity's key routes during \n     core service hours.\n       (i) For purposes of this section, key routes are defined as \n     routes along which there is service at least hourly \n     throughout the day.\n       (ii) For purposes of this section, core service hours \n     encompass at least peak periods, as these periods are defined \n     locally for fixed route service, consistent with industry \n     practice.\n       (3) If the General Counsel determines that the public \n     entity will incur an undue financial burden as the result of \n     providing basic complementary paratransit service, such that \n     it is infeasible for the entity to provide basic \n     complementary paratransit service, the Administrator shall \n     require the public entity to coordinate with other available \n     providers of demand responsive service in the area served by \n     the public entity to maximize the service to CAA paratransit \n     eligible individuals to the maximum extent feasible.\n     Sec. 37.155  Factors in decision to grant an undue financial \n         burden waiver.\n       (a) In making an undue financial burden determination, the \n     General Counsel will consider the following factors:\n       (1) Effects on current fixed route service, including \n     reallocation of accessible fixed route vehicles and potential \n     reduction in service, measured by service miles;\n       (2) Average number of trips made by the entity's general \n     population, on a per capita basis, compared with the average \n     number of trips to be made by registered CAA paratransit \n     eligible persons, on a per capita basis;\n       (3) Reductions in other services, including other special \n     services;\n       (4) Increases in fares;\n       (5) Resources available to implement complementary \n     paratransit service over the period covered by the plan;\n       (6) Percentage of budget needed to implement the plan, both \n     as a percentage of operating budget and a percentage of \n     entire budget;\n       (7) The current level of accessible service, both fixed \n     route and paratransit;\n       (8) Cooperation/coordination among area transportation \n     providers;\n       (9) Evidence of increased efficiencies, that have been or \n     could be effectuated, that would benefit the level and \n     quality of available resources for complementary paratransit \n     service; and\n       (10) Unique circumstances in the submitting entity's area \n     that affect the ability of the entity to provide paratransit, \n     that militate against the need to provide paratransit, or in \n     some other respect create a circumstance considered \n     exceptional by the submitting entity.\n       (b)(1) Costs attributable to complementary paratransit \n     shall be limited to costs of providing service specifically \n     required by this part to CAA paratransit eligible \n     individuals, by entities responsible under this part for \n     providing such service.\n       (2) If the entity determines that it is impracticable to \n     distinguish between trips mandated by the CAA and other trips \n     on a trip-by-trip basis, the entity shall attribute to CAA \n     complementary paratransit requirements a percentage of its \n     overall paratransit costs. This percentage shall be \n     determined by a statistically valid methodology that \n     determines the percentage of trips that are required by this \n     part. The entity shall submit information concerning its \n     methodology and the data on which its percentage is based \n     with its request for a waiver. Only costs attributable to \n     CAA-mandated trips may be considered with respect to a \n     request for an undue financial burden waiver.\n       (3) Funds to which the entity would be legally entitled, \n     but which, as a matter of State or local funding \n     arrangements, are provided to another entity and used by that \n     entity to provide paratransit service which is part of a \n     coordinated system of paratransit meeting the requirements of \n     this part, may be counted in determining the burden \n     associated with the waiver request.\n\n                    Subpart G--Provision of Service\n\n     Sec. 37.161  Maintenance of accessible features: general.\n       (a) Public and covered entities providing transportation \n     services shall maintain in operative condition those features \n     of facilities and vehicles that are required to make the \n     vehicles and facilities readily accessible to and usable by \n     individuals with disabilities. These features include, but \n     are not limited to, lifts and other means of access to \n     vehicles, securement devices, elevators, signage and systems \n     to facilitate communications with persons with impaired \n     vision or hearing.\n       (b) Accessibility features shall be repaired promptly if \n     they are damaged or out of order. When an accessibility \n     feature is out of order, the entity shall take reasonable \n     steps to accommodate individuals with disabilities who would \n     otherwise use the feature.\n       (c) This section does not prohibit isolated or temporary \n     interruptions in service or access due to maintenance or \n     repairs.\n     Sec. 37.163  Keeping vehicle lifts in operative condition: \n         public entities.\n       (a) This section applies only to public entities with \n     respect to lifts in non-rail vehicles.\n       (b) The entity shall establish a system of regular and \n     frequent maintenance checks of lifts sufficient to determine \n     if they are operative.\n       (c) The entity shall ensure that vehicle operators report \n     to the entity, by the most immediate means available, any \n     failure of a lift to operate in service.\n       (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, \n     when a lift is discovered to be inoperative, the entity shall \n     take the vehicle out of service before the beginning of the \n     vehicle's next service day and ensure that the lift is \n     repaired before the vehicle returns to service.\n       (e) If there is no spare vehicle available to take the \n     place of a vehicle with an inoperable lift, such that taking \n     the vehicle out of service will reduce the transportation \n     service the entity is able to provide, the public entity may \n     keep the vehicle in service with an inoperable lift for no \n     more than five days (if the entity serves an area of 50,000 \n     or less population) or three days (if the entity serves an \n     area of over 50,000 population) from the day on which the \n     lift is discovered to be inoperative.\n       (f) In any case in which a vehicle is operating on a fixed \n     route with an inoperative lift, and the headway to the next \n     accessible vehicle on the route exceeds 30 minutes, the \n     entity shall promptly provide alternative transportation to \n     individuals with disabilities who are unable to use the \n     vehicle because its lift does not work.\n     Sec. 37.165  Lift and securement use.\n       (a) This section applies to public and covered entities.\n       (b) All common wheelchairs and their users shall be \n     transported in the entity's vehicles or other conveyances. \n     The entity is not required to permit wheelchairs to ride in \n     places other than designated securement locations in the \n     vehicle, where such locations exist.\n       (c) (1) For vehicles complying with part 38 of these \n     regulations, the entity shall use the securement system to \n     secure wheelchairs as provided in that part.\n       (2) For other vehicles transporting individuals who use \n     wheelchairs, the entity shall provide and use a securement \n     system to ensure that the wheelchair remains within the \n     securement area.\n       (3) The entity may require that an individual permit his or \n     her wheelchair to be secured.\n       (d) The entity may not deny transportation to a wheelchair \n     or its user on the ground that the device cannot be secured \n     or restrained satisfactorily by the vehicle's securement \n     system.\n       (e) The entity may recommend to a user of a wheelchair that \n     the individual transfer to a vehicle seat. The entity may not \n     require the individual to transfer.\n       (f) Where necessary or upon request, the entity's personnel \n     shall assist individuals with disabilities with the use of \n     securement systems, ramps and lifts. If it is necessary for \n     the personnel to leave their seats to provide this \n     assistance, they shall do so.\n       (g) The entity shall permit individuals with disabilities \n     who do not use wheelchairs, including standees, to use a \n     vehicle's lift or ramp to enter the vehicle. Provided that an \n     entity is not required to permit such individuals to use a \n     lift Model 141 manufactured by EEC, Inc. If the entity \n     chooses not to allow such individuals to use such a lift, it \n     shall clearly notify consumers of this fact by signage on the \n     exterior of the vehicle (adjacent to and of equivalent size \n     with the accessibility symbol).\n     Sec. 37.167  Other service requirements.\n       (a) This section applies to public and covered entities.\n       (b) On fixed route systems, the entity shall announce stops \n     as follows:\n       (1) The entity shall announce at least at transfer points \n     with other fixed routes, other major intersections and \n     destination points, and intervals along a route sufficient to \n     permit individuals with visual impairments or other \n     disabilities to be oriented to their location.\n       (2) The entity shall announce any stop on request of an \n     individual with a disability.\n       (c) Where vehicles or other conveyances for more than one \n     route serve the same stop, the entity shall provide a means \n     by which an individual with a visual impairment or other \n     disability can identify the proper vehicle to enter or be \n     identified to the vehicle operator as a person seeking a ride \n     on a particular route.\n       (d) The entity shall permit service animals to accompany \n     individuals with disabilities in vehicles and facilities.\n\n[[Page S54]]\n\n       (e) The entity shall ensure that vehicle operators and \n     other personnel make use of accessibility-related equipment \n     or features required by part 38 of these regulations.\n       (f) The entity shall make available to individuals with \n     disabilities adequate information concerning transportation \n     services. This obligation includes making \n     adequate communications capacity available, through \n     accessible formats and technology, to enable users to \n     obtain information and schedule service.\n       (g) The entity shall not refuse to permit a passenger who \n     uses a lift to disembark from a vehicle at any designated \n     stop, unless the lift cannot be deployed, the lift will be \n     damaged if it is deployed, or temporary conditions at the \n     stop, not under the control of the entity, preclude the safe \n     use of the stop by all passengers.\n       (h) The entity shall not prohibit an individual with a \n     disability from traveling with a respirator or portable \n     oxygen supply, consistent with applicable Department of \n     Transportation rules on the transportation of hazardous \n     materials.\n       (i) The entity shall ensure that adequate time is provided \n     to allow individuals with disabilities to complete boarding \n     or disembarking from the vehicle.\n       (j)(1) When an individual with a disability enters a \n     vehicle, and because of a disability, the individual needs to \n     sit in a seat or occupy a wheelchair securement location, the \n     entity shall ask the following person to move in order to \n     allow the individual with a disability to occupy the seat or \n     securement location:\n       (i) Individuals, except other individuals with a disability \n     or elderly persons, sitting in a location designated as \n     priority seating for elderly and handicapped persons (or \n     other seat as necessary);\n       (ii) Individuals sitting in or a fold-down or other movable \n     seat in a wheelchair securement location.\n       (2) This requirement applies to light rail and rapid rail \n     systems only to the extent practicable.\n       (3) The entity is not required to enforce the request that \n     other passengers move from priority seating areas or \n     wheelchair securement locations.\n       (4) In all signage designating priority seating areas for \n     elderly persons or persons with disabilities, or designating \n     wheelchair securement areas, the entity shall include \n     language informing persons siting in these locations that \n     they should comply with requests by transit provider \n     personnel to vacate their seats to make room for an \n     individual with a disability. This requirement applies to all \n     fixed route vehicles when they are acquired by the entity or \n     to new or replacement signage in the entity's existing fixed \n     route vehicles.\n     Sec. 37.169  Interim requirements for over-the-road bus \n         service operated by covered entities.\n       (a) Covered entities operating over-the-road buses, in \n     addition to compliance with other applicable provisions of \n     this part, shall provide accessible service as provided in \n     this section.\n       (b) The covered entity shall provide assistance, as needed, \n     to individuals with disabilities in boarding and \n     disembarking, including moving to and from the bus seat for \n     the purpose of boarding and disembarking. The covered entity \n     shall ensure that personnel are trained to provide this \n     assistance safely and appropriately.\n       (c) To the extent that they can be accommodated in the \n     areas of the passenger compartment provided for passengers' \n     personal effects, wheelchairs or other mobility aids and \n     assistive devices used by individuals with disabilities, or \n     components of such devices, shall be permitted in the \n     passenger compartment.

All vehicles covered by this subpart shall \n     provide a level-change mechanism or boarding device (e.g., \n     lift or ramp) complying with paragraph (b) or (c) of this \n     section and sufficient clearances to permit a wheelchair or \n     other mobility aid user to reach a securement location. At \n     least two securement locations and devices, complying with \n     paragraph (d) of this section, shall be provided on vehicles \n     in excess of 22 feet in length; at least one securement \n     location and device, complying with paragraph (d) of this \n     section, shall be provided on vehicles 22 feet in length or \n     less.\n       (b) Vehicle lift--(1) Design load. The design load of the \n     lift shall be at least 600 pounds. Working parts, such as \n     cables, pulleys, and shafts, which can be expected to wear, \n     and upon which the lift depends for support of the load, \n     shall have a safety factor of at least six, based on the \n     ultimate strength of the material. Nonworking parts, such as \n     platform, frame, and attachment hardware which would not be \n     expected to wear, shall have a safety factor of at least \n     three, based on the ultimate strength of the material.\n       (2) Controls--(i) Requirements. The controls shall be \n     interlocked with the vehicle brakes, transmission, or door, \n     or shall provide other appropriate mechanisms or systems, to \n     ensure that the vehicle cannot be moved when the lift is not \n     stowed and so the lift cannot be deployed unless the \n     interlocks or systems are engaged. The lift shall deploy to \n     all levels (i.e., ground, curb, and intermediate positions) \n     normally encountered in the operating environment. Where \n     provided, each control for deploying, lowering, raising, and \n     stowing the lift and lowering the roll-off barrier shall be \n     of a momentary contact type requiring continuous manual \n     pressure by the operator and shall not allow improper lift \n     sequencing when the lift platform is occupied. The controls \n     shall allow reversal of the lift operation sequence, such as \n     raising or lowering a platform that is part way down, without \n     allowing an occupied platform to fold or retract into the \n     stowed position.\n       (ii) Exception. Where the lift is designed to deploy with \n     its long dimension parallel to the vehicle axis and which \n     pivots into or out of the vehicle while occupied (i.e., \n     ``rotary lift''), the requirements of this paragraph \n     prohibiting the lift from being stowed while occupied shall \n     not apply if the stowed position is within the passenger \n     compartment and the lift is intended to be stowed while \n     occupied.\n       (3) Emergency operation. The lift shall incorporate an \n     emergency method of deploying, lowering to ground level with \n     a lift occupant, and raising and stowing the empty lift if \n     the power to the lift fails. No emergency method, manual or \n     otherwise, shall be capable of being operated in a manner \n     that could be hazardous to the lift occupant or to the \n     operator when operated according to manufacturer's \n     instructions, and shall not permit the platform to be stowed \n     or folded when occupied, unless the lift is a rotary lift and \n     is intended to be stowed while occupied.\n       (4) Power or equipment failure. Platforms stowed in a \n     vertical position, and deployed platforms when occupied, \n     shall have provisions to prevent their deploying, falling, or \n     folding any faster than 12 inches/second or their dropping of \n     an occupant in the event of a single failure of any load \n     carrying component.\n       (5) Platform barriers. The lift platform shall be equipped \n     with barriers to prevent any of the wheels of a wheelchair or \n     mobility aid from rolling off the platform during its \n     operation. A movable barrier or inherent design feature shall \n     prevent a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the \n     edge closest to the vehicle until the platform is in its \n     fully raised position. Each side of the lift platform which \n     extends beyond the vehicle in its raised position shall have \n     a barrier a minimum 1\\1/2\\ inches high. Such barriers shall \n     not interfere with maneuvering into or out of the aisle. The \n     loading-edge barrier (outer barrier) which functions as a \n     loading ramp when the lift is at ground level, shall be \n     sufficient when raised or closed, or a supplementary system \n     shall be provided, to prevent a power wheelchair or mobility \n     aid from riding over or defeating it. The outer barrier of \n     the lift shall automatically raise or close, or a \n     supplementary system shall automatically engage, and \n     remain raised, closed, or engaged at all times that the \n     platform is more than 3 inches above the roadway or \n     sidewalk and the platform is occupied. Alternatively, a \n     barrier or system may be raised, lowered, opened, closed, \n     engaged, or disengaged by the lift operator, provided an \n     interlock or inherent design feature prevents the lift \n     from rising unless the barrier is raised or closed or the \n     supplementary system is engaged.\n       (6) Platform surface. The platform surface shall be free of \n     any protrusions over \\1/4\\ inch high and shall be slip \n     resistant. The platform shall have a minimum clear width of \n     28\\1/2\\ inches at the platform, a minimum clear width of 30 \n     inches measured from 2 inches above the platform surface to \n     30 inches above the platform, and a minimum clear length of \n     48 inches measured from 2 inches above the surface of the \n     platform to 30 inches above the surface of the platform. (See \n     Fig. 1)\n       (7) Platform gaps. Any openings between the platform \n     surface and the raised barriers shall not exceed \\5/8\\ inch \n     in width. When the platform is at vehicle floor height with \n     the inner barrier (if applicable) down or retracted, gaps \n     between the forward lift platform edge and the vehicle floor \n     shall not exceed \\1/2\\ inch horizontally and \\5/8\\ inch \n     vertically. Platforms on semi-automatic lifts may have a hand \n     hold not exceeding 1\\1/2\\ inches by 4\\1/2\\ inches located \n     between the edge barriers.\n       (8) Platform entrance ramp. The entrance ramp, or loading-\n     edge barrier used as a ramp, shall not exceed a slope of 1:8, \n     measured on level ground, for a maximum rise of 3 inches, and \n     the transition from roadway or sidewalk to ramp may be \n     vertical without edge treatment up to \\1/4\\ inch. Thresholds \n     between \\1/4\\ inch and \\1/2\\ inch high shall be beveled with \n     a slope no greater than 1:2.\n       (9) Platform deflection. The lift platform (not including \n     the entrance ramp) shall not deflect more than 3 degrees \n     (exclusive of vehicle roll or pitch) in any direction between\n\n[[Page S56]]\n\n     its unloaded position and its position when loaded with 600 \n     pounds applied through a 26 inch by 26 inch test pallet at \n     the centroid of the platform.\n       (10) Platform movement. No part of the platform shall move \n     at a rate exceeding 6 inches/second during lowering and \n     lifting an occupant, and shall not exceed 12 inches/second \n     during deploying or stowing. This requirement does not apply \n     to the deployment or stowage cycles of lifts that are \n     manually deployed or stowed. The maximum platform horizontal \n     and vertical acceleration when occupied shall be 0.3g.\n       (11) Boarding direction. The lift shall permit both inboard \n     and outboard facing of wheelchair and mobility aid users.\n       (12) Use by standees. Lifts shall accommodate persons using \n     walkers, crutches, canes or braces or who otherwise have \n     difficulty using steps. The platform may be marked to \n     indicate a preferred standing position.\n       (13) Handrails. Platforms on lifts shall be equipped with \n     handrails on two sides, which move in tandem with the lift, \n     and which shall be graspable and provide support to standees \n     throughout the entire lift operation. Handrails shall have a \n     usable component at least 8 inches long with the lowest \n     portion a minimum 30 inches above the platform and the \n     highest portion a maximum 38 inches above the platform. The \n     handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 \n     pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without \n     permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting \n     structure. The handrail shall have a cross-sectional diameter \n     between 1\\1/4\\ inches and 1\\1/2\\ inches or shall provide an \n     equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner \n     radii of not less than \\1/8\\ inch. Handrails shall be placed \n     to provide a minimum 1\\1/2\\ inches knuckle clearance from the \n     nearest adjacent surface. Handrails shall not interfere with \n     wheelchair or mobility aid maneuverability when entering or \n     leaving the vehicle.\n       (c) Vehicle ramp--(1) Design load. Ramps 30 inches or \n     longer shall support a load of 600 pounds, placed at the \n     centroid of the ramp distributed over an area of 26 inches by \n     26 inches, with a safety factor of at least 3 based on the \n     ultimate strength of the material. Ramps shorter than 30 \n     inches shall support a load of 300 pounds.\n       (2) Ramp surface. The ramp surface shall be continuous and \n     slip resistant; shall not have protrusions from the surface \n     greater than \\1/4\\ inch high; shall have a clear width of 30 \n     inches; and shall accommodate both four-wheel and three-wheel \n     mobility aids.\n       (3) Ramp threshold. The transition from roadway or sidewalk \n     and the transition from vehicle floor to the ramp may be \n     vertical without edge treatment up to \\1/4\\ inch. Changes in \n     level between \\1/4\\ inch and \\1/2\\ inch shall be beveled with \n     a slope no greater than 1:2.\n       (4) Ramp barriers. Each side of the ramp shall have \n     barriers at least 2 inches high to prevent mobility aid \n     wheels from slipping off.\n       (5) Slope. Ramps shall have the least slope practicable and \n     shall not exceed 1:4 when deployed to ground level. If the \n     height of the vehicle floor from which the ramp is deployed \n     is 3 inches or less above a 6-inch curb, a maximum slope of \n     1:4 is permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor from \n     which the ramp is deployed is 6 inches or less, but greater \n     than 3 inches, above a 6-inch curb, a maximum slope of 1:6 is \n     permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor from which the \n     ramp is deployed is 9 inches or less, but greater than 6 \n     inches, above a 6-inch curb, a maximum slope of 1:8 is \n     permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor from which \n     the ramp is deployed is greater than 9 inches above a 6-\n     inch curb, a slope of 1:12 shall be achieved. Folding or \n     telescoping ramps are permitted provided they meet all \n     structural requirements of this section.\n       (6) Attachment. When in use for boarding or alighting, the \n     ramp shall be firmly attached to the vehicle so that it is \n     not subject to displacement when loading or unloading a heavy \n     power mobility aid and that no gap between vehicle and ramp \n     exceeds \\5/8\\ inch.\n       (7) Stowage. A compartment, securement system, or other \n     appropriate method shall be provided to ensure that stowed \n     ramps, including portable ramps stowed in the passenger area, \n     do not impinge on a passenger's wheelchair or mobility aid or \n     pose any hazard to passengers in the event of a sudden stop \n     or maneuver.\n       (8) Handrails. If provided, handrails shall allow persons \n     with disabilities to grasp them from outside the vehicle \n     while starting to board, and to continue to use them \n     throughout the boarding process, and shall have the top \n     between 30 inches and 38 inches above the ramp surface. The \n     handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 \n     pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without \n     permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting \n     structure. The handrail shall have a cross-sectional diameter \n     between 1\\1/4\\ inches and 1\\1/2\\ inches or shall provide an \n     equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner \n     radii of not less than \\1/8\\ inch. Handrails shall not \n     interfere with wheelchair or mobility aid maneuverability \n     when entering or leaving the vehicle.\n       (d) Securement devices--(1) Design load. Securement systems \n     on vehicles with GVWRs of 30,000 pounds or above, and their \n     attachments to such vehicles, shall restrain a force in the \n     forward longitudinal direction of up to 2,000 pounds per \n     securement leg or clamping mechanism and a minimum of 4,000 \n     pounds for each mobility aid. Securement systems on vehicles \n     with GVWRs of up to 30,000 pounds, and their attachments to \n     such vehicles, shall restrain a force in the forward \n     longitudinal direction of up to 2,500 pounds per securement \n     leg or clamping mechanism and a minimum of 5,000 pounds for \n     each mobility aid.\n       (2) Location and size. The securement system shall be \n     placed as near to the accessible entrance as practicable and \n     shall have a clear floor area of 30 inches by 48 inches. Such \n     space shall adjoin, and may overlap, an access path. Not more \n     than 6 inches of the required clear floor space may be \n     accommodated for footrests under another seat provided there \n     is a minimum of 9 inches from the floor to the lowest part of \n     the seat overhanging the space. Securement areas may have \n     fold-down seats to accommodate other passengers when a \n     wheelchair or mobility aid is not occupying the area, \n     provided the seats, when folded up, do not obstruct the clear \n     floor space required. (See Fig. 2)\n       (3) Mobility aids accommodated. The securement system shall \n     secure common wheelchairs and mobility aids and shall either \n     be automatic or easily attached by a person familiar with the \n     system and mobility aid and having average dexterity.\n       (4) Orientation. In vehicles in excess of 22 feet in \n     length, at least one securement device or system required by \n     paragraph (a) of this section shall secure the wheelchair or \n     mobility aid facing toward the front of the vehicle. In \n     vehicles 22 feet in length or less, the required securement \n     device may secure the wheelchair or mobility aid either \n     facing toward the front of the vehicle or rearward. \n     Additional securement devices or systems shall secure the \n     wheelchair or mobility aid facing forward or rearward. Where \n     the wheelchair or mobility aid is secured facing the rear of \n     the vehicle, a padded barrier shall be provided. The padded \n     barrier shall extend from a height of 38 inches from the \n     vehicle floor to a height of 56 inches from the vehicle floor \n     with a width of 18 inches, laterally centered immediately in \n     back of the seated individual. Such barriers need not be \n     solid provided equivalent protection is afforded.\n       (5) Movement. When the wheelchair or mobility aid is \n     secured in accordance with manufacturer's instructions, the \n     securement system shall limit the movement of an occupied \n     wheelchair or mobility aid to no more than 2 inches in any \n     direction under normal vehicle operating conditions.\n       (6) Stowage. When not being used for securement, or when \n     the securement area can be used by standees, the securement \n     system shall not interfere with passenger movement, shall not \n     present any hazardous condition, shall be reasonably \n     protected from vandalism, and shall be readily accessed when \n     needed for use.\n       (7) Seat belt and shoulder harness. For each wheelchair or \n     mobility aid securement device provided, a passenger seat \n     belt and shoulder harness, complying with all applicable \n     provisions of part 571 of title 49 CFR, shall also be \n     provided for use by wheelchair or mobility aid users. Such \n     seat belts and shoulder harnesses shall not be used in lieu \n     of a device which secures the wheelchair or mobility aid \n     itself.\n     Sec. 38.25  Doors, steps and thresholds.\n       (a) Slip resistance. All aisles, steps, floor areas where \n     people walk and floors in securement locations shall have \n     slip-resistant surfaces.\n       (b) Contrast. All step edges, thresholds, and the boarding \n     edge of ramps or lift platforms shall have a band of color(s) \n     running the full width of the step or edge which contrasts \n     from the step tread and riser, or lift or ramp surface, \n     either light-on-dark or dark-on-light.\n       (c) Door height. For vehicles in excess of 22 feet in \n     length, the overhead clearance between the top of the door \n     opening and the raised lift platform, or highest point of a \n     ramp, shall be a minimum of 68 inches. For vehicles of 22 \n     feet in length or less, the overhead clearance between the \n     top of the door opening and the raised lift platform, or \n     highest point of a ramp, shall be a minimum of 56 inches.\n     Sec. 38.27  Priority seating signs.\n       (a) Each vehicle shall contain sign(s) which indicate that \n     seats in the front of the vehicle are priority seats for \n     persons with disabilities, and that other passengers should \n     make such seats available to those who wish to use them. At \n     least one set of forward-facing seats shall be so designated.\n       (b) Each securement location shall have a sign designating \n     it as such.\n       (c) Characters on signs required by paragraphs (a) and (b) \n     of this section shall have a width-to-height ratio between \n     3:5 and 1:1 and a stroke width-to-height ratio between 1:5 \n     and 1:10, with a minimum character height (using an upper \n     case ``X'') of \\5/8\\ inch, with ``wide'' spacing (generally, \n     the space between letters shall be 1/16 the height of upper \n     case letters), and shall contrast with the background either \n     light-on-dark or dark-on-light.\n     Sec. 38.29  Interior circulation, handrails and stanchions.\n       (a) Interior handrails and stanchions shall permit \n     sufficient turning and maneuvering space for wheelchairs and \n     other mobility aids to reach a securement location from the \n     lift or ramp.\n       (b) Handrails and stanchions shall be provided in the \n     entrance to the vehicle in a configuration which allows \n     persons with disabilities to grasp such assists from outside \n     the vehicle while starting to board, and to continue using \n     such assists throughout the\n\n[[Page S57]]\n\n     boarding and fare collection process. Handrails shall have a \n     cross-sectional diameter between 1\\1/4\\ inches and 1\\1/2\\ \n     inches or shall provide an equivalent grasping surface, and \n     have eased edges with corner radii of not less than \\1/8\\ \n     inch. Handrails shall be placed to provide a minimum 1\\1/2\\ \n     inches knuckle clearance from the nearest adjacent surface. \n     Where on-board fare collection devices are used on vehicles \n     in excess of 22 feet in length, a horizontal passenger assist \n     shall be located across the front of the vehicle and shall \n     prevent passengers from sustaining injuries on the fare \n     collection device or windshield in the event of a sudden \n     deceleration. Without restricting the vestibule space, the \n     assist shall provide support for a boarding passenger from \n     the front door through the boarding procedure. Passengers \n     shall be able to lean against the assist for security while \n     paying fares.\n       (c) For vehicles in excess of 22 feet in length, overhead \n     handrail(s) shall be provided which shall be continuous \n     except for a gap at the rear doorway.\n       (d) Handrails and stanchions shall be sufficient to permit \n     safe boarding, on-board circulation, seating and standing \n     assistance, and alighting by persons with disabilities.\n       (e) For vehicles in excess of 22 feet in length with front-\n     door lifts or ramps, vertical stanchions immediately behind \n     the driver shall either terminate at the lower edge of the \n     aisle-facing seats, if applicable, or be ``dog-legged'' so \n     that the floor attachment does not impede or interfere with \n     wheelchair footrests. If the driver seat platform must be \n     passed by a wheelchair or mobility aid user entering the \n     vehicle, the platform, to the maximum extent practicable, \n     shall not extend into the aisle or vestibule beyond the wheel \n     housing.\n       (f) For vehicles in excess of 22 feet in length, the \n     minimum interior height along the path from the lift to the \n     securement location shall be 68 inches. For vehicles of 22 \n     feet in length or less, the minimum interior height from lift \n     to securement location shall be 56 inches.\n     Sec. 38.31  Lighting.\n       (a) Any stepwell or doorway immediately adjacent to the \n     driver shall have, when the door is open, at least 2 foot-\n     candles of illumination measured on the step tread or lift \n     platform.\n       (b) Other stepwells and doorways, including doorways in \n     which lifts or ramps are installed, shall have, at all times, \n     at least 2 foot-candles of illumination measured on the step \n     tread, or lift or ramp, when deployed at the vehicle floor \n     level.\n       (c) The vehicle doorways, including doorways in which lifts \n     or ramps are installed, shall have outside light(s) which, \n     when the door is open, provide at least 1 foot-candle of \n     illumination on the street surface for a distance of 3 feet \n     perpendicular to all points on the bottom step tread outer \n     edge. Such light(s) shall be located below window level and \n     shielded to protect the eyes of entering and exiting \n     passengers.\n     Sec. 38.33  Fare box.\n       Where provided, the farebox shall be located as far forward \n     as practicable and shall not obstruct traffic in the \n     vestibule, especially wheelchairs or mobility aids.\n     Sec. 38.35  Public information system.\n       (a) Vehicles in excess of 22 feet in length, used in \n     multiple-stop, fixed-route service, shall be equipped with a \n     public address system permitting the driver, or recorded or \n     digitized human speech messages, to announce stops and \n     provide other passenger information within the vehicle.\n       (b) [Reserved]\n     Sec. 38.37  Stop request.\n       (a) Where passengers may board or alight at multiple stops \n     at their option, vehicles in excess of 22 feet in length \n     shall provide controls adjacent to the securement location \n     for requesting stops and which alerts the driver that a \n     mobility aid user wishes to disembark. Such a system shall \n     provide auditory and visual indications that the request \n     has been made.\n       (b) Controls required by paragraph (a) of this section \n     shall be mounted no higher than 48 inches and no lower than \n     15 inches above the floor, shall be operable with one hand \n     and shall not require tight grasping, pinching, or twisting \n     of the wrist.

Space to accommodate wheelchairs and \n     mobility aids may be provided within the normal area used by \n     standees and designation of specific spaces is not required. \n     Particular attention shall be given to ensuring maximum \n     maneuverability immediately inside doors. Ample vertical \n     stanchions from ceiling to seat-back rails shall be provided. \n     Vertical stanchions from ceiling to floor shall not interfere \n     with wheelchair or mobility aid circulation and shall be kept \n     to a minimum in the vicinity of accessible doors.\n     Sec. 38.79  Floors, steps and thresholds.\n       (a) Floor surfaces on aisles, step treads, places for \n     standees, and areas where wheelchair and mobility aid users \n     are to be accommodated shall be slip-resistant.\n       (b) All thresholds and step edges shall have a band of \n     color(s) running the full width of the step or threshold \n     which contrasts from the step tread and riser or adjacent \n     floor, either light-on-dark or dark-on-light.\n     Sec. 38.81  Lighting.\n       (a) Any stepwell or doorway with a lift, ramp or bridge \n     plate immediately adjacent to the driver shall have, when the \n     door is open, at least 2 footcandles of illumination measured \n     on the step tread or lift platform.\n       (b) Other stepwells, and doorways with lifts, ramps or \n     bridge plates, shall have, at all times, at least 2 \n     footcandles of illumination measured on the step tread or \n     lift or ramp, when deployed at the vehicle floor level.\n       (c) The doorways of vehicles not operating at lighted \n     station platforms shall have outside lights which provide at \n     least 1 foot candle of illumination on the station platform \n     or street surface for a distance of 3 feet perpendicular to \n     all points on the bottom step tread. Such lights shall be \n     located below window level and shielded to protect the eyes \n     of entering and exiting passengers.\n     Sec. 38.83  Mobility aid accessibility.\n       (a)(1) General. All new light rail vehicles, other than \n     level entry vehicles, covered by this subpart shall provide a \n     level-change mechanism or boarding device (e.g., lift, ramp \n     or bridge plate) complying with either paragraph (b) or (c) \n     of this section and sufficient clearances to permit at least \n     two wheelchair or mobility aid users to reach areas, each \n     with a minimum clear floor space of 48 inches by 30 inches, \n     which do not unduly restrict passenger flow. Space to \n     accommodate wheelchairs and mobility aids may be provided \n     within the normal area used by standees and designation of \n     specific spaces is not required.\n       (2) Exception. If lifts, ramps or bridge plates meeting the \n     requirements of this section are\n\n[[Page S59]]\n\n     provided on station platforms or other stops required to be \n     accessible, or mini-high platforms complying with \n     Sec. 38.73(d) of this part are provided, the vehicle is not \n     required to be equipped with a car-borne device. Where each \n     new vehicle is compatible with a single platform-mounted \n     access system or device, additional systems or devices are \n     not required for each vehicle provided that the single device \n     could be used to provide access to each new vehicle if \n     passengers using wheelchairs or mobility aids could not be \n     accommodated on a single vehicle.\n       (b) Vehicle lift--(1) Design load. The design load of the \n     lift shall be at least 600 pounds. Working parts, such as \n     cables, pulleys, and shafts, which can be expected to wear, \n     and upon which the lift depends for support of the load, \n     shall have a safety factor of at least six, based on the \n     ultimate strength of the material. Nonworking parts, such as \n     platform, frame, and attachment hardware which would not be \n     expected to wear, shall have a safety factor of at least \n     three, based on the ultimate strength of the material.\n       (2) Controls--(i) Requirements. The controls shall be \n     interlocked with the vehicle brakes, propulsion system, or \n     door, or shall provide other appropriate mechanisms or \n     systems, to ensure that the vehicle cannot be moved when the \n     lift is not stowed and so the lift cannot be deployed unless \n     the interlocks or systems are engaged. The lift shall deploy \n     to all levels (i.e., ground, curb, and intermediate \n     positions) normally encountered in the operating environment. \n     Where provided, each control for deploying, lowering, \n     raising, and stowing the lift and lowering the roll-off \n     barrier shall be of a momentary contact type requiring \n     continuous manual pressure by the operator and shall not \n     allow improper lift sequencing when the lift platform is \n     occupied. The controls shall allow reversal of the lift \n     operation sequence, such as raising or lowering a platform \n     that is part way down, without allowing an occupied platform \n     to fold or retract into the stowed position.\n       (ii) Exception. Where physical or safety constraints \n     prevent the deployment at some stops of a lift having its \n     long dimension perpendicular to the vehicle axis, the \n     transportation entity may specify a lift which is designed to \n     deploy with its long dimension parallel to the vehicle axis \n     and which pivots into or out of the vehicle while occupied \n     (i.e., ``rotary lift''). The requirements of paragraph \n     (b)(2)(i) of this section prohibiting the lift from being \n     stowed while occupied shall not apply to a lift design of \n     this type if the stowed position is within the passenger \n     compartment and the lift is intended to be stowed while \n     occupied.\n       (iii) Exception. The brake or propulsion system interlocks \n     requirement does not apply to a station platform mounted lift \n     provided that a mechanical, electrical or other system \n     operates to ensure that vehicles do not move when the lift is \n     in use.\n       (3) Emergency operation. The lift shall incorporate an \n     emergency method of deploying, lowering to ground level with \n     a lift occupant, and raising and stowing the empty lift if \n     the power to the lift fails. No emergency method, manual or \n     otherwise, shall be capable of being operated in a manner \n     that could be hazardous to the lift occupant or to the \n     operator when operated according to manufacturer's \n     instructions, and shall not permit the platform to be stowed \n     or folded when occupied, unless the lift is a rotary lift \n     intended to be stowed while occupied.\n       (4) Power or equipment failure. Lift platforms stowed in a \n     vertical position, and deployed platforms when occupied, \n     shall have provisions to prevent their deploying, falling, or \n     folding any faster than 12 inches/second or their dropping of \n     an occupant in the event of a single failure of any load \n     carrying component.\n       (5) Platform barriers. The lift platform shall be equipped \n     with barriers to prevent any of the wheels of a wheelchair or \n     mobility aid from rolling off the lift during its operation. \n     A movable barrier or inherent design feature shall prevent a \n     wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the edge closest \n     to the vehicle until the lift is in its fully raised \n     position. Each side of the lift platform which extends beyond \n     the vehicle in its raised position shall have a barrier a \n     minimum 1\\1/2\\ inches high. Such barriers shall not interfere \n     with maneuvering into or out of the aisle. The loading-edge \n     barrier (outer barrier) which functions as a loading ramp \n     when the lift is at ground level, shall be sufficient when \n     raised or closed, or a supplementary system shall be \n     provided, to prevent a power wheelchair or mobility aid from \n     riding over or defeating it. The outer barrier of the lift \n     shall automatically rise or close, or a supplementary system \n     shall automatically engage, and remain raised, closed, or \n     engaged at all times that the lift is more than 3 inches \n     above the station platform or roadway and the lift is \n     occupied. Alternatively, a barrier or system may be raised, \n     lowered, opened, closed, engaged or disengaged by the lift \n     operator provided an interlock or inherent design feature \n     prevents the lift from rising unless the barrier is raised or \n     closed or the supplementary system is engaged.\n       (6) Platform surface. The lift platform surface shall be \n     free of any protrusions over \\1/4\\ inch high and shall be \n     slip resistant. The lift platform shall have a minimum clear \n     width of 28\\1/2\\ inches at the platform, a minimum clear \n     width of 30 inches measured from 2 inches above the lift \n     platform surface to 30 inches above the surface, and a \n     minimum clear length of 48 inches measured from 2 inches \n     above the surface of the platform to 30 inches above the \n     surface. (See Fig. 1)\n       (7) Platform gaps. Any openings between the lift platform \n     surface and the raised barriers shall not exceed \\5/8\\ inch \n     wide. When the lift is at vehicle floor height with the inner \n     barrier (if applicable) down or retracted, gaps between the \n     forward lift platform edge and vehicle floor shall not exceed \n     \\1/2\\ inch horizontally and \\5/8\\ inch vertically. Platforms \n     on semi-automatic lifts may have a hand hold not exceeding \n     1\\1/2\\ inches by 4\\1/2\\ inches located between the edge \n     barriers.\n       (8) Platform entrance ramp. The entrance ramp, or loading-\n     edge barrier used as a ramp, shall not exceed a slope of 1:8 \n     measured on level ground, for a maximum rise of 3 inches, and \n     the transition from the station platform or roadway to ramp \n     may be vertical without edge treatment up to \\1/4\\ inch. \n     Thresholds between \\1/4\\ inch and \\1/2\\ inch high shall be \n     beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2.\n       (9) Platform deflection. The lift platform (not including \n     the entrance ramp) shall not deflect more than 3 degrees \n     (exclusive of vehicle roll) in any direction between its \n     unloaded position and its position when loaded with 600 \n     pounds applied through a 26 inch by 26 inch test pallet at \n     the centroid of the lift platform.\n       (10) Platform movement. No part of the platform shall move \n     at a rate exceeding 6 inches/second during lowering and \n     lifting an occupant, and shall not exceed 12 inches/second \n     during deploying or stowing. This requirement does not apply \n     to the deployment or stowage cycles of lifts that are \n     manually deployed or stowed. The maximum platform horizontal \n     and vertical acceleration when occupied shall be 0.3g.\n       (11) Boarding direction. The lift shall permit both inboard \n     and outboard facing of wheelchairs and mobility aids.\n       (12) Use by standees. Lifts shall accommodate persons using \n     walkers, crutches, canes or braces or who otherwise have \n     difficulty using steps. The lift may be marked to indicate a \n     preferred standing position.\n       (13) Handrails. Platforms on lifts shall be equipped with \n     handrails, on two sides, which move in tandem with the lift \n     which shall be graspable and provide support to standees \n     throughout the entire lift operation. Handrails shall have a \n     usable component at least 8 inches long with the lowest \n     portion a minimum 30 inches above the platform and the \n     highest portion a maximum 38 inches above the platform. The \n     handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 \n     pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without \n     permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting \n     structure. Handrails shall have a cross-sectional diameter \n     between 1\\1/4\\ inches and 1\\1/2\\ inches or shall provide an \n     equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner \n     radii of not less than \\1/8\\ inch. Handrails shall be placed \n     to provide a minimum 1\\1/2\\ inches knuckle clearance from the \n     nearest adjacent surface. Handrails shall not interfere with \n     wheelchair or mobility aid maneuverability when entering or \n     leaving the vehicle.\n       (c) Vehicle ramp or bridge plate (1) Design load. Ramps or \n     bridge plates 30 inches or longer shall support a load of 600 \n     pounds, placed at the centroid of the ramp or bridge plate \n     distributed over an area of 26 inches by 26 inches, with a \n     safety factor of at least 3 based on the ultimate strength of \n     the material. Ramps or bridge plates shorter than 30 inches \n     shall support a load of 300 pounds.\n       (2) Ramp surface. The ramp or bridge plate surface shall be \n     continuous and slip resistant, shall not have protrusions \n     from the surface greater than \\1/4\\ inch, shall have a clear \n     width of 30 inches, and shall accommodate both four-wheel and \n     three-wheel mobility aids.\n       (3) Ramp threshold. The transition from roadway or station \n     platform and the transition from vehicle floor to the ramp or \n     bridge plate may be vertical without edge treatment up to \\1/\n     4\\ inch. Changes in level between \\1/4\\ inch and \\1/2\\ inch \n     shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2.\n       (4) Ramp barriers. Each side of the ramp or bridge plate \n     shall have barriers at least 2 inches high to prevent \n     mobility aid wheels from slipping off.\n       (5) Slope. Ramps or bridge plates shall have the least \n     slope practicable. If the height of the vehicle floor, under \n     50% passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is 3 \n     inches or less above the station platform a maximum slope of \n     1:4 is permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor, under \n     50% passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is 6 \n     inches or less, but more than 3 inches, above the station \n     platform a maximum slope of 1:6 is permitted; if the height \n     of the vehicle floor, under 50% passenger load, from which \n     the ramp is deployed is 9 inches or less, but more than 6 \n     inches, above the station platform a maximum slope of 1:8 is \n     permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor, under 50% \n     passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is greater \n     than 9 inches above the station platform a slope of 1:12 \n     shall be achieved. Folding or telescoping ramps are permitted \n     provided they meet all structural requirements of this \n     section.\n       (6) Attachment. (i) Requirement. When in use for boarding \n     or alighting, the ramp or bridge plate shall be attached to \n     the vehicle, or otherwise prevented from moving such that it \n     is not subject to displacement when loading or unloading a \n     heavy power mobility aid and that any gaps between vehicle \n     and ramp or bridge plate, and station platform and ramp or \n     bridge plate, shall not exceed \\5/8\\ inch.\n       (ii) Exception. Ramps or bridge plates which are attached \n     to, and deployed from, station platforms are permitted in \n     lieu of vehicle devices provided they meet the displacement \n     requirements of paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section.\n\n[[Page S60]]\n\n       (7) Stowage. A compartment, securement system, or other \n     appropriate method shall be provided to ensure that stowed \n     ramps or bridge plates, including portable ramps or bridge \n     plates stowed in the passenger area, do not impinge on a \n     passenger's wheelchair or mobility aid or pose any hazard to \n     passengers in the event of a sudden stop.\n       (8) Handrails. If provided, handrails shall allow persons \n     with disabilities to grasp them from outside the vehicle \n     while starting to board, and to continue to use them \n     throughout the boarding process, and shall have the top \n     between 30 inches and 38 inches above the ramp surface. The \n     handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 \n     pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without \n     permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting \n     structure. The handrail shall have a cross-sectional diameter \n     between 1\\1/4\\ inches and 1\\1/2\\ inches or shall provide an \n     equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner \n     radii of not less than \\1/8\\ inch. Handrails shall not \n     interfere with wheelchair or mobility aid maneuverability \n     when entering or leaving the vehicle.\n     Sec. 38.85  Between-car barriers\n       Where vehicles operate in a high-platform, level-boarding \n     mode, devices or systems shall be provided to prevent, deter \n     or warn individuals from inadvertently stepping off the \n     platform between cars. Appropriate devices include, but are \n     not limited to, pantograph gates, chains, motion detectors or \n     other suitable devices.\n     Sec. 38.87  Public information system.\n       (a) Each vehicle shall be equipped with an interior public \n     address system permitting transportation system personnel, or \n     recorded or digitized human speech messages, to announce \n     stations and provide other passenger information. Alternative \n     systems or devices which provide equivalent access are also \n     permitted.\n       (b) [Reserved].\n     38.91-38.127  [Reserved]\n\n               Subpart F--Over-the-Road Buses and Systems\n\n     Sec. 38.151  General.\n       (a) New, used and remanufactured over-the-road buses, to be \n     considered accessible by regulations in part 37 of these \n     regulations, shall comply with this subpart.\n       (b) Over-the-road buses covered by Sec. 37.7(c) of these \n     regulations shall comply with Sec. 38.23 and this subpart.\n     Sec. 38.153  Doors, steps and thresholds.\n       (a) Floor surfaces on aisles, step treads and areas where \n     wheelchair and mobility aid users are to be accommodated \n     shall be slip-resistant.\n       (b) All step edges shall have a band of color(s) running \n     the full width of the step which contrasts from the step \n     tread and riser, either dark-on-light or light-on-dark.\n       (c) To the maximum extent practicable, doors shall have a \n     minimum clear width when open of 30 inches, but in no case \n     less than 27 inches.\n     Sec. 38.155  Interior circulation, handrails and stanchions.\n       (a) Handrails and stanchions shall be provided in the \n     entrance to the vehicle in a configuration which allows \n     passengers to grasp such assists from outside the vehicle \n     while starting to board, and to continue using such handrails \n     or stanchions throughout the boarding process. Handrails \n     shall have a cross-sectional diameter between 1\\1/4\\ inches \n     and 1\\1/2\\ inches or shall provide an equivalent grasping \n     surface, and have eased edges with corner radii of not \n     less than \\1/8\\ inch. Handrails shall be placed to provide \n     a minimum 1\\1/2\\ inches knuckle clearance from the nearest \n     adjacent surface. Where on-board fare collection devices \n     are used, a horizontal passenger assist shall be located \n     between boarding passengers and the fare collection device \n     and shall prevent passengers from sustaining injuries on \n     the fare collection device or windshield in the event of a \n     sudden deceleration. Without restricting the vestibule \n     space, the assist shall provide support for a boarding \n     passenger from the door through the boarding procedure. \n     Passengers shall be able to lean against the assist for \n     security while paying fares.\n       (b) Where provided within passenger compartments, handrails \n     or stanchions shall be sufficient to permit safe on-board \n     circulation, seating and standing assistance, and alighting \n     by persons with disabilities.\n     Sec. 38.157  Lighting.\n       (a) Any stepwell or doorway immediately adjacent to the \n     driver shall have, when the door is open, at least 2 foot-\n     candles of illumination measured on the step tread.\n       (b) The vehicle doorway shall have outside light(s) which, \n     when the door is open, provide at least 1 foot-candle of \n     illumination on the street surface for a distance of 3 feet \n     perpendicular to all points on the bottom step tread outer \n     edge. Such light(s) shall be located below window level and \n     shielded to protect the eyes of entering and exiting \n     passengers.\n     Sec. 38.159  Mobility aid accessibility. [Reserved]\n\n                 Subpart G--Other Vehicles and Systems\n\n     Sec. 38.171  General.\n       (a) New, used and remanufactured vehicles and conveyances \n     for systems not covered by other subparts of this part, to be \n     considered accessible by regulations in part 37 of these \n     regulations, shall comply with this subpart.\n       (b) If portions of the vehicle or conveyance are modified \n     in a way that affects or could affect accessibility, each \n     such portion shall comply, to the extent practicable, with \n     the applicable provisions of this subpart. This provision \n     does not require that inaccessible vehicles be retrofitted \n     with lifts, ramps or other boarding devices.\n     Sec. 38.173  Automated guideway transit vehicles and systems.\n       (a) Automated Guideway Transit (AGT) vehicles and systems, \n     sometimes called ``people movers,'' operated in airports and \n     other areas where AGT vehicles travel at slow speed (i.e., at \n     a speed of no more than 20 miles per hour at any location on \n     their route during normal operation), shall comply with the \n     provisions of Sec. 38.53(a) through (c), and Sec. Sec. 38.55 \n     through 38.61 of this part for rapid rail vehicles and \n     systems.\n       (b) Where the vehicle covered by paragraph (a) of this \n     section will operate in an accessible station, the design of \n     vehicles shall be coordinated with the boarding platform \n     design such that the horizontal gap between a vehicle door at \n     rest and the platform shall be no greater than 1 inch and the \n     height of the vehicle floor shall be within plus or minus \\1/\n     2\\ inch of the platform height under all normal passenger \n     load conditions. Vertical alignment may be accomplished by \n     vehicle air suspension or other suitable means of meeting the \n     requirement.\n       (c) In stations where open platforms are not protected by \n     platform screens, a suitable device or system shall be \n     provided to prevent, deter or warn individuals from stepping \n     off the platform between cars. Acceptable devices include, \n     but are not limited to, pantograph gates, chains, motion \n     detectors or other appropriate devices.\n       (d) Light rail and rapid rail AGT vehicles and systems \n     shall comply with subparts D and C of this part, \n     respectively. AGT systems whose vehicles travel at a speed of \n     more than 20 miles per hour at any location on their route \n     during normal operation are covered under this paragraph \n     rather than under paragraph (a) of this subsection.\n     Sec. 38.175  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 38.177  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 38.179  Trams, similar vehicles and systems.\n       (a) New and used trams consisting of a tractor unit, with \n     or without passenger accommodations, and one or more \n     passenger trailer units, including but not limited to \n     vehicles providing shuttle service to remote parking areas, \n     between hotels and other public accommodations, and between \n     and within amusement parks and other recreation areas, shall \n     comply with this section. For purposes of determining \n     applicability of Sec. Sec. 37.101 or 37.105 of these \n     regulations, the capacity of such a vehicle or ``train'' \n     shall consist of the total combined seating capacity of all \n     units, plus the driver, prior to any modification for \n     accessibility.\n       (b) Each tractor unit which accommodates passengers and \n     each trailer unit shall comply with Sec. 38.25 and Sec. 38.29 \n     of this part.

Sec. 38.23(b) or (c) and shall provide at least one \n     space for wheelchair or mobility aid users complying with \n     Sec.  38.23(d) of this part unless the complete operating \n     unit consisting of tractor and one or more trailers can \n     already accommodate at least two wheelchair or mobility aid \n     users.\n     Figures in Part 38--[Copies of these figures may be obtained \n         from the Office of Compliance, Room LA 200, John Adams \n         Building, 110 Second Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. \n         20540-1999.]\n\n                Appendix to Part 38 --Guidance Material\n\n       This appendix contains materials of an advisory nature and \n     provides additional information that should help the reader \n     to understand the minimum requirements of the guidelines or \n     to design vehicles for greater accessibility. Each entry is \n     applicable to all subparts of this part except where noted. \n     Nothing in this appendix shall in any way obviate any \n     obligation to comply with the requirements of the guidelines \n     themselves.\n\nI. Slip Resistant Surfaces Aisles, Steps, Floor Area Where People Walk, \n       Floor Areas in Securement Locations, Lift Platforms, Ramps\n\n       Slip resistance is based on the frictional force necessary \n     to keep a shoe heel or crutch tip from slipping on a walking \n     surface under conditions likely to be found on the surface. \n     While the dynamic coefficient of friction during walking \n     varies in a complex and non-uniform way, the static \n     coefficient of friction, which can be measured in several \n     ways, provides a close approximation of the slip resistance \n     of a surface. Contrary to popular belief, some slippage is \n     necessary to walking, especially for persons with restricted \n     gaits; a truly ``non-slip'' surface could not be negotiated.\n       The Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n     recommends that walking surfaces have a static coefficient of \n     friction of 0.5. A research project sponsored by the \n     Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board \n     (Access Board) conducted tests with persons with disabilities \n     and concluded that a higher coefficient of friction was \n     needed by such persons. A static coefficient of friction of \n     0.6 is recommended for steps, floors, and lift platforms and \n     0.8 for ramps.\n       The coefficient of friction varies considerably due to the \n     presence of contaminants, water, floor finishes, and other \n     factors not under the control of transit providers and may be \n     difficult to measure. Nevertheless, many common materials \n     suitable for flooring are now labeled with information on the \n     static coefficient of friction. While it may not be possible \n     to compare one product directly with another, or to guarantee \n     a constant measure, transit operators or vehicle\n\n[[Page S61]]\n\n     designers and manufacturers are encouraged to specify \n     materials with appropriate values. As more products include \n     information on slip resistance, improved uniformity in \n     measurement and specification is likely. The Access Board's \n     advisory guidelines on Slip Resistant Surfaces provides \n     additional information on this subject.\n\n          II. Color Contrast--Step Edges, Lift Platform Edges\n\n       The material used to provide contrast should contrast by at \n     least 70%. Contrast in percent is determined by:\n\n     Contrast = [(B1--B2)/B1] x \n         100\n     Where B1 = light reflectance value (LRV) of the \n         lighter area and B2 = light reflectance value \n         (LRV) of the darker area.\n       Note that in any application both white and black are never \n     absolute; thus, B1 never equals 100 and \n     B2 is always greater than 0.\n\n                     III. Handrails and Stanchions\n\n       In addition to the requirements for handrails and \n     stanchions for rapid, light, and commuter rail vehicles, \n     consideration should be given to the proximity of handrails \n     or stanchions to the area in which wheelchair or mobility aid \n     users may position themselves. When identifying the clear \n     floor space where a wheelchair or mobility aid user can be \n     accommodated, it is suggested that at least one such area be \n     adjacent or in close proximity to a handrail or stanchion. Of \n     course, such a handrail or stanchion cannot encroach upon the \n     required 32 inch width required for the doorway or the route \n     leading to the clear floor space which must be at least 30 by \n     48 inches in size.\n\n              IV. Priority Seating Signs and Other Signage\n\n       A. Finish and Contrast. The characters and background of \n     signs should be eggshell, matte, or other non-glare finish. \n     An eggshell finish (11 to 19 degree gloss on 60 degree \n     glossimeter) is recommended. Characters and symbols should \n     contrast with their background either light characters on a \n     dark background or dark characters on a light background. \n     Research indicates that signs are more legible for persons \n     with low vision when characters contrast with their \n     background by at least 70 percent. Contrast in percent is \n     determined by:\n\n     Contrast = [(B1--B2)/B1] x 100\n     Where B1 = light reflectance value (LRV) of the \n         lighter area and B2 = light reflectance value \n         (LRV) of the darker area.\n       Note that in any application both white and black are never \n     absolute; thus, B1 never equals 100 and \n     B2 is always greater than 0.\n       The greatest readability is usually achieved through the \n     use of light-colored characters or symbols on a dark \n     background.\n       B. Destination and Route Signs. The following \n     specifications, which are required for buses (Sec.  38.39), \n     are recommended for other types of vehicles, particularly \n     light rail vehicles, where appropriate.\n       1. Where destination or route information is displayed on \n     the exterior of a vehicle, each vehicle should have \n     illuminated signs on the front and boarding side of the \n     vehicle.\n       2. Characters on signs covered by paragraph IV.B.1 of this \n     appendix should have a width-to-height ratio between 3:5 and \n     1:1 and a stroke width-to-height ratio between 1:5 and 1:10, \n     with a minimum character height (using an upper case ``X'') \n     of 1 inch for signs on the boarding side and a minimum \n     character height of 2 inches for front ``headsigns,'' with \n     ``wide'' spacing (generally, the space between letters shall \n     be 1/16 the height of upper case letters), and should \n     contrast with the background, either dark-on-light or light-\n     on-dark, or as recommended above.\n       C. Designation of Accessible Vehicles. The International \n     Symbol of Accessibility should be displayed as shown in \n     Figure 6.\n\n                     V. Public Information Systems.\n\n       There is currently no requirement that vehicles be equipped \n     with an information system which is capable of providing the \n     same or equivalent information to persons with hearing loss. \n     While the Department of Transportation assesses available and \n     soon-to-be available technology during a study conducted \n     during Fiscal Year 1992, entities are encouraged to employ \n     whatever services, signage or alternative systems or devices \n     that provide equivalent access and are available. Two \n     possible types of devices are visual display systems and \n     listening systems. However, it should be noted that while \n     visual display systems accommodate persons who are deaf or \n     are hearing impaired, assistive listening systems aid only \n     those with a partial loss of hearing.\n       A. Visual Display Systems. Announcements may be provided in \n     a visual format by the use of electronic message boards or \n     video monitors.\n       Electronic message boards using a light emitting diode \n     (LED) or ``flip-dot'' display are currently provided in some \n     transit stations and terminals and may be usable in vehicles. \n     These devices may be used to provide real time or pre-\n     programmed messages; however, real time message displays \n     require the availability of an employee for keyboard entry of \n     the information to be announced.\n       Video monitor systems, such as visual paging systems \n     provided in some airports (e.g., Baltimore-Washington \n     International Airport), are another alternative. The \n     Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board \n     (Access Board) can provide technical assistance and \n     information on these systems (``Airport TDD Access: Two Case \n     Studies,'' (1990)).\n       B. Assistive Listening Systems. Assistive listening systems \n     (ALS) are intended to augment standard public address and \n     audio systems by providing signals which can be received \n     directly by persons with special receivers or their own \n     hearing aids and which eliminate or filter background noise. \n     Magnetic induction loops, infra-red and radio frequency \n     systems are types of listening systems which are appropriate \n     for various applications.\n       An assistive listening system appropriate for transit \n     vehicles, where a group of persons or where the specific \n     individuals are not known in advance, may be different from \n     the system appropriate for a particular individual provided \n     as an auxiliary aid or as part of a reasonable accommodation. \n     The appropriate device for an individual is the type that \n     individual can use, whereas the appropriate system for a \n     station or vehicle will necessarily be geared toward the \n     ''average'' or aggregate needs of various individuals. \n     Earphone jacks with variable volume controls can benefit only \n     people who have slight hearing loss and do not help people \n     who use hearing aids. At the present time, magnetic induction \n     loops are the most feasible type of listening system for \n     people who use hearing aids equipped with ``T-coils'', but \n     people without hearing aids or those with hearing aids not \n     equipped with inductive pick-ups cannot use them without \n     special receivers. Radio frequency systems can be extremely \n     effective and inexpensive. People without hearing aids can \n     use them, but people with hearing aids need a special \n     receiver to use them as they are presently designed. If \n     hearing aids had a jack to allow a by-pass of microphones, \n     then radio frequency systems would be suitable for people \n     with and without hearing aids. Some listening systems may be \n     subject to interference from other equipment and feedback \n     from hearing aids of people who are using the systems.

Sec. Sec. 1301 et seq. In general, the CAA applies the \n     rights and protections of eleven federal labor and employment \n     statutes to covered employees and employing offices within \n     the legislative branch. Section 215(a) provides that each \n     employing office and each covered employee shall comply with \n     the provisions of section 5 of the Occupational Safety and \n     Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 654 (``OSHAct''). 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1341(a).\n       Section 215(d) of the CAA requires the Board of Directors \n     of the Office of Compliance established under the CAA to \n     issue regulations implementing the section. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1341(d). Section 215(d) further states that such \n     regulations ``shall be the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) except to \n     the extent that the Board may determine, for good cause shown \n     and stated together with the regulation, that a modification \n     of such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and\n\n[[Page S62]]\n\n     protections under this section.'' Id. Section 215(d) further \n     provides that the regulations ``shall include a method of \n     identifying, for purposes of this section and for different \n     categories of violations of subsection (a), the employing \n     office responsible for correction of a particular \n     violation.'' Id.\n       On September 19, 1996, the Board published in the \n     Congressional Record a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (``NPR'') (142 Cong. Rec. S11019 (daily ed., Sept. 19, \n     1996)). In response to the NPR, the Board received four \n     written comments, two of which were from offices within the \n     Legislative Branch and two of which were from labor \n     organizations. After full consideration of the comments \n     received in response to the proposed regulations, the Board \n     has adopted and is submitting these regulations for approval \n     by the Congress pursuant to section 304(c) of the CAA.\n\n             I. Summary of Comments and Board's Final Rules\n\n            A. Request for additional rulemaking proceedings\n\n       One commenter requested that the Board withdraw its \n     proposed regulations and engage in what it terms \n     ``investigative rulemaking,'' a process that apparently is to \n     include discussions with involved parties regarding the \n     nature and scope of the regulations. This commenter expressed \n     the concern that affected parties had not been sufficiently \n     involved in the rulemaking process and have been discouraged \n     from providing meaningful comments. Specifically, the \n     commenter objected to the following actions of the Board: (1) \n     providing a comment period of no more than 30 days; (2) \n     issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking without first \n     issuing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking; (3) \n     issuing proposed regulations under section 215 \n     concurrently with proposed regulations under section 210 \n     and shortly before the Congress had adjourned sine die; \n     (4) stating in the NPR that nomenclature and other \n     technical changes were made to the adopted regulations, \n     but not specifically cataloguing each of those changes in \n     the summary of the proposed rules; and (5) not providing a \n     record of consultations between the Office and \n     representatives of the Department of Labor in the NPR.\n       The Board has considered each of the above concerns and, \n     after careful evaluation of them, has determined that further \n     rulemaking proceedings, with their concomitant costs and \n     delay, are not warranted in this context.\n       1. The request for an extended comment period and for \n     ``investigatory'' rulemaking.--The rulemaking procedure \n     employed by the Board in this context is substantially \n     similar to that employed by the Board with respect to every \n     other regulation promulgated thus far under the CAA; and it \n     complies with the required procedures under section 304 of \n     the CAA. Specifically, section 304(b) generally requires the \n     Board to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking and to provide \n     a comment period of at least 30 days. The Board has done so. \n     Nor is there any reason to believe that a significant \n     extension of the comment period beyond 30 days or a resort to \n     alternative forms of rulemaking would result in a different \n     rulemaking comment record, either qualitatively or \n     quantitatively: The Board's rulemaking record includes an \n     extensive report from its General Counsel--a report which \n     itself was prepared on the basis of an extensive \n     investigation by the General Counsel and with the invited \n     participation of all employing offices. In addition, the \n     General Counsel met with representatives of a number of \n     employing offices prior to the inspections, including the \n     Architect of the Capitol, concerning the appropriate \n     standards to be applied to Legislative Branch facilities. \n     Moreover, no commenter claimed an inability in this \n     rulemaking proceeding to adequately present its views through \n     written submissions. Indeed, the only specific request for an \n     extension of the comment period came from this particular \n     commenter, who requested an extension of only one day, which \n     was granted. No request for further time was sought by the \n     commenter or by any other person or organization. Finally, a \n     review of the comments received tends to reinforce the \n     Board's view that an extended comment period, hearings, and/\n     or other additional forms of rulemaking proceedings would \n     only result in the addition to the record of information \n     which would at most duplicate or corroborate the written \n     comments without providing further insight into or \n     elucidation of the issues involved.\n       2. Failure to issue an Advance Notice of Proposed \n     Rulemaking.--Although not expressly provided for in the \n     Administrative Procedure Act (``APA''), an advance notice of \n     proposed rulemaking (``ANPR'') is sometimes used by \n     administrative agencies to seek information from the public \n     to assist in framing a notice of proposed rulemaking and to \n     narrow the issues during the public comment period on the \n     proposed rules ultimately developed. See, e.g., 52 Fed. Reg. \n     38,794 (1987) (preliminary notice for Medicare anti-kickback \n     regulations). Thus, in prior rulemakings, the Board has \n     sometimes used ANPRs to obtain views regarding interpretation \n     of statutory provisions in the CAA that had not previously \n     been interpreted by the Board and to obtain general \n     information regarding conditions within the Legislative \n     Branch that may bear on rulemaking questions. See, e.g., 141 \n     Cong. Rec. S14542 (daily ed. Sept. 28, 1995) (ANPR seeking \n     information regarding, inter alia, the standard for \n     determining whether and to what extent regulations under the \n     CAA should be modified for ``good cause;'' whether \n     regulations imposing notice posting and recordkeeping \n     requirements are included within the CAA; whether certain \n     regulations constituted ``substantive regulations;'' and \n     whether the concept of ``joint employer status'' is \n     applicable under the CAA). From these prior rulemaking \n     proceedings, the Board has developed a body of \n     interpretations of the CAA upon which it has drawn in \n     developing the proposed rules in this rulemaking.\n       In contrast to those earlier rulemaking proceedings, here \n     no ANPR was necessary or appropriate. Both the Board and its \n     statutory appointees have now had over a year's experience in \n     addressing regulatory issues governing the Legislative Branch \n     and have collected a body of institutional knowledge and \n     experience that makes the open-ended information gathering \n     techniques such as an ANPR less needed. Indeed, the \n     rulemaking experience under the CAA over the last year has \n     shown that ANPRs have become less useful over time. For \n     example, although the Board received twelve separate \n     responses to the first ANPR that it issued in September of \n     1995, the most recent ANPR issued by the Board, regarding \n     rulemaking under section 220(e), elicited only 2 comments \n     directed to section 220(e), neither of which addressed the \n     precise questions posed by the Board in that ANPR. See 142 \n     Cong. Rec. S5552 (daily ed. May 23, 1996) (NPR regarding \n     section 220(e)). And, in this context, there is no reason to \n     believe that further comments beyond those received in \n     response to the NPR would have been received had an ANPR been \n     issued.\n       More to the point, there is no reason to believe that \n     procedures other than the traditional notice-and-comment \n     procedures outlined in section 304 of the CAA would develop \n     any further useful information in the context of rulemaking \n     under section 215 especially given the information already \n     gathered by the Office regarding these issues. Among other \n     things, the General Counsel has conducted an inspection of \n     all facilities within the Legislative Branch for \n     compliance with health and safety standards under sections \n     215 and disability access standards under section 210, \n     utilizing as guidelines standards that were in a form \n     virtually identical to the regulations which the Board has \n     proposed. The General Counsel also sent detailed \n     inspection questionnaires to each Member of the House of \n     Representatives and to each Member of the Senate regarding \n     compliance with health and safety and disability access \n     standards in District and Home State offices. The General \n     Counsel's reports regarding compliance issues under \n     sections 210 and 215 of the CAA were submitted June 28, \n     1996 and detailed the application of safety and health and \n     disability regulations to conditions within the \n     legislative branch. Copies of those reports were delivered \n     in July 1996 to each Senator and Representative, to each \n     committee of Congress, and to representatives of every \n     other employing office in the Legislative Branch, \n     including the commenter. No comments were received from \n     anyone concerning the appropriateness of applying any such \n     regulations to Legislative Branch offices, and the \n     commenter has not provided any here.\n       Where, as here, an ANPR would not likely result in receipt \n     of additional useful information to develop a proposed rule, \n     there is also the concern that its use might be viewed as \n     evidence of procrastination in the face of an obligation to \n     proceed quickly with important rulemaking activity. Cf. \n     United Steelworkers of America v. Pendergrass, 819 F.2d 1263, \n     1268 (3d Cir. 1987) (challenge to OSHA's failure to issue \n     revised rule on hazard communication in response to court \n     remand; court was extremely critical of OSHA having published \n     an ANPR to supplement original record); Administrative \n     Conference of the United States Recommendation No. 87-10, \n     ``Regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration,'' published at 1 C.F.R. Sec. 305.87-10, para. \n     3(e) (1989) (recommending that agency should not routinely \n     use ANPR's as an information-gathering technique and that \n     they should be used only when information not otherwise \n     available to the agency ``is likely to be forthcoming'' in \n     response to the ANPR). This is particularly true where, as \n     here, the Office of Compliance, through the General Counsel, \n     has already gathered a considerable body of experience and \n     information regarding the conditions of operations and \n     facilities within the Legislative Branch and how the \n     regulations proposed by the Board would likely affect those \n     operations and facilities. Nothing has been offered by any \n     commenter to suggest a new area of inquiry or information \n     which was not considered by the Board in the NPR that might \n     affect the Board's decision regarding any of the regulatory \n     matters contained in the NPR. In the absence of any such \n     showing, additional rulemaking proceedings are neither \n     required nor desirable.\n       3. The timing of the notice of proposed rulemaking.--The \n     commenter's argument regarding the timing of the issuance of \n     the regulations also does not require additional rulemaking \n     proceedings.\n       Despite the commenter's suggestion to the contrary, there \n     is nothing unusual or unprecedented about the Board issuing \n     simultaneously two notices of proposed rulemaking \n     implementing two separate sections of the CAA. For example, \n     on November 28, 1995, the Board issued concurrent notices of \n     proposed rulemaking to implement the rights and protections \n     of five major sections of the CAA: sections 202 (Family and \n     Medical Leave Act), 203 (Fair Labor Standards Act), 204 \n     (Employee Polygraph Protection Act),\n\n[[Page S63]]\n\n     and 205 (Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act). \n     See, e.g., 141 Cong. Rec. S17627-S17652, S17603-27, S17656-\n     64, S17652-56 (daily ed., Nov. 28, 1995). The volume of \n     regulations covered by those five notices (and the collective \n     complexity and diversity of the legal and interpretative \n     rulemaking issues involved in promulgating those five sets of \n     proposed regulations) was significantly greater than the \n     proposed regulations at issue here and those proposed under \n     section 210. The commenter has not shown that there is \n     anything about the nature and extent of the regulations in \n     the current rulemaking proceedings that has impeded the \n     ability of any commenter to provide useful and comprehensive \n     comments.\n       Similarly, the timing of the issuance of proposed \n     regulations here was not only appropriate, but it also was \n     necessary. Sections 210 and 215 of the CAA become effective \n     on January 1, 1997, a date which was set by the CAA , not by \n     the Board. The proposed regulations were developed and issued \n     as soon as practicable given, inter alia, the need of the \n     Board and all interested persons to first have the benefit of \n     the General Counsel's investigation and reports and the need \n     to first complete rulemaking on sections of the CAA that \n     contained earlier effective dates, such as sections 203-207 \n     (effective January 23, 1996) and section 220 (effective \n     October 1, 1996). The proposed regulations were issued when \n     they were in order to afford commenters the earliest \n     practical opportunity to comment on the proposed regulations \n     so that final regulations could be adopted by the Board \n     before the effective date of section 215 of the CAA.\n       The schedule of Congress cannot be a determinative factor \n     for the Board in deciding when to issue proposed regulations. \n     The CAA applies whether the Congress is in session or not; \n     and the CAA imposes deadlines that must be met whether the \n     Congress is in session or not. The session of Congress is \n     relevant to the date of publication of regulations, which is \n     why the Board submitted the NPR to the Congress prior to \n     adjournment sine die, so that the NPR could be published (in \n     accordance with section 304(1) of the CAA) for comment prior \n     to January 1, 1997. The rights and protections of the CAA \n     continue while Congress is in recess, and the CAA requires \n     that employing offices and Members meet their obligations \n     whether Congress is in session or not.\n       4. Technical and nomenclature changes.--As with prior \n     rulemakings, the Board has proposed to make technical and \n     nomenclature changes to make the language of the adopted \n     regulations fit more naturally to situations arising within \n     the Legislative Branch. See, e.g., 142 Cong. Rec. at S225 \n     (daily ed. Jan. 22, 1996) (final regulations regarding \n     section 203 of the CAA). However, the Board has made clear \n     that such changes are not intended to affect a substantive \n     change in the regulations. Id. Examples of such changes \n     include the following substitutions: ``employing office'' for \n     ``employer,'' ``covered employee'' for ``employee,'' \n     definitions of ``employing office'' (including the list of \n     offices set forth in the CAA) for the definition of \n     ``employer,'' and deleting provisions regarding interstate \n     commerce as a basis for jurisdiction (which is not a \n     requirement of the CAA).\n       The Board disagrees with the commenter's argument that \n     failing to catalogue each of these changes in the preamble \n     somehow hinders commenters' ability to provide effective \n     comments regarding the proposed regulations. Where \n     significant changes in the substance of the regulations have \n     been proposed, such changes have been summarized and \n     discussed in the preamble to the proposed regulations. \n     However, as in past notices of proposed rulemaking, the Board \n     has generally described the nature of proposed technical and \n     nomenclature changes and has made clear that such changes are \n     not intended to effect a significant or substantive change in \n     the nature of the regulations adopted. Moreover, the complete \n     text of the proposed regulations, including technical and \n     nomenclature changes, has been made available for review as \n     part of the NPR. It is the responsibility of commenters to \n     review and comment on these matters; while the Board desires \n     reasonably to assist this process, it cannot do the \n     commenters' work; and there is absolutely no reason to delay \n     rulemaking on this basis.\n       5. Record of comments and public meetings.--Finally, the \n     Board rejects the suggestion that it publish a summary of the \n     discussions that have occurred between the Office and \n     representatives of the Secretary of Labor and other agencies. \n     Those discussions have not been with members of the Board; \n     and the public record is solely for matters presented to the \n     Board by outside persons. General discussions with outside \n     persons by staff of the Office of Compliance are not properly \n     part of that record; nor are discussions between staff and \n     the Board properly part of that record. There is no legal \n     basis or precedent for making such discussions part of the \n     record; and to do so would improperly chill inter-agency and \n     intra-agency deliberations and communications.\n\n            B. Regulations that the Board proposed to adopt\n\n       1. Substantive health and safety standards at Parts 1910 \n     and 1926, 29 CFR.--In the NPR, the Board proposed that \n     otherwise applicable health and safety standards of the \n     Secretary's regulations published at Parts 1910 and 1926 of \n     Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (``29 CFR'') be \n     adopted with only limited modifications. All commenters \n     agreed in general with the Board's proposal.\n       2. Recordkeeping requirements contained in substantive \n     health and safety standards of Parts 1910 and 1926.--The \n     Board further proposed to include within its regulations \n     recordkeeping requirements contained in the substantive \n     health and safety standards of Parts 1910 and 1926, 29 CFR. \n     One commenter took issue with this decision, arguing that \n     adoption of such requirements is contrary to the intent of \n     the CAA. The Board disagrees.\n       Section 215(d)(2) provides that the Board regulations shall \n     be ``the same as'' the regulations of the Secretary \n     implementing the health and safety standards of section 5 of \n     the OSHAct. Where, as here, a recordkeeping or posting \n     requirement is expressly contained in and inextricably \n     intertwined with a substantive health and safety standard, \n     the Board is required to adopt the standard as written under \n     section 215(d)(2), unless there is good cause to believe that \n     not including the recordkeeping or posting requirement would \n     be ``more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections'' under section 215. In contrast to the general \n     recordkeeping regulations that implement section 8(c) of the \n     OSHAct (discussed at section I.C.2., infra), adoption of the \n     health and safety standards, including those specific \n     recordkeeping requirements that are part and parcel of such \n     standards, is authorized (if not compelled) by section \n     215(d)(2).\n       The commenter does not offer any basis for concluding that \n     excluding such recordkeeping or posting requirements would be \n     ``more effective'' for implementing the rights and \n     protections of the health and safety standard at issue. On \n     the contrary, there is every reason to believe that the \n     substantive health and safety protections contained in \n     subpart Z of Part 1910, such as the rules relating to \n     employee exposure, would be less effective without a \n     requirement that employing offices document such exposure.\n\n          C. Regulations that the Board proposes not to adopt\n\n       1. Rules of procedure for variances, procedure regarding \n     inspections, citations, and notices.-- The Board proposed not \n     to adopt as regulations under section 215(d) provisions of \n     the Secretary's regulations that did not constitute health \n     and safety standards and/or were not promulgated to \n     implement the provisions of section 5 of the OSHAct. 142 \n     Cong. Rec. at S11020. In doing so, the Board noted that, \n     with respect to those regulations that dealt with \n     procedures of the Office, the Executive Director might, \n     where appropriate, decide to propose comparable provisions \n     pursuant to a rulemaking undertaken in accordance with \n     section 303 of the CAA.\n       All four commenters took issue with the Board's decision. \n     Two commenters argued that, because sections 8, 9 and 10 of \n     the OSHAct (which include provisions governing variances and \n     the procedure for inspections, citations, and penalties) are \n     referenced in section 215(c) of the CAA, the Secretary's \n     regulations implementing those sections (Parts 1903 and 1905, \n     29 CFR) are within the Board's mandatory rulemaking authority \n     under section 215(d)(2). These commenters characterized the \n     Board's decision as a refusal to adopt the variance, \n     citations, and inspections regulations because they are \n     ``procedural'' as opposed to ``substantive'' regulations, \n     which the commenters believe is inconsistent with the Board's \n     resolution of a similar issue in the context of the Board's \n     section 220 regulations. See 142 Cong. Rec. at S5072 (daily \n     ed. May 15, 1996) (NPR regarding section 220) (procedural \n     rules ``can in fact be substantive regulations'' and the fact \n     that the ``regulations may arguably be procedural in content \n     is, in the Board's view, not a legally sufficient reason for \n     not viewing them as `substantive' regulations.''). Two other \n     commenters argued that regulations covering the subject of \n     variances, citations, and similar other matters cannot be \n     issued as rules governing the procedures of the Office under \n     section 303 of the CAA, because to do so would improperly \n     circumvent Congress' ability to review and pass on \n     substantive regulations prior to their implementation (since \n     section 303 regulations require no congressional approval). A \n     third commenter argued that rules regarding variances, \n     inspections, and citations should be issued by the Board as \n     substantive regulations, rather than by the Executive \n     Director under section 303 of the CAA; however, this \n     commenter did not offer a legal basis for this argument. \n     Finally, a fourth commenter argued that the Part 1903 \n     regulations should be issued as part of the current \n     rulemaking, regardless whether they are issued as substantive \n     regulations under section 215(d)(2) of the CAA or as \n     procedures of the Office under section 303 of the CAA.\n       After carefully considering these various comments, the \n     Board has again determined that it would not be legally \n     appropriate to adopt the Secretary's regulations at Parts \n     1903 and 1905, 29 CFR, as regulations under section \n     215(d)(2). Contrary to the commenters' characterization, the \n     Board excluded Parts 1903 and 1905 from the proposed \n     regulations, not because they were ``procedural'' as opposed \n     to ``substantive,'' but because they were not within the \n     scope of the Board's rulemaking authority under section \n     215(d)(2) of the CAA. Section 215(d)(2) provides that the \n     regulations issued by the Board to implement section 215 \n     ``shall be the same as substantive regulations promulgated by \n     the Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions \n     referred to in subsection (a) [of section 215],'' except for \n     modification of those regulations for ``good cause.'' The \n     only ``statutory provision[] referred to in subsection (a)'' \n     of section 215 is section 5 of the\n\n[[Page S64]]\n\n     OSHAct, which sets forth the substantive health and safety \n     standards applicable to employers. Thus, only the regulations \n     of the Secretary that implement the substantive health and \n     safety standards of section 5 of the OSHAct are within the \n     scope of the Board's rulemaking authority under section \n     215(d)(2). Because the Secretary's health and \n     safety standards contained in Parts 1910 and 1926 \n     implement section 5 of the OSHAct, such regulations may be \n     included within the proposed regulations; but the \n     Secretary's regulations regarding variance procedures, \n     inspections, citations and notices, set forth at Parts \n     1903 and 1904, were promulgated to implement sections 8, \n     9, and 10 of the OSHAct, statutory provisions which are \n     not ``referred to in subsection (a)'' of section 215. \n     Thus, the plain language of section 215(d)(2) excludes \n     such regulations from the scope of the Board's rulemaking \n     mandate under section 215(d)(2).\n       The commenters apparently read section 215(d)(2)'s \n     requirement that the Board's regulations be ``the same as \n     substantive regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Labor'' as including any regulation promulgated by the \n     Secretary to implement any provision of the OSHAct referred \n     to in any subsection of section 215, including subsection \n     (c). But the Board may not properly ignore the requirement of \n     section 215(d)(2) that the regulations be promulgated ``to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     (a).'' To do so would violate the cardinal rule of statutory \n     construction that a statute should not be read as rendering \n     any word or phrase therein mere surplusage. See Babbitt v. \n     Sweet Home Ch. of Commun. for Greater Or., 115 S.Ct. 2407, \n     2413 (1995).\n       The only way in which regulations implementing provisions \n     of the OSHAct referred to in subsection (c) could be \n     considered within the scope of regulations under section \n     215(d)(2) would be by speculating that Congress' specific \n     reference to subsection (a) was inadvertent. However, such \n     ``[s]peculation loses, for the more natural reading of the \n     statute's text, which would give effect to all of its \n     provisions, always prevails over a mere suggestion to \n     disregard or ignore duly created law as legislative \n     oversight.'' United Food and Commercial Workers v. Brown \n     Group, Inc., 116 S.Ct. 1529, 1533 (1996).\n       Furthermore, because section 215(c) sets forth a detailed \n     enforcement procedure which is significantly different from \n     the procedures of the OSHAct, it is doubtful that the \n     drafters intended to include regulations implementing OSHAct \n     enforcement procedures as part of the Board's rulemaking \n     under section 215(c)(2). Instead, given the significant \n     differences between the two statutory enforcement provisions, \n     it is reasonable to conclude that Congress did not intend the \n     Board to presume that the regulations regarding such \n     procedures should be ``the same'' as the Secretary's \n     procedures, as they generally must be if they fell within the \n     Board's substantive rulemaking authority under section \n     215(d)(2). Thus, the commenters' interpretation is not \n     supported by either the text or the legislative history of \n     section 215.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Even under the commenters' narrow reading of section \n     215(d)(2), Part 1905 (rules of practice and procedure \n     relating to variances) is not a ``substantive regulation.'' \n     Part 1905 was issued by the Secretary as a ``rule of agency \n     procedures and practice'' and thus was not promulgated after \n     notice and comment. See 36 Fed. Reg. 12,290 (June 30, 1971) \n     (``The rules of practice [Part 1905] shall be effective upon \n     publication in the Federal Register (6-30-71).'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       For this reason, the Board must also reject the commenter's \n     suggestion that it ``modify'' the proposed regulations to \n     include the Secretary's Part 1903 and 1904 regulations. The \n     Board cannot adopt as a ``modification'' regulations that are \n     not within the scope of section 215(d)(2). See 141 Cong. Rec. \n     S17603, 17604 (daily ed. Nov. 28, 1995) (``Because the \n     Board's authority to modify the Secretary's regulations for \n     `good cause' does not authorize it to adopt regulatory \n     requirements that are the equivalent of statutory \n     requirements that Congress has omitted from the CAA * * * \n     ''); see also MCI Telecommunications v. American Tel. & Tel., \n     114 S.Ct. 2223, 2230 (1994) (FCC's statutory authority to \n     ``modify any requirement'' under section of tariff statute \n     did not authorize FCC to make basic and fundamental changes \n     in regulatory scheme; term ``modify'' connotes moderate or \n     incremental change in existing requirements).\n       2. General recordkeeping requirements.--In the NPR, the \n     Board proposed not to adopt regulations implementing the \n     general recordkeeping requirements of section 8(c) of the \n     OSHAct. The Board determined that section 8(c) of the OSHAct \n     is neither a part of the rights and protections of section 5 \n     of the OSHAct nor a substantive health and safety standard \n     referred to therein. Thus, regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary to implement the recordkeeping requirements are not \n     within the scope of the Board's rulemaking under section \n     215(d)(2).\n       Two commenters asked the Board to reconsider this decision \n     and to issue regulations implementing section 8(c) of the \n     OSHAct. The Board has considered these comments and finds no \n     new arguments or statutory evidence therein to support a \n     change in the Board's original conclusion. The arguments \n     offered by the commenters were substantially the same as \n     those that were considered and rejected by the Board in an \n     earlier rulemaking on an essentially identical issue. See 141 \n     Cong. Rec. S17603, 17604 (daily ed. Nov. 28, 1995) (resolving \n     identical issue in the context of rulemaking under section \n     203 of the CAA).\n\n         D. Method for identifying responsible employing office\n\n       In section 1.106 of the proposed regulations, the Board set \n     forth a method for identifying the employing office \n     responsible for correction of a particular violation. Under \n     proposed section 1.106, correction of a violation of section \n     215(a) ``is the responsibility of any employing office that \n     is a creating employing office, a controlling employing \n     office, and/or a correcting employing office, as defined by \n     this section, to the extent that the employing office is in a \n     position to correct or abate the hazard or to ensure its \n     correction or abatement.''\n       1. General comments regarding section 1.106.--One commenter \n     argued that section 1.106 should be significantly revised or \n     a different method developed by the Board because: (1) the \n     definitions of ``creating,'' ``exposing,'' ``controlling,'' \n     and ``correcting'' employer are allegedly vague and confusing \n     and give insufficient guidance to employing offices regarding \n     their responsibilities; and (2) section 1.106 contemplates \n     the possibility that more than one employing office may be \n     held responsible for correcting a violation, which is said to \n     be contrary to section 215 (which the commenter argues \n     prohibits the imposition of joint responsibility) and, \n     assuming that more than one employing office may properly be \n     held responsible under section 1.106, the Board should \n     provide a mechanism for allocating joint responsibility among \n     multiple offices. The Board has considered each of these \n     arguments and, as explained below, finds no reason to depart \n     substantially from the proposed regulations as issued.\n        a. Definition of ``creating,'' ``exposing,'' \n     ``controlling,'' and ``correcting'' employing office.--The \n     commenter argued that the definitions of ``creating,'' \n     ``exposing,'' ``controlling,'' and ''correcting'' employing \n     office are vague and confusing because allegedly ``they do \n     little more than imply that an employing office can be \n     responsible in almost all situations'' and allegedly do not \n     give any more guidance on this issue than before the proposed \n     regulations were submitted. However, the commenter has not \n     explained how the provisions of proposed section 1.106 can \n     fairly be seen as vague or confusing. To be sure, proposed \n     section 1.106 states general principles that will need to be \n     applied in the context of actual factual situations by the \n     General Counsel and, ultimately, by the Board. But this is \n     the case with almost every rule of law, whether stated in a \n     statute, a regulation, or a judicial decision. The fact that \n     the text of a regulation on its face does not purport to \n     provide a clear answer to every hypothetical question that \n     may be posed by a party is not a reason to deem a regulation \n     to be unclear. In the course of individual cases before the \n     General Counsel and ultimately the Board, application of \n     these rules will be made to specific situations. Without \n     further elaboration by the commenter as to the nature of the \n     purported ambiguity, there is no reason to believe that \n     further clarification or elaboration in section 1.106 is \n     needed.\n       b. Joint responsibility.--The commenter argued that section \n     1.106 authorizes assigning correction responsibility to more \n     than one employing office, which it said to be is contrary to \n     the CAA. In support of its argument, the commenter seized \n     upon the provisions of section 215(d)(3), which direct the \n     Board to develop a method for identifying ``the employing \n     office, not employing offices,'' and section 415, which \n     states that funds to correct violations may be paid only from \n     funds appropriated ``to the employing office or entity \n     responsible for correcting such violations.'' (emphasis in \n     original of comment). According to the commenter, these \n     provisions establish a statutory prohibition on the \n     imposition of ``joint'' responsibility for section 215 \n     violations. Again, the Board disagrees.\n       First, it is an elementary rule of statutory construction \n     that reference to persons or parties in statutory language \n     stated in the singular is presumed to include the plural. \n     See, e.g., 1 U.S.C. Sec. 1 (``In determining the meaning of \n     any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates otherwise--\n     words importing the singular include and apply to several \n     persons, parties, or things'').\n       Second, nothing in the language of section 215 suggests \n     that the General Counsel and the Board must determine the \n     (e.g., ``sole'') employing office responsible for correction. \n     On the contrary, the language of section 215, including other \n     subsections not cited by the commenter, suggests that more \n     than one office may have responsibilities for the safety and \n     health of a covered employee. For example, by applying \n     section 5 of the OSHAct, section 215(a) of the CAA imposes a \n     duty on each employing office to provide to its employees \n     employment and a place of employment free of recognized \n     hazards. Section 215(a) makes clear that other entities (in \n     addition to the employing office) may also have a duty to \n     those employees regarding such hazards ``irrespective of \n     whether the entity has an employment relationship'' with that \n     employee. Section 215(a)(2)(C). See also subsection (c)(2) \n     (A) and (B) (authorizing the General Counsel to issue a \n     citation or notice to ``any employing office responsible for \n     correcting a violation'') (emphasis added).\n       Third, adoption of a rule that requires the General Counsel \n     in an investigatory proceeding or the hearing officer and/or \n     the Board in an adjudicatory proceeding to determine a single \n     employing office responsible for correction of a violation \n     would be unworkable (and in some cases impossible to apply) \n     and\n\n[[Page S65]]\n\n     would be inconsistent with similar principles applied under \n     the OSHAct. In the private sector, where a single employer \n     controls the working conditions and working environment of \n     the employees, that employer is solely accountable under the \n     OSHAct for providing safe working conditions for its \n     employees. Similarly, in situations under section 215 of the \n     CAA where the alleged violation involves a one-employing \n     office workplace that is under the sole authority and \n     jurisdiction of that office, section 1.106 would not be \n     needed to resolve the issue of responsibility for correction. \n     However, as the Board noted in NPR, the vast majority of \n     workplaces in the Legislative Branch are not conventional, \n     one-employing office workplaces. Instead, there are a number \n     of employing offices and entities (including, but not limited \n     to, the Architect of the Capitol, the Sergeants-At-Arms, the \n     Chief Administrative Officer of the House, Senate and \n     House committees, and individual Members) that have \n     varying degrees of actual or apparent jurisdiction, \n     authority, and responsibility for the physical location in \n     which the violation occurred and, therefore, for \n     correction of violations. Section 1.106 is needed to \n     address such situations; and it can workably do so only by \n     imposing responsibility on several covered entities.\n       In private sector worksites where the working environment \n     is controlled by more than one employer, such as in \n     construction or other activities involving subcontractors, \n     OSHA's longstanding policy has been to hold multiple \n     employers responsible for the correction of workplace hazards \n     in appropriate cases. Thus, when safety or health hazards \n     occur on multi-employer worksites in the private sector, OSHA \n     will issue citations not only to the employer whose employees \n     were exposed to the violation, but also to other employers, \n     such as general contractors or host employers, who can \n     reasonably be expected to have identified or corrected the \n     hazard by virtue of their supervisory role over the worksite. \n     See OSHA Field Inspection Reference manual (``FIRM''), OSHA \n     Instruction CPL 2.103 at III-28,29 (1994). This multi-\n     employer policy does not confer special burdens on these \n     superintending employers, but merely recognizes that \n     employers with overall administrative responsibility for an \n     ongoing project or worksite are responsible under the OSHAct \n     for taking reasonable steps to correct the violation, or to \n     require correction of hazards to the extent of their \n     authority and/or responsibility. There is no legal basis for \n     excusing employing offices under the CAA from similar \n     responsibilities.\n       As noted in the NPR, the employing office's responsibility \n     for correction is only to the extent that it is ``in a \n     position to correct or abate the hazard or to ensure its \n     correction or abatement.'' In addition, the duties of the \n     employing office under section 1.106 are no more than to \n     exercise the power or authority that it may possess, \n     singularly or together with other employing offices, to \n     ensure the correction of the hazard. The Board finds no \n     compelling reason to reconsider this rule.\n       The Board also declines the commenter's suggestion that it \n     adopt rules allocating responsibility in what it \n     characterizes as ``joint'' liability situations. Contrary to \n     the commenter's assumption, the responsibility under section \n     1.106 is not ``joint'' but ``several.'' That is, the \n     employing office is only responsible to the extent that it is \n     a ``creating,'' ``exposing,'' ``controlling,'' and/or \n     ``correcting'' employing office and to the extent that it is \n     ``in a position to correct or abate the hazard or to ensure \n     its correction or abatement.'' Thus, if the facts establish \n     that a particular employing office only ``exposed'' its \n     employees to a hazard (but did not create the hazard or have \n     control over the workspace involved), that employing office \n     discharges its responsibility (and abates its ``share'' of a \n     citation) by ceasing the activity that exposes its employees \n     to the hazard (by not sending its employees to the area, \n     providing personal protective equipment, etc.). Even though \n     the ``exposing'' employing office has discharged its \n     responsibility (and is, therefore, no longer a ``responsible \n     employing office'' with respect to that violation), the \n     ``violation'' at that worksite is not abated until the \n     condition creating the hazard is eliminated. In most cases, \n     that responsibility will be assigned to the ``correcting'' \n     employing office. However, in some cases, the ''controlling'' \n     employing office (the one with legal authority to control the \n     area) may be a different office than the ``correcting'' \n     employing office and, therefore, may need to be a party to \n     any proceeding so that complete relief can be granted by the \n     hearing officer to ensure correction of the violation.\n       For all of the above reasons, the Board will adopt section \n     1.106, as modified below, as part of its final regulations.\n       2. Recommended modifications to section 1.106(c).--One \n     commenter took issue with the following portion of section \n     1.106(c):\n       ``In addition, if equipment or facilities to be used by an \n     employing office, but not under the control of the employing \n     office, do not meet applicable health and safety standards or \n     otherwise constitute a violation of section 215(a), it is the \n     responsibility of the employing office not to permit its \n     employees to utilize such equipment or facilities. In such \n     circumstances, the employing office is in violation if, and \n     only if, it permits its employees to utilize such equipment \n     or facilities.''\n       According to the commenter, this statement fails to \n     recognize the affirmative defense to a violation in \n     situations involving multi-employer worksites where the cited \n     employer does not have the ability to recognize or abate the \n     offending condition or has taken reasonable alternative \n     measures to protect its employees from the hazard. See Anning \n     Johnson Co. v. OSHRC, 516 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir. 1975). The \n     Board agrees with the commenter that employing offices should \n     have the benefit of this affirmative defense in such a \n     situation. Accordingly, the Board will incorporate the \n     commenter's suggested language (which has been modified to \n     conform to the elements of the multi-employer affirmative \n     defense). As amended, the passage in section 1.106(c) will be \n     revised to read as follows:\n       ``In addition, if equipment or facilities to be used by an \n     employing office, but not under the control of the employing \n     office, do not meet applicable health and safety standards or \n     otherwise constitute a violation of section 215(a), it is the \n     responsibility of the employing office not to permit its \n     employees to utilize such equipment or facilities. In such \n     circumstances, an employing office that did not create or \n     control a violation may avoid liability if, and only if, it \n     proves either that it took reasonable alternative measures to \n     protect its employees against the hazard or that it lacked \n     sufficient expertise to recognize that the equipment or \n     facilities did not meet applicable health and safety \n     standards or otherwise constituted a violation of section \n     215(a).''\n\n        E. Future changes in text of health and safety standards\n\n       The commenters generally agreed with the Board's proposed \n     approach regarding changes in the substantive health and \n     safety standards. However, two commenters suggested that the \n     Board expressly state the manner and frequency with and by \n     which it plans to submit changes in substantive rules, and \n     the manner and frequency with and by which the Office will \n     advise employees and employing offices of changes to external \n     documents.\n       As stated in the NPR, the Board will make any changes in \n     the substantive health and safety standards under the \n     rulemaking procedures of section 304 of the CAA. Those \n     changes will be made as frequently as needed. It is \n     impossible for the Board to establish a pre-set schedule \n     under which as yet unanticipated and unknown changes will be \n     made. Similarly, the frequency by which the Office may issue \n     information to employing offices and employing offices \n     regarding the requirements of the CAA will be based on the \n     appropriate professional judgment of the Office and its \n     statutory appointees in the particular circumstances that \n     issues arise; it cannot be specified in advance.\n\n                   F. Comments on specific provisions\n\n       1. Specific standards of Part 1910 incorporated by \n     reference.--One commenter recommended that the Board not \n     adopt the following provisions that were included within the \n     proposed regulations, which the commenter contended are \n     inapplicable to operations of the Legislative Branch: \n     1910.104 (relating to installation of bulk oxygen systems), \n     1910.216 (relating to mills and calenders in the rubber and \n     plastics industries), and 1910.266 (relating to logging \n     operations). Upon further consideration, the Board will \n     delete these provisions from its final regulations, as \n     recommended by the commenter.\n       This commenter also recommended that the Board exclude from \n     the final regulations sections 1910.263 (safety and health \n     standards relating ``to the design, installation, operation \n     and maintenance of machinery and equipment used in a \n     bakery''), and section 1910.264 (standards relating to \n     ``laundry machinery and operations''). Because the terms \n     ``bakery'' and ``laundry'' are not defined in the \n     regulations, it is not clear that these sections are \n     inapplicable to conditions or facilities within the \n     Legislative Branch. Accordingly, out of an abundance of \n     caution, the Board will retain sections 1910.263 and 1910.264 \n     in the final regulations.\n       Finally, for the reasons set forth in section I.B.2, supra, \n     the Board declines the commenter's suggestion that sections \n     1910.1020 (access to employee exposure and medical records) \n     and 1910.1200 (hazard communication) not be included within \n     the Board's final regulations because they may require \n     employing offices to make or maintain records to meet these \n     substantive health and safety standards.\n       2. Section 1.104 (Notice of protection).--Two commenters \n     argued that proposed section 1.104 should be deleted since \n     they fear that the section may be interpreted as a notice \n     posting or recordkeeping ``requirement.'' On the contrary, \n     section 1.104 merely provides that, consistent with section \n     301(h) of the CAA, the Office will make information regarding \n     the CAA available to employing offices in a manner suitable \n     for posting. This identical provision has been included in \n     prior regulations promulgated by the Board and approved by \n     Congress. See, e.g., Final Rules Under Section 204 of the \n     CAA, section 1.6, 141 Cong. Rec. at S265 (daily ed. Jan. 22, \n     1996).\n       3. Sections 1.102 (Definition of ``covered employee'') and \n     1.105 (Authority of the Board).--Two commenters took issue \n     with the Board's inclusion of proposed sections 1.102 \n     (defining ``covered employee'') and 1.105 (stating the \n     Board's authority to promulgate regulations under the CAA) \n     because they contend that such provisions are inconsistent \n     with the CAA and/or not needed. The Board is satisfied that \n     these sections are consistent with the CAA and will be \n     retained. As with proposed section 1.104, proposed sections \n     1.102\n\n[[Page S66]]\n\n     and 1.105 have been included in several prior regulations \n     promulgated by the Board and approved by Congress. See, e.g., \n     Final Rules regarding section 203 of the CAA, sections \n     501.102, 501.104, 141 Cong. Rec. at S226; Final Rules \n     regarding section 204 of the CAA, sections 1.2 and 1.7, 141 \n     Cong. Rec. at S264-65.\n       4. Section 1900.1 (Purpose and Scope).--Proposed section \n     1900.1 sets forth the purpose and scope of the Board's \n     adoption of the occupational safety and health standards of \n     Parts 1910 and 1926, 29 CFR. Subsection (b) makes clear that \n     only the substantive health and safety standards of Parts \n     1910 and 1926 are adopted by reference and that other \n     materials not relating to health and safety standards are not \n     adopted. One commenter requested further clarification \n     because, in the commenter's view, ``there is no indication of \n     what is `excluded' '' by the reference. On the contrary, \n     section 1900.1(b) gives an illustration of the types of \n     material not adopted by reference: rules that relate to laws \n     such as the Construction Safety Act, but have no relation to \n     the OSHAct; and statements or references to the duties and/or \n     authorities of the Assistant Secretary of Labor (since such \n     authorities are assigned by the CAA to the General Counsel). \n     In the Board's view, section 1900.1 adequately describes the \n     scope of its incorporation of standards under Parts 1910 and \n     1926.\n\n                 G. Technical and nomenclature changes\n\n       Two commenters have requested that the Board list the \n     technical and nomenclature changes that it has made to the \n     adopted regulations. Since the Board does not intend by \n     the changes to effect a substantive change in the meaning \n     of the adopted regulations, it is unclear what purpose, if \n     any, would be served by such a list. The regulations \n     adequately set forth the extent of such technical and \n     nomenclature changes. Proposed section 1900.2 states that, \n     except where inconsistent with the definitions, provisions \n     regarding scope, application and coverage, and exemptions \n     provided in the CAA or other sections of these \n     regulations, the definitions, provisions regarding scope, \n     application and coverage, and exemptions provided in Parts \n     1910 and 1926, 29 CFR, as incorporated into these \n     regulations, shall apply under these regulations. For \n     example, any reference to ``employer'' in Parts 1910 and \n     1926 shall be deemed to refer to ``employing office.'' The \n     commenter identified a number of other miscellaneous \n     statements in the NPR and the proposed rules therein that \n     it contends are vague and ambiguous or misleading, and/or \n     inconsistent with its reading of the CAA, for which the \n     commenter suggests technical corrections and \n     clarifications. The Board has considered all of these \n     suggestions and, as appropriate, has adopted them.\n\n                         II. Method of Approval\n\n       The Board received no comments on the method of approval \n     for these regulations. Therefore, the Board continues to \n     recommend that (1) the version of the proposed regulations \n     that shall apply to the Senate and employees of the Senate \n     should be approved by the Senate by resolution; (2) the \n     version of the proposed regulations that shall apply to the \n     House of Representatives and employees of the House of \n     Representatives should be approved by the House of \n     Representatives by resolution; and (3) the version of the \n     proposed regulations that shall apply to other covered \n     employees and employing offices should be approved by the \n     Congress by concurrent resolution.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C. on this 20th day of December, \n     1996.\n\n                                                Glen D. Nager,\n\n                                               Chair of the Board,\n                                             Office of Compliance.\n\n       Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance hereby adopts and submits for approval by the \n     Congress the following regulations:\n\n                          ADOPTED REGULATIONS\n\n Application of Rights and Protections of the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Act of 1970 (Section 215 of the Congressional Accountability Act \n                                of 1995)\n\n\nPART 1--MATTERS OF GENERAL APPLICABILITY TO ALL REGULATIONS PROMULGATED \n   UNDER SECTION 215 OF THE CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995\n\n     Sec.\n     1.101  Purpose and scope\n     1.102  Definitions\n     1.103  Coverage\n     1.104  Notice of protection\n     1.105  Authority of the Board\n     1.106  Method for identifying the entity responsible for \n         correction of violations of section 215\n     Sec. 1.101  Purpose and scope.\n       (a) Section 215 of the CAA. Enacted into law on January 23, \n     1995, the Congressional Accountability Act (``CAA'') directly \n     applies the rights and protections of eleven federal labor \n     and employment law and public access statutes to covered \n     employees and employing offices within the Legislative \n     Branch. Section 215(a) of the CAA provides that each \n     employing office and each covered employee shall comply with \n     the provisions of section 5 of the Occupational Safety and \n     Health Act of 1970 (``OSHAct''), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 654. Section \n     5(a) of the OSHAct provides that every covered employer has a \n     general duty to furnish each employee with employment and a \n     place of employment free from recognized hazards that are \n     causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm \n     to those employees, and a specific duty to comply with \n     occupational safety and health standards promulgated under \n     the law. Section 5(b) requires covered employees to comply \n     with occupational safety and health standards and with all \n     rules, regulations and orders which are applicable to \n     their actions and conduct. Set forth herein are the \n     substantive regulations that the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance has promulgated pursuant to section \n     215(d) of the CAA.\n       (b) Purpose and scope of regulations. The regulations set \n     forth herein (Parts 1 and 1900) are the substantive \n     regulations that the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance has promulgated pursuant to section 215(d) of the \n     CAA. Part 1 contains the general provisions applicable to all \n     regulations under section 215, including the method of \n     identifying entities responsible for correcting a violation \n     of section 215. Part 1900 contains the substantive safety and \n     health standards which the Board has adopted as substantive \n     regulations under section 215(e).\n     Sec. 1.102  Definitions.\n       Except as otherwise specifically provided in these \n     regulations, as used in these regulations:\n       (a) Act or CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995 (Pub.L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-\n     1438).\n       (b) OSHAct means the Williams-Steiger Occupational Safety \n     and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 651, et seq.), as \n     applied to covered employees and employing offices by Section \n     215 of the CAA.\n       (c) The term covered employee means any employee of (1) the \n     House of Representatives; (2) the Senate; (3) the Capitol \n     Guide Service; (4) the Capitol Police; (5) the Congressional \n     Budget Office; (6) the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol; (7) the Office of the Attending Physician; and (8) \n     the Office of Compliance.\n       (d) The term employee includes an applicant for employment \n     and a former employee.\n       (e) The term employee of the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol includes any employee of the Office of the Architect \n     of the Capitol, the Botanic Gardens, or the Senate \n     Restaurants.\n       (f) The term employee of the Capitol Police includes any \n     member or officer of the Capitol Police.\n       (g) The term employee of the House of Representatives \n     includes an individual occupying a position the pay for which \n     is disbursed by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, or \n     another official designated by the House of Representatives, \n     or any employment position in an entity that is paid with \n     funds derived from the clerk-hire allowance of the House of \n     Representatives but not any such individual employed by any \n     entity listed in subparagraphs (3) through (8) of paragraph \n     (c) above.\n       (h) The term employee of the Senate includes any employee \n     whose pay is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, but \n     not any such individual employed by any entity listed in \n     subparagraphs (3) through (8) of paragraph (c) above.\n       (i) The term employing office means: (1) the personal \n     office of a Member of the House of Representatives or the \n     Senate or a joint committee; (2) a committee of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate or a joint committee; (3) any \n     other office headed by a person with the final authority to \n     appoint, hire, discharge, and set the terms, conditions, or \n     privileges of the employment of an employee of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate; or (4) the Capitol Guide \n     Board, the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of the \n     Architect of the Capitol, the Office of the Attending \n     Physician, and the Office of Compliance.\n       (j) The term employing office includes any of the following \n     entities that is responsible for correction of a violation of \n     this section, irrespective of whether the entity has an \n     employment relationship with any covered employee in any \n     employing office in which such violation occurs: (1) each \n     office of the Senate, including each office of a Senator and \n     each committee; (2) each office of the House of \n     Representatives, including each office of a Member of the \n     House of Representatives and each committee; (3) each joint \n     committee of the Congress; (4) the Capitol Guide Service; (5) \n     the Capitol Police; (6) the Congressional Budget Office; (7) \n     the Office of the Architect of the Capitol (including the \n     Senate Restaurants and the Botanic Garden); (8) the Office of \n     the Attending Physician; and (9) the Office of Compliance.\n       (k) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (l) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n       (m) General Counsel means the General Counsel of the Office \n     of Compliance.\n     Sec. 1.103  Coverage.\n       The coverage of Section 215 of the CAA extends to any \n     ``covered employee.'' It also extends to any ``covered \n     employing office,'' which includes any of the following \n     entities that is responsible for correcting a violation of \n     section 215 (as determined under section 1.106), irrespective \n     of whether the entity has an employment relationship with any \n     covered employee in any employing office in which such a \n     violation occurs:\n       (1) each office of the Senate, including each office of a \n     Senator and each committee;\n       (2) each office of the House of Representatives, including \n     each office of a Member of the House of Representatives and \n     each committee;\n       (3) each joint committee of the Congress;\n       (4) the Capitol Guide Service;\n       (5) the Capitol Police;\n       (6) the Congressional Budget Office;\n       (7) the Office of the Architect of the Capitol (including \n     the Senate Restaurants and the Botanic Garden);\n\n[[Page S67]]\n\n       (8) the Office of the Attending Physician; and\n       (9) the Office of Compliance.\n     Sec. 1.104  Notice of protection.\n       Pursuant to section 301(h) of the CAA, the Office shall \n     prepare, in a manner suitable for posting, a notice \n     explaining the provisions of section 215 of the CAA. Copies \n     of such notice may be obtained from the Office of Compliance.\n     Sec. 1.105  Authority of the Board.\n       Pursuant to section 215 and 304 of the CAA, the Board is \n     authorized to issue regulations to implement the rights and \n     protections of section 215(a). Section 215(d) of the CAA \n     directs the Board to promulgate regulations implementing \n     section 215 that are ``the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) except to \n     the extent that the Board may determine, for good cause shown \n     and stated together with the regulation, that a modification \n     of such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec.  1341(d). The regulations issued by \n     the Board herein are on all matters for which section 215 of \n     the CAA requires a regulation to be issued. Specifically, it \n     is the Board's considered judgment, based on the information \n     available to it at the time of promulgation of these \n     regulations, that, with the exception of the regulations \n     adopted and set forth herein, there are no other \n     ``substantive regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Labor to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     subsection (a) [of section 215 of the CAA]'' that need be \n     adopted.\n       In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to \n     make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to \n     situations in the Legislative Branch. However, by making \n     these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     difference between these regulations and those of the \n     Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover, such \n     changes, in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute \n     an interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n     Sec. 1.106  Method for identifying the entity responsible for \n         correction of violations of section 215.\n       (a) Purpose and scope. Section 215(d)(3) of the CAA \n     provides that regulations under section 215(d) include a \n     method of identifying, for purposes of this section and for \n     categories of violations of section 215(a), the employing \n     office responsible for correcting a particular violation. \n     This section sets forth the method for identifying \n     responsible employing offices for the purpose of allocating \n     responsibility for correcting violations of section 215(a) of \n     the CAA. These rules apply to the General Counsel in the \n     exercise of his authority to issue citations or notices to \n     employing offices under sections 215(c)(2)(A) and (B), and to \n     the Office and the Board in the adjudication of complaints \n     under section 215(c)(3).\n       (b) Employing Office(s) Responsible for Correcting a \n     Violation of Section 215(a) of the CAA. With respect to the \n     safety and health standards and other obligations imposed \n     upon employing offices under section 215(a) of the CAA, \n     correction of a violation of section 215(a) is the \n     responsibility of any employing office that is an exposing \n     employing office, a creating employing office, a controlling \n     employing office, and/or a correcting employing office, as \n     defined in this subsection, to the extent that the employing \n     office is in a position to correct or abate the hazard or to \n     ensure its correction or abatement.\n       (i) Creating employing office means the employing office \n     that actually created the hazard forming the basis of the \n     violation or violations of section 215(a).\n       (ii) Exposing employing office means the employing office \n     whose employees are exposed to the hazard forming the basis \n     of the violation or violations of section 215(a).\n       (iii) Controlling employing office means the employing \n     office that is responsible, by agreement or legal authority \n     or through actual practice, for safety and health conditions \n     in the location where the hazard forming the basis for the \n     violation or violations of section 215(a) occurred.\n       (iv) Correcting employing office means the employing office \n     that has the responsibility for actually performing (or the \n     authority or power to order or arrange for) the work \n     necessary to correct or abate the hazard forming the basis of \n     the violation or violations of section 215(a).\n       (c) Exposing Employing Office Duties. Employing offices \n     have direct responsibility for the safety and health of their \n     own employees and are required to instruct them about the \n     hazards that might be encountered, including what protective \n     measures to use. An employing office may not contract away \n     these legal duties to its employees or its ultimate \n     responsibilities under section 215(a) of the CAA by requiring \n     another party or entity to perform them. In addition, if \n     equipment  or facilities to be used by an employing office, \n     but not under the control of the employing office, do not \n     meet applicable health and safety standards or otherwise \n     constitutes a violation of section 215(a), it is the \n     responsibility of the employing office not to permit its \n     employees to utilize such equipment or facilities. In such \n     circumstances, an employing office that did not create or \n     control a violation may avoid liability if, and only if, \n     it proves either that it took reasonable alternative \n     measures to protect its employees against the hazard or \n     that it lacked sufficient expertise to recognize that the \n     equipment or facilities did not meet applicable health and \n     safety standards or otherwise constituted a violation of \n     section 215(a). It is not the responsibility of an \n     employing office to effect the correction of any such \n     deficiencies itself, but this does not relieve it of its \n     duty to use only equipment or facilities that meet the \n     requirements of section 215(a).\n\n    PART 1900--ADOPTION OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS\n\n     Sec.\n     1900.1  Purpose and scope\n     1900.2  Definitions; provisions regarding scope, \n         applicability, and coverage; and exemptions\n     1900.3  Adoption of occupational safety and health standards\n     Sec. 1900.1  Purpose and scope.\n       (a) The provisions of this subpart B adopt and extend the \n     applicability of occupational safety and health standards \n     established and promulgated by the Occupational Safety and \n     Health Administration (``OSHA'') and set forth at Parts 1910 \n     and 1926 of title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, with \n     respect to every employing office, employee, and employment \n     covered by section 215 of the Congressional Accountability \n     Act.\n       (b) It bears emphasis that only standards (i.e., \n     substantive rules) relating to safety or health are adopted \n     by any incorporations by reference of standards prescribed in \n     this Part. Other materials contained in the referenced parts \n     are not adopted. Illustrations of the types of materials \n     which are not adopted are these. The incorporation by \n     reference of part 1926, 29 CFR, is not intended to include \n     references to interpretative rules having relevance to the \n     application of the Construction Safety Act, but having no \n     relevance to the Occupational Safety and Health Act. \n     Similarly, the incorporation by reference of part 1910, 29 \n     CFR, is not intended to include any reference to the \n     Assistant Secretary of Labor and the authorities of the \n     Assistant Secretary. The authority to adopt, promulgate, and \n     amend or revoke standards applicable to covered employment \n     under the CAA rests with the Board of Directors of the Office \n     of Compliance pursuant to sections 215(d) and 304 of the CAA. \n     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the \n     incorporated standards, the exclusive means for enforcement \n     of these standards with respect to covered employment are the \n     procedures and remedies provided for in section 215 of the \n     CAA.\n       (c) This part incorporates the referenced safety and health \n     standards in effect as of the effective date of these \n     regulations.\n     Sec. 1900.2  Definitions, provisions regarding scope, \n         applicability and coverage, and exemptions.\n       (a) Except where inconsistent with the definitions, \n     provisions regarding scope, application and coverage, and \n     exemptions provided in the CAA or other sections of these \n     regulations, the definitions, provisions regarding scope, \n     application and coverage, and exemptions provided in Parts \n     1910 and 1926, 29 CFR, as incorporated into these \n     regulations, shall apply under these regulations. For \n     example, any reference to ``employer'' in Parts 1910 and 1926 \n     shall be deemed to refer to ``employing office.'' Similarly, \n     any limitation on coverage in Parts 1910 and 1926 to \n     employers engaged ``in a business that affects commerce'' \n     shall not apply in these regulations.\n       (b) The provisions of section 1910.6, 29 CFR, regarding the \n     force and effect of standards of agencies of the U.S. \n     Government and organizations that are not agencies of the \n     U.S. Government, which are incorporated by reference in Part \n     1910, shall apply to the standards incorporated into these \n     regulations.\n       (c) It is the Board's intent that the standards adopted in \n     these regulations shall have the same force and effect as \n     applied to covered employing offices and employees under \n     section 215 of the CAA as those standards have when applied \n     by OSHA to employers, employees, and places of employment \n     under the jurisdiction of OSHA and the OSHAct.\n     Sec. 1900.3  Adoption of occupational safety and health \n         standards.\n       (a) Part 1910 Standards. The standards prescribed in 29 CFR \n     part 1910, Subparts B  through S, and Subpart Z, as \n     specifically referenced and set forth herein at Appendix \n     A, are adopted as occupational safety and health standards \n     under Section 215(d) of the CAA and shall apply, according \n     to the provisions thereof, to every employment and place \n     of employment of every covered employee engaged in work in \n     an employing office. Each employing office shall protect \n     the employment and places of employment of each of its \n     covered employees by complying with the appropriate \n     standards described in this paragraph.\n       (b) Part 1926 Standards. The standards prescribed in 29 CFR \n     part 1926, Subparts C through X and Subpart Z, as \n     specifically referenced and forth herein at Appendix B, are \n     adopted as occupational safety and health standards under \n     Section 215(d) of the CAA and shall apply, according to the \n     provisions thereof, to every employment and place of \n     employment of every covered employee engaged in work in an \n     employing office. Each employing office shall protect the \n     employment and places of employment of each of its covered \n     employees by complying with the\n\n[[Page S68]]\n\n     appropriate standards described in this paragraph.\n       (c) Standards not adopted. This section adopts as \n     occupational safety and health standards under section 215(d) \n     of the CAA the standards which are prescribed in Parts 1910 \n     and 1926 of 29 CFR. Thus, the standards (substantive rules) \n     published in subparts B through S and Z of part 1910 and \n     subparts C through X and Z of part 1926 are applied. As set \n     forth in Appendix A and Appendix B to this Part, this section \n     does not incorporate all sections contained in these \n     subparts.

  \n\n[Pages S70-S81]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE REPORT TO CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, pursuant to section 102(b) of the \nCongressional Accountability Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. sec. 1302(b)), the \nBoard of Directors of the Office of Compliance has submitted a report \nto Congress. This document is titled a ``Review and Report of the \nApplicability to the Legislative Branch of Federal Law Relating to \nTerms and Conditions of Employment and Access to Public Services and \nAccommodations.''\n  Section 102(b) requires this report to be printed in the \nCongressional Record, and referred to committees with jurisdiction. \nTherefore I ask unanimous consent that the report be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  Review and Report of the Applicability to the Legislative Branch of \n Federal Law Relating to Terms and Conditions of Employment and Access \n                 to Public Services and Accommodations\n\n    [Prepared by the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance \n Pursuant to Section 102(b) of the Congressional Accountability Act of \n                    1995 (PL 104-1), Dec. 31, 1996]\n\n\n                         section 102 (b) Report\n\n       Section 102(a) of the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA) lists the eleven laws that ``shall apply, as prescribed \n     by this Act, to the legislative branch of the Federal \n     Government.'' Section 102(b) directs the Board of Directors \n     (Board) of the Office of Compliance to: ``review provisions \n     of Federal law (including regulations) relating to (A) the \n     terms and conditions of employment (including hiring, \n     promotion, demotion, termination, salary, wages, overtime \n     compensation, benefits, work assignments or reassignments, \n     grievance and disciplinary procedures, protection from \n     discrimination in personnel actions, occupational health and \n     safety, and family and medical and other leave) of employees, \n     and (B) access to public services and accommodations.''\n       And, on the basis of this review, ``[b]eginning on December \n     31, 1996, and every 2 years thereafter, the Board shall \n     report on (A) whether or to what degree the provisions \n     described in paragraph (1) are applicable or inapplicable to \n     the legislative branch, and (B) with respect to provisions \n     inapplicable to the legislative branch, whether such \n     provisions should be made applicable to the legislative \n     branch.''\n       In preparing this report, the Board has reviewed the entire \n     United States Code to identify those laws and associated \n     regulations of general application that relate to terms and \n     conditions of employment or access to public accommodations \n     and services. In other words, the Board has reviewed those \n     provisions of law that confer employment rights or benefits \n     on or affect workplace conditions of employees, and that \n     create a corresponding mandate for employers, or that relate \n     to access to public services or accommodations. The Board \n     excluded from consideration those laws that, although \n     employment-related, (1) are specific to narrow or specialized \n     industries or types of employment not found in the \n     legislative branch (e.g., employment in maritime or mining \n     industries, or the armed forces, or employment in a project \n     funded by federal grants or contracts); or (2) establish \n     government programs of research, data-collection, advocacy, \n     or training, but do not establish correlative rights and \n     responsibilities for employees and employers (e.g., statutes \n     authorizing the Women's Bureau of Labor Statistics); or (3) \n     authorize, but do not require, that employers provide \n     benefits to employees, (e.g., so-called ``cafeteria plans'' \n     authorized by 26 U.S.C. 125).\n       For ease of reference, the results of this research are \n     presented in four tables, each of which contains a matrix of \n     analysis consisting of four parts. The first column of each \n     table lists the name or a short description of the law; the \n     second gives the United States Code citation and any relevant \n     Code of Federal Regulations citation; the third summarizes \n     the provision of law to illustrate the extent to which it \n     relates to terms and conditions of employment or access to \n     public services or accommodations; and, the fourth analyzes \n     the extent of the provision's application in the legislative \n     branch. Because many statutes are either silent or ambiguous \n     in their definition of coverage, and because the issue is \n     only infrequently litigated, it is often difficult to \n     determine definitively\n\n[[Page S71]]\n\n     whether a statute is applicable to the legislative branch. \n     The Board has generally followed the principle that coverage \n     must be clearly and unambiguously stated.\n       Table A lists and reviews those provisions of law relating \n     to terms and conditions of employment or access to public \n     accommodations and services that are generally applicable in \n     the private sector and/or in state and local government, and \n     that are already applicable to entities in the legislative \n     branch of the federal government. This table includes nine of \n     the statutes made applicable to the legislative branch by the \n     CAA.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ The nine CAA statutes treated in Table A are: the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), Title \n     VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et \n     seq.), the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \n     12101 et seq.), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 (29 U.S.C. 621 et seq.), the Family and Medical Leave \n     Act of 1993 (29 U.S.C. 2611 et seq.), the Occupational Safety \n     and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.), the \n     Employment Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 (29 U.S.C. 2001 \n     et seq.), the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification \n     Act (29 U.S.C. 2101 et seq.), and Chapter 43 (relating to \n     uniformed services employment and reemployment) of title 38, \n     United States Code. (See Table B for the two CAA statutes \n     applicable only in the federal public sector.)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Table B lists and reviews those provisions of law that \n     apply only in the federal public sector, and have no \n     application in the private sector or in state or local \n     governments. Table B includes the two exclusively federal \n     factor laws applied to the legislative branch by the CAA.\\2\\ \n     Also listed in this table are the civil service laws in title \n     5 of the United States Code, the employment-related laws \n     applicable to Congress and the President, and a variety of \n     other employment-related laws applicable only in the federal \n     public sector.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ The two statutes made applicable to the legislative \n     branch by the CAA are: Chapter 71 (relating to federal \n     service labor-management relations) of title 5, United States \n     Code, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 701 et \n     seq.).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Table C lists and reviews five private sector and/or state \n     and local government provisions of law that do not apply in \n     the legislative branch. The five provisions of law listed in \n     this table are: the Government Employees Rights Act of 1991, \n     a provision of the Immigration Reform Control Act, the \n     National Labor Relations Act, the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act, and provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus \n     Budget Reconciliation Act of 1998 (COBRA). In the fourth \n     column of this table, the Board identifies other provisions \n     of law, currently applicable in the legislative branch, that \n     confer similar or related rights and protections to those \n     provided by the five private sector provisions of law. Those \n     provisions that, in the Board's view, create corresponding \n     rights and protections for the legislative branch are: the \n     anti-discrimination provisions of the Congressional \n     Accountability Act, Legislative Branch Appropriations Acts, \n     the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute \n     provisions, as applied by the Congressional Accountability \n     Act, the Federal Employees Retirement System provisions, and \n     the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, respectively.\n       Table D contains the Board's review of thirteen other \n     private sector and/or state and local government provisions \n     of law that do not apply or have very limited application to \n     entities in the legislative branch. The first entry in the \n     table discusses a provision in the Immigration Reform and \n     Control Act, which forbids discrimination by employers on the \n     basis of national origin or citizenship status. Entry two \n     prohibits employment discrimination based on the fact that an \n     employee has declared personal bankruptcy. Entry three \n     prohibits an employer from firing an employee because that \n     employee's wages have been subject to garnishment. The fourth \n     provision in Table D prohibits an employer from discharging \n     an employee because that employee was called to serve on a \n     jury. The next two entries, title II and III of the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964, prohibit discrimination on the basis of \n     race, color, religion, or national origin in the provision of \n     public accommodations and services. The final two entries \n     review the employee protection provisions contained in seven \n     environmental protection statutes.\n       Having completed the review and analysis summarized in the \n     tables, the Board next considered the basis on which to \n     decide whether those statutes that were currently \n     inapplicable to the legislative branch ``should'' be applied \n     to the legislative branch. The statutory mandate of Section \n     102(b) could be interpreted to require the Board to report on \n     whether all the provisions analyzed in the tables should or \n     should not now be made fully applicable to all entities \n     within the legislative branch. The Board did not do so \n     because, as even a cursory review of those tables \n     demonstrates, that task is the work of many hands and many \n     years. Moreover, section 102(b)(2), in mandating that the \n     Board report biennially, argues for accomplishing such \n     statutory change on an incremental basis through an ongoing \n     reporting process. Accordingly, the Board has decided to \n     focus this, its first report, on the statutes in Table D, for \n     which there is currently no coverage in the legislative \n     branch, and to defer consideration of those provisions of \n     private and public sector laws in tables A, B, and C, not \n     currently fully applicable to the legislative branch, for \n     discussion in future reports.\n       The Board's rationale for setting these priorities in its \n     first biennial report derives from its reading of the CAA and \n     from prudential institutional concerns. Because the statute \n     does not give direct guidance, the Board set its priorities \n     from the priorities found in the CAA. The CAA focuses almost \n     entirely on private sector law, applying to the legislative \n     branch only two exclusively federal public sector provisions \n     of law. This reading of the legislative priorities \n     established in the CAA is supported by the statement of \n     Senator Grassley, one of the bill's sponsors, who called for \n     an end to the situation in which ``[t]here is one set of \n     protections for people in the private sector whose employees \n     are protected by the employment, safety and civil rights \n     laws, but no protection, or very little protection for \n     employees on Capitol Hill.'' \\3\\ The Board has determined \n     likewise to focus attention in its first biennial report on \n     private sector law. Further, the Board made its first \n     priority the cases where, as Senator Grassley put it, there \n     is currently ``no protection, or very little protection'' in \n     the legislative branch. Accordingly, the Board focused on \n     reporting on private sector laws found in Table D that \n     currently have no or very limited application to entities in \n     the legislative branch.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\3\\ 141 Cong. Rec. S622 (daily ed. Jan. 9, 1995).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Board next considered how to treat the statutes in the \n     other tables. Because the CAA itself was concerned almost \n     exclusively with the application of private sector law to the \n     legislative branch, the Board gave the federal sector \n     statutes found in Table B a low priority. Further, \n     determining which currently inapplicable provisions of \n     federal civil service law could and ``should'' be applied to \n     the legislative branch and, if so, to which entities, is \n     difficult. Table B indicates how disparate the application of \n     federal sector laws currently is in the legislative branch \n     and the difficulty in finding a rational organizing \n     principle. Some of the statutes or provisions of statutes \n     already apply to some entities within the legislative branch, \n     but not to others; while a number do not have any application \n     to any entity within the legislative branch. Moreover, the \n     executive branch and the Congress are presently in the \n     process of reexamining the application of federal civil \n     service law in some parts of the executive branch. While such \n     review is underway, the Board has determined that it would be \n     premature to consider applying to the Congress the very \n     provisions at issue. Additionally, such determinations \n     involve, in part, weighing the merits of the protections \n     afforded by CAA against those provided under other statutory \n     schemes. But in this, its first year of administering the \n     CAA, it would be premature for the Board to make such \n     comparative judgments. Therefore, in light of the priorities \n     established by the CAA and the prematurity of review at this \n     time, the Board decided to defer reporting on the statutes \n     listed in Table B for future reports.\n       Likewise, prudential concerns led the Board to defer \n     consideration of the statutes found in Table C. Although \n     Table C comprises a universe of statutes that are currently \n     inapplicable to entities in the legislative branch, the \n     Congress has already applied comparable provisions to \n     legislative branch entities. As the Board gains rulemaking \n     and adjudicatory experience in the application of the CAA to \n     the legislative branch, the Board will be better situated to \n     formulate recommendations about appropriate changes in those \n     different statutory schemes. Thus, the Board has determined \n     to defer consideration of the laws in table C in this first \n     report.\n       Table A, as noted above, comprises the universe of private \n     sector law and/or state and local government law that \n     Congress has, with only limited exception, already applied to \n     the legislative branch, including nine of the laws made \n     applicable by the CAA. Because of the obvious importance of \n     these laws to the CAA, the Board intends to undertake a more \n     in depth study of the specific exceptions created by \n     Congress, with the goal of issuing an interim report prior to \n     December 31, 1998 with regard to whether and to what degree \n     the provisions excepted from the laws set forth in Table A \n     should be made applicable to the legislative branch.\n       Turning now to those statutes in Table D that currently do \n     not apply to the legislative branch, the Board reports below \n     on whether those provisions should or should not be applied \n     to the legislative branch. Because a major goal of the CAA \n     was to achieve parity with the private sector, the Board has \n     determined that, if our review reveals no impediment to \n     applying the provision in question to the legislative branch, \n     it should be made applicable.\n     Prohibition against discrimination based on national origin \n         or citizenship status (8 U.S.C. 1324b)\n       Section 1324b of the Immigration Reform and Control Act \n     (IRCA) prohibits employment discrimination by employers of \n     three or more employees against a person because of national \n     origin or citizenship status. This section of IRCA, on its \n     face, does not appear to apply to entities in the legislative \n     branch. The national origin discrimination provisions of \n     IRCA, by their terms, do not apply to any employer that is \n     covered by Title VII. 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(2)(B). The CAA \n     already applies the rights and protections of Title VII to \n     legislative branch employment and therefore, IRCA's national \n     origin discrimination provisions would not apply, even if \n     IRCA was generally extended to the legislative branch.\n       While IRCA prohibits citizenship status discrimination \n     generally, it permits such discrimination to the extent such \n     discrimination is required by federal, state, or local\n\n[[Page S72]]\n\n     law, regulation, or executive order. 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(2)(C). \n     Thus, IRCA gives governments an ``override'' power with \n     respect to their own hiring practices, and in establishing \n     employment in a government contract with private employers, \n     to require American citizenship as a condition of employment. \n     IRCA, if applied to the legislative branch, would likewise \n     allow legislative branch entities, by law or regulation, to \n     require American citizenship as a condition of employment in \n     any covered facility. The legislative branch has, in the \n     context of appropriations bills, imposed citizenship \n     restrictions on federal government hiring. See, e.g., Pub. L. \n     No. 104-52, title VI, Sec. 606, 109 Stat. 497 (Nov. 19, 1995) \n     (except as otherwise provided, no part of any appropriation \n     contained in this or any other act shall be used to pay the \n     compensation of any officer or employee of the Government of \n     the U.S. whose post of duty is the continental U.S. unless \n     such person is a U.S. citizen or intended citizen or meets \n     other specified requirements). Therefore, application of this \n     section of IRCA would be without significant effect.\n     Prohibition against discrimination on the basis of bankruptcy \n         (11 U.S.C. 525)\n       Section 525(a) provides that ``a government unit'' may not \n     deny employment to, terminate the employment of, or \n     discriminate with respect to employment against, a person \n     that is or has been a debtor under the bankruptcy statutes. \n     This provision currently does not apply to the legislative \n     branch. For the reason stated above, the Board reports that \n     the rights and protections against discrimination on this \n     basis should be applied to employing offices within the \n     legislative branch.\n     Prohibition against discharge from employment by reason of \n         garnishment (15 U.S.C. 1674(a))\n       Section 1674(a) prohibits discharge of any employee because \n     his or her earnings ``have been subject to garnishment for \n     any one indebtedness.'' This section is limited to private \n     employers, so it currently has no application to the \n     legislative branch. For the reason set forth above, the Board \n     has determined that the rights and protections against \n     discrimination on this basis should be applied to employing \n     offices within the legislative branch.\n     Prohibition against discrimination on the basis of jury duty \n         (28 U.S.C. 1875)\n       Section 1875 provides that no employer shall discharge, \n     threaten to discharge, intimidate, or coerce any permanent \n     employee by reason of such employee's jury service, or the \n     attendance or scheduled attendance in connection with such \n     service, in any court of the United States. This section \n     currently does not cover legislative branch employment. For \n     the reason set forth above, the Board has determined that the \n     rights and protections against discrimination on this basis \n     should be applied to employing offices within the legislative \n     branch.\n     Titles II and III of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \n         2000a to 2000a-6, 2000b to 2000b-3)\n       These titles prohibit discrimination or segregation on the \n     basis of race, color, religion, or national origin regarding \n     the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and \n     accommodations of ``any place of public accommodation'' as \n     defined in the Act. Although the CAA incorporated the \n     protections of titles II and III of the ADA, which prohibit \n     discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to \n     access to public services and accommodations, it does not \n     extend protection based upon race, color, religion, or \n     national origin. Since those protections of titles II and III \n     of the Civil Rights Act do not currently apply to entities in \n     the legislative branch, the Board has determined that the \n     rights and protections afforded by titles II and III of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 against discrimination with respect \n     to places of public accommodation should be applied to \n     employing offices within the legislative branch.\n     Employee protection provisions in the environmental \n         protection statutes (15 U.S.C. 2622; 33 U.S.C. 1367; 42 \n         U.S.C. 300j-9(i), 5851, 6971, 7622, 9610)\n       These provisions generally protect an employee from \n     discrimination in employment because the employee has \n     commenced, or caused to be commenced, proceedings under the \n     applicable statutes, has testified or is about to testify in \n     any such proceedings, or has participated or is about to \n     participate in any way in such proceedings. It is unclear to \n     what extent, if any, these provisions apply to entities in \n     the legislative branch. Furthermore, even if applicable or \n     partially applicable, it is unclear whether and to what \n     extent the legislative branch has the type of employees and \n     employing offices that would be subject to these provisions. \n     Consequently, the Board reserves judgment on whether or not \n     these provisions should be made applicable to the legislative \n     branch at this time.\n       Thus, pursuant to section 102(b), the Board submits this \n     review and report, concluding that the following provisions \n     of law, summarized in Table D, should be applied to the \n     legislative branch: 11 U.S.C. 525 (bankruptcy); 15 U.S.C. \n     1675(a) (garnishment); 28 U.S.C. 1875 (jury duty); and titles \n     II and III of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a \n     to 2000a-6, 2000b to 2000b-3) (public accommodations and \n     services).\n       (The analysis and conclusions in this review and report are \n     being made solely for the purposes set forth in section \n     102(b) of the Congressional Accountability Act. Nothing in \n     this review and report is intended or should be construed as \n     a definitive interpretation of any factual or legal question \n     by the Office of Compliance or its Board of Directors.)\n       (The Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance \n     gratefully acknowledges the contributions of Lawrence B. \n     Novey and Nicola O.

The Lobbying Disclosure Act of \n1995 amended the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 regarding the \nappointment of the United States Trade Representative and the Deputy \nUnited States Trade Representatives by imposing certain limitations on \ntheir appointment. These limitations only became effective with respect \nto the appointment of the United States Trade Representative and Deputy \nUnited States Trade Representatives on January 1, 1996, and do not \napply to individuals who were serving in one of those positions on that \ndate and continue to serve in them. Because Charlene Barshefsky was \nappointed Deputy United States Trade Representative on May 28, 1993, \nand has continued to serve in that position since then, the limitations \nin the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which became effective on January 1, \n1996, do not apply to her in her capacity as Deputy United States Trade \nRepresentative and it is appropriate that they not apply to her if she \nis appointed to be the United States Trade Representative.\n  I have today nominated Charlene Barshefsky to be the next United \nStates Trade Representative. She has done an outstanding job as Deputy \nUnited States Trade Representative since 1993 and as Acting United \nStates Trade Representative for the last 9 months. I am confident she \nwill make an excellent United States Trade Representative. I urge the \nCongress to take prompt and favorable action on this legislation.\n                                                    William J.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of California; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n[[Page S98]]\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 45\n\n       Whereas, Alameda has a long history associated with the \n     U.S. Navy and Naval Air Forces, and Alameda was shaped by the \n     birth of aviation technology and is proudly and inextricably \n     linked to the military's presence; and\n       Whereas, The acquisition of the aircraft carrier Hornet \n     (CV-12) would preserve a vital part of the U.S. military \n     history and its establishment as a museum would be a fitting \n     memorial to Alameda's contributions to U.S. efforts in World \n     War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War; and\n       Whereas, In the 18 months of combat during World War II, \n     the aircraft and gunners of the U.S.S. Hornet (CV-12) \n     destroyed 1,410, enemy planes, sank 73 ships, and damaged \n     more than 400 vessels, including the first hits on the \n     Japanese battleship Yamato, which was sunk on April 7, 1945, \n     as it steamed toward Okinawa; and\n       Whereas, The U.S.S. Hornet (CV-12), a 53-year old Essex \n     Class carrier is one of eight warships that bore that name, \n     but it was the most decorated of them all, earning a \n     presidential unit citation and seven battle stars in action \n     during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War; and\n       Whereas, The first U.S. Navy aircraft carrier named \n     ``Hornet'' was CV-8 (Yorktown Class, including: Enterprise/\n     CV-6 and Yorkton/CV-5) laid down in September 1939 by the \n     Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Company. It was launched \n     on December 14, 1940, and commissioned on October 20, 1941; \n     it displaced 20,000 tons, measured 761 feet long, and had a \n     complement of 2,200 personnel; and\n       Whereas, The Hornet (CV-8) was designed with the benefit of \n     real operating experience, sharing the basic design \n     principles of a large, open hangar deck topped by a thin, \n     rectangular wood and steel flight deck; and\n       Whereas, On April 2, 1942, the U.S.S. Hornet (CV-8) having \n     just completed its workups, left Alameda with an unusual \n     deckload of 16 Army Air Corps B-25 Mitchell bombers commanded \n     by Lt. Colonel James ``Jimmy'' Doolittle, sailing to join a \n     task force with Enterprise (CV-6) targeting the Japanese \n     Cities of Tokyo, Nagoya, Yokohama, and Kobe; and\n       Whereas, On April 18, 1942, still some miles to the east of \n     the intended launch point, the ships of the task force were \n     sighted by Japanese picket boats. Faced with the decision \n     whether to abort the mission, push on to the planned launch \n     point against an alerted enemy, or launch immediately with \n     full knowledge that the B-25s lacked the range to reach their \n     intended landing fields in China, ``Doolittle's Raiders'' \n     launched immediately, and struck the first successful attack \n     upon the homeland of Japan; and\n       Whereas, The Hornet (CV-8) was further involved during \n     World War II in the Central and South Pacific carrying out \n     operations in the Battle of Midway, June 4-6, 1942, and the \n     Battle of Santa Cruz Islands, where it received six Japanese \n     bomb hits, two torpedo hits, and two hits by suicide \n     aircraft, and sank on October 27, 1942; and\n       Whereas, The second U.S. Navy aircraft carrier named \n     ``Hornet'' was CV-12 (modernized Essex Class, including 19 \n     ships), constructed by the Newport News Shipbuilding & \n     Drydock Company, and launched August 29, 1943. The Hornet \n     (CV-12) was commissioned November 29, 1943, it displaced \n     38,500 tons, measured 889 feet long, carried 45 aircraft, and \n     had a complement of 2,400 personnel; and\n       Whereas, In June, 1945, a typhoon ripped a 24-foot gash in \n     the forward section of the flight deck, but the Hornet (CV-\n     12) was simply turned around and the aircraft were launched \n     off the stern; and\n       Whereas, Postwar modernization of the Hornet (CV-12) under \n     the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization program allowed it \n     to be refitted with improved elevators, a reinforced flight \n     deck, increased aviation fuel storage, and other features for \n     operating jet aircraft including modernization of its \n     aircraft arresting system. These refittings increased the \n     Hornet's ability to operate advanced aircraft and to improve \n     antisubmarine capabilities; and\n       Whereas, The aircraft carrier Hornet (CV-12) contributed to \n     U.S. efforts in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam \n     War, and served as the command ship for recovery of the \n     Apollo XI and XII reentry vehicles; and\n       Whereas, The aircraft carrier Hornet (CV-12) was \n     decommissioned on June 26, 1970, and is in good structural \n     condition, and will soon be considered for sale as military \n     surplus; and\n       Whereas, The McDonald Douglas F/A 18 Hornet multiple-role \n     air superiority/ground attack aircraft that has become the \n     fleet's principal carrier-based fixed wing aircraft, was \n     named in honor of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Hornet; and\n       Whereas, In 1995, the weathered-gray warship was scheduled \n     for demolition despite its 1991 designation as a National \n     Historic Landmark; and\n       Whereas, The decision to demolish the ship outraged former \n     crew members, who recruited approximately 100 volunteers and \n     embarked on a campaign to save the ship; and\n       Whereas, The Aircraft Carrier Hornet Museum is proposed to \n     be permanently berthed in Alameda at Pier No. 2 and to be \n     secured by eight 2-inch chains to existing chain pads welded \n     on the shell, and would immeasurably enhance the maritime \n     ambience of the regional shipyards, the Port of Oakland, and \n     the Alameda Naval Air Station; and\n       Whereas, The Aircraft Carrier Hornet Foundation (ACHF) has \n     arranged to acquire four 110-foot long by 34-foot wide YCs \n     for mooring (that are certified as suitable for use \n     associated with nuclear submarines) from Mare Island Naval \n     Shipyard. This arrangement will provide a 440-foot long \n     parallel load distribution plane from the hull to the fenders \n     of the pier; and\n       Whereas, Use of this system of chain attachment to the pier \n     bollards in conjunction with the four YCs will provide an \n     arrangement of positive mechanical attachment sufficient to \n     secure the ship and withstand 100-year weather requirements; \n     and\n       Whereas, The carrier museum would be an attraction to both \n     domestic and foreign tourists, thereby enhancing the global \n     competitive position of the San Francisco Bay area; and\n       Whereas, According to the Historic Naval Ships Association, \n     a 1994-95 survey shows attendance to similar historic U.S. \n     naval ship museums as follows: battleship Texas (BB-35)--\n     300,000; battleship Arizona (BB-39)--1.5 million; battleship \n     North Carolina (BB-55)--225,000; battleship Massachusetts \n     (BB-59)--140,000; battleship Alabama (BB-60)--245,000; \n     aircraft carrier Intrepid (CV-11)--410,000; aircraft carrier \n     Lexington (CV-16)--340,000; submarine Bowfin (SS-287)--\n     195,000; submarine Pampanito (SS-383)--250,000; 3-masted \n     frigate Constitution--420,000; and\n       Whereas, The added attraction of a carrier museum would \n     result in longer tourist stays, with consequent increases in \n     retail sales, hotel and motel occupancy, and restaurant \n     patronage, resulting in higher sales and transient occupancy \n     tax revenues; and\n       Whereas, Estimates indicate that establishment of the \n     proposed museum and cultural center would employ up to 150 \n     people within three years, and would annually infuse between \n     12 and 22 million dollars into the local economy; and\n       Whereas, A carrier museum could be used as an ongoing \n     exposition to showcase Alameda's leadership in aerospace and \n     defense technology, to develop educational programs for \n     schoolaged children, and to provide entertainment attractions \n     based on naval aviation history; and\n       Whereas, The presence of a military museum in Alameda would \n     promote positive community relations between the citizens and \n     the military; and\n       Whereas, Support for legislation pending before the 104th \n     Session of the U.S. Congress entitled ``The World War II \n     Education and Research Act'' would authorize that at least \n     one site per state be officially designated a National World \n     War II Education and Research Center; and\n       Whereas, The purposes of this Congressional Act are to \n     enable industry, universities, research facilities, \n     presidential libraries, museums, and public and private \n     sector organizations to make available to the public all \n     relevant information on the collective war effort involving \n     the military, industrial, and civilian sectors; and\n       Whereas, The Aircraft Carrier Hornet Foundation intends to \n     raise sufficient resources from various possible sources \n     (donations, pledges, venture capital, and revenue bonds) to \n     pay for all relevant startup costs and to develop a long-\n     range master plan to do all of the following: (1) include a \n     1940-60's museum in hangar bays 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis \n     on Pacific theater battles including airplanes and artifacts \n     from that era; (2) incorporate Airwings, Squadrons, Marine \n     Detachments, and Reserve and Veterans Associations called \n     ``Bringing the Ship Back to Life''; (3) provide mobile \n     displays and exhibits in hangar bays for large community-\n     sponsored events; and (4) establish Apollo XI and Apollo XII \n     displays; and\n       Whereas, The Alameda Reuse and Redevelopment Association \n     (ARRA), which will be responsible for the base after the Navy \n     leaves in 1997, has indicated its willingness to enter into \n     an interim lease of one of the piers for this purpose, and to \n     adopt a resolution in support of the U.S.S. Hornet renovation \n     project; and\n       Whereas, A group of Alameda citizens have established a \n     nonprofit corporation and a committee, along with the support \n     of the ARRA, the World War II Education and Research \n     Commission, the Mayor and City Council of Oakland, the San \n     Francisco Veterans' Affairs Commission, the City of \n     Vacaville, the Oakland Navy League, the Aircraft Carrier \n     Hornet Foundation, the Historic Naval Ships Association, and \n     the Smithsonian Institution, to pursue the acquisition of the \n     aircraft carrier Hornet (CV-12); now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That in order to enhance the public's \n     awareness of the contributions of the citizens of the State \n     of California and the County of Alameda to military \n     preparedness and, in particular, naval aviation history, and \n     to enhance the region's economy by increasing tourism and \n     creating new employment opportunities, the Legislature of the \n     State of California endorses the efforts to acquire the \n     aircraft carrier U.S.S. Hornet (CV-12) as a permanent museum, \n     educational, and entertainment complex to be located in \n     Alameda; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of California \n     respectfully memorializes the President and Congress of the \n     United States, the Secretary of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs \n     of Staff to the Department of Defense, to support the efforts \n     of the citizens of the State of California and the County of \n     Alameda to acquire the aircraft carrier Hornet; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United\n\n[[Page S99]]\n\n     States, to the Secretary of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff of the Department of Defense, to the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives, and to each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-3. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of California; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n       Whereas, The recent worldwide conflicts have highlighted \n     again the contributions of this nation's military and retired \n     veterans; and\n       Whereas, Integral to the success of our military forces are \n     those servicemen and servicewomen who have made a career of \n     defending their country, who in peacetime may be called away \n     to places remote from their families and loved ones, and who \n     in war face the prospect of death or of serious disabling \n     wounds as a constant possibility; and\n       Whereas, Legislation has been introduced by the United \n     States Congress to remedy an inequity applicable to military \n     careerists; and\n       Whereas, The inequity concerns those veterans who are both \n     retired and disabled and who, because of an antiquated law \n     that dates back to the nineteenth century, are denied \n     concurrent receipt of full retirement pay and disability \n     compensation pay, but instead may receive one or the other or \n     must waive an amount of retirement pay equal to the amount of \n     disability compensation pay; and\n       Whereas, No such deduction applies to the federal civil \n     service so that a disabled veteran who has held a nonmilitary \n     federal job for the requisite duration receives full \n     longevity retirement pay undiminished by the subtraction of \n     disability pay; and\n       Whereas, A statutory change is necessary to correct this \n     injustice and discrimination in order that America's \n     occasional commitment to war in pursuit of national and \n     international goals may be matched by an allegiance to those \n     who sacrificed on behalf of those goals; now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California urges the Congress of the United States to amend \n     Chapter 71 (commencing with Section 1401) of Title 10 of the \n     United States Code, relating to the compensation of retired \n     military personnel, to permit full concurrent receipt of \n     military longevity retirement pay and service-connected \n     disability pay; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, to the Secretary of Defense, to the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives, and to each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-4.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \nacknowledge the Sons of the American Revolution, Gen. David Humphreys \nBranch, and the East Haven Historical Society. In a combined effort, \nthese three groups have placed a marker on the northeast corner of the \nEast Haven Town Green as a memorial to the Marquis de Lafayette, \ngeneral in the Continental Army. General Lafayette and his troops \ncamped on that site en route to support the American and French forces \nat Providence, RI, on July 26, 1778.\n  The dedication took place on May 27, 1996, in observance of Memorial \nDay. The ceremony included planes from the Connecticut Air National \nGuard flying overhead. Mayor Henry Luzzi of East Haven introduced State \nRepresentative Michael P. Lawlor, 99th District, as the guest speaker. \nRepresentative Lawlor spoke of General Lafayette's concern for our \nnewly formed Government and his firm dedication to the cause of \nfreedom. General Lafayette served at his own expense as a volunteer \nusing his personal funds to supply the troops under his command and \nsoon reached virtual bankruptcy. Additionally, he forged a friendship \nbetween two nations which has lasted to the present time. When he died \nin 1834, soil from each of the individual United States was placed on \nhis grave. I commend the Sons of the American Revolution, Gen. David \nHumphreys Branch, and the East Haven Historical Society for their \nefforts and dedication to preserving the history of the United States.\n\n\n              Monitoring the new Line-Item Veto Authority\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on the first of January, the clock began \nticking on an historic 8-year experiment. The Line-Item Veto Act became \neffective on that date, a law that provides the President with \nsignificant new authority to cancel discretionary spending and new \nentitlement spending, along with an extremely limited ability to cancel \nnew spending done through the Tax Code.\n  Though the version enacted was flawed in several ways, I supported \nthis new authority to provide the President with some additional \nflexibility to eliminate inappropriate spending. I do not believe the \nline-item veto is the whole answer to our deficit problem, or even most \nof the answer, but it certainly can be part of the answer.\n  A key part of the new Presidential authority is the sunset clause. \nUnless Congress renews this authority, it will expire. The sunset \nclause will put the burden on those who want to retain the authority to \ndemonstrate the experiment has worked.\n  Mr. President, though the continuing Federal budget deficits justify \ngranting this temporary authority to the President on a trial basis, \nthere are many extremely serious issues surrounding this proposal that \nmerit close monitoring over the next several years. At the time I voted \nfor the final version of this new authority last year, I announced my \nintention to form a line-item veto watchdog project to regularly \nmonitor how this new law is implemented over the next 8 years, and I am \npleased to take this opportunity to report on that project.\n  Mr. President, joining me in this line-item veto watchdog project are \na number of distinguished observers of Federal policymaking, including \nNorman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, Stephen Moore of \nthe CATO Institute, and Demetri Coupanis on behalf of the Concord \nCoalition. In addition, several individuals from my home State of \nWisconsin have also agreed to participate in the project. They include \nState Senator Lynn Adelman, State Representative Dave Travis, and \nattorney Fred Wade of Madison. Each of those three individuals has a \ndeep interest in the partial veto authority granted to Wisconsin's\n\n[[Page S102]]\n\nGovernors and brings a critical perspective to the new authority given \nthe President.\n  Mr. President, though we have no prior experience at the Federal \nlevel, many in this body who have served in State government may have \nseen the use of line-item veto authority at the State level. Indeed, \nmuch of the support for a Federal line-item veto stems from the State \nexperience. But few other States, if any at all, have witnessed the \nabuses of line-item veto authority that we have seen in Wisconsin. That \nabuse has been bipartisan--Governors of both parties have used \nWisconsin's partial veto authority in ways it is safe to say no one \nanticipated when that authority was first contemplated. For example, \nWisconsin's current Governor, Governor Thompson, has used the veto \nauthority not only to rewrite entire laws, but actually to increase \nspending and increase taxes.\n  Mr. President, given that history, the participation of Senator \nAdelman, Representative Travis, and attorney Wade will be invaluable in \nhelping us monitor potential abuses of the new Presidential authority.\n  Mr. President, the watchdog project will be monitoring and \nchronicling a number of aspects of the Presidential power--first, the \nactual amount of Federal spending eliminated by the President's use of \nthe line-item veto. Reducing unnecessary spending was the central \nargument for this new authority, and keeping track of how much spending \nis eliminated will be useful in seeing how effective this new tool \nactually is. It may also help encourage Presidents to make sure that \nthey are making full use of this new authority as we will attempt to \ntrack missed opportunities as well as successes.\n  The watchdog project will also monitor instances where the new \nauthority is abused by the executive branch. Some have suggested that \nthe line-item veto could be used to coerce Members of Congress to toe \nthe line on an administration's policies through the threat to cancel \nspending in home States. If a President starts misusing the line-item \nveto authority as a club to get votes on nominations or other policy \nmatters, the public ought to hear about it, and our project will seek \nto document this kind of abuse if it takes place.\n  Mr. President, the watchdog project will also look for examples of \nexcess spending that escape scrutiny because of loopholes in the new \nlaw. Some already are speculating on the different techniques that may \nbe attempted to avoid the reach of this new Presidential power.\n  Mr. President, in this regard, I am especially concerned that the \nsections of the line-item veto authority that deal with tax \nexpenditures were too narrowly drawn, and that many new special \ninterest tax breaks could escape the line-item veto pen. Along with my \ngood friend in the other body, Representative Tom Barrett of Milwaukee, \nI have introduced legislation to address this weakness in the new law, \nand will do so again this session. It makes no sense to provide the \nPresident with this new authority while protecting one of the fastest \ngrowing areas of spending in the Federal budget, an area that includes \nunjustified subsidies to some of the wealthiest individuals and \ncorporations in the world.\n  Mr. President, the watchdog group will also monitor efforts to twist \nthe line item authority beyond its stated purpose. As I noted above, in \nWisconsin, the partial veto authority has been abused by our Governors \nby striking out single letters in appropriation bills to create new \nwords and new meanings to legislation. In some cases, the Wisconsin \nstatute has been used to actually increase State spending. The new \nFederal law does not, on its surface, appear to allow for that kind of \nabuse, but our project will be monitoring that aspect of implementation \nof the new law as well.\n  Other aspects of the new law that warrant review are also sure to \npresent themselves as we begin its actual use later this session, and I \nwelcome suggestions from my colleagues who are interested in this \nhistoric new law.\n  It is critical that we track closely how the new authority is being \nused so that when it expires in 8 years, Congress and the public will \nhave some measurable criteria by which to assess its effectiveness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S101-8", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BURTON P.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \n220th anniversary of the U.S. Cavalry. The anniversary occurred on \nDecember 16, 1996.\n  It was in the town of Wethersfield, CT, under orders by the First \nContinental Congress, that Revolutionary troops organized the 1st \nCavalry Regiment in the Continental Army. Today, the town of \nWethersfield, located in my home State of Connecticut, is proud to be \nrecognized as the birthplace of the U.S. Cavalry.\n  Recognized by the U.S. Department of the Army's Center of Military \nHistory, the 2d Continental Light Dragoons--Sheldon's Horse--were \norganized in Wethersfield. This was the first dragoon regiment to \nbecome a part of the Continental Army. Training ground for this \nregiment had been created by a Wethersfield native, Capt. Benjamin \nTallmadge. This regiment made numerous contributions in the \nRevolutionary War by participating in combat in northern New Jersey and \nthe defense of Philadelphia.\n  The town of Wethersfield played a vital role in America's \nindependence. From the historic Webb House, where Gen. George \nWashington met with Comte de Rochambeau to discuss strategies for the \nBattle of Yorktown, to the modern development of the Silas Deane \nHighway, the quaintness of Wethersfield is intermingled with the heroic \ngreatness of the U.S. Cavalry. With origins in Wethersfield, the U.S. \nCavalry fought epic battles at Brandy Station during the Civil War and \nthe Punity Expedition before World War I.\n  The U.S. Cavalry now based in Fort Riley, KS, will be forever linked \nwith Wethersfield and the State of Connecticut. I applaud the efforts \nof Deputy Mayor Richard Sparveri, Town Councilman Brendan T. Flynn, the \nWethersfield Historical Society, Wethersfield Tourism Task Force, Mr. \nJohn Conway, Mr. Arthur Hutchinson, and so many others who have brought \nthis significant part of American history into the spotlight it greatly \ndeserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S102-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S102-S103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on January 7, 1997, by the President \nof the United States: protocols to the 1980 Conventional Weapons \nConvention, Treaty Document No. 105-1.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the treaty be considered as \nhaving been read the first time; that it be referred, with accompanying \npapers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be \nprinted; and that the President's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, the following Protocols to the 1980 Convention on \nProhibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons \nWhich May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have \nIndiscriminate Effects: the amended Protocol on Prohibitions or \nRestrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices \n(Protocol II or the amended Mines Protocol); the Protocol on \nProhibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons (Protocol \nIII or the Incendiary Weapons Protocol); and the Protocol on Blinding \nLaser Weapons (Protocol IV). Also transmitted for the information of \nthe Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to \nthese Protocols, together with article-by-article analyses.\n  The most important of these Protocols is the amended Mines Protocol. \nIt is an essential step forward in dealing with the problem of anti-\npersonnel landmines (APL) and in minimizing the very severe casualties \nto civilians that have resulted from their use. It is an important \nprecursor to the total prohibition of these weapons that the United \nStates seeks.\n  Among other things, the amended Mines Protocol will do the following: \n(1) expand the scope of the original Protocol to include internal armed \nconflicts, where most civilian mine casualties have occurred; (2) \nrequire that all remotely delivered anti-personnel mines be equipped \nwith self-destruct devices and backup self-deactivation features to \nensure that they do not pose a long-term threat to civilians; (3) \nrequire that all nonremotely delivered anti-personnel mines that are \nnot equipped with such devices be used only within controlled, marked, \nand monitored minefields to protect the civilian population in the \narea; (4) require that all anti-personnel mines be detectable using \ncommonly available technology to make the task of mine clearance easier \nand safer; (5) require that the party laying mines assume \nresponsibility for them to ensure against their irresponsible and \nindiscriminate use; and (6) provide more effective means for dealing \nwith compliance problems to ensure that these restrictions are actually \nobserved. These objectives were all endorsed by the Senate in its \nResolution of Ratification of the Convention in March 1995.\n  The amended Mines Protocol was not as strong as we would have \npreferred. In particular, its provisions on verification and compliance \nare not as rigorous as we had proposed, and the transition periods \nallowed for the conversion or elimination of certain noncompliant mines \nare longer than we thought necessary. We shall pursue these issues in \nthe regular meetings that the amended Protocol provides for review of \nits operation.\n  Nonetheless, I am convinced that this amended Protocol will, if \ngenerally adhered to, save many lives and prevent many tragic injuries. \nIt will, as well, help to prepare the ground for the total prohibition \nof anti-personnel landmines to which the United States is committed. In \nthis regard, I cannot overemphasize how seriously the United States \ntakes the goal of eliminating APL entirely. The carnage and devastation \ncaused by anti-personnel landmines--the hidden killers that murder and \nmaim more than 25,000 people every year--must end.\n  On May 16, 1996, I launched an international effort to this end. This \ninitiative sets out a concrete path to a global ban on anti-personnel \nlandmines and is one of my top arms control priorities. At the same \ntime, the policy recognizes that the United States has international \ncommitments and responsibilities that must be taken into account in any \nnegotiations on a total ban. As our work on this initiative progresses, \nwe will continue to consult with the Congress.\n  The second of these Protocols--the Protocol on Incendiary Weapons--is \na part of the original Convention but was not sent to the Senate for \nadvice and consent with the other 1980 Protocols in 1994 because of \nconcerns about the acceptability of the Protocol from a military point \nof view. Incendiary weapons have significant potential military value, \nparticularly with respect to flammable military targets that cannot so \nreadily be destroyed with conventional explosives.\n\n  At the same time, these weapons can be misused in a manner that could \ncause heavy civilian casualties. In particular, the Protocol prohibits \nthe use of air-delivered incendiary weapons against targets located in \na city, town, village, or other concentration of civilians, a practice \nthat caused very heavy civilian casualties in past conflicts.\n  The executive branch has given very careful study to the Incendiaries \nProtocol and has developed a reservation that would, in our view, make \nit acceptable from a broader national security perspective. This \nproposed reservation, the text of which appears in the report of the \nDepartment of State, would reserve the right to use incendiaries \nagainst military objectives located in concentrations of civilians \nwhere it is judged that such use would cause fewer casualties and less \ncollateral damage than alternative weapons.\n  The third of these three Protocols--the new Protocol on Blinding \nLasers--prohibits the use or transfer of laser weapons specifically \ndesigned to cause permanent blindness to unenhanced vision (that is, to \nthe naked eye or to the eye with corrective devices). The Protocol also \nrequires Parties to take all feasible precautions in the employment of \nother laser systems to avoid the incidence of such blindness.\n  These blinding lasers are not needed by our military forces. They are \npotential weapons of the future, and the United States is committed to \npreventing their emergence and use. The United States supports the \nadoption of this new Protocol.\n  I recommend that the Senate give its early and favorable \nconsideration to these Protocols and give its advice and consent to \nratification, subject to the conditions described in the accompanying \nreport of the Department of State. The prompt ratification of the \namended Mines Protocol is particularly important, so that the United \nStates can continue its position of leadership in the effort to deal \nwith the humanitarian catastrophe of irresponsible landmine use.\n                                                    William J. Clinton.\n  The White House, January 7, 1997.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/07/senate-section/article/S103-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECESS UNTIL THURSDAY, JANUARY 9, 1997, AT 12:30 P.M.\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
