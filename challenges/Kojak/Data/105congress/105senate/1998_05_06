The clerk will report the pending \nbusiness.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2676) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to restructure and reform the Internal Revenue Service, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I further ask that at the conclusion or \nyielding back of time the Senate proceed to vote on the Roth amendment \nfollowed by a vote on the Kerrey amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, before we begin debate today, I would like \nto offer some comments about the consent agreement that governs the \noffering of amendments. Basically, amendments that are to be in order \nmust be relevant to the purpose of the IRS reform legislation, which \ncovers three major areas.\n  First, it reorganizes, restructures, and re-equips the IRS to make it \nmore customer friendly in its tax-collecting mission.\n  Second, it protects taxpayers from abusive practices and procedures \nof the IRS.\n  Third, it deals with the management and conduct of IRS employees.\n  These are the main purposes of the bill. While there are provisions \ndealing with electronic filing and congressional oversight, that is \nbasically what this bill does.\n  Title 6 of the bill is an entirely different matter. That title \ncontains technical amendments that run the breadth of the tax code. In \nthe House of Representatives, this title was reported by the Ways and \nMeans Committee as a separate bill--which, in fact, it is.\n  Title 6 is unrelated to IRS reform. It contains only technical \ncorrections to previously enacted tax legislation that meet the \nfollowing criteria:\n\n[[Page S4380]]\n\n  First, they carry out the original intent of Congress in enacting the \nprovision being amended.\n  Second, by definition, the technical correction does not score as a \nrevenue gain or loss.\n  Third, the policy has been approved by the Treasury Department, the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, and the majority and minority of both the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee.\n  As a consequence, amendments which are relevant because of provisions \nin title 6 must meet a more difficult standard under the consent \nagreement. They must not only be relevant, but must be cleared but the \ntwo managers and the two leaders. And in clearing provisions that \nrelate to title 6, I will apply the same criteria that the provisions \nof title 6 had to meet to become part of that title.\n  I hope this explanation provides a clearer understanding of the \napplication of the consent agreement to possible amendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2339\n\n    (Purpose: To ensure compliance with Federal budget requirements)\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware (Mr. Roth) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2339.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 401, strike line 3, and insert: ``beginning after \n     December 31, 1998''.\n       On page 415, between lines 16 and 17, insert:\n\n     SEC. 5007. CLARIFICATION OF DEFINITION OF SPECIFIED LIABILITY \n                   LOSS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (B) of section 172(f)(1) \n     (defining specified liability loss) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(B) Any amount (not described in subparagraph (A)) \n     allowable as a deduction under this chapter which is \n     attributable to a liability--\n       ``(i) under a Federal or State law requiring the \n     reclamation of land, decommissioning of a nuclear power plant \n     (or any unit thereof), dismantlement of an offshore drilling \n     platform, remediation of environmental contamination, or \n     payment of workmen's compensation, and\n       ``(ii) with respect to which the act (or failure to act) \n     giving rise to such liability occurs at least 3 years before \n     the beginning of the taxable year.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to net operating losses arising in taxable years \n     beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5008.

EXTENSION OF INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE USER FEES.\n\n       Subsection (c) of section 10511 of the Revenue Act of 1987 \n     is amended by striking ``October 1, 2003'' and inserting \n     ``October 1, 2007''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is now \nset aside.\n  Does the Senator from Nebraska wish to offer his amendment?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2340\n\n    (Purpose: To ensure compliance with Federal budget requirements)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Kerrey) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2340.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments submitted.'')\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  The Senator from Delaware has 30 minutes under his control.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2339\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, under the Senate's budget rules, the first year, first \nfive years, and second five years of revenue losses in a tax bill must \nbe offset with either mandatory savings or revenue increases.\n  When the Finance Committee marked up the underlying bill, the first \nfive years of revenue loss were offset. The second five years of \nrevenue loss were not fully offset. The IRS Restructuring bill was \nshort in excess of $9 billion in the last five years. During the \nmarkup, I indicated that I would work with the Budget Committee to \nattempt to find offsets so that the bill would be fully paid for over \nthe last five years.\n  Finding offsets was not an easy task. Every major revenue raiser I \nconsidered brought forth opposition from different members. After \nseveral weeks of reviewing options, I have developed a package, in \nconsultation with the leadership.\n  Mr. President, this pay-for package contains three new revenue \nraisers and a change to a revenue raiser in the underlying bill.\n  The first revenue raiser comes from the Administration's budget. This \nproposal would tighten the definition of operating losses that are \neligible for a special ten year carry back. Congress intended this \ntreatment to be limited to a narrow category of activities. This \nproposal simply clarifies the types of losses eligible for this special \ntreatment. This proposal is noncontroversial.\n  The second new revenue raiser relates to the rollover rules for Roth \nIRAs. Under current law, individuals or married couples with adjusted \ngross income over $100,000 cannot rollover a traditional IRA into a \nRoth IRA. For purposes of the $100,000 test, minimum distributions \nwhich are required when an IRA beneficiary reaches 70\\1/2\\ are counted \nas income.\n  This second new raiser would modify current law by excluding minimum \ndistributions from the $100,000 test. The effect of this proposal is to \nallow more taxpayers, at age 70\\1/2\\ and above, to rollover from a \ntraditional IRA to a Roth IRA. This proposal will enlarge the group of \ntaxpayers who can enjoy the benefits of the Roth IRA.\n  The third new raiser would extend the current law user fees charge by \nthe IRS for private letter rulings. This extension would be effective \nfor four years.\n  Let me note that the IRS restructuring bill uses the balance on the \npay-go scorecard of $406 million in the last five years as an offset. \nWe have been informed by the Budget Committee staff that the use of the \npay-go balance is appropriate in this instance.\n  Finally, this amendment modifies an effective date of a revenue \nraiser in the Finance Committee bill. The proposal modified is the \nproposal to limit the carry back period of the foreign tax credit. \nUnder this amendment, the effective date of the foreign tax credit \nraiser has been moved out one year to tax years beginning after 1998.\n  Now, Mr. President, some on the other side may criticize the most \nsignificant new revenue raiser in this package. The target of their \ncriticism is the proposal to allow more older taxpayers to convert to \nRoth IRAs.\n  As I see it, those criticizing the rollover provision have the \nobjective of limiting retirement savings choices for taxpayers who \nreach the end of their working years. For taxpayers who reach 70\\1/2\\, \nthe opponents of the rollover provision are saying those taxpayers \nshould fall under a more restrictive rule than those taxpayers under \n70\\1/2\\.\n  If you are over 70\\1/2\\ and you are a middle income person who has a \nhealthy IRA or pension plan, the opponents of the rollover provision \nare arguing you should not have the choice of a Roth IRA.\n  Alan Greenspan says America's most important economic problem is its \nlow savings rate. It is a problem that we must address. The rollover \nprovision in this amendment is a small step toward resolving our number \n1 economic problem.\n\n[[Page S4381]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a technical description \nof this amendment, and a revised revenue table for the IRS \nrestructuring bill, prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nDescription of Roth Financing Amendment to the Internal Revenue Service \n    Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 as Reported by the Senate \n                          Committee on Finance\n\n\na. foreign tax credit carryback and carryover periods (sec. 5002 of the \n                                 bill)\n\n       Under the bill, the provision is effective with respect to \n     credits arising in taxable years ending after the date of \n     enactment. Under the modification, the provision would be \n     effective with respect to credits arising in taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 1998.\n\n\n b. restrict special net operating loss carryback rules for specified \n                            liability losses\n\n     Present law\n       Under present law, that portion of a net operating loss \n     that qualifies as a ``specified liability loss'' may be \n     carried back 10 years rather than being limited to the \n     general two-year carryback period. A specified liability loss \n     includes amounts allowable as a deduction with respect to \n     product liability, and also certain liabilities that arise \n     under Federal or State law or out of any tort of the \n     taxpayer. In the case of a liability arising out of a Federal \n     or State law, the act (or failure to act) giving rise to the \n     liability must occur at least 3 years before the beginning of \n     the taxable year. In the case of a liability arising out of a \n     tort, the liability must arise out of a series of actions (or \n     failures to act) over an extended period of time a \n     substantial portion of which occurred at least 3 years before \n     the beginning of the taxable year. A specified liability loss \n     cannot exceed the amount of the net operating loss, and is \n     only available to taxpayers that used an accrual method \n     throughout the period that the acts (or failures to act) \n     giving rise to the liability occurred.\n     Description of proposal\n       Under the proposal, specified liability losses would be \n     defined and limited to include (in addition to product \n     liability losses) only amounts allowable as a deduction that \n     are attributable to a liability that arises under Federal or \n     State law for reclamation of land, decommissioning of a \n     nuclear power plant (or any unit thereof), dismantlement of \n     an offshore oil drilling platform, remediation of \n     environmental contamination, or payments arising under a \n     workers' compensation statute, if the act (or failure to act) \n     giving rise to such liability occurs at least 3 years before \n     the beginning of the taxable year. No inference regarding the \n     interpretation of the specified liability loss carryback \n     rules under current law would be intended by this proposal.\n     Effective date\n       The proposal would be effective for net operating losses \n     arising in taxable years beginning after the date of \n     enactment.\n\n\n C. Modification of Minimum Distribution Requirements to Determine AGI \n                        for Roth IRA Conversions\n\n     Present law\n       Under present law, uniform minimum distribution rules \n     generally apply to all types of tax-favored retirement \n     vehicles, including qualified retirement plans and annuities, \n     individual retirement arrangements (``IRAs'') other than Roth \n     IRAs, and tax-sheltered annuities (sec 403(b)).\n       Under present law, distributions are required to begin no \n     later than the participant's required beginning date (sec. \n     401(a)(9)). The required beginning date means the April 1 of \n     the calendar year following the later of (1) the calendar \n     year in which the employee attains age 70\\1/2\\, or (2) the \n     calendar year in which the employee retires. In the case of \n     an employee who is a 5-percent owner (as defined in section \n     416), the required beginning date is April 1 of the calendar \n     year following the calendar year in which the employee \n     attains age 70\\1/2\\. The Internal Revenue Service has issued \n     extensive Regulations for purposes of calculating minimum \n     distributions. In general, minimum distributions are \n     includible in gross income in the year of distribution. An \n     excise tax equal to 50 percent of the required distribution \n     applies to the extent a required distribution is not made.\n       Under present law, all or any part of amounts held in a \n     deductible or nondeductible IRA may be converted into a Roth \n     IRA. Only taxpayers with adjusted gross income (``AGI'') of \n     $100,000 or less are eligible to convert an IRA into a Roth \n     IRA. In the case of a married taxpayer, AGI is the combined \n     AGI of the couple. Married taxpayers filing a separate return \n     are not eligible to make a conversion.\n     Description of proposal\n       The proposal would modify the definition of AGI to exclude \n     required minimum distributions from the taxpayer's AGI solely \n     for purposes of determining eligibility to convert from an \n     IRA to a Roth IRA. As under present law, the required minimum \n     distribution would not be eligible for conversion and would \n     be includible in gross income.\n     Effective date\n       The proposal would be effective for taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 2004.\n\n\n                     D. Extension of IRS User Fees\n\n     Present law\n       The IRS provides written responses to questions of \n     individuals, corporations, and organizations relating to \n     their tax status or the effects of particular transactions \n     for tax purposes in the form of ruling letters, determination \n     letters, opinion letters, and other similar rulings or \n     determinations. The IRS is directed by statute to establish a \n     user fee program with respect to such rulings and \n     determinations. Pursuant to this statutory authorization, the \n     IRS establishes a schedule of user fees. The statutory \n     authorization for the IRS use fee program is in effect for \n     requests made before October 1, 2003 (P.L. 104-117).\n     Description of proposal\n       The proposal would extend the IRS user fee program for \n     requests made before October 1, 2007.\n     Effective date\n       The proposal would be effective on the date of enactment.\n\nESTIMATED REVENUE EFFECTS OF H.R. 2676, THE ``INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT OF 1998,'' AS REPORTED BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE AND MODIFIED BY THE ROTH FINANCING\n                                                                                            AMENDMENT\n                                                                        [Fiscal Years 1998-2007, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Provision                           Effective              1998      1999      2000      2001      2002      2003      2004      2005      2006      2007    1998-2002  2003-2007\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTitle I.

Mr. President, I would now like to turn to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Kerrey.\n  Senator Kerrey is offering an alternative pay-for package. I must \noppose Senator Kerrey's package.\n  The Kerrey amendment contains revenue raisers similar to the Roth \namendment. There are a few additional items that I had considered in \ncrafting my pay-for amendment.\n  There, is, however, one very controversial revenue raiser in the \nKerrey amendment. I think it is important that my colleagues focus \ntheir attention on it.\n  Rather than modifying the rollover rules for Roth IRAs, which would \nallow more taxpayers to enjoy the benefits of the Roth IRA, the Kerrey \namendment would reinstate the expired Superfund taxes.\n  It is an undisputable fact that the present Superfund program needs \nimmediate, substantial reform. I am a longstanding supporter of the \nSuperfund program. It is critical that Superfund sites be cleaned up. \nIt is a shame that the program has floundered over the past several \nyears. Every Senator should feel the responsibility to get the \nSuperfund program back up and running at full speed.\n  The Superfund trust fund received its revenues from excise taxes on \ndomestic crude oil and imported petroleum products, certain chemicals \nand imported derivative products, and a corporate environmental tax.\n  These taxes expired a couple of years ago. If the taxes are extended, \nthey will provide the necessary resources for Superfund cleanup \nactivities.\n  It is important to maintain the ``connection'' between the Superfund \ntaxes and the Superfund program. It is the view of our Senior \nRepublican colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee \nthat this connection is important for both the politics and policy of \nSuperfund.\n  Our distinguished colleagues from the Committee on Environmental and \nPublic Works, in particular, Senator Smith and Senator Chafee, have \nworked long and hard on Superfund reform legislation.\n  They produced a bill, passed it out of committee, and have asked me \nto extend the expired Superfund taxes to cover the authorization \nperiod. Senators Smith and Chafee should be commended for moving \nSuperfund forward, not undercut here on the Senate floor.\n  I intend to support Senators Smith and Chafee's efforts. As they have \ncommunicated to me, unless the Superfund taxes are enacted directly in \nconnection with a Superfund reform bill, any hope for the long-needed \nchanges in this environmental program would be dashed.\n  In deference to Senators Smith and Chafee, the Finance Committee did \nnot include an extension of the Superfund taxes in either the IRS \nReform bill that passed our committee unanimously or in the Roth \namendment. I agree with Senators Smith and Chafee that the appropriate \nvehicle for extension of the Superfund taxes is their Superfund bill.\n  As chairman, let me be clear--I pledge to work with Senators Smith \nand Chafee on Superfund with respect to the issues within Finance \nCommittee jurisdiction.\n  It is my hope that will move forward with a viable Superfund reform \nproposal. The recent progress made by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee is encouraging.\n  If you are for Superfund reform, as I am, you need to support \nSenators Smith and Chafee. For this reason, I respectfully urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the Kerrey amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first of all, the choice that the Senate \nwill be making today really is, the first choice we have to make is do \nwe want to put another $9 billion of spending in this bill. That is \nwhat the Finance Committee did. And as a consequence we are now trying \nto find a pay-for of some kind. I believe it is a perfectly good bill \nwithout that $9 billion worth of additional expenditure, but that is \nthe threshold question. Do you want to spend an additional $9 billion? \nAnd if you do, the question is, how do you get the money? Where do you \nget the money to pay for it?\n  What we have done in our amendment is included two provisions that\n\n[[Page S4384]]\n\nwere included by the chairman of the Budget Committee. The Chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, has advocated these two \nprovisions as reasonable provisions, and we have included them as a \npay-for. The alternative must be described here in a little more \ndetail.\n  It is essentially an accounting gimmick that will be used by people \nover the age of 70\\1/2\\ that will basically enable them to pass to \ntheir heirs, tax free, assets that they currently own. That is what it \nis. Members need to know who will be affected by this.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter from the Joint Committee on Taxation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the memorandum was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 1998.\n     To: Mark Patterson.\n     From: Lindy L. Paull.\n     Subject: Estimated revenue effects of proposal included in \n         Roth financing amendment to modify rules relating to Roth \n         IRA conversions.\n       Included in the proposed Roth Financing Amendment to the \n     IRS Restructuring bill currently pending on the Senate floor \n     is a proposal to modify the definition of adjusted gross \n     income (``AGI'') for purposes of determining the income \n     limitation of conversions of IRA balances to Roth IRAs, \n     effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2004. The following describes the analysis of the staff of \n     the Joint Committee on Taxation in preparing estimated \n     revenue effects of this proposal.\n\n\n                        Description of proposal\n\n       Under present law, uniform minimum distribution rules \n     generally apply to all types of tax-favored retirement \n     vehicles, including qualified retirement plans and annuities, \n     IRAs other than Roth IRAs, and tax-sheltered annuities (sec. \n     403(b)).\n       Distributions are required to begin no later than the \n     participant's required beginning date (sec. 401(a)(9)). The \n     required beginning date means April 1 of the calendar year \n     following the later of (1) the calendar year in which the \n     employee attains age 70\\1/2\\, or (2) the calendar year in \n     which the employee retires. In the case of an employee who is \n     a 5-percent owner (as defined in section 416), the required \n     beginning date is April 1 of the calendar year following the \n     calendar year the employee attains age 70\\1/2\\. In general, \n     minimum distributions are includible in gross income in the \n     year of distribution.\n       Under present law, all or any part of amounts in a \n     deductible or nondeductible IRA may be converted into a Roth \n     IRA. Only taxpayers with AGI of $100,000 or less are eligible \n     to convert an IRA into a Roth IRA. In the case of a married \n     taxpayer, AGI is the combined AGI of the couple. Married \n     taxpayers filing a separate return are not eligible to make a \n     conversion.\n       If a taxpayer is required to take a minimum required \n     distribution from an IRA, the amount of the required \n     distribution is includible in gross income, and cannot be \n     rolled over into a Roth IRA.\n       The proposal would modify the definition of AGI to exclude \n     the required minimum distribution from the taxpayer's AGI \n     solely for purposes of determining eligibility to convert \n     from an IRA to a Roth IRA. As under present law, the required \n     minimum distribution would not be eligible for conversion and \n     would be includible in gross income.\n\n\n                     revenue estimation assumptions\n\n       The proposal targets a fairly narrow, well-defined \n     taxpaying population who have attained or will attain age \n     70\\1/2\\ during the budget period. For purposes of the revenue \n     estimate, it is assumed that the proposal would be utilized \n     by a subset of this population. Two classes of taxpayers who \n     become eligible for the conversion to a Roth IRA as a result \n     of the proposal have been identified.\n       (1) Taxpayers who are currently over age 70\\1/2\\, are \n     taking a minimum required distribution, and who have AGI in \n     excess of $100,000. When the proposal becomes effective, some \n     taxpayers whose AGI would fall below $100,000 if the minimum \n     required distributions were disregarded would convert to a \n     Roth IRA. In addition, some taxpayers whose AGI would not \n     fall below $100,000 under the proposal but who have income \n     that could be shifted easily from one tax year to another \n     would convert to a Roth IRA. It is assumed for estimating \n     purposes that some of these taxpayers would utilize this \n     income shifting technique under present law to take advantage \n     of the conversion to a Roth IRA; however, taxpayers whose \n     minimum required distributions are substantial would be less \n     able to utilize this technique under present law.\n       (2) Taxpayers whose AGI exceeds $100,000 and who will \n     attain age 70\\1/2\\ during the budget window. These taxpayers \n     are currently not eligible to convert to a Roth IRA; some of \n     these taxpayers have income which could be shifted easily \n     from one tax year to another and might be expected to do such \n     income shifting in order to make a conversion to a Roth IRA \n     under present law. Other taxpayers would not be able to shift \n     income easily and would not be able to utilize the conversion \n     to a Roth IRA under present law.\n       Approximately 500,000 taxpayers would be eligible for the \n     conversion under the proposal during the budget years 2005 \n     through 2007. Of those eligible, we estimate that \n     approximately 170,000 taxpayers would convert to a Roth IRA.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. The Joint Committee on Taxation said, as we all know, it \nonly affects Americans with retirement income over $100,000 a year. \nThat is who is affected. So ask yourself how many people in your State \nhave incomes over $100,000 a year, because that is who it is going to \naffect. The Joint Committee on Taxation is saying 170,000 of those \nindividuals--that is what they are saying, 170,000 of those \nindividuals--will convert to a Roth IRA. What does that mean? That \nmeans they are going to pay $50,000 each to convert. In order to get $8 \nmillion, you have to have an average of $50,000 of taxes paid by each \nof these 170,000 people to convert.\n  You ask yourself, why are they doing it? Love America? Love their \ncountry? Get teary-eyed when they watch the flag go by? No, sir. What \nthey are doing is saying they would rather pay that extra $50,000 \nbecause they know their heirs will not pay any tax on this asset when \nit is transferred. That is what happens. It is a substantial reduction \nin tax revenue in the 10- to 15-year period at the very moment that \nthis Senate and this Congress is going to be facing a tremendous \nproblem of growing entitlements. They are going to force us into a \nsituation where we will have to be reducing the cost of entitlement \nprograms. While we are reducing the cost of entitlement programs, the \nheirs of very wealthy Americans are going to be receiving income on \nwhich they are paying no tax. That is what this is all about. This is \nnot about Americans who are under the gun. Remember, of all of the \nnearly 40 million Social Security beneficiaries, almost 70 percent of \nthem have 50 percent of their income being Social Security only; that \nis $745 a month.\n  This is about people over the age of 70\\1/2\\ with retirement incomes \nover $100,000 taking an IRA, converting it to a Roth IRA, paying, on an \naverage, $47,000 per person for taxes so their heirs don't have to pay \nany taxes at the very moment that this Senate is going to be facing \ncutting back on benefits to the middle-income Americans. That is the \nchoice that this proposal presents to us.\n  We are saying, first of all, on this side we would prefer that we not \nadd to the cost of the bill. We have. Second, if we are saying we are \ngoing to add to the cost of the bill, let's find something that is more \nappropriate than providing a tax break to people right now who, \nfrankly, not only are they not asking for a tax break, I think it is \nvery difficult to justify that they need one. Our offset includes a \nprovision that was recommended by the chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  In addition, our proposal, our amendment, includes some requests.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter sent to the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee from Commissioner Rossotti be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Treasury,\n\n\n                                     Internal Revenue Service,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 31, 1998.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to provide the Senate \n     Finance Committee information about provisions under \n     consideration as part of the IRS restructuring bill which, in \n     order to implement, will require changes in IRS computer \n     information systems.\n       As is noted in one of the provisions of the restructuring \n     bill, it is essential that the work needed to make the IRS \n     computer systems comply with the Century Date Change be given \n     priority. If these changes are not made and tested \n     successfully, computer systems on which the IRS directly \n     depends for accepting and processing tax returns and tax \n     payments will cease to function after December 31, 1999. In \n     order to accomplish this change, a massive effort is underway \n     now and will continue through January 2000. This project, one \n     of the largest information systems challenges in the country \n     today, is estimated to cost approximately $850 million \n     through FY 1999 and requires updating and testing of about \n     75,000 computer applications programs, 1400 minicomputers, \n     over 100,000 desktop computers, over 80 mainframe computers \n     and data communications networks comprising more than 50,000 \n     individual product components. In addition, the data entry \n     system that processes most of the tax returns must be \n     replaced.\n       Most of the work to repair or replace these individual \n     components must be done prior to the tax season that begins \n     in January 1999,\n\n[[Page S4385]]\n\n     and thus is at its peak during calendar 1998. During this \n     peak period, the IRS must also make the changes necessary to \n     implement the provisions of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \n     which are effective in tax year 1998. These changes are still \n     being defined in detail but are currently estimated to \n     require about 800 discrete computer systems changes.\n       The most critical systems to which these changes must be \n     made are systems that were originally developed in the \n     1960's, 1970's and 1980's, and many are written in old \n     computer languages. A limited number of technical staff have \n     sufficient familiarity with these programs to make changes to \n     them. Furthermore, the IRS suffered attrition of 8% of this \n     staff during FY 97, which attrition has continued at the same \n     or higher rate until recently. In part, this attrition \n     reflected the very tight market for technical professionals \n     as well as a perceived lack of future opportunities at the \n     IRS.\n       This extraordinary situation has required the IRS to commit \n     every available technical and technical management resource \n     to these critical priorities and to defer most other requests \n     for systems changes at least during calendar year 1998.\n       For these reasons, it will not be feasible to make any \n     significant additional changes to the IRS systems prior to \n     the 1999 filing season, pushing the start of all additional \n     work to about the second quarter of calendar 1999. \n     Furthermore during 1999, a major amount of additional work \n     will be required to perform the testing to ensure that all \n     the repaired or replaced components work as expected prior to \n     January 1, 2000. Given the magnitude of the changes, it is \n     likely that additional work will be required to repair \n     defects and problems that will be uncovered during the \n     testing in the second half of 1999. Thus, while some capacity \n     to make systems changes is projected to exist in 1999, there \n     is considerable uncertainty about how much capacity will in \n     fact be available even during calendar 1999.\n       With this context in mind, we have attempted to identify \n     the provisions in the restructuring bill that require \n     significant changes to computer systems and estimate how much \n     staff time would be needed to implement these changes. Based \n     on this very preliminary analysis, we have prepared a list of \n     recommended effective dates if these provisions are adopted. \n     In all cases, we would strive to implement the provisions \n     sooner if possible. In addition, two provisions entail both \n     significant systems and policy issues. For these items, which \n     are discussed first, we suggest an alternative approach.\n\n\n                          Alternative approach\n\n       1. Require that all IRS notices and correspondence contain \n     a name and telephone number of an IRS employee who the \n     taxpayer may call. Also, to the extent practicable and where \n     it is advantageous to the taxpayer, the IRS should assign one \n     employee to handle a matter with respect to a taxpayer until \n     that matter is resolved.\n       Concern: We agree with the objectives of this proposal, but \n     are concerned because it would entail a total redesign of \n     customer service systems and would actually move the IRS away \n     from the best practices found in the private sector. We do \n     support the proposal that the IRS should assign one employee \n     to handle a matter with respect to the taxpayer where it is \n     both practicable and where it is advantageous to the \n     taxpayer.\n       The proposal would affect the Masterfile, Integrated Data \n     Retrieval System (IDRS), and any system supported by IDRS \n     (including AIMS and ACS). In addition, the proposal is likely \n     to decrease the customer service we are trying to improve \n     through our expansion of access by telephone to 7 days a \n     week, 24 hours a day. The assignment of a particular employee \n     for a taxpayer contact could actually increase the level \n     of taxpayer frustration as the named employee may be on \n     another phone call, working a diffrent shift, or handling \n     some other taxpayer matter when taxpayers call. In \n     addition, consistent with private sector practices, we are \n     currently installing a national call router designed to \n     ensure that when a taxpayer calls with a question, the \n     call can be routed to the next available customer service \n     representative for the fastest response possible.\n       Proposal: Require that the IRS adopt best practices for \n     customer service with regard to notices and correspondence, \n     as exemplified by the private sector. Require that the IRS \n     report to Congress on an annual basis on these private sector \n     best practices, the comparable state of IRS activities, and \n     the specific steps the IRS is taking to close any gap between \n     its level and quality of service and that of the private \n     sector. Furthermore, the IRS could be required to put \n     employee names on individual correspondence; it could require \n     all employees to provide taxpayers with their names and \n     employee ID numbers; and, finally, it could record, in the \n     computer system, the ID number of the employee who takes any \n     action on a taxpayer account.\n       2. The proposal would suspend the accrual of penalties and \n     interest after one year, if the IRS has not sent the taxpayer \n     a notice of deficiency within the year following the date \n     which is the later of the original date of the return or the \n     date on which the individual taxpayer timely filed the \n     return.\n       Concern: We agree with the objective of the proposal to \n     encourage the IRS to proceed expeditiously in any contact \n     with taxpayers, however, our systems are currently unable to \n     accommodate some of the data requirements with the speed \n     necessary to make this proposal workable. In addition, we are \n     concerned that the proposal could have the perverse incentive \n     of encouraging taxpayers to actually drag out their audit \n     proceedings rather than work with the IRS to bring them to a \n     speedy conclusion. Our administrative appeals process, which \n     is designed to resolve cases without the taxpayer and the \n     government incurring the cost and burden of a trial, could \n     also become a vehicle for taxpayers to delay issuance of a \n     deficiency notice.\n       Proposal: Require the IRS to set as a goal the issuance of \n     a notice of deficiency within one year of a timely filed \n     return. Mandate that the IRS provide a report to the Congress \n     on an annual basis that specifies: progress the IRS has made \n     toward meeting this goal, measures the IRS has implemented to \n     meet this goal, additional measures it proposes toward the \n     same end, and any impediments or problems that hinder the \n     IRS' ability to meet the goal. In addition, the proposal \n     could reemphasize the requirement that the IRS abate interest \n     during periods when there is a lapse in contact with the \n     taxpayer because the IRS employee handling the case is unable \n     to proceed in a timely manner. The IRS could be required to \n     provide information on the number of cases in which there is \n     interest abatement each year in the report.\n\n\n                            Effective dates\n\n       We propose the following effective dates for specific \n     provisions. These dates are driven by the capacity of our \n     information technology systems, not the impact of the policy. \n     Some of these provisions would be fairly easy to implement, \n     but in total--and in conjunction with all the other demands \n     on our information technology resources--it is simply not \n     feasible to implement them until the dates proposed. If the \n     situation changes, we will strive to implement the provisions \n     sooner.\n       The effective date for many of these changes is January 31, \n     2000. Given that all of these changes must be made compatible \n     with the Century Date Change, we believe we will need the \n     month of January 2000 to ensure all the Century Date Changes \n     are successful before implementing the provisions listed \n     below.\n       Allow the taxpayers to designate deposits for each payroll \n     period rather than using the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method \n     that results in cascading penalties. Effective immediately \n     for taxpayers making the designation at time of deposit. \n     Effective July 31, 2000 for taxpayers making the designation \n     after deposit.\n       Overhaul the innocent spouse relief requirements and \n     replace with proportionate liability, etc. Effective date: \n     July 31, 2000. The IRS has no way of administering \n     proportionate liability with our current systems. This \n     provision would require significant complex changes to our \n     systems and is likely to be cumbersome and error-prone for \n     both taxpayers and the IRS.\n       Require each notice of penalty to include a computation of \n     penalty. Effective date: Notices issued more than 180 days \n     after date of enactment.\n       Develop procedures for alternative to written signature for \n     electronic filing. The IRS is already preparing a pilot \n     project for filing season 1999. Subsequent roll out of \n     alternatives to written signatures for electronic filing will \n     depend on the success of the pilot.\n       Develop procedures for a return-free tax system for \n     appropriate individuals. This provision should be interpreted \n     as a study of the requirements of a return-free tax system \n     and the target segment of taxpayers. Actual implementation \n     will be based on the findings and conclusions of the study.\n       Increase the interest rate on overpayments for non-\n     corporate taxpayers from the federal short-term interest +2% \n     to +3%. Effective date: July 31, 1999.\n       Do not impose the failure to pay penalty while the taxpayer \n     is in an installment agreement. Effective date: January 31, \n     2000.\n       Require the IRS to provide notice of the taxpayer's rights \n     (if the IRS requests an extension of the statute of \n     limitations). Require Treasury IG to track. Effective date: \n     January 31, 2000.\n       Require IRS to provide on each deficiency notice the date \n     the IRS determines is the last day for the taxpayer to file a \n     tax court opinion. A petition filed by the specified date \n     would be deemed timely filed. Effective date: January 31, \n     2000.\n       Require the Treasury IG to certify that the IRS notifies \n     taxpayers of amount collected from a former spouse. Effective \n     date: January 31, 2000.\n       Require the IRS to provide notice to the taxpayer 30 days \n     (90 days in the case of life insurance) before the IRS liens, \n     levies, or seizes a taxpayer's property. Effective date: 30 \n     days after date of enactment for seizures; January 31, 2000 \n     for liens and levies.\n       Require the IRS to immediately release a levy upon \n     agreement that the amount is ``currently not collectible.'' \n     Effective date: January 31, 2000.\n       Waive the 10% addition to tax for early withdrawal from an \n     IRA or other qualified plan if the IRS levies. Effective \n     date: January 31, 2000.\n       The taxpayer would have 30 days to request a hearing with \n     IRS Appeals. No collection activity (other than jeopardy \n     situations) would be allowed until after the hearing. The \n     taxpayer could raise any issue as to why collection should \n     not be continued. Effective date: January 31, 2000.\n       IRS to implement approval process for liens, levies, and \n     seizures. Effective date: implement procedures manually 60 \n     days after\n\n[[Page S4386]]\n\n     date of enactment; implement system for IG tracking and \n     reporting January 31, 2000.\n       The following items were proposed in the Administration's \n     FY 1999 Budget. In conjunction with the other proposals in \n     this bill, they will also require significant systems \n     changes:\n       Eliminate the interest rate differential on overlapping \n     periods of interest on income tax overpayments and \n     underpayments.\n       Prohibit the IRS from collecting a tax liability by levy \n     if: (1) an offer-in-compromise is being processed; (2) within \n     30 days following rejection of an offer; and (3) during \n     appeal of a rejection of an offer.\n       Suspend collection of a levy during refund suit.\n       Allow equitable tolling of the statute of limitations on \n     filing a refund claim for the period of time a taxpayer is \n     unable to manage his affairs due to a physical or mental \n     disability that is expected to result in death or last more \n     than 12 months. Tolling would not apply if someone was \n     authorized to act on these taxpayers' behalf on financial \n     affairs.\n       Ensure availability of installment agreements if the \n     liability is $10,000 or less.\n       Finally, we would attempt to immediately implement the \n     cataloging of taxpayer complaints of employee misconduct and \n     would stop any further designation of ``illegal tax \n     protesters.'' However, there may be some systems issues with \n     regard to these proposals that could delay certain changes \n     until some time in early 1999.\n       I look forward to working with you, the Finance Committee, \n     and the Congress as we strive to restructure the Internal \n     Revenue Service.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles O. Rossotti.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Our amendment includes something that I urge my \ncolleagues to consider. My hope is Senator Moynihan will offer this as \na free-standing amendment later. Mr. Rossotti, quite appropriately, \nsays we have about 600 days before the 31st of December 1999. No one is \nmore eloquent than the Senator from Utah, Senator Bennett, talking \nabout the problems that the year 2000 is going to create as a \nconsequence of having to rewrite all of our computer codes. The \ncomputers will think it is the year 1900 and everything is going to end \nup getting shut down, a huge problem for the IRS. Mr. Rossotti is very \nmuch worried. Right now the IRS is a bit behind. He sent us a letter \nasking us to delay some of these provisions.\n  We have not been able to get these scored yet from Joint Tax. I \nregret that. It takes a little longer out of Joint Tax than we would \nlike. We will get that scored before we are through with this debate \nand we will be able to reduce some of the offsets in other areas. But I \nam urging Members have an opportunity to put themselves on the side of \nhonoring the request of Mr. Rossotti, who is saying we are not going to \nbe able to meet that year 2000 problem if a whole series of additional \nthings are imposed upon us that we have to do.\n  Understand, we pass the law but the IRS has to implement it. We \nchange the law, whether it is a Tax Code or some other area of the tax \nlaw, and the IRS is the one that has to organize human beings to get \nthe job done.\n  We have an offset in here that has been endorsed by the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee. We have an offset that does not have us saying to \npeople with retirement incomes over $100,000 a year here is a way for \nyou to shelter that income for your heirs. And we have a provision in \nhere that enables Senators to say we have taken a step to make certain \nthat at least the IRS is not, in the year 2000, going to cause all \nkinds of additional hardships to the American taxpayers as a \nconsequence of not having their computer system and their software Y2K \ncompliant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, No. 1, for recognizing \nme, but more importantly for supporting the provision that we should \nnot use these environmental income taxes, and oil and chemical excise \ntaxes, for anything but Superfund. I know it was a difficult decision. \nI support the Senator fully on the IRS reform which he has done such a \ntremendous job on, and on which he has exerted such great leadership. I \ncommend him for understanding, also, there is another issue here with \nSuperfund.\n  This, essentially, with the greatest respect to my colleague from \nNebraska, will just totally destroy the Superfund reform that we have \nworked on for some 3\\1/2\\ years. In order to make the things happen \nthat we need to make happen in the Superfund Program, these taxes would \nhave to be reinstituted and used strictly and exclusively for the \nSuperfund Program. So I vehemently oppose the Kerrey amendment.\n  I am certain the majority of this body, and I think the majority of \nthe American people agree that IRS and Superfund have a similarity. \nThey are both badly broken. They both need to be fixed. But they don't \nhave to go against each other to do that. These are two separate and \ndistinct issues.\n\n  I support the IRS reform the distinguished chairman is pursuing and I \nalso support reforming the Superfund Program. It is inappropriate to \nutilize Superfund taxes to pay for the cost of IRS. Superfund taxes \nshould be used to fix Superfund.\n  For those who have been anxiously waiting for the reform of the \nprogram, help is on the way, I hope, if the Senate will be supportive. \nWorking with the distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee who is on the floor, Senator Chafee, and through his \nleadership we were able to pass a bill out of committee. I am hopeful \nthe majority of our colleagues will allow that bill to be brought to \nthe floor and fully debated. Within the next few days the committee's \nreport will be complete. There are differences on the bill. But I think \nclearly no one should be of the opinion that we should use Superfund \ntaxes; that is, the environmental income tax and the oil and chemical \nexcise tax, for anything other than to reform that program.\n  I don't want to get into a full debate now on the problems associated \nwith Superfund. I will have that opportunity when we get the bill to \nthe floor. But I just want to say, when Congress established this \nprogram in 1980, the consensus was it would take a few billion dollars \nto clean up what we thought were around 400 sites. In order to fund \nthis program, revenues were collected through these taxes. We \nreauthorized the program in 1986, extending the taxing authority. What \nhas happened is we spent $20 billion of taxpayers' money and we have \nonly cleaned up about 160 sites; that is 160 sites were removed from \nthe NPL.\n  These folks who pay the environmental income taxes, who pay the oil \nand chemical excise taxes, rightfully say this program isn't working. \nWe are paying all this tax money and it is going to lawyers and it is \nbeing wasted and we are not cleaning up sites. Our Superfund bill \nclearly expedites cleanup, gets the money away from lawyers and towards \ncleanup. To take that money away from this program and provide it for \nsome other use is simply unconscionable. Although maybe well intended, \nit is a serious mistake in terms of the bipartisan consensus that we \nhave to fix a broken program.\n  So I am hopeful--I wish the Senator would reconsider his amendment \nand I hope this will be defeated.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. First of all, as to ``unconscionable,'' we are just \nfollowing the lead of the chairman of the Budget Committee who \napparently is unconscionable as well. He had the same proposal in his \nbudget.\n  Second, let me say this is not to fund the operation of the IRS. This \nbasically funds a tax cut. That is what we are talking about. We have \nnew innocent spouse provisions in this bill and a burden of proof shift \nthat will result in a reduction of taxes of some American taxpayers. \nThat is what this pay-for is set up to do.\n  Let me say these taxes are not imposed until the year 2002. This \ngives the Environment and Public Works Committee nearly 3 additional \nyears. They had 3\\1/2\\ years now already since this bill expired. My \npresumption is 3 years is plenty. I can find an additional offset, \nperhaps, and push it back to 2003 if you want an additional year to get \nthis bill authorized.\n  This takes care of a second 5-year problem. Again, I say to \ncolleagues, we are having to deal with this because the Finance \nCommittee decided to spend $9 billion more, and that $9 billion is \nbeing spent to reduce some people's taxes who are going to pay higher\n\n[[Page S4387]]\n\ntaxes as a result of the innocent spouse provision and the burden-of-\nproof issue.\n  We are reducing taxes in one area and we have to find an offset. It \nseems to me, Mr. President, that Senator Domenici's recommendation is \ncorrect. By delaying this until 2002, we take away the argument the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire had about destroying the \nSuperfund Program. This gives the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee 3\\1/2\\ years to finish their job.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of our \nFinance Committee for yielding me some time on this matter.\n  I rise to oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from Nebraska. \nThis amendment offers the Senate an alternative to the Finance \nCommittee's plan to pay for the tax relief provided in the IRS reform \nbill, but the reality is that the Kerrey amendment would prevent \nmeaningful Superfund reform. The amendment, I believe strongly, should \nbe rejected.\n  I oppose this amendment, obviously, but let me tell you what I do \nsupport. I support reimposition of the Superfund taxes. I also support \nreasonable Superfund reform. We will need to reimpose the three \nSuperfund taxes--namely, the corporate environmental income tax, the \nexcise taxes on crude oil and the excise tax on chemical feedstock--to \nprovide the revenue to pay for a fairer Superfund Program.\n  Why do I keep talking about Superfund? Mr. President, the Committee \non Environment and Public Works reported a Superfund bill to the floor \n6 weeks ago. Just yesterday, the committee received CBO's estimate on \nthe bill. As we expected, we will need to reimpose the Superfund taxes \nin order to pay for the Superfund reforms and the Superfund \nreauthorization. In other words, if we gobble up this money now in \nconnection with the IRS reforms, the money won't be there for the \nSuperfund bill which we are moving along now and which has used in the \npast these very funds; in other words, these are Superfund taxes.\n  The Kerrey amendment, if adopted, would prevent meaningful reform of \nthe Superfund Program. I could discuss at length the numerous problems \nthat plague Superfund. There is no question it has a lot of \ndifficulties. I am prepared to explain the solutions we propose in our \ncomprehensive Superfund bill that is on the floor now, but it is not \nnecessary to do that today.\n  While the Environment and Public Works Committee reported our \nSuperfund bill on an 11-to-7 vote--there are 18 members of our \ncommittee, 10 Republicans and 8 Democrats--the bill was reported out in \nreally a nearly partisan vote by 11 to 7 with only one Democratic \nSenator in support. However, there is bipartisan consensus that the \nSuperfund has to be reformed.\n  There wasn't, obviously, agreement with the way the Republicans on \nthe committee wanted to proceed, but, nonetheless, there is agreement \nthat the Superfund legislation needs to be reformed. Indeed, I see the \nranking member of the committee now, and he devoted many hours of his \ntime to this effort for reform.\n\n  He also knows it will be necessary to offset the spending in any \nSuperfund reform by reimposing these Superfund taxes. This was the case \nwhen Senator Baucus chaired the committee and reported a Superfund bill \nin 1994, and it still remains the case today. If we are going to have \nSuperfund reform, we are going to need these moneys that now are \napparently being seized or attempting to be seized by Senator Kerrey to \nuse for this other purpose; namely, the IRS changes.\n  The Kerrey amendment would preclude any meaningful reform of the \nSuperfund Program. In other words, how are we going to pay for the \nthing? We wouldn't be able to if this Kerrey amendment is adopted.\n  The real issue before us is whether the Senate wants to abandon \nSuperfund reform. If we do, then go ahead and vote for the Kerrey \namendment. If you don't, if you want Superfund to take place and do \nsomething about the brownfields redevelopment, for example, we have to \nhave these moneys. There aren't other revenues around that we can use. \nThe Kerrey amendment would preempt reform. The amendment would \nfrustrate any Superfund reform efforts. I believe it is bad public \npolicy to take these taxes and use them to pay for tax relief in the \nabsence of Superfund reform.\n  Mr. President, I strongly hope this amendment will be rejected and \nthat we can all agree we are saving these Superfund taxes. They will \nhave to be reimposed at sometime when we get a reauthorization of the \nSuperfund legislation, but let's save them for that purpose, the \npurpose they have been used for in the past and the purpose I believe \nthey should be used for in the future.\n  I thank the Chair, and I urge my colleagues to support the Roth \namendment and to reject the Kerrey amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield such time as necessary to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nebraska.\n  I strongly support the Kerrey amendment for several reasons. First, \nthe funding mechanism provided for in the manager's amendment to the \nunderlying bill, while creative and it meets the technical requirements \nof the budget rules, it is also very misleading. The rollover \nprovisions in the managers' amendment do raise $8 billion in the first \n5 years that the provision will be in effect, but that same provision \nloses $7 billion in the second 5 years--a clear revenue loss.\n  Here we are in the underlying amendment saying, ``OK, early on, we'll \nraise the revenue,'' but we don't tell the rest of the world, \nparticularly the Congress and Senators who are voting on this, that we \nare going to lose $7 billion in the next 5 years.\n  Part of our efforts in the Congress, I hope, have been truth in \nbudgeting not just in the first 5 years, but also beyond, in the next 5 \nyears. Too often, this Congress has, unfortunately, hoodwinked people--\nthe President has been part of it, both administrations, in the last 10 \nto 15 years--by saying, ``OK, we will meet the budget requirements in \nthe first 5 years, but we won't tell everybody what we are doing in the \nnext 5 years,'' and often in the next 5 years, if not disastrous, it is \ninimical to the American people because it tends to increase deficits \nrather than decrease. That is a fact. To the credit of this \nadministration, it has tried to be truthful not only in the first 5 \nyears, but also the next 5 years, and so has the Congress.\n  Here we are with an underlying amendment which goes totally against \nthat effort on the part of good, solid statesmanlike Senators to be \ntruthful not only in the first 5 years, but the next 5 years.\n  This amendment increases the deficit because it costs $7 billion more \nin the next 5 years. That is not right. We shouldn't be doing that. \nThat is what this amendment does. This is a gimmick. It is purely and \nsimply a gimmick, and that is why it is a bad idea.\n  The Kerrey amendment, on the other hand, raises revenue in several \nways. One is by postponing some of the effective dates of the \nprovisions. Why is that important? Not only because it raises revenue, \nthat is only of minor importance, but the major reason is because we \nall know, Mr. President, this country faces a massive problem in the \nnext year or two with the fancy term Y2K. It is computer conversion to \nthe next millennium.\n  We know that most computers in our country, whether it is in the IRS, \nwhether it is in the companies, have a system where they have two \ndigits for the date, two digits for the month, and two digits for the \nyear. What is today? Today is May 6, 1998. So it would be 05-06-98.\n  That is how the computers record today's date. All computers do that. \nSo we get to December 1999--12-30-99, 12-31-99, and next is 01-01-00. \nNow, we like to think that is January 1, 2000, but most computers today \nwill record that as January 1, 1900, because two zeros are treated as \n1900, not 2000. Massive problems.\n\n[[Page S4388]]\n\n  It is going to cost the IRS, to convert these computers just to meet \nthis conversion problem, $1 billion--$1 billion just to convert. That \nis to say nothing of all the other costs to comply with new changes in \nthe law.\n  So the Kerrey amendment is very, very logical. It is safe. Maybe a \nlittle on the conservative side. It says, let us delay the effective \ndates of some of these new provisions. Why? Because we do not want to \nfurther complicate the conversion problem.\n  This IRS restructuring bill is going to further complicate the \nconversion problem--further complicate it--not lessen, but further \ncomplicate it. So Senator Kerrey says, well, let us not do the gimmick, \nlet us delay the effective date a little bit, and let us also delay the \neffective date to take care of the Y2K problem, the conversion problem.\n  The underlying amendment, the manager's amendment--I have the highest \nregard for my friend from Delaware, the chairman of the committee--does \nnot delay, therefore, further causes a problem for the IRS to convert \nand is much more expensive. It also comes up with a way to get revenue, \nwhich is a gimmick.\n  Some on the floor have said that extending the Superfund tax will \nprevent the enactment of Superfund. That is not true, just basically is \nnot true. What is the advantage of using the extension of the Superfund \ntax? I will give you several.\n  One, it is not a gimmick. It is straight. It is right there. People \nknow what it is. It is not a gimmick. Second, it is a tax that \neverybody knows about, is comfortable with. Sure, it expired a couple \nyears ago, but everybody knows who pays the tax, what the tax is; and \nit would be extended I think to the year 2000, which means that the \nrevenue is there.\n  Let us say Congress does enact Superfund. And I sure hope it does. I \nsay, Mr. President, we have been working on Superfund for a long time. \nLet us say we enact Superfund. I hope we do. That does not mean it \ncannot be enacted because previously we extended the Superfund tax. Not \nat all. The Superfund tax we talk about here is not offset against the \nSuperfund. It is not offset against--it is there. It is revenue and \nheld in a pot to pay for the bill.\n  We can still enact Superfund. And, frankly, the underlying tax bill \nstill pays part of Superfund. The Superfund bill will still go to the \nFinance Committee. The Finance Committee is pretty creative in figuring \nout ways to find the additional revenue, which will not be very much, \nbasically to pay for the orphan share, the effect of the later date. \nThere is no rocket science in the choice of the standards we have \nbefore us.\n  On the one hand it is the underlying amendment, which is a gimmick, \nwhich is deceiving the taxpayers, which will require this body to come \nup with $7 billion more revenue than otherwise is the case because we \nare widening the budget deficit, not decreasing it in the second 5 \nyears.\n  Also, on that amendment--let me say it again. First is the underlying \namendment. It further complicates the conversion problem. It is a \ngimmick. That is one choice. The other choice is to enact a revenue \nmeasure which is not a gimmick and which will not further complicate \nthe conversion problem. That is the case.\n\n  Mr. President, I think the choice is pretty simple. I think it is \npretty straightforward. I think, accordingly, we should put politics \naside. I know the majority party is going to vote for the amendment \nbecause that is what they are told to do. That is the drill. You vote \nfor that one. But if you step back and think a little bit about what is \nreally going on here, I hope both parties can find a way to come \ntogether, find a way not to further complicate the conversion problem \nand to pass a revenue-raising measure that is not a gimmick.\n  Believe me, Mr. President, the Kerrey amendment is certainly the \nbeginnings of that. Maybe with further modifications we can come \ntogether to finally get this thing passed.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, I want to make it clear again what we are doing here. We are \ntrying to come up with an offset for $9 billion worth of additional \ncost that the Senate bill has that the House bill does not. It is $9 \nbillion worth of additional loss of revenue, $9 billion of loss of \nrevenue that occurs as a consequence of changes that we are making in \nthe tax law. Somebody will pay less taxes. That is essentially what \nthis amounts to.\n  Mr. President, we tried to ascertain who was going to benefit from \nthese changes. I think it is very important as we look at our tax law \nthat we ask ourselves--since the vast majority of our taxes come from \nmiddle-income Americans and there is a significant concern on their \npart as to whether or not they are paying their fair share, we tried to \nget some distributional analysis on this thing to find out who is going \nto benefit from the innocent spouse provisions, the burden of proof \nshifts, and the Tax Court. Not many Americans go to Tax Court. There is \na provision in here as well that has to do with interest being \naccumulated.\n  Unfortunately, Joint Tax was not able to give us a distributional \nanalysis. So we are flying a little bit blind and not able to describe \nwho is going to benefit from these provisions. The underlying issue for \nus, though, is we now have to find $9 billion.\n  We have a proposal. Chairman Roth has a proposal. I alert colleagues, \nby the way, what I think will likely happen. My guess is the majority \nwill all vote for the Roth amendment and that will pass. And if it does \npass, I will not insist on a rollcall vote on the alternative \namendment. There are other alternatives that we can come up with.\n  The baseline question is going to be for us, after the Roth amendment \nis accepted: How comfortable do you feel with the provisions in it? So, \nyou will have rejected the alternative amendment, fine. Let us reject \nthe alternative amendment. But remember this: This law now is going to \ncontain a provision in there that is going to do something for certain \ntaxpayers. Approximately 170,000 taxpayers will be affected by this \nprovision in the law.\n  How will they be affected? That is the question we have to ask \nourselves. The answer is, they are going to be entitled to pay more \ntaxes early on, approximately--the estimate is $47,000 per taxpayer. \nThey will pay about $8 billion total. And then they will not pay any \ntaxes in the outyears. When they convert, they will not pay any taxes. \nWe are trying to ascertain what the outyear costs are going to be for \nthis program, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a response from Joint Tax to this \nquestion be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 1998.\n     To: Mark Patterson.\n     From: Lindy L. Paull.\n     Subject: Revenue Request.\n       This is in response to your telephone request of May 5, \n     1998, for a revenue estimate of a proposal which would expand \n     the eligibility for conversions to Roth individual retirement \n     arrangements (``IRAs'')\n       Under present law, uniform minimum distribution rules \n     generally apply to all types of tax-favored retirement \n     vehicles, including qualified retirement plans and annuities, \n     IRAs other than Roth IRAs, and tax-sheltered annuities (sec \n     403(b)).\n       Distributions are required to begin no later than the \n     participant's required beginning date (sec. 401(a)(9)). The \n     required beginning date means April 1 of the calendar year \n     following the later of (1) the calendar year in which the \n     employee attains age 70\\1/2\\, or (2) the calendar year in \n     which the employee retires. In the case of an employee who is \n     a 5-percent owner (as defined in section 416), the required \n     beginning date is April 1 of the calendar year following the \n     calendar year the employee attains age 70\\1/2\\. the Internal \n     Revenue Service has issued extensive regulations for purposes \n     of calculating minimum distributions. In general, minimum \n     distributions are includible in gross income in the year of \n     distribution.\n       Under present law, all or any part of amounts in a \n     deductible or nondeductible IRA may be coverted into a Roth \n     IRA. Only taxpayers with adjusted gross income (``AGI'') of \n     $100,000 or less are eligible to convert an IRA into a Roth \n     IRA. In the case of a married taxpayer, AGI is the combined \n     AGI of the couple. Married taxpayers filing a separate return \n     are not eligible to make a conversion.\n       If a taxpayer is required to take a minimum required \n     distribution from an IRA for a year, the amount of the \n     required distribution\n\n[[Page S4389]]\n\n     is includible in gross income, and cannot be rolled over into \n     a Roth IRA.\n       The proposal would modify the definition of AGI to exclude \n     the required minimum distribution from the taxpayer's AGI for \n     the year of the conversion for purposes of determining \n     eligibility to convert from an IRA to a Roth IRA. The \n     required minimum distribution would not be eligible for \n     conversion.\n       The proposal would be effective for years beginning after \n     December 31, 1997. We estimate that the proposal would change \n     Federal fiscal year budget receipts as follows:\nFiscal Years:                                                  Billions\n    1998............................................................(*)\n    1999...........................................................$2.6\n    2000............................................................3.1\n    2001............................................................3.1\n    2002...........................................................-0.9\n    2003...........................................................-1.0\n    2004...........................................................-1.2\n    2005...........................................................-1.4\n    2006...........................................................-1.5\n    2007...........................................................-1.7\n    1998-2002.......................................................7.8\n    1998-2007.......................................................1.1\n\n(*) Gain of less than $50 million.\n\nNote: Details do not add to totals due to rounding.\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 1998.\n     To: Nick Giordano and Maury Passman.\n     From: Lindy L. Paull.\n     Subject: Request for Distributional Effects.\n       This is in response to your request dated April 23, 1998, \n     for the distributional effects of provisions contained in \n     H.R. 2676, the ``Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and \n     Reform Act of 1998'' relating to: (1) the burden of proof; \n     (2) innocent spouse relief; and (3) the suspension of accrual \n     of interest and penalties if the Internal Revenue Service \n     (``IRS'') fails to contact the taxpayer within 12 months \n     after a timely filed return.\n       We can not provide analyses of the distributional effects \n     of these types of proposals. In general, the information used \n     to prepare estimates for these types of proposals does not \n     come from statistical samples of taxpayer return information, \n     but from various operational data bases within the IRS \n     collectively referred to as administrative data. \n     Administrative data does not contain the type of taxpayer \n     income information necessary to prepare a distributional \n     analysis. Moreover, often the data are in an aggregate form \n     so that individual taxpayers can not be identified. As a \n     result, there would be an enormous amount of uncertainty \n     involved in characterizing the income distribution of \n     taxpayers contained in this type of data. Should you wish to \n     discuss this request any further, please feel free to contact \n     me.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, what happens is that in the first 5 years \nthat this provision is in effect, Joint Tax is estimating there will be \n$2.6 billion of additional revenue coming in year 1; $3.1 billion in \nyear 2; $3.1 billion in year 3. Americans with incomes over $100,000, \nwho are 70.5 years of age or older, $100,000 of retirement income or \nmore, they will be converting existing accounts into Roth IRA accounts, \nand paying, on average, $47,000 for the privilege of doing that. In the \nyear 2002, we will lose $1 billion; in 2003, we will lose $1 billion; \nin 2004, it goes to $1.2 billion we lose; in 2005, we lose $1.4 \nbillion; in 2006, we lose $1.5 billion; and in 2007, we lose $1.7 \nbillion. The trend line is up.\n  I remind my colleagues, in the year 2010, we will see the beginnings \nof the retirement of 77 million Americans called baby boomers. If you \nlook at the cost, the outyear cost of our mandatory programs, you can \nsee clearly what is going to happen.\n  In order to fund a tax cut for Americans who have $100,000 a year of \nretirement income and up, because their heirs or whoever is converting \nand not going to pay any taxes on this income, in order to fund a \ngrowing tax cut for these individuals, we are going to be cutting \nprograms for middle-income Americans. It is an inescapable thing that \nwe will be facing.\n  So, again, I want my colleagues to understand, issue No. 1 is, do you \nwant to spend another $9 billion to reduce the taxes of Americans who \nhave been affected by innocent spouses who go to Tax Court or who have \nother problems that are identified in this bill? If the answer is yes, \nthen you have to find an offset. And what we have is the chairman's \nproposal to reduce the taxes of upper-income Americans, or more likely \ntheir heirs, at some point out in the future, and that point is the \nvery point when our mandatory programs are going to be squeezing all of \nour discretionary programs even worse than they are today.\n  My expectation is the majority will come down and vote for the \namendment that the Senator from Delaware has offered, the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee. As I said, I will not insist on a rollcall vote \non ours.\n  Colleagues, I hope both Republican and Democrats will look at this \npay-for. It will not be too late for us to change it. We can still \nchange it on this floor. We can change it in conference. I don't think \nwhen you examine the details of this pay-for that you will be very \ncomfortable going home to Nebraska or other States, first of all, \nfinding somebody who has over $100,000 worth of retirement income and \nsaying, ``Congratulations, your heirs won't pay any taxes on whatever \nasset you convert to a Roth IRA.''\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERREY. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I venture to say most Members of the Senate are not very \nfamiliar with this issue because the bill was brought to the floor and \na mechanism to pay-for--it is brought to the floor this morning; I \nguess it was disclosed yesterday.\n  As I looked at it, it seems to me it is exactly as the Senator from \nNebraska described. But even more than that, it is a device by which \nyou bring some money here and say this is really paid for but. In fact, \nthe cost in the outyears is very substantial.\n  It is just a timing issue, kind of a clever timing issue, but in my \njudgment not a very thoughtful way to do this bill.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator from North Dakota is exactly right.\n  I hope colleagues will look at this letter from the Joint Tax \nCommittee. This is the tip of the iceberg. The tax only scores 10 years \nout. They are saying, yes, Americans with over $100,000 in retirement \nincome converting to a Roth IRA pay $47,000 in taxes each, and that \nwill add to $2.6 billion by year 1, 2, 3, but after that it starts to \ncost more and more money as the individuals convert and don't pay any \ntax on their income. That is basically what will happen--and it grows.\n  I say to the Senator from North Dakota, not only are you exactly \nright, but in the fourth year it costs $900 million and in the 10th \nyear it is $1.7 billion. It is going up. This is less taxes that upper-\nincome Americans will pay on these retirement accounts. As I said, it \nis apt to be the heirs.\n  Who will pick up the slack? We know who will pick up the slack. If \nthis amendment is accepted, which I suspect it will, I hope colleagues \nwill look at the details of it. If you want to spend another $9 million \nin the second 5 years to pay for all the things that we added in the \nSenate Finance Committee, most of which are good and reasonable, if you \nwant to add those provisions, the question is how will you pay for it. \nMy hope is that we will find an alternative to this.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield, I think I understood the \nSenator to say you were not able to get any burden tables or \ndistribution tables to determine who gets the benefit of this proposal. \nThat is troublesome because when ideas are brought to the floor as late \nas this, you are unable to get information about who this is going to \nbenefit and how.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator is right.\n  Title 3 of the bill is called the taxpayer rights provision. I worked \nvery hard on those provisions. We extended lots of new taxpayer rights. \nIn the bill that Senator Grassley and I introduced in the Finance \nCommittee--and I voted for it--we added some additional rights.\n  The problem is we don't know who will benefit from those tax \nreductions. We know three principal provisions cost us money. One is \nthe shifting of burden of proof in Tax Court. For citizens, they need \nto ask themselves, do they go to Tax Court? If they don't go to Tax \nCourt and don't have the experience on a regular basis in Tax Court, \nthey will not bill.\n  The second provision is called innocent spouse relief. They have to \nask, will that affect me? Seventy percent of Nebraskans do not itemize \ntheir deductions. They will not be impacted by the second one.\n  The third one, the suspension of the accrual of interest and \npenalties if the IRS fails to contact the taxpayer within 12 months \nafter a timely filed return. Again, ask yourself who will be affected \nby this? We were unable, I regret, to get from the Joint Tax Committee \nan answer to that. We don't know who will benefit from those three \nadditional provisions, but that is what is costing us the money. That \nis why we have to find some kind of an offset.\n\n[[Page S4390]]\n\n  As I said, I understand the die is likely to be cast and we will \nprobably have 55 votes for the Roth amendment and 45 votes against. I \nwill not ask for a rollcall vote on our alternative, but I appeal both \nto Republicans and Democrats on the floor to examine what it is we are \nabout to do and ask ourselves, do we want to open up a hole in revenue \nin the outyears as a consequence of these conversions that will benefit \na relatively small number of Americans who have retirement income in \nexcess of $100,000 a year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nDelaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2339\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, Alan Greenspan says \nthat America's most important economic problem is its low savings rate. \nWith that, I agree. As a practical matter, I have done my very best the \nlast several years to try to build the kind of incentives into the tax \npicture that would promote savings on the part of the American people. \nThe rollover provision in this amendment is a small step toward \nresolving our No. 1 economic problem.\n  Just let me point out what we are saying. What we are proposing is \nletting older people keep the money that they have saved. We are not \nasking them to do anything that others are not able to do. As a \npractical matter, the way the system now works, it discriminates \nagainst the older people. The problem is that if you are under the age \nof 70\\1/2\\, there is no requirement that you make withdrawals from your \nIRA. It is only when you reach 70\\1/2\\ that you are required to do so \nunder the deductible IRA. So there is a built-in discrimination against \nthe senior citizens. I think that is wrong.\n  Again, let me emphasize what we are talking about. What we are \nproposing is to treat these older Americans, those that are over 70\\1/\n2\\, to have the same kind of treatment as those that are younger than \n70\\1/2\\. As I said, if you are under 70\\1/2\\ there is no requirement of \nwithdrawals, and of course the basic problem is that if you have income \nin excess of $100,000 you are not entitled to this benefit.\n  Let me correct one further point that has been made. My distinguished \nfriend and colleague, Senator Kerrey, has said that the purpose of the \nIRA rollover provision is to allow heirs to escape payment of estate \ntaxes. That is just not the case. If the IRA is part of the estate, \nthen the individual who passes on is subject to the estate tax. If he \nor she tries to give it during the lifetime to someone else, and it is \na permanent irrevocable gift, then it is subject to the gift tax. So \nthere is no escaping of estate taxes by this provision.\n  Let me just say, as we all know, the Roth IRA has become a very \npopular savings vehicle. A taxpayer, as I said, who has a regular IRA \nmay convert their regular IRA into a Roth IRA as long as the taxpayer \nand the taxpayer's spouse have adjusted income of $100,000 or less. \nAgain, let me repeat, older Americans are now required to receive \nminimum distribution from their regular IRA on an annual basis \nbeginning in the year following the year they attain the age of 70\\1/\n2\\. Those required distributions must be counted, under current law, as \npart of the older taxpayer-adjusted gross income, which in some \ninstances will cause these older Americans to become ineligible to roll \nover their IRAs.\n  My amendment gives these older taxpayers the opportunity to roll over \ntheir IRAs into Roth IRAs by not counting these required minimum \ndistributions toward $100,000 adjusted growth income.\n  It is only fair, in my judgment, that these older taxpayers are given \nthe same ability to roll over their IRAs and not be penalized because \nthey must take distribution from their regular IRA solely because of \ntheir age.\n  Let's be clear here, the revenue cost by this provision comes from \ntaxpayers who will pay tax on their regular IRA when they convert to \nthe Roth IRA. These conversions are entirely voluntary on the part of \nthe taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Members of this distinguished body to \nsupport the Roth amendment because I think it brings equity into the \npicture and only treats the senior citizens the same as the younger.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, as I said, the die is cast on this thing. \nThis amendment is going to be accepted. The question is, Will we have \nany reexamination moment? We will reexamine what we are about to do?\n  Again, this affects people with incomes over $100,000 in retirement \nincome. To get $100,000 in retirement income, I am probably going to \nhave to have a million or more dollars in liquid assets that are \nearning this income. I would probably have tax-exempt bonds that I own \nas well. This is a very select group of people. We are not penalizing \nthem; we are treating them like everybody else. I am capable of feeling \nsympathy for low- and moderate-income seniors who are struggling to pay \nfor health care bills, and about making certain that Americans have the \nopportunity to save. But we are not helping Americans who are \nstruggling to save with this. These are Americans who have accumulated \na substantial amount of wealth.\n  If we want to help struggling Americans, we ought to cut the payroll \ntax, as Senator Moynihan is proposing, giving Americans an $800 billion \ncut in taxes; that would go immediately into savings. That is exciting \nto me. And 98.5 percent of Americans die with estates under $600,000. \nWe are talking about 1.5 percent of the American people who have \nestates over $600,000. You have to have an estate over a million \ndollars in order to generate $100,000 worth of income.\n  Please don't tell me that tax lawyers and tax advisers can't figure \nout a way to transfer this to your heirs. If that assertion is made by \na colleague, let's bring a tax adviser in before one of our committees \nand ask them. It darn sure can, and they darn sure will.\n  This provides a benefit for a very small amount of Americans, and, \nfrankly, it is very difficult to make the case that they need a \nbenefit. They are not treating them in a fashion that is equal; they \nare treating them unequally with other Americans who are in the \nworkforce and might be looking to retirement accounts as well.\n  Mr. President, this pay-for ought to be rejected by this body; it is \ngoing to be accepted nonetheless. I hope we have some ``morning after'' \ndoubts about this, after examining whom it is going to benefit and the \ndilemma it will pose to us down the road. I don't know how many in this \nbody expect to be here 6, 7, 8 years from now, but if you are here, one \nof the questions you are going to have to answer is: Why did you give \naway $2 billion a year back in 1998 to less than 1 percent of the \nAmerican public, who are not struggling, who are not foraging in the \nalley for food, and they are not trying to figure out how to make ends \nmeet? They will use this change in the law to transfer an asset to \nheirs, and their heirs won't pay any taxes as a consequence.\n  Mr. President, as I say, I know when it is time, if not to accept \ndefeat, to acknowledge it. I expect 55 Republican votes for this \namendment. I do not intend to ask for a rollcall vote on the \nsubstitute, but I hope my colleagues, as they begin to examine what \nthis amendment does, will ask that we come back and revisit the pay-for \nfor the second 5 years.\n  I yield back whatever time I have.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2340, As modified\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, as I indicated earlier, I have to ask for \none modification. It is a date on page 2, line 2. In the earlier \nunanimous consent request, I indicated that I might need to modify our \namendment.\n  I send the modified amendment to the desk, as described.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand that Senator Kohl wishes a few \nminutes on another matter.\n  Whatever remaining time remains under our request, I ask that the \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, have the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Thank you, Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the IRS Reform bill. \nThere is no doubt that this bill will count among the most important \npieces of legislation that we will pass in the 105th Congress. A great \ndeal of thanks and appreciation is due to Senators Roth and Moynihan \nfor their work sheperding this bill through the Finance Committee, and \nmost especially to my friend from Nebraska, Senator Bob Kerrey, whose \nefforts on the Restructuring Commission and tireless advocacy brought \nus here today.\n  We have all been struck by the stories of abuse of taxpayers by \noverzealous or self-serving IRS employees. And all of us have received \ncalls of concern and outrage from constituents who feel they have been \ntreated unfairly by an agency that wields a tremendous amount of power \nin the daily lives of Americans.\n  We have also learned of retaliation against honest IRS employees who \nworked hard and wanted to do the right thing by speaking out against \nabuses. This legislation will go a long way towards addressing these \nproblems.\n  It will also go a long way toward making the agency more effective in \nits policy mission and more responsive to budget constraints. We have \nall witnessed the $4 billion debacle of the IRS computer modernization \neffort and want to ensure resources are allocated responsibly in the \nfuture.\n  As ranking member of the Treasury Appropriations Subcommittee, I have \nhad the opportunity to meet the Commissioner of the IRS, Mr. Rossotti, \nand am encouraged by his strong background in management and \ninformation technology. The legislation before us will provide the \nCommissioner with tools to put together a high-quality team to run the \nagency, and award those who do their jobs well.\n  This bill also includes new sources of outside oversight of the \nagency, such as the Oversight Board and the new Treasury IG's Office \nfor Tax Administration. Coming from the business world, I know the \nimportance of accountability and constant self-examination. Management \nand employees should always be looking for ways to do their jobs more \neffectively and be open to constructive criticism.\n  But for too long, the IRS has operated as if it were a class by \nitself, somehow above the standards of efficiency and customer service \nthat any American business must follow to survive.\n  We have witnessed the effects of this problem in my home state of \nWisconsin. For the past two and a half years, we have worked to address \nallegations of misconduct and discrimination at the Milwaukee-Waukesha \nIRS Offices. These allegations were discussed at length at the \nCommittee hearings last week, and were so serious that some IRS \nemployees felt the need to sneak into my office in Milwaukee to report \non abuses.\n  Employees feared retaliation and alleged again and again that \nmanagement was allowing, if not promoting, a hostile work environment. \nSuch a deplorable situation of fear and intimidation is unacceptable, \nmust be stopped, and must be prevented from happening in the future.\n  This bill sets up a confidential means through which honest employees \ncan report allegations of abuses. In addition, I am offering an \namendment with my colleague, Senator Feingold, to ensure that oversight \nof the Milwaukee office is a top priority of the new IG. This \nlegislation will prevent abuses in the future, but we must also be \nvigilant in dealing with serious problems that have yet to be resolved \nin the present.\n  Mr. President, while taking time to mention only a few of the many \nimportant provisions of this bill, I want to urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  We have a historic opportunity to right future wrongs and be party to \nthe creation of a more consumer-friendly, efficient and responsible \nIRS. Let us seize that opportunity with enthusiasm and without further \ndelay.\n\n[[Page S4393]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield back the balance of the time.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I will rise to introduce an amendment, but I \nwill defer to my colleague from Delaware if he wishes to ask for a time \nagreement.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator that I do \nwant to ask for an agreement on the 40 minutes, but I have to wait for \nSenator Kerrey to return. I will raise that when he comes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Internal Revenue \nService Restructuring and Reform Act that we are now considering. Over \nthe past several months Senator Roth and his Finance Committee have \ndone an exemplary job of reviewing the legislation sent to us by the \nHouse and identifying ways to improve and strengthen that bill. And \nit's been well worth the wait. I also commend my colleague from \nDelaware and his committee for including a number of the proposals that \nI introduced as part of my Putting the Taxpayer First Act, earlier this \nyear. They represent suggestions that I received from Missourians and \nsmall business owners across the country, who have called, written, and \nstopped me on the street to stress the need for IRS reform and greater \ntaxpayer rights.\n  While I believe we have made substantial progress toward that goal, \none aspect of this bill continues to trouble me--the creation of the \nso-called oversight board. As currently proposed, a majority of this \nboard will consist of six individuals who must split their time between \nwatching over the IRS and running their private-sector businesses--each \nof which can be more than a full-time job. And even if these \nindividuals can dedicate sufficient time, their ability to make real \nchanges for the benefit of taxpayers amounts to little more than advice \nto the Commissioner, which he may or may not decide to take.\n  Despite these issues, the creation of a part-time board has been \nportrayed by many as the linchpin of solving the problems at the IRS. \nBut when has such a part-time advisory board ever turned around a \ngovernmental agency as vast as the IRS and with such a poor record of \nservice to millions of Americans? I have searched for a comparable \nsuccess story within our government, and came up dry. And while some \npoint to Canada's Revenue Office as an example, Canada's part-time \nboard is still on the drawing board. Consequently, I think we are \nplacing too much reliance on the untested and unproven concept of a \npart-time board to bring fundamental change to the IRS.\n  If we are going to create a board to steer the IRS back on course, \nlet's do more than add some window dressing to this troubled agency. \nAmerica's taxpayers deserve a well-managed agency committed to service. \nThe amendment I offer today establishes the framework to accomplish \nthat goal.\n  Mr. President, my amendment creates an independent, full-time Board \nof Governors for the IRS, which will exercise top-level administrative \nmanagement over the agency. The Board of Governors will have full \nresponsibility, authority, and accountability for the IRS' enforcement \nactivities, such as examinations and collections, which are often at \nthe heart of taxpayer complaints about the IRS. In addition, the Board \nwill oversee the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate and the new \nindependent appeals function required by the bill.\n  Under my amendment, the Board of Governors will consist of five \nmembers appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, each \nwith a staggered five-year term. Four of the members will be drawn from \nthe private sector. Overall these members will bring private-sector \nexperience critical to the management of an agency like the IRS. Of \nequal importance, they will bring the perspective of the diverse group \nof taxpayers the IRS must serve, including individuals and small and \nlarge businesses. The fifth member of the Board will be the \nCommissioner of Internal Revenue, who will also serve as the Chairman \nof the Board of Governors.\n  The board I envision through this amendment corrects the major \nweaknesses of the bill's part-time advisory board. First, my full-time \nBoard of Governors is a permanent solution to the management \ndifficulties that have plagued the IRS for years. It seems like little \nmore than a token gesture to create an oversight board for the IRS and \nhave it expire after 10 years, as set out in the bill. If a board is \nexpected to turn the IRS around, wouldn't it make sense to continue the \nreason for that success story?\n  Second, my full-time Board of Governors will have real authority to \nmake a difference. The Board's direction is to ``oversee the Internal \nRevenue Service in the administration, management, conduct, direction, \nand supervision of the execution and application of the internal \nrevenue laws or related statutes and tax conventions to which the \nUnited States is a party.'' The only exception to this broad authority \nis that the Board will have only a consultative role in developing tax \npolicy.\n  In contrast, the part-time advisory board recommended by the Finance \nCommittee starts with broad authority but is quickly whittled down \nessentially to an advisory role. For instance, the part-time board \nwould have no responsibility or authority with respect to tax policy. \nIn my view, good tax policy must take into account more than just \nrevenue and collections; it must consider the burdens that the law \nimposes on the taxpayers and the corresponding burdens involved in \nadministering and enforcing those laws. A full-time Board of Governors \nmanaging the IRS will be uniquely qualified to provide critical \nperspective and feedback to the Treasury Department in crafting future \ntax proposals.\n  Similarly, the bill's part-time board would have no responsibility or \nauthority over specific IRS law enforcement activities or personnel \nactions.\n  These restrictions fly in the face of the testimony that the Finance \nCommittee received just last week, not to mention to committee's \nhearings last fall. Each of us was shocked by the taxpayers and IRS \nemployees who came forward with accounts of poor service and abuse, and \nmany of these cases involved IRS examination or collection activities. \nMoreover, these horror stories merely echo the countless letters and \ncalls that each of us receives from taxpayers embroiled in disputes \nwith the IRS in our home states.\n  Can any of us suggest, with a straight face, that creating a part-\ntime advisory board will ``fix'' the IRS when that board cannot know \nabout or address specific enforcement or personnel problems? While I am \nnot suggesting that the IRS board should address every taxpayer \ngrievance, the board should be able to take action with respect to \nspecific types of examination and collection problems and those that \ninvolve IRS personnel.\n  Some will argue that the expansion of the taxpayer-confidentiality \nrules addresses this issue. I must disagree. The information that the \npart-time board will receive under this provision is dependent on the \ndiscretion of the Commissioner and the Treasury Inspector General. For \ntoo long, ``section 6103'' has been a convenient shield for the IRS to \nhide behind, and it will be too easy for that practice to continue \nleaving the board in the dark about the types of problems described all \ntoo clearly in the Finance Committee's hearings. In addition, limited \naccess to taxpayer information won't help the board address personnel \nproblems in the agency, which is critical if we are to restore \ncredibility to the term ``service'' in its name.\n  My amendment resolves this problem. As full-time employees, the four \nmembers of the Board of Governors drawn from the private sector will \nhave access to the same information available to the Commissioner. \nMoreover, the Board under my amendment will have authority to address \npersonnel issues. As a result, their hands will not be tied when it \ncomes to restoring taxpayer service and respect in all IRS enforcement \nactivities.\n  The bill's part-time advisory board also starts out with authority to \nreview and approve reorganization plans for the IRS. Yet tucked away at \nthe end of the effective date section is a provision barring the part-\ntime board from approving the current plan to reorganize the IRS along \ncustomer lines. This contradiction simply defies reason.\n  I am a strong advocate of reorganizing the IRS into divisions that \nserve\n\n[[Page S4394]]\n\nparticular taxpayers with similar needs, like individual taxpayers and \nsmall business owners, and I included such a plan in my Putting the \nTaxpayer First Act that I introduced. IRS Commissioner Rossotti has \nalso embraced this approach. With so much support, why should we \nrestrict even a part-time advisory board from approving such a \nfundamental restructuring of the IRS but require its review and \napproval for all future plans? The full-time Board of Governors under \nmy amendment would be required to evaluate and sign-off on all plans to \nreorganize the agency--it only makes sense!\n  Mr. President, besides giving the IRS board real authority to run the \nagency and make critical changes, my amendment also ensures that the \nmembers of the Board of Governors are sufficiently committed to the \ntask. Having been governor of my state of Missouri, I have some \nappreciation of the time and energy it takes to run a large \norganization. But I can't begin to imagine how I could have hoped to \nmake a difference if I spent only a few days a year commuting to our \ncapital, Jefferson City, to govern the state, and spent the rest of my \ntime running a successful business or even a not so successful law \npractice. That is the trap we will create with a part-time advisory \nboard for the IRS.\n  The IRS has over 100,000 employees spread across the country and \naround the world. The agency has a budget of over $7 billion, and it \ncollects more than $1 trillion each year from millions of taxpayers. It \nis an imposing task for even a full-time Board of Governors to reform \nan institution of this size-- common-sense suggests it is an impossible \ntask for a part-time advisory board.\n  What's more, the proponents of the bill contend that its part-time \nboard will improve accountability within the IRS. But take, for \nexample, a part-time board member who is an executive in a major \ncorporation headquartered on the west coast. He flies to Washington \nseveral times a year as part of his IRS oversight responsibilities. How \ncan he be accountable for the daily actions of this enormous \norganization when he is little more than a hostage to its bureaucracy \non his occasional visit to Washington? If we are going to make changes \nto the IRS' management structure, we should give them a real chance for \nsuccess and give the taxpayers confidence that reform can be achieved.\n  Mr. President, while not everyone will agree with my proposal, let's \ntake a moment to look at some arguments I've heard so far. Some have \ncommented that we won't get the best people to serve on the IRS board \nif they have to leave their private-sector jobs for a tour of \ngovernment service. As an example that just the opposite is true, I \npoint to our current IRS Commissioner. In my assessment, Commissioner \nRossotti has outstanding credentials and has been very successful as a \nbusiness owner in the private sector. In addition, I think most of my \ncolleagues would agree that he has done an exceptional job during his \nshort tenure at the helm of the IRS.\n  This criticism also rings rather hollow when we look at the \nindividuals who have served on similar full-time boards and commissions \nthroughout the government, like the Federal Reserve, the Federal Trade \nCommission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, to name a few. \nI've never heard it suggested that we scrape the bottom of the barrel \nto find people qualified to serve in these full-time positions. Just \nthe opposite is true. As Commissioner Rossotti, Treasury Secretary \nRubin, and many others have demonstrated, there are business leaders in \nthis country who are willing to take leave from their private-sector \nlives to serve the public.\n  Others have argued that the IRS Commissioner doesn't need a full-time \nboard to run the agency, especially since the bill gives the \nCommissioner broader authority to bring in senior management talent. If \nthat's true, why do we need a board at all? Why not have just Alan \nGreenspan run the Federal Reserve or Arthur Levitt oversee the \nsecurities markets? Surely the same arguments would apply to those \nboards and those commissions.\n\n  I believe there is value in having a core group of individuals who \nbring important talents and experience to complement the Commissioner's \nmanagement of an agency like the IRS. Just as with other boards and \ncommissions throughout the government, these individuals can share the \ntop-level management burdens and allow the Commissioner to focus on the \nmost pressing issues completely and quickly.\n  A third issue raised by my opponents is that a full-time board with \nreal authority will make the IRS too independent. So what exactly is \nthe problem? Sadly, there have been allegations in recent years that \nthe IRS is being used for politically-motivated audits. Whether true or \nnot, such assertions severely undercut any efforts to instill \nconfidence in our tax-administration system. While I applaud the \nprovision in the bill that prohibits Executive Branch influence over \ntaxpayer audits, we can further ensure that result by establishing a \nboard with representatives of both political parties, as my amendment \nrequires. In the end, there should be nothing partisan about helping \ntaxpayers to comply with the tax laws in the least burdensome manner \npossible.\n  Mr. President, my amendment offers a straight forward, common-sense \nsolution for the management of this troubled agency and it cures the \ninherent weaknesses of the part-time advisory board called for in the \nbill. With a vast number of agencies across this city, including the \ncity itself, managed under full-time boards and commissions, we have \nample evidence that this structure can work for the IRS. In my opinion, \nif we want more than window dressing on the current management \nstructure, a full-time, full authority, full accountability Board of \nGovernors is the answer.\n  A part-time advisory board will not make a difference in how the \nagency is run. If we need a board, we need a full-time board. We don't \nneed a part-time advisory board. Otherwise, if we do not want to have a \nfull-time board, let's leave the agency's management alone, because \nwhen has a part-time advisory board ever turned an agency around? I \nsuggest never.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2341\n\n (Purpose: To strike the Internal Revenue Service Oversight Board and \n   establish a full-time Board of Governors for the Internal Revenue \n                                Service)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri (Mr. Bond) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2341.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as I indicated before the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri spoke, we had a tentative agreement of 40 minutes \nfor this amendment, with 20 minutes to a side. I ask that we \nunanimously agree to that with the time that the distinguished Senator \nused to discuss the amendment being deducted from the 20 minutes. I \nunderstand that is roughly 13 minutes. Is that satisfactory?\n  Mr. BOND. I ask for 10 minutes, because there are others on this side \nwho may wish to speak.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Delaware \nwould agree--Senator Reid has an amendment he wants to bring right \nafter this--that we stack these votes, and have a UC to have both of \nthese votes stacked.\n  Mr. ROTH. That would be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERREY. We would have to get a time agreement.\n  Mr. ROTH. Let's agree on the Bond amendment first; the agreement \nbeing 40 minutes divided between the two sides, and that Senator Bond \nwould have the remaining 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct. Mr. President, 20 minutes for the side in \nopposition, and 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. And no second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Could I ask the Senator to restate the \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, what we are proposing for unanimous consent \nis 40 minutes for consideration of the amendment to be divided between \nthe\n\n[[Page S4395]]\n\ntwo sides, that it be agreed that the distinguished Senator has 10 \nminutes remaining on his side of the 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. And I would also add there would be no second-degree \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Could we modify it so we go to Senator Reid's amendment \nnext and have rollcall votes not before 1:15?\n  Mr. ROTH. Let's wait on the rollcall votes. We can go ahead with the \nReid amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a \nminute on each side for the proponents and opponents to state their \ncase on the amendment since the vote is going to be stacked later.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I, unfortunately, oppose the amendment \nby the Senator from Missouri. I say ``unfortunately'' because the \nSenator from Missouri has good motives in offering his amendment. They \ncome from the fact that he has been an outspoken advocate for small \nbusiness in the Senate. He has made a career of promoting an \nenvironment very good to small business, and obviously we all know that \nsometimes the Internal Revenue Service is one Government agency that \ntends to be anti-small business. We had a lot of information coming out \nof our hearings that IRS agents are told to go after the small people--\nforget about the bigger, wealthier people--because smaller people do \nnot have the resources to fight.\n  That is particularly true of small business where you have \naccumulated some wealth in a small business but you do not necessarily \nhave a lot of income. And so you do not have the resources to fight the \nIRS. So I do not find fault with the motives behind what Senator Bond \nis trying to do.\n  I definitely believe this bill we have before us, including the \nprovisions for an advisory board, has been well thought out. The \nNational Commission on the Restructuring of the IRS created the concept \nof this Board. We assessed the various pros and cons of separating the \nIRS from the supervision of the Secretary of the Treasury and making it \nmore independent. We decided that it needed more independence. Next, we \nhad to decide how the independent operation should be governed. To \nanswer this, we came up with the Oversight Board.\n  So I thank Senator Bond for his advocacy for small business and his \nconcern about this important legislation. But at the same time I think \nI must rise in opposition to this amendment. The Commission came up \nwith this idea of having an oversight board for the IRS after months \nand months of discussion and consideration. It was a recommendation \nthat we on the Commission put in our report because we thought it would \nkeep the IRS on track and improving in the right direction. The Senator \nfrom Nebraska and I made this board one of the centerpieces of our \nlegislation, S. 1096, which, of course, was the first comprehensive IRS \nreform legislation introduced in the Senate.\n\n  The National Commission on Restructuring of the IRS--Senator Kerrey \nand I, two members of the House of Representatives, and 13 other people \nserved on this Commission. Ten of the members were nongovernmental, \nprivate sector people who knew about the problems that the private \nsector was having with the IRS. We fully considered adopting a full-\ntime oversight board at one time, but we came to the conclusion that it \nwas not an advisable thing to do. We decided that this part-time board \nwould be more effective, and I will give you the reasons for that.\n  First of all, the purpose of the board is to be advisory, not to \nmanage the IRS. It is meant to function like a corporation's board of \ndirectors. It is not intended to get involved in the day-to-day \noperations of the IRS because the IRS already has a leader--the \ncommissioner. And by the way, this is the first nonlawyer and more \nspecifically nontax lawyer who has been head of the IRS. Mr. Rossotti, \nor somebody with his background from private sector management, brings \nto the management of the IRS a person who is consumer oriented, \ncustomer oriented. His own private sector corporation had to satisfy \nhis consuming public for the services that he sold or he would not have \nbeen in business. He would not have developed a successful business. So \nto have a nontax attorney for the first time running the IRS is very, \nvery good because it brings somebody in there who knows that \norganization ought to serve the taxpayers and not be a master of the \ntaxpayers. He has already led the organization in some important \nchanges and I have great confidence that he will continue to make \nproductive changes. He will do a better job because of this \nlegislation.\n  In addition, it seems to me that a full-time board would not attract \nthe people who we want to attract to this board. A full-time board too \noften in this town attracts inside-the-beltway, Washington career \npeople. That is not the type of person we want on the board.\n  What the IRS needs is guidance from people who come from the real \nworld of work, people outside the beltway, people who are real \nAmericans. It needs experts in business, management and customer \nservice. It needs people who are willing to take the time in the name \nof public service to help guide the IRS, through this recovery period \nit is now in. The IRS does not need people who consider the full-time \njob of being on the IRS board a good career move. The fact is the \npeople we want to serve on this board will not give up their full-time \njobs to do it.\n  This bill is not intended to create more bureaucracy. We have too \nmuch bureaucracy already. This is generally true throughout Government. \nBut we found it is definitely the case in the IRS. A full-time board \nwould just be one more layer in an organization with way too many \nlayers of bureaucracy already. For these reasons, I ask my colleagues \nto join me in opposing this amendment. If we want the IRS to be \ncustomer friendly, like a corporation must be, we must give it a \ncorporate-like board.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back the remainder of my time to be \nreserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, let me first do as the Senator from Iowa \ndid, Senator Grassley, and compliment the intent of the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri. I started out exactly where the Senator from \nMissouri is, considering that a full-time board would be best. What I \nhave concluded is that over time, examining what this board is going to \nbe doing--and let nobody doubt, by the way, this board has substantial \npowers. This is not an advisory board. There are a number of things \nthat we specifically say they cannot do, in order to avoid conflict of \ninterest with procurement and with personnel and with confidentiality, \nbut this board oversees the IRS in its administration, its management, \nits conduct, its direction, and its supervision of the execution and \napplication of the IRS law.\n  It has substantial powers in making recommendations to the President \nas to who the Commissioner ought to be and has the power to recommend \nthe Commissioner ought to be terminated. I urge colleagues to look at \nsection 1102 of the proposed legislation.\n  I share the conclusion Senator Grassley has just iterated in his \nopposition to this amendment; that is, that a full-time board would \nactually restrict our capacity to go out and get the people with the \nkind of talent that we need to be on this board in the first place. \nThere are an awful lot of Americans who have expertise in management, \nhave expertise in computers, have expertise in the operation of a large \norganization. They especially\n\n[[Page S4396]]\n\nhave expertise in restructuring, which is going to be a very, very \nimportant piece of work that Mr. Rossotti will have the authority to \ndo, restructuring and changing the nature an organization.\n  We need people with all those kinds of expertise. And if you require \nthe individual to serve full time, my conclusion, strongly felt, is you \nwill exclude large numbers of citizens who would say: If it is part \ntime, I'm prepared to sit on this Board as a consequence of my desire \nto improve the way this IRS is operated. My desire to improve it is \nstrong enough to serve part time, but I can't possibly do it full time. \nWe are going to reduce the list if we make it full time, of citizens \nwho could serve this in this way.\n  In addition, I point out this board sunsets in 2002; thus, Congress \nwould have the opportunity to revisit and make a determination as to \nwhether or not, as a result of the experience that we have had, this \nboard needs to be full time.\n  So I urge those who were concerned about this board being part time, \non the one hand to consider we are going to restrict our ability to get \nthe kind of expertise that is needed on this board, and, second, we \nwill have an opportunity, after 5 years, to revisit this issue. If the \nexperience of this board is that they are recommending to us that full \ntime would be better than part time, we will have ample opportunity to \nmake that judgment.\n  I urge my colleagues, with great respect to the Senator from Missouri \nand his intent, to vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require. I \nthank my colleagues from both Iowa and Nebraska for their very \nthoughtful comments. As I said earlier, I appreciate so much the \nexcellent work the Finance Committee has done on restructuring of the \nIRS. Truly, it is a very important issue.\n\n  Primarily, I hear them raising the point that we can't get people to \nserve if we have a full-time board. We are making it a small board. We \nneed four individuals who want to serve.\n  Some say you can have part-time people who can come in and get the \nbig picture authority. The problem is, we need them to work on specific \nlaw enforcement activities and personnel actions. We are not talking \nabout somebody giving them the big picture; we are talking about \nsomebody taking management responsibility. If individuals would serve, \nis their question. They say we can't get good individuals to serve.\n  We have the Commissioner of the IRS. He came from the private sector. \nHe was willing to move in. Private-sector individuals have served, and \nhave served with great distinction, in related areas, where they do an \nexcellent job. Why should we think it is harder to get people to serve \non the IRS board than it would be to serve on the FTC board or on the \nSEC? These are issues that I think are very closely related. If we \ncan't get good people to serve on that board, I would be very much \nsurprised. We would not see a part-time advisory board dealing with \nactual cases of taxpayer abuse. They would have to do so only when the \nCommissioner or the Treasury Inspector General said they could.\n  Let's just take an example--the alarming revelation last week that \nformer Secretary Howard Baker and former Congressman James Quillen were \nthe targets of a vendetta by a rogue IRS agent. Even more troubling, \nmore troubling is that the agent's activities were covered up by \nnumerous officials in the IRS district office.\n  This case clearly demonstrates a pattern of bad behavior in one \noffice, but it may be indicative of structural or procedural defects \nthroughout the agency. Are we really going to tie the hands of the IRS \nboard and only permit it to review such problems as the Commissioner or \nthe Treasury IG permit it? I say not. If we are going to do the job, we \nought to do it right. Without this authority, the board will only find \nout about the problems like the rest of us--when the press points them \nout or when we have to go through a congressional hearing.\n  The problems of the IRS are well known. Now we need to make sure we \nfix them, not just tinker around the edges. The Bond amendment replaces \nthe IRS management structure of a Commissioner plus a part-time limited \nauthority board with an independent full-time board of governors, \nincluding the Commissioner. It is not an accident, as I have said \nearlier, that the SEC, the FTC, the Federal Reserve, are all run by \nboards or commissions. These agencies carry out sensitive regulatory \nand enforcement duties, and they must be insulated from political \nmotives. Insulation from political motives is one of the objectives we \nmust achieve in this IRS restructuring. The American taxpayer deserves \nthe same level of protection as the people who are governed by and are \nsubject to the rules and regulations of the SEC and the FTC and the \nFCC.\n  Who has not heard of the allegations that the IRS has targeted out-\nof-favor groups or those who seem to have nothing in common but their \nopposition to various White House policies? No American should have the \nenforcement powers of the IRS unleashed on them because they don't \nagree with the White House on an issue. I think that is simply why my \namendment is so necessary. Under the current bill, the only way the \npart-time board would have known about the abuses we learned about last \nweek is the same way the rest of us did when we watched Senator Roth's \nhearing on television. That is how limited the authority of the part-\ntime board is.\n  We need real reform of how the IRS does its business. I believe \nputting a full-time, independent board in place to run the agency is \nthe best way to do that. I say to those people who really want reform, \nif you really believe a board is essential to restructuring the IRS, \nthen I say let's get out and run with the big dogs; let's get a full \ntime, independent board. Otherwise, get back up on the porch, because a \npart-time advisory board is not going to even have a large bark; it \nwill have a minor meow.\n  If we are going to put some teeth into it, we need to have the teeth \nthat a full-time, independent board governing the IRS can give to \nmanaging the agency, to make sure it does not abuse taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Bond's \namendment to establish a full-time IRS Board of Governors. I firmly \nbelieve that oversight of an agency with the equivalent of 100,000 \nfull-time employees, a requested fiscal year 1999 budget of almost $8.2 \nbillion, and a history of wasting $4 billion in an attempt to modernize \nthe tax collection system, is, without question, a full time job.\n  Furthermore, rigorous oversight will be critical to ensuring that the \nreforms that Congress has in store for the agency will be carried out \neffectively and expeditiously. I think the prudent strategy is to keep \nthe agency on very short leash given the shocking stories that have \ncome to light from the recent Finance Committee hearings. I have my own \nideas as to how to liberate the taxpayer from the IRS--namely the \nimplementation of my flat-tax proposal. But short of comprehensive tax \nsimplification, I strongly support Senator Bond's efforts.\n  Mr. President, the IRS is a very troubled agency that demands the \nhighest level of scrutiny. I strongly urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment. I feel we owe it to the American taxpayer.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  Mr. President, I, too, join my colleagues in paying my respects to \nthe distinguished Senator from Missouri. He brings a wealth of \nbackground and experience, so his comments are always welcomed and \nlistened to with great care. While I completely agree that the IRS \noversight board must be adequately structured, I respectfully urge my \ncolleagues to oppose this amendment which would make the IRS oversight \nboard a full-time board.\n  In my judgment, the board should be a part-time board. The purpose of \nthe board is to provide ``big picture'' oversight over the IRS, provide \nspecific expertise to IRS management to ensure\n\n[[Page S4397]]\n\naccountability at the IRS, as well as to ensure that taxpayers are \nbeing treated and served properly.\n  The purpose of the board is not to micromanage the IRS. Commissioner \nRossotti is a management expert, unlike his predecessors who were \nexperts in tax law. As I have said many times on the floor, I think we \nare very fortunate in having an individual of his qualifications, his \nexpertise, not only in management but high tech as well. I believe we \nshould support the manager and provide a board that will help him turn \nthe troubled agency around.\n  It is my judgment a full-time board would destroy the delicate \nbalance we tried to include in this legislation. The Commissioner, not \nthe board, should manage the IRS.\n  A full-time board would bog down in details, diffuse accountability, \nand I fear very much probably not include the type of individuals, the \nexperts, the background, and vision that are necessary on the board. \nAlso, I have to say that I would doubt that Commissioner Rossotti might \nremain with the IRS if the board were full time.\n  The very basic question is what would be the point? While I agree \nwith my colleague's objectives, I do not believe that a full-time board \nwould enhance the prospect of turning this agency around. In fact, \nmaking the board full time could very well undermine the purpose of \nthis legislation.\n  As my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Nebraska, has pointed \nout, the board is sunsetted. There will be an opportunity in the future \nto see how this board is functioning, whether it is working in the \nmanner that we hope and believe it will.\n  I urge my colleagues, Mr. President, to vote against the full-time \nboard. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I, again, commend my colleague from Delaware \nfor his outstanding leadership. I will only say that Commissioner \nRossotti is going to leave sometime. I think it is important for us to \nmake a structure which gives us the possibility of real reform in the \nIRS. An advisory board, in my experience in dealing with advisory \nboards, cannot and will not make a difference in the day-to-day \nmanagement, the selection of IRS audits and the running of the agency \nwhich is the issue on the minds of American taxpayers. We need to do \nthe job right, and I believe we need to make the change now.\n  Mr. President, if the distinguished manager of the bill has no \nfurther people wishing to speak--the ones who wanted to speak in \nsupport of the amendment are otherwise occupied--I am prepared to yield \nback the remainder of my time. We have 1 minute on each side prior to \nthe vote. If the manager is finished with his speakers, I will join him \nin yielding back whatever time remains.\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, Mr. President, I am pleased at this time to yield back \nthe remainder of our time.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield back the remainder of time on our side. I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nexpiration or yielding back of time on the pending Bond amendment, it \nbe temporarily set aside and a vote occur on, or in relation to, the \nBond amendment at 1:15 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. REID. I also ask unanimous consent that a congressional fellow, \nAlan Easterling, be allowed privileges of the floor during this issue \nthat is now before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2342\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to eliminate \n           payments for detection of underpayments and fraud)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2342.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of subtitle H of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ELIMINATION OF PAYMENTS FOR DETECTION OF \n                   UNDERPAYMENTS AND FRAUD.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subchapter B of chapter 78 is amended by \n     striking section 7623.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for \n     subchapter B of chapter 78 is amended by striking the item \n     relating to section 7623.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as Members of this body know, I have worked \nlong and hard with other Members of this body to change how the IRS \nfunctions. The first speech I gave on the Senate floor after being \nelected in 1986, was on the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. As I presented my \nremarks that day, presiding was Senator David Pryor of Arkansas. At the \ntime, he was chairman of the Subcommittee on Finance that dealt with \nthe Internal Revenue Service. Also, that same day in the Chamber was \nCharles Grassley of Iowa, a longtime proponent of changes within the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n  I received a note from Senator Pryor after I finished my remarks that \na page delivered to me, indicating he wanted to work with me on the \nlegislation that I talked about. That same day, I received word from \nSenator Grassley he wanted to work with me.\n  This was bipartisan legislation. The bill that I wrote, the Taxpayer \nBill of Rights--because of these two Senators; the Senator from \nArkansas, the Senator from Iowa; a Democrat and a Republican--we were \nable to move this bill through the Senate. It passed in 1988 and became \nlaw. It was really a significant change. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights \nchanged the way the taxpayers dealt with the tax collectors. It put the \ntaxpayer on a more equal footing with the tax collector. It was the \nbeginning of some major changes in the way we deal with the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  The Taxpayer Bill of Rights No. 2, in 1996, was also a change. But we \nare here now because of H.R. 2676, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act \nof 1997. I say to the chairman of the full committee, the senior \nSenator from Delaware, I appreciate his working hard on this issue. I \nthink the hearings have been informative to the American public and \nindicate that we need to do more. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights No. 1 and \nNo. 2 were important, but we need to go further.\n  I was one of those initial sponsors of this legislation in the \nSenate. Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator Grassley of Iowa, and I \nheld a press conference where we talked about this legislation. At that \ntime we didn't have a lot of support. But the support has built, and \nnow we have support from the administration, and it is once again \nbipartisan legislation.\n\n  I look forward to the opportunity to speak in favor of the speedy \npassage of this much needed and long overdue reform.\n  What I want to talk about today in my amendment is one of the things \nthat leads to the bad press, the bad feelings that the American public \nhas about the IRS. What I want to prohibit the IRS from doing in the \nfuture is continuing with a program that I refer to as the ``Reward for \nRats Program.'' This is a program where the IRS, in effect, has a \ncontingent fee, much like a lawyer gets in a personal injury case. They \nsay, ``If you have somebody who will snitch on a neighbor, an ex-wife, \nor business partner, and this will lead to our collecting money, then \nwe will give you part of that money.''\n  I believe anyone who owes money to the Internal Revenue Service \nshould pay it. But I think it should be collected in a way that is in \nkeeping with the American system, not go into people's personal lives, \nwhere you have a wife--former wife or former husband\n\n[[Page S4398]]\n\nwho just completed a long divorce, and the IRS contacts one of them and \nsays, ``Hey, if you can give us a little information on your ex-spouse, \nthen we will give you part of the money we collect.''\n  I think this is wrong, and I think we should stop it. There is \nnothing specifically in the statute which allows this. The problem is, \nthere is nothing that disallows it. That is what this amendment would \ndo. It is a practice which, if it isn't corrected, will be permitted \nunder this legislation now before the body.\n  Last week, the Senate Finance Committee, under the leadership of the \nsenior Senator from Delaware, conducted hearings in the cases of \nabusive practices by employees of the IRS. Witnesses before that \ncommittee provided testimony which describes an organization prepared, \nI am sorry to say, to use virtually any means to collect this Nation's \ntaxes.\n  Again, I think the taxes should be collected but it should be in a \nfair way. An organization apparently prepared to take advantage of \nindividual greed or desire for revenge to identify, rightly or wrongly, \ncitizens who have failed to pay their taxes is something we need to do \naway with.\n  Last week, we learned of a restaurant owner whose life was ruined on \nthe basis of no more than a tip from a vengeful informant. As recently \nreported in the press, we learned of a tax accountant who snitched on a \nclient, motivated only by the expectation of payment for betraying a \nconfidential relationship. In both cases that I have just provided, the \ninformation was false.\n  Such informants, most of the time, are not acting in some sense of \ncivic duty. They don't act from a selfless interest in the Nation's \nwell-being. They act against friends, relatives, employers, and \nassociates because the IRS pays them to do so.\n  Under section 7623 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, they are \nauthorized to pay sums, as required, to informants in order to bring to \ntrial violators of Internal Revenue laws. In plain English, the IRS \npays snitches to act against associates, employers, relatives, and \nothers--whether motivated by greed or revenge--in order to collect \ntaxes. I find this activity unseemly, distasteful, and just wrong.\n  Under the current IRS program, these informants are paid up to 15 \npercent of the money recovered as a result of their tips, but no less \nthan $100. In a recent change to the so-called Snitch Program, the \nService increased the maximum allowable reward to $2 million--a \npowerful incentive to anyone interested in becoming rich at the expense \nof a neighbor, former business associates or business associate, former \nwife, former husband.\n\n  As if the desire for revenge alone hasn't been responsible enough for \nruined lives, the Service has a $2 million jackpot to sweeten the \npayoff. For the nosy neighbor, the alienated spouse, or the wronged \npartner, the odds of seeing that payday may appear better than anything \nthe State can offer. This program is unethical, it is contrary to \ntaxpayer privacy, and inconsistent with the spirit of the Taxpayer Bill \nof Rights.\n  Let's assume that someone comes to an accountant with a tax problem--\nunder the present law, there is no confidentiality; we are trying to \nchange that, of course--comes to an accountant with a tax problem, \nthinking, of course, you have to get this thing worked out with your \naccountant; and the accountant walks out after the meeting and calls \nthe IRS and says, ``I have somebody you can get a real good chunk of \nmoney from, but of course I get 15 percent of it.''\n  I think that is wrong. It is contrary to taxpayer privacy and \ninconsistent with the spirit of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights which was \npassed previously.\n  The IRS would have you believe that these programs--this snitch \nprogram is warranted because of the millions of dollars it is able to \ncollect through the snitches. This simply demonstrates that the IRS is \nrelying upon others to do its work. It shouldn't be up to friends, \nfamilies, coworkers, and neighbors to ensure taxes are being paid; it \nis up to the IRS. We should not be paying private citizens to perform \nthe job the IRS employees are expected to carry out.\n  I think this program should come to an end. To that purpose, I \npropose this amendment, which will eliminate the payments for detection \nof underpayment and fraud. The amendment to eliminate the reward of \ngreed and invasive action against honest taxpayers should pass.\n  I propose that in the process of reforming and restructuring the \nInternal Revenue Service, we join together to eliminate the ``Reward \nfor Rats Program.'' It is time that this snitch program be eliminated \nand that we restore greater civic order to the manner in which the IRS \nconducts itself.\n  The amendment is considered important because it reforms the IRS, it \nfundamentally overhauls the manner in which they conduct business, and \nit serves the customers and also allows a more orderly way of \ncollecting money. This amendment addresses an unethical and destructive \nprogram employed by the IRS in the collection of revenues. In that the \namendment eliminates the program, it must be considered consistent with \nthe spirit of this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a story from \nthe Los Angeles Times dated April 15, 1998, entitled ``Rewards-for-\nSnitches Program Comes Under Fire,'' which illustrates what the problem \nis we are trying to correct.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Apr. 15, 1998]\n\n         IRS ``Rewards-for-Snitches'' Program Comes Under Fire\n\n                         (By Ralph Vartabedian)\n\n       Washington.--Americans voluntarily hand over most of the \n     $1.3 trillion owed to the Internal Revenue Service each year, \n     but a tiny fraction of tax collections depends on an obscure \n     and increasingly controversial IRS program of using paid \n     informants.\n       Motivated by a combination of greed and revenge, informants \n     are typically business associates, employees, acquaintances, \n     neighbors or ex-spouses of tax cheats. Many experts say the \n     program is one of the most unseemly parts of the U.S. tax \n     system.\n       However, IRS officials say they exercise great care in \n     handling the informants, weeding spurious allegations, and \n     that the rewards play an important role in the nation's tax \n     enforcement system.\n       The IRS pays the informants up to 15% of the taxes it \n     recovers from their tips--up to a maximum of $2 million--\n     though the vast majority of informants end up empty-handed.\n       After a series of recent congressional disclosures about \n     widespread taxpayer abuses, watchdog groups are growing \n     concerned about the ethics of the agency's informant reward \n     program.\n       ``We should refocus our efforts on good citizenry, not \n     bribing people to answer questions,'' said John Berthoud, \n     president of the nonpartisan National Taxpayers Union, who \n     called on the IRS to end the program in an interview with The \n     Times.\n       The program has been sharply criticized by individuals who \n     say they were victimized by bogus allegations, and even by \n     informants, such as Mary Case of Sherman Oaks, who say the \n     IRS has stiffed them on their rewards.\n       The Senate Finance Committee, which has been \n     broadly investigating IRS abuses over the last year, is \n     expected to unveil new evidence later this month that \n     taxpayers have been devastated by aggressive IRS \n     investigations based on phony information from snitches.\n\n\n               one tax accountant snitched on his client\n\n       Tax attorneys and accountants generally decry the informant \n     reward system, asserting that the government is on thin ice \n     in offering money to taxpayers to turn each other in. They \n     argue that a cornerstone of the U.S. tax system is the \n     protection of taxpayer privacy and that the IRS is wrong to \n     encourage people to breach confidential business or family \n     relationships. In one case, a St. Louis tax accountant \n     informed on his own client.\n       ``It smacks of communism, turn in your parents if you catch \n     them cheating,'' said San Francisco tax attorney Frederick \n     Daily, author of the book ``Stand up to the IRS.''\n       Bruce Hockman, a top Los Angeles tax attorney whose \n     clientele includes the rich and famous, refuses to help \n     clients snitch to the IRS. ``I have had people come in and \n     ask me to take them downtown to IRS district headquarters,'' \n     Hockman said. ``I say no way. The Nazis did it, turn people \n     in. It is unseemly.''\n       Of course, Congress authorized the IRS to create the \n     informant reward program in the first place. Former IRS \n     historian Shelley Davis says her research indicates that \n     informant rewards date back to the Civil War ear.\n       Tipsters are one of the important parts of the IRS toolbox \n     for enforcing tax compliance, says Thomas J. Smith, assistant \n     IRS commissioner for examination and chief of the agency's \n     informant reward program.\n\n\n               93% of snitches' tips end up in trash can\n\n       IRS figures for 1996, the last year for which data are \n     available, show that 9,430 Americans sought rewards. Of \n     those, the IRS acted on just 650--meaning that 93% of the \n     tips\n\n[[Page S4399]]\n\n     ended up in the IRS garbage can. The IRS paid out about $3.5 \n     million in rewards and recovered $103 million in taxes.\n       ``If you look at the last three years, we have had 2,000 \n     cases closed, resulting in taxes of $797 million,'' Smith \n     said. ``So, in terms of dollars, most people would judge that \n     as reasonably significant. It does supply a very useful \n     source of information for us.''\n       The IRS has a national informant hotline (1-800-829-0433), \n     though many informants walk in or call in to the IRS' 33 \n     district offices or 10 regional service centers, Smith said.\n       With little fanfare and with no explanation, the IRS last \n     year decided to substantially boost the maximum allowable \n     award to $2 million from $100,000. It also set a minimum \n     reward of $100, eliminating a lot of penny ante payments.\n       In 1996, the agency's largest award was a jackpot-size \n     $1.06 million. (The agency does not disclose who gets the \n     awards or what cases they involve.) The agency's smallest was \n     just $18--less than the typical reward advertised in \n     newspapers for lost dogs.\n       Under the new guidelines, rewards range from 1% to 15% of \n     the tax recovered, depending on the assistance provided by \n     the informer. But all awards are at the ``discretion'' of IRS \n     officials, who make their decisions behind closed doors. Of \n     course, the rewards are taxable income.\n       The IRS takes a low-key approach, not seeking to send the \n     message that the federal government is actively recruiting \n     paid stool pigeons. The agency does not make Form 211, which \n     informants must fill out to claim a reward, widely available. \n     It isn't even kept in the IRS national headquarters lobby, \n     where the agency has almost every form on display.\n       Asked if the IRS encourages Americans to inform on others, \n     Smith said he could offer no advice and suggested that \n     individuals do what they feel is right. But former IRS \n     officials are more blunt.\n\n\n                 garbage information comes streaming in\n\n       ``Informants rewards are pretty distasteful to everybody \n     except the person who gets one,'' said Phillip Brand, a tax \n     expert at KPMG Peat Marwich LLP and former IRS chief of \n     compliance. ``People have a different feeling about informing \n     when they do it as good citizens.''\n       Another problem with paying for information is that the IRS \n     gets a lot of garbage information. Brand recalled a tipster \n     once sought a reward for the disclosure that a secretary of \n     State was dealing drugs to Queen Elizabeth II and not \n     reporting the sales on his taxes.\n       But week allegations are less humorous when the IRS pursues \n     them against innocent taxpayers. That apparently happened to \n     John Colaprette of Virginia Beach, Va., whose home and two \n     restaurants were raided in 1994 by armed IRS agents after his \n     bookkeeper, Deborah A. Shofner, made phony allegations.\n       The bookkeeper was later arrested and charged with stealing \n     from a Colaprette restaurant, the Jewish Mother. She was \n     sentenced to 6 years and 11 months in Virginia.\n       ``This case was investigated for just one and a half days \n     before they obtained a search warrant, which was then \n     executed 12 hours later,'' said Colaprette, who is expected \n     to testify this month before the Senate Finance \n     Committee's hearings on IRS abuses.\n       Although the committee is saying little about its planned \n     hearings, it is expected to focus on the IRS' criminal \n     investigation division, which handles most of the paid \n     informants and conducts a wide range of undercover \n     operations.\n       Since the raid on the Jewish Mother, the IRS has never \n     assessed any back taxes or made any changes to his tax \n     returns, Colaprette said. He has a $20-million suit against \n     the IRS.\n       ``Why do we have an agency that nobody controls?'' \n     Colaprette asked.\n       It isn't unusual for the IRS to deal with informants who \n     violate confidential relationships. Like Colaprette's \n     bookkeeper, when St. Louis tax accountant James Checksfield \n     informed on his own client in 1989, he was discredited. The \n     government dropped its tax evasion case against the client \n     and the accountant lost his license.\n       Smith, the IRS chief of exams, said he could not discuss \n     any specific cases because of privacy laws. But he said the \n     IRS carefully screens allegations and is mindful of the \n     potential for bogus information.\n       ``It is a concern that we take very seriously,'' Smith \n     said. ``We absolutely try to be very careful about looking at \n     returns with the greatest probability of error.'' Smith added \n     that 89% of the returns examined as a result of a tip end up \n     with changes.\n       While it isn't surprising that the targets of allegations \n     feel abused, informants also are often frustrated over how \n     the agency treats their claims.\n\n\n                If Case Isn't Closed, No Reward Is Paid\n\n       Case, the Sherman Oaks woman, tipped the IRS in 1985 to \n     Stanley D. Hexom, a San Jose real estate broker later accused \n     of swindling millions of dollars from elderly California \n     investors in fraudulent real estate deals. She has never \n     received a reward from the IRS, but neither has the agency \n     closed her case.\n       As Hexom's bookkeeper, Case provided IRS agents boxes of \n     evidence, including copies of doctored tax returns and \n     locations of bank accounts, as well as testifying to a \n     federal grand jury.\n       Under IRS guidelines, an informant who provides such \n     specific information is supposed to get 15% of the back \n     taxes. But a big caveat is that the IRS has to actually \n     collect the back taxes. So, if the agency comes up empty-\n     handed, so does the informant.\n       There is no doubt that the IRS went after Hexom, who was \n     convicted on two counts of bank fraud and one count of \n     preparing a false tax return. IRS agents tried to collect \n     from Hexom's wife, though she may have escaped assessment by \n     claiming she was an innocent spouse, said Richard Blos, \n     Hexom's attorney in San Jose.\n       Hexom was released from prison in 1993 and is currently \n     living in the Phoenix area. He could not be reached for \n     comment.\n       Smith acknowledged that the agency is often criticized for \n     taking too long time to pay rewards, but he added that 13 \n     years is an abnormally long time for an informant to be kept \n     waiting.\n       Other informants say the agency's criminal investigation \n     division takes all the credit for big money cases and \n     undermines the role played by informants.\n       Joseph Pinnavaia, an Oceanside gemstone expert, helped the \n     IRS crack a tax fraud ring in the early 1980's, in which \n     worthless stones were being donated to museums for big tax \n     write-offs.\n       Pinnavaia died last November, but not before completing a \n     manuscript, entitled, ``The Most Corrupt Agency in the \n     Federal Government: The Internal Revenue Service,'' which \n     detailed how the agency mishandled his case.\n       With Pinnavaia's help, the IRS went after a doctor in \n     Florida who had donated an allegedly worthless blue topaz gem \n     to the Smithsonian Institution. By 1979, the IRS was \n     receiving 10,000 tax returns a year with deductions for \n     gemstones, it was later discovered.\n       Though Pinnavaia was awarded $11,000 for his help in the \n     case, he asserted that the IRS cheated him by claiming it \n     already knew about the larger nationwide fraud ring. The \n     manuscript, a copy of which was provided to The Times, \n     includes a variety of internal IRS documents, in which \n     criminal division agents downplayed his role in the case.\n       ``He felt the $11,000 didn't even cover his expenses,'' \n     said Mathew D. Pinnavaia, his son. ``They tried to deny he \n     played any role.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. First of all, let me say to the Senator from Nevada, long \nbefore I got on this issue of taxpayer rights, the Senator was there, \nworking on Taxpayer Bill of Rights 1 and Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2. \nThis legislation in title III is a continuation of your work. And I \nappreciate very much your early support of this bill that enabled us to \nfashion this legislation in a bipartisan way, which I think allows us \nto make certain that we can extend the rights and power and authority \nto the taxpayer and stop abuses that we see within the IRS's capacity \nto collect money that this Congress authorizes is to be collected.\n\n  I appreciate, specifically, the problem you are identifying with your \namendment. It is a problem that, thanks to Chairman Roth, we heard \nbefore our committee. We saw the problems that can occur when you offer \nsomebody, essentially, a reward to inform; you can get abuse from that. \nAs the Senator knows, as I have heard him talk about this as well, the \ndilemma is, how far do you go? We have this mechanism being used \nthroughout law enforcement and there are many times when it works and \nwhen it is not abuse.\n  I am wondering if the Senator would allow to us modify his amendment \nso it can require the commissioner to do a thorough analysis of this \nproblem. Commissioner Rossotti has had this brought to his attention. \nIt would require him to do a thorough analysis of this problem and then \ncome back to us and say, how can we change the law so as to make \ncertain that you are able to use this system when appropriate, but we \ncan get rid of some of the abuses that are quite obviously not the \nintent of this Congress.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Nebraska that I \nappreciate the kind comments about my work on the Internal Revenue \nService tax issues generally in the past. I also want to say that but \nfor the Senator from Nebraska, we would not be on the floor today. The \npeople of Nebraska should understand, as I am sure they do, the \ntenaciousness of the senior Senator from Nebraska. The work that he has \ndone on this issue--when the history books are written about tax reform \nin this country, one of the chapters has to be dedicated to him. I \npersonally appreciate, on behalf of my constituents from the State of \nNevada, the work that you have done on this issue. I also think the \nwork done on the underlying legislation, giving the commissioner of the \nInternal Revenue Service the power to do some things for a change will \nallow the commissioner to take a good look at this program and make \nsome\n\n[[Page S4400]]\n\nsuggestions, which in the past fell on deaf ears because he had no \npower and authority to do anything. So I think we have a good \ncommissioner. I am willing to have my amendment modified. I think it is \na step in the right direction. There may be some things that I don't \nunderstand having only gotten----\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, if the Senator yield. I find it very \ndifficult to hear what the distinguished Senator is saying.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to talk a little louder. I say to \nmy friend from Delaware that this has always been one of my habits. I \ncan remember when I first started trying case, there was a judge named \nMarshall--and Las Vegas only had 3 or 4 judges at the time--and he was \nhard of hearing. I would get up and talk to the jury and he could not \nhear what I was saying, so he would get upset at me. He thought I was \nsaying things I didn't want him to hear. That wasn't the case then and \nit's not the case now. I will try to be more direct to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  What I was saying is that I think this underlying legislation gives \nthe commissioner of the IRS power he didn't have before, which is good. \nOne of the problems we have had in the past is that the commissioner of \nthe IRS has had no power to make changes in the way the Service \noperates. This legislation certainly gives him power to do that.\n\n  So, as I said to my friend from Nebraska, and I say again, I am \nwilling for my amendment to be modified to have the commissioner report \nback to us within a reasonable time as to whether or not this program \nshould be terminated in its entirety, or whether it should be modified. \nThere may be instances when there may be a need for some type of a \ncontingent fee. I am not aware of any, but there may be. I have enough \nconfidence in the underlying legislation, which will be in effect in a \nfew weeks, we hope, and in the commissioner of the IRS that I am \nwilling to allow my amendment to be modified.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nNevada that that is a very positive step, a very sound way of \naddressing the problem. It has been the practice in Government, as he \nwell knows, that contingent fees are sometimes made available, not only \nin the IRS, but I believe in other areas of activity as well. As we all \nwitnessed last week, this practice was used in an extremely abusive \nmanner--a manner that should be dealt with. So I can understand the \nSenator's concern and interest in this matter.\n  I appreciate it and would find it acceptable, as far as I am \nconcerned, if he would modify this to make a study, and within a \nlimited time come back. I think we do have a new commissioner that is \nvery effective and is bringing about change. This would help give him \ndirection, and we think this is a matter of critical importance.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Delaware will yield. I say to the \nmanager of the bill, I think also that we focused attention, through \nthe hearings that you have held, newspaper articles written, and \nthrough this amendment, on this practice that I am sure the \ncommissioner will have enough information to come back to us as to \nwhether or not this practice should be continued, modified in some way \nor, as I said, eliminated. So I would be happy to modify this amendment \nso that the commissioner could report back to us within a reasonable \nperiod of time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I think I will make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present and try to reach agreement on the specific \nlanguage.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. \n2676, the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act. We \nhave waited too long for the opportunity to debate this issue and move \nthis legislation. Senate action is coming six months after the House \noverwhelmingly passed this legislation and almost a year after the \nKerrey/Portman Commission issued their recommendations for improving \nand reforming the IRS.\n  It is no wonder the American taxpayer is frustrated and angry. What \nkind of penalty or interest would the IRS levy against a taxpayer who \nwas six months late in filing their taxes?\n  Mr. President, the IRS is an agency out of control. I hear this from \npeople all across my state. They want the IRS reformed. And they want \nit done now.\n  What has this six month delay meant to taxpayers? Since November 5, \n1997 the date the House voted on H.R. 2676, more than 17 million \ntaxpayers have received a collection notice from the IRS; more than 34 \nmillion Americans have contacted the IRS to request assistance or \ninformation--of these calls, more than 16 million did not go through \nand close to 2 million Americans did not get correct answers.\n  This is unacceptable. Had we acted back in November, the impact on \nthese families would have been dramatically different. We did not need \nmore hearings, we needed action.\n  Since November 1997 I have heard from close to 1,200 taxpayers from \nmy state who have written in support of systemwide reforms at the IRS. \nThey have told me of their experiences and frustrations--and I have to \nsay, some are quite disturbing.\n  Mr. President, I want to read some excerpts from a few of these \nletters--which have come from every corner of my state. They really \nhighlight the abuses taking place by the IRS.\n  This comes from a constituent in Moses Lake, Washington. She says:\n\n       We are people who obey the law. If there were things on our \n     tax return which were in error or were questionable, we have \n     no problem with being called to account for it. Nor do we \n     take issue with paying more taxes if we legitimately owed \n     more. However, the way we were treated by a representative of \n     the IRS should never be allowed in any country, let alone \n     ours, which is supposed to be based on presumption of \n     innocence.\n\n  Another letter comes from a constituent in Seattle:\n\n       In 1993, my husband and I bought a franchise and opened our \n     business as sole proprietors. (If we had incorporated, our \n     suffering would be over now). My husband, Craig, had plenty \n     of knowledge and experience in carpentry and built a strong, \n     thriving closet remodeling business. He did not, however, \n     have business tax and accounting training, and he made \n     mistakes in the paying of taxes and filling our paperwork to \n     the IRS. As soon as he recognized his mistake, he alerted the \n     IRS and began to try to make amends.\n       It seemed he had awakened a vicious sleeping dog.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Along with everything else, the IRS randomly cleaned out \n     our bank accounts, as well as those of our children.\n       It seems the IRS has an incentive program for their \n     employees which persuades them to take quick, harsh action, \n     trying to ``get what they can'' and ask questions of the \n     ``customer'' later.\n\n  Finally, from a constituent in Kirkland, WA:\n\n       For the past seven years both my husband and I have lived \n     our lives under the tormenting cloud of the IRS.\n       We had a lien put on our home and the letters began to come \n     of companies wanting to help us with our troubles with the \n     IRS. This was so devastating as we were just starting what we \n     thought would be a beautiful life together. One day I came \n     home to 12 different notices from the IRS I needed to sign \n     for at the Post Office. That is a great way to spend \n     taxpayers' money, don't you think?\n\n  These heavy-handed tactics by the IRS are not acceptable.\n  But this is not the first time I have heard from constituents about \nproblems with the IRS. I knew reform was long overdue. It was not until \nthe release of the Kerrey/Portman Commission report that I realized \nthat it was not just a few bureaucrats abusing their position, but \nrather an agency out of control. An agency with management practices \nthat encouraged abuse of taxpayers; managers who rewarded the most \naggressive and unbending employees; and an agency that viewed taxpayers \nas the enemy.\n  Why is it so critical to enact IRS reform? We can all name many \nreasons why reform is necessary and important, but I think we all have \nto remember that taxpayers are only trying to meet their \nresponsibilities in a democratic society. They are not turning to the \nIRS to apply for benefits or for assistance. They are attempting to \nhonor their financial obligation and commitment to a democratic and \nprogressive society. They are not asking for anything in return but to \nbe treated fairly.\n\n[[Page S4401]]\n\n  Unfortunately, this is not the experience of most taxpayers. This \nfrustration with the IRS jeopardizes compliance with the tax code and \nundermines the faith taxpayers have in our system.\n  Currently, honest taxpayers and businesses pay an average of $1,600 \nper person for those who do not meet their financial obligations. An \nestimated $120 billion a year goes uncollected. We do not need to add \nto this by encouraging more taxpayers to give up.\n  The great thing about this legislation is that it keeps the \ntaxpayer's interest in mind. It simply levels the playing field between \nthe taxpayer, both large and small, and the IRS. What's more effective \nthan forcing the IRS to work in a more fair and even-handed manner?\n  I am particularly pleased this legislation provides relief for \n``innocent spouses'' who find themselves liable for taxes, interest, or \npenalties because of actions by their spouse. This has become a severe \nproblem for many women and children. Following a divorce many women are \nleft to fight the IRS to save their homes and their children's future. \nSpouses who engaged in illegal activities or misrepresented their \nincome to the IRS simply flee and leave. The IRS then attempts to \ncollect from the innocent spouse--who is often easier to locate--as she \nhas custody of the children. It is a little difficult to hide when you \nhave children.\n  The IRS then aggressively pursues these innocent spouses for a debt \nthat they never knew about. If only we could be as aggressive in \ntracking down the billions of dollars in uncollected child support.\n  I urge the Senate to do the right thing today and pass this \nlegislation. No more delays and no more excuses. The American taxpayer \ndeserves better.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2343\n\n  (Purpose: To provide electronic access to Internal Revenue Service \n                      information on the Internet)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, an \namendment offered by Senator Leahy and Senator Ashcroft. It has been \ncleared on both sides. I ask that this amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey], for Mr. Leahy, for \n     himself and Mr. Ashcroft, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2343.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 262, after line 14, add the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``In the case of taxable periods beginning after December \n     31, 1998, the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary's \n     delegate shall establish procedures for all Tax Forms, \n     Instructions, and Publications created in the most recent 5-\n     year period to be made available electronically on the \n     Internet in a searchable database not later than the date \n     such records are available to the public in printed form. In \n     addition, in the case of taxable periods beginning after \n     December 31, 1998, the Secretary of the Treasury or the \n     Secretary's delegate shall, to the extent practicable, \n     established procedures for other taxpayer guidance to be made \n     available electronically on the Internet in a searchable \n     database not later than the date such guidance is available \n     to the public in printed form.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend Chairman Roth and Senator \nMoynihan for their outstanding work on legislation to reform the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS). It is time for the IRS to deliver \nbetter service to the American people. Our nation's taxpayers deserve \nno less.\n  Today, Senator Ashcroft and I are offering an amendment to H.R. 2676 \nbased on the Taxpayers Internet Assistance Act of 1998, S. 1901. Our \nbipartisan legislation requires the IRS to provide taxpayers with \nspeedy access to tax forms, publications and other published guidance \nvia the Internet.\n  Mr. President, I want to praise the Senate Finance Committee, \nChairman Roth, Senator Moynihan, Senator Kerrey and Senator Grassley \nfor their leadership in moving the IRS reform legislation to the full \nSenate. I strongly support the bill approved by the Finance Committee.\n  As the Senate prepares to debate IRS reforms, we must use technology \nto make the IRS more effective for all taxpayers. What better way to do \nthat then to require the IRS to maintain online access to the latest \ntax information. Every citizen in the United States, no matter if he or \nshe lives in a small town or big city, should be able to receive \nelectronically the latest published tax guidance or download the most \nup-to-date tax form.\n  The IRS web page at >http://irs.ustreas.gov< provides timely service \nto taxpayers by increasing electronic access to some tax forms and \npublications. I commend the IRS for its use of Internet technology to \nimprove its services. More information and services should be offered \nonline and not just as a passing fad. Our legislation is needed to \nbuild on this electronic start and lock into the law for today and \ntomorrow comprehensive online taxpayer services.\n  For Tax Forms, Instructions and Publications, our legislation \nprovides for online posting of documents created during the most recent \nfive years, the same period of time that the IRS now keeps these \ndocuments on CD-ROM for Congressional offices. With these common sense \nrequirements, the IRS will be able to enhance its web page with \ncomprehensive tax guidance in a matter of days at little cost to \ntaxpayers under our bipartisan bill. In fact, the Congressional Budget \nOffice has scored our legislation as adding no new direct spending.\n  Thomas Jefferson observed that, ``Information is the currency of \ndemocracy.'' Let's harness the power of the information age to make the \nIRS a truly democratic institution, open to all our citizens all the \ntime. We strongly believe that the IRS must prepare itself for the next \nmillennium now.\n  I thank Senator Ashcroft for his support and urge my colleagues to \nsupport our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2343) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERREY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2342, as modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Is the Reid amendment still the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Reid amendment is the pending business.\n  Mr. REID. I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2342), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle H of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . STUDY OF PAYMENTS MADE FOR DETECTION OF UNDERPAYMENT \n                   AND FRAUD.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall conduct a study and \n     report to Congress on the use of section 7623 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 including--\n       (1) an analysis of the present use of such section and the \n     results of such use, and\n       (2) any legislative or administrative recommendations \n     regarding the provisions of such section and its application.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this amendment addresses a very important \nproblem that we saw in the oversight hearings that the chairman \nconducted, and that is sometimes the payment made to induce an \nindividual to provide evidence against a taxpayer who is violating the \nlaw becomes an incentive to provide evidence that is faulty and the \ntaxpayers end up being abused as a consequence. Normally, a request for \na study would not necessarily go very far. In this case, Commissioner \nRossotti has already launched an investigation by the Criminal \nInvestigation Division, using Mr. Webster,\n\n[[Page S4402]]\n\nformer FBI Director, as the lead who has indicated he wants to get to \nthe bottom of this problem as well. So I believe this modification is a \ngood modification. I am prepared to accept it on this side.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we have reviewed the proposed change in this \namendment. As I understand it, it requires a study to be made on \ninformant payment, that the study must be completed within a year. As I \nsaid earlier, we found there are some serious problems in this area, \nand the modified amendment is satisfactory to this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2342), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2341\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question recurs on the Bond amendment with \n2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we all know the problems of the IRS. They \nare well known. This is a troubled agency. It needs to be turned \naround. This is a good bill, but I think we need to do one thing to \nmake it better. When has a part-time board ever turned around a \ntroubled agency? A part-time board will not do the job. We need a full-\ntime board if they want to change the culture of the agency. A full-\ntime board such as the FTC, the SEC, even the Federal Reserve, can draw \nthe people from all walks of life across the country to make sure the \nculture of the IRS is changed.\n  If you want to do something about the IRS, you have to put into the \nfield a big dog that can back up his bark. Otherwise you have a little \npuppy on the porch that is meowing with the cats. It is not going to \nchange the IRS to put a toothless puppy in as an advisory board. I \nbelieve a full-time board can give us the strength we need for vital \nreform. I ask for support of my amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I was concerned as to where that animal analogy was going \nto go. Again, I appreciate very much what the Senator from Missouri is \ntrying to do. I think the intent is shared both by myself and the \nchairman of the committee. We believe very strongly that this amendment \nwould actually reduce the President's ability to find qualified people \nto come and bring their considerable expertise to assist the \nCommissioner who will be granted new authority to manage the Internal \nRevenue Service to restructure and improve customer service, improve \nthe use of technology, and increase the satisfaction that customers of \nthe IRS get.\n  So although it is well intended--I actually started out where the \nSenator from Missouri is--I believe it will make it more difficult for \nus to get the kind of people the Commissioner needs to serve on this \nboard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Bond \namendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka) is \nabsent due to a death in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I know there are a number of Members who \nwish to speak, so I will keep my comments brief. But first I want to \ncongratulate the chairman of the committee, Chairman Roth, for bringing \nforward this really excellent bill to try to address what have been \nsome extraordinary abuses which have been testified to before his \ncommittee and testified to in other arenas.\n  In my own case, I held a meeting in New Hampshire--a number of \nmeetings, and found that we have had over 75 cases involving complaints \ninvolving the Internal Revenue Service since I have been in the Senate, \nwhich is an extremely high percentage.\n  We held a number of meetings. In one of the meetings, we had a \npresentation that was really disturbing--two presentations, in fact. \nThe first was a fellow who practiced tax law and tax preparation for \nover 27 years who brought in a memo, an actual memo that he had taken \noff the desk of an agent. And the memo stated very bluntly that the IRS \nagents in that arena, in that area, were to collect a specific amount \nof dollars. Not only were they to collect a specific amount of dollars, \nbut they were to collect a specific amount of dollars every month. In \nfact, it went further. It said how much they were supposed to collect \nevery day, almost down to every hour--how much money the agents in that \narea were supposed to collect. It was not collection on the basis of \npeople who legitimately owed taxes; it was collection on the basis of a \nquota system. It was outrageous that such a memo should exist or such \ndirection should occur with this agency.\n  The second instance, which was even more disturbing because it led to \na death, involved a fairly well known case now in New Hampshire of Mrs. \nBarron and Mr. Barron. Mrs. Barron's husband was essentially driven to \nsuicide as a result of the abusive and totally inappropriate tactics \nthat the Service, and a specific member of the Service, used in \npursuing Mr. Barron for collection of taxes that were owed.\n  It was so terrible and so outrageous that it did lead to Mr. Barron's \ndeath and has disrupted and destroyed really Mrs. Barron and her \nfamily. As of today--in fact, I believe it will be announced today--\nMrs. Barron has now finally received, after 5 or 6 years, some slight \nrecompensation from the Internal Revenue Service in that they have \ndropped all action against her and against her husband's estate, and \nstated that they will no longer pursue the liability which they \noriginally alleged was due and which drove this family into such \ndespair. The manner of the collection was just horrific. The way in \nwhich they proceeded was horrific.\n  Of course, we have seen testimony before the Senate committee on \nwhich Chairman Roth has been holding hearings which reflected agents \ncoming into slumber parties and forcing young children to get dressed \nin front of them, at gunpoint essentially, and throwing a household \ninto chaos in that manner.\n  Even a former majority leader of this Senate, Senator Baker, was \nsubject to what amounted to extortion as a result of the activities of \nwhat I think was then a rogue agent pursuing Senator Baker.\n  The instances go on and on. And almost every Member of this Senate, I \nsuspect, has cases in their home State of abuse, of action taken by \nspecific agents which went beyond anything which we in a democracy \nshould tolerate.\n  Thus, this bill is absolutely appropriate because this bill puts the \ntaxpayer back on a level playing field. Instead of treating the \ntaxpayers as if\n\n[[Page S4403]]\n\nthey are guilty until proven innocent--just the exact opposite of the \nway our culture proceeds--this bill puts the burden back on the \nInternal Revenue Service, where the taxpayer can present a reasonable \ncase.\n\n  In addition, this bill says to the spouse, who is just a bystander, \nthat they will not end up being treated unfairly or abused as a result \nof the misdeeds of their husband. And in most instances where the \nspouse simply signs the return, the innocent spouse language in this \nbill is very, very appropriate. And the chance to recover from the IRS \nfor damages which are caused as a result of excessive activity on the \npart of agents who may act outside the reasonable course of collection \nof taxes is also very appropriate in this bill.\n  So this is truly a strong bill. It is dedicated to the purpose of \ntrying to rein in the Internal Revenue Service management activities \nand make the Internal Revenue Service a more responsible agency as it \ndeals with our citizenry. Because the bottom line, quite honestly, in \nour tax collection service, in our tax collection system as a \ndemocracy, is that people have to have confidence; they have to have \nconfidence in the system. They have to have confidence that when they \npay their taxes, they are paying, No. 1, their fair share and, No. 2, \nthey are going to get fair treatment in the manner in which their taxes \nare reviewed. And as people lose that confidence, we will lose \ncompliance.\n  What we have seen basically is that people have lost their confidence \nin the manner in which the Internal Revenue Service pursues the \ncollection of taxes in this country. This bill will hopefully move a \nlarge step down the road towards reestablishing faith in the collection \nprocess that we pursue in this Nation for our tax obligations.\n  It does not get to the underlying problem, of course, which is that \nthe tax laws have become far too complex, far too intricate, have \ngotten to a point of legal mumbo jumbo that very few people can \nunderstand what the tax laws actually say or can even comply with them \nwithout the assistance of professionals. That issue we also need to \naddress as a Congress.\n  We need to simplify, make fairer, make flatter our tax system; make \nit a more comprehensible and understandable tax system. Pending doing \nthat, which I hope we will do in the next year or so, this bill is a \nmajor stride forward in giving the taxpayers fairer and better \ntreatment under the Internal Revenue Service procedures and allowing \ntaxpayers to be treated like citizens of a democracy rather than \ncitizens of a police state.\n  Mr. President, I yield back such time as I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask Senator Allard, do you want to proceed with your \ncomments?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2676.\n  Mr. President, I also want to talk about reform of the Internal \nRevenue Service. The Senate Finance Committee examined this issue last \nyear, and they recently conducted a careful reexamination. I commend my \ncolleagues, particularly the chairman of the Finance Committee, for \ntheir vigilance on this issue.\n  They have worked very hard to identify problems with the Internal \nRevenue Service and to craft legislation to correct the problems that \nwere pointed out during committee hearings.\n  As we saw in the hearings last fall, the IRS has lacked \naccountability for years. The most recent hearings remind us of the \nimportance of reforming this institution.\n  No one can dispute the fact that we must end business as usual at the \nIRS.\n  We must bring accountability and integrity back to the IRS.\n  American citizens should not live in fear of their government.\n  Certainly most IRS employees work diligently and honestly to insure \nthat they administer the nation's tax laws accurately and fairly.\n  But as we have seen, the IRS as an institution has fostered a culture \nthat tolerates and at times even encourages those few who operate \noutside the law.\n  We desperately need reforms to bring to justice those agents and \nelements within the IRS that have so far flauted the law.\n  The best way to curtail the power of the IRS is to simplify our \nnation's tax laws.\n  Congress is the principal entity responsible for the tax code.\n  Frankly, I believe Congress should scrap the current tax system and \nstart fresh with a simple and fair system.\n  The federal tax burden on hard working Americans is excessive and \noverly intrusive, and reform is long overdue.\n  By striking at the heart of the problem with a fairer, flatter tax \nsystem, Congress will put an end to abusive IRS practices.\n  Until Congress is able to pass substantive changes to the nation's \ntax system that the President is willing to sign, we must reform the \nIRS.\n  Senator Roth's bill would create an independent oversight board that \nwould redefine IRS accountability.\n  The board would provide desperately needed oversight of the \nmanagement and operation of the IRS, as well as its enforcement and \ncollection activities.\n  Taxpayers have a right to expect honesty and integrity in their \ndealings with the IRS.\n  In fact, the mission statement of the IRS calls on its employees to \nperform in a manner warranting the highest degree of public confidence \nin their integrity, efficiency, and fairness. Let me repeat that. The \nmission statement of the IRS calls on its employees to perform in a \nmanner warranting the highest degree of public confidence in their \nintegrity, efficiency, and fairness.\n  When this fundamental trust is breached, taxpayers must have adequate \nrecourse.\n  The Senate IRS reform bill gives them the necessary recourse.\n  Taxpayers would have expanded ability to collect damages and expenses \nwhen they are the target of improper IRS actions.\n  Also, agents who take improper actions, such as improper seizures we \nhave heard on this floor, false statements under oath, which was heard \nin the committee, falsifying documents, we heard those before, \nviolation of taxpayer confidentiality, and even harassing a taxpayer, \nwould be terminated under the Senate bill.\n  While it is important to make whole those who have been injured by \nthe IRS, it is even more important to prevent abuses from ever \nhappening.\n  Senator Roth's bill would provide this important protection for \ntaxpayers.\n  Innocent spouses could no longer be held liable for the tax debts of \ntheir spouse, and spousal liability would be limited on joint returns.\n  Thanks to this bill, taxpayers will finally receive due process in \ntheir dealings with the IRS, which I think is a significant part of \nthis bill.\n  IRS agents would have to follow specific procedures before seizing \nassets or filing liens, and they would be prevented from seizing \nsomeone's home for a minor tax liability.\n  The IRS would also be subject to the same Fair Debt collection \nstandards that all other bill collectors in America are required to \nfollow.\n  This year I have met with citizens in all 63 counties of Colorado.\n  In many of those meetings I had, I constantly heard about how \nfrustrating and intimidating it can be to deal with the IRS. The Senate \nIRS reform bill would make it easier for citizens to communicate with \nthe IRS.\n  The bill would require all IRS notices and correspondence to include \nthe name, phone number, and address of an IRS employee that the \ntaxpayer should contact regarding the notice.\n  It would also be easier to contact the IRS with general questions \nsince they would finally be required to publish local phone numbers and \naddresses in the phone book.\n  Unfortunately a few agents have elected to use the IRS as their \npersonal weapon, but the abuse of taxpayers must stop.\n  The IRS must recommit itself to serving the taxpayers.\n  The Senate IRS reform bill is a significant step towards that goal.\n  According to Judge William Downes,\n\n       The conduct of our Nation's affairs always demands that \n     public servants discharge their duties under the Constitution \n     and the laws of this Republic with fairness and a proper \n     spirit of subservience to the people whom they are sworn to \n     serve. Respect for the law can only be fostered if citizens \n     believe that those responsible for implementing and enforcing \n     the law are themselves acting in conformity with the law.\n\n\n[[Page S4404]]\n\n\n  I conclude by saying Congress must pass this legislation to end \nabusive practices and restore American confidence in the IRS.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2344\n\n (Purpose: To examine the transfer pricing enforcement efforts of the \n                       Internal Revenue Service)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Reid from Nevada. I believe the amendment has been \nworked out.\n  Let me describe it briefly. As I describe this amendment, let me say \nthat the issue that is addressed in this bill dealing with the behavior \nof the Internal Revenue Service is an important issue. Stories with \nrespect to hearings that have been held here in recent months, stories \nof abuse and taxpayer harassment, are stories that reflect horrible \nmismanagement, in my judgment, at the Internal Revenue Service.\n  This bill serves notice that that kind of behavior will not ever be \ntolerated at the Internal Revenue Service. This piece of legislation \ngives taxpayers some muscle to fight back when and if this occurs, and \nthis piece of legislation makes some management changes at the Internal \nRevenue Service, some structural changes, to make sure the \nmismanagement does not occur again.\n  Now, there is another issue, however, that is important and this \nissue has not been the subject of hearings. That is the issue of \nenforcement. You must have a tax system to collect the money to do the \nthings we need to do as a country--provide for our common defense, to \npay for roads, to pay for health research, to pay for food safety, to \npay for environment protection. So who pays those taxes? What kind of \nagency collects them and who pays the taxes?\n  We want to make sure our tax laws are enforced sufficiently so that \nsome of the largest economic interests are not getting by paying zero \ntaxes while the working families, who get out, go to work and work all \nday, and have a salary or a wage and have withholding taken out of \ntheir check, pay their taxes because they have no choice and no \nflexibility.\n  A recent study done by the GAO says foreign-controlled corporations \ndoing business in the United States and not paying taxes equal 73 \npercent of all foreign corporations doing business here. Let me say \nthat another way. If you think of the brand names of foreign products \nthat you purchase in this country, just the most common brand names of \ncompanies who sell billions of dollars' worth of products in this \ncountry, and make billions of dollars in net income in this country, \nyou can be sure that some of those names you just thought of are part \nof this 73 percent who do business here, make money here, and pay no \ntaxes here--none, none at all. Seventy-three percent of foreign-\ncontrolled corporations doing business in the United States pay zero in \nFederal income taxes.\n  Now when they come here and compete against a U.S. corporation that \ndoes business only here and must pay taxes only here, they are engaged \nin unfair competition because they do business here tax free while our \ndomestic business pays a tax to our country. This deals with tax \nenforcement.\n  The reason I offer this amendment is I want to just describe in a \nmoment how tax avoidance occurs in this area and why it is important to \nhave an Internal Revenue Service that is making sure these corporations \npay their fair share of taxes in this country as well.\n  There have been a number of studies--a GAO study, a Treasury study, \nan IRS study, a study by two professors from Florida, Pak and \nZdanowicz. Let me show Members what these studies have told us. \nCorporations, in this case foreign corporations doing business in this \ncountry, can simply inflate the cost of what they are selling to their \nU.S. subsidiary that they wholly own, and when they inflate the cost of \nthe product they are selling to their wholly owned subsidiary, their \nsubsidiary in the United States ends up doing a lot of business but \nends up paying no taxes because they say they made no profits.\n  Let me give you an example of pricing. Tweezers. A pair of tweezers \nfor $218. You have been to a drugstore or a grocery store and bought \ntweezers. Did you pay that for tweezers? I don't think so. Tweezers are \npriced at $218 so that a foreign corporation can overcharge to the \ndomestic subsidiary and, therefore, take all the profit out of that \nsubsidiary and claim they made no profit in the United States.\n  How about safety pins for $29 each? That is $29 for a safety pin. \nThat is another way to price your profit out of the United States and \nshow no income and pay no taxes to the United States.\n  How about a toothbrush imported into the United States from France \nfor $18 apiece? Has anybody here bought a toothbrush for $18 apiece \nlately?\n  There is another way to do this, by the way, which is that \ncorporations can have a foreign subsidiary in another country and they \nunderprice their export to that foreign subsidiary, and that tends to \nmove profits away from the United States as well.\n  Let me tell you what they do there. How about a piano, selling a \npiano to a company in Brazil for $50? Or what about tractor tires, \nselling a tractor tire to France for $7.69? Do you think U.S. farmers \nare able to buy a tractor tire for $7.69? How about a bulldozer for \n$551? You all know what a bulldozer looks like. Do you think you can \nbuy that for $551? How about a missile-rocket launcher for $58? That is \nthe way you move income around and end up not paying income tax to the \nUnited States of America, when all the rest of the taxpayers here pay \nthe tax.\n  My point is very simple. How do you enforce what is called arms-\nlength transactions between related corporations? Well, you take all \ntheir transactions and try to put them back together and measure \nwhether they are priced in a way that would represent fair market \nprices. That is like taking two plates of spaghetti and trying to \nattach the ends of the spaghetti. It cannot be done. The result is \nbillions and billions and billions of dollars--some estimates are over \n$40 billion a year--are lost to the U.S. Treasury through massive tax \navoidance, while we are worried about whether people who go to work \nevery day pay their taxes--and they do pay them because they don't have \nany flexibility; they can't get out of it and they can't overprice \ntweezers to $18 and tractor tires to $7.60. They pay their tax.\n  I want the IRS to worry about enforcement of our tax laws with \nrespect to those who are doing business here to the tune of tens of \nbillions of dollars, earning income here to the tune of tens of \nbillions of dollars, and paying zero to this country in taxes. American \nfirms that do business here must pay taxes; so too should foreign \ncompanies.\n  The amendment I offered is very simple. It simply requires the \nInternal Revenue Service Oversight Board that we are creating to \nconduct a study of whether the IRS has the resources needed to prevent \nthe tax avoidance by these companies. In other words, do they have the \nresources to enforce in this area, No. 1; and No. 2, to analyze how \nmuch we are losing in this area of tax avoidance.\n  It is, in my judgment, scandalous. I refer anybody who is interested \nto the study by Pak and Zdanowicz, released not long ago. They are two \nFlorida doctors who say that the U.S. Government was cheated out of \n$42.6 billion in tax revenues in 1997. That is a huge area.\n  I heard all this discussion on the floor about the IRS targeting low-\nincome folks. That represents a different sort of enforcement. That \ndeals with the earned-income tax credit. That is why that is happening. \nWhat about targeting the folks doing business here and not paying taxes \nhere, who are earning billions of dollars every year in the United \nStates in profits and using price transfers to price their income out \nof this country and shield it from the U.S. taxpayer? Shouldn't they \nhave to pay income tax on their profit as well?\n  My amendment requires the oversight board to do certain things and \nreport back to Congress within a year. I hope that perhaps this will \nstimulate some activity to take a look at this area and to see if we \ncan't get the taxes that are owed this country by foreign corporations \ndoing business in this country, making a great deal of money and paying \nnothing--literally zero--in Federal income taxes. My understanding is \nthat this amendment has been cleared on both sides and, if so, I would \nonly need a voice vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept this amendment. \nIt\n\n[[Page S4405]]\n\nrequires a study to be done. I think it is a very important amendment. \nI appreciate the Senator bringing it onto this bill and bringing it to \nour attention. There is a problem with noncompliance; it is a big \nproblem. Indeed, there is a problem in the IRS with noncompliant \ntaxpayers, and Americans believe a problem with the IRS is that people \nwho are complying are being harassed by the IRS. We have spent a lot of \ntime, as is appropriate, dealing with the second category. I appreciate \nwhat the Senator is asking for very much.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, likewise, I am willing to accept the \namendment of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Will the Senator call up his \namendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today we are engaged in a very important \ndebate about the reform of the IRS, but there is another very crucial \ndebate that we also must consider and recognize, and that is the debate \nabout the future of our health care system in the United States--\nparticularly the managed care health care system, which is becoming so \nprominent in America today.\n  I am particularly concerned that children should also be part of this \ndebate and that they deserve the same consumer protections that many \nhave talked about in the context of adult health care plans. Managed \ncare, as we all recognize, plays a very important and critical role in \nour health care delivery system and has provided many benefits. But we \nalso hear repeatedly about instances in which patients--particularly \nchildren--are not served as well as they should be by managed care.\n  I recall one child who was brought to my attention in Rhode Island. A \nyoung child, Morgan Smith, was born in Rhode Island November of 1993. \nShortly after her fourth birthday, Morgan was diagnosed with \nRhabdomyosarcoma, a cancer that attacks any smooth muscle in the body, \nincluding blood vessels. They detected this cancer in Morgan's brain. \nShe was indeed faced with a critical, life-threatening brain tumor.\n  We are fortunate in Rhode Island because we have an excellent \nchildren's hospital, Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence, which is \nthe hospital where Morgan was diagnosed. The pediatric oncologists \nthere determined that the best treatment for Morgan would be to go to \nthe New England Regional Medical Center in Boston for specialized \nchemotherapy. Now, her mother, obviously, was willing to do anything to \ntreat her child and have the best benefits for her child.\n  At that point, the insurance company denied her the ability to bring \nher child to Boston and requested that they get a second opinion. They \ngot that second opinion; it was the same as the first opinion. However, \nthe HMO still refused to authorize the treatment necessary for that 4-\nyear-old child to receive life-saving therapy in Boston.\n  Mrs. Smith literally had to wage war against the HMO to make her \npoint. At the time, she was absolutely crushed by the prospect of her \nyoung child being stricken with a life-threatening brain tumor. She \ndetermined on her own to go to Boston regardless of the consequences, \nrisking her financial future, risking all of the resources that she \nhad, while also having to provide for her other children. Nevertheless, \nshe was bound and determined to provide for Morgan.\n  Fortunately, this story has a happy ending. About a month after \npleading by Mrs. Smith, and by others, the insurance company relented \nand she was granted permission to have the treatment conducted in \nBoston. And the child is doing very well.\n  That is merely one example of the stories we are hearing constantly \nabout managed care and its inability at times to provide the kind of \ncare that most parents think they should get when they pay good money, \nor their employer pays good money, for these managed care plans.\n  There have been studies in parts of the country suggesting that the \nmanaged care plans are not best suited, in many cases, for children. A \nstudy in California by Elizabeth Jameson at the University of \nCalifornia compared managed care plans with the State's Medicaid plan \nfor children. Medicaid plans are sometimes stereotyped as the low-cost \nand, by inference, low-quality health care. This study, however, found \nthat in many respects children in California's Medicaid Program were \ngetting better pediatric care than those enrolled in managed care plans \nin the State.\n  The study found, for example, that some of the managed care plans \nimposed restrictions on referrals to pediatric specialists. They also \nfound that many plan providers were attempting to deal with very \ncomplicated pediatric conditions with which they had little experience.\n  As a result of the anecdotal evidence, as a result of the statistical \nstudies and surveys that have been done in parts of the country, I have \nintroduced S. 1808, the Children's Health Insurance Accountability Act. \nIt is designed to provide an opportunity for children's health to be \nconsidered and focused on in a managed care plan. This act would \nprovide common sense protections for children in managed care plans--\nprotections, for example, that would ensure that a family has access to \nnecessary pediatric services; that they would have appeal rights and \nspecial conditions with respect to children; that they would have \nquality programs that measure outcomes with respect to children and not \njust to adults; that there would be utilization review rules that be \ngeared toward children and not just to adults; that there would be \nchild-specific information in terms of the sale of these plans on care \nprovided to children.\n  There are so many parents who buy plans and think they have coverage \nfor their kid, only to discover in a time of crisis that the coverage \nis not what they thought it was. My legislation would put that \ninformation up front.\n  What I have done with respect to children is consistent with a much \nbroader class of legislation that is attempting to reform managed care \nfor\n\n[[Page S4406]]\n\nthe entire population of patients. The Health Care Bill of Rights, for \nexample, introduced by my Democratic colleagues, is one such plan. My \nlegislation is consistent with this overall thrust to ensure that \nmanaged care continues to operate for the benefit of patients, that \noperates by allowing physicians to provide advice, and not accountants, \nto control the diagnosis and the application of health care.\n  With respect to children, again, the American people are strongly \nsupportive of proposals to give better access through managed care for \npediatric services. In a February 1998 poll by the firm of Lake, Sosin, \nSnell, Perry and Associates and the Tarrance Group--two pollsters, one \nDemocrat and one Republican--it was found that 89 percent of adults \nsurveyed favored having ``Congress require HMOs and other insurance \ncompanies to allow parents to choose a pediatrician as their child's \nprimary care physician.'' And 90 percent favored having ``Congress \nrequire HMOs and other insurance companies to allow parents of children \nwith special care needs, like cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, or \nsevere asthma, to choose a pediatric specialist to be their child's \nprimary care physician.''\n  There is overwhelming public support for these provisions that will \nallow parents to truly and wisely choose coverage for their children \nand have the ability to have pediatric specialists care for their \nchildren.\n  Again, this is consistent with a theme, a message, and a \nresponsibility that we all have; that is, to move in this time \ndecisively, with determination, to ensure that we reform the managed \ncare system, that we provide the benefits of managed care in terms of \npreventive services; in terms of access to physicians, that we do it in \na way that physicians know they are providing the best care for their \npatients and that the consumers of health care know that they can have \naccess to good-quality care.\n  The time to act is now. I join many of my colleagues on an almost \ndaily basis in urging that we take up this matter quickly and that we \nmove forward decisively and pass comprehensive managed care for all of \nour citizens, but particularly for our children.\n  I thank you, Mr. President. I yield my time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/06/senate-section/article/S4405-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4406-S4409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2347\n\n(Purpose: To require 1 member of the Internal Revenue Service Oversight \n            Board to be a representative of small business)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of offering an \namendment on behalf of myself and Senator Bond.\n  Yesterday, I spoke at some length about the issue of small business \nand the Internal Revenue Service. In that statement I pointed out that \nsmall business is a peculiarly affected part of the American economy as \nit relates to the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Small business, as we know, is the fastest growing sector of our \neconomy. Typically, management has multiple responsibilities and does \nnot have the kind of access to a panoply of expertise in accounting and \nlaw as a larger business would have. Oftentimes the small \nbusinessperson and those associated with the small business are in \ntheir own learning curve as to what requirements of compliance might \nbe.\n  Therefore, it is my feeling as we look at this reform of the IRS that \nwe should pay some special attention to how this will evolve in terms \nof its application to small businesses. As we know, one of the \nprincipal elements of this reform is the establishment of an IRS \nOversight Board. This oversight board has the responsibility of being \nboth the window of the Government onto the taxpayer, and the taxpayer \nback to the Government. So it serves an especially important role of \nunderstanding and communication.\n  The legislation is written so that three of the members of the nine-\nmember oversight board are ex officio--the Secretary of the Treasury, \nthe IRS Commissioner, and a representative of IRS employees. The other \nsix appointees are Presidential appointments, and according to the \ncurrent draft of the legislation these six appointees must possess \nexpertise in the following areas: management of large service \norganizations, customer service, Federal tax laws, information \ntechnology, organization development, and needs and concerns of \ntaxpayers.\n  The amendment that I am offering will add an additional category of \nexpertise to be represented among the six Presidential appointees and \nthat is the needs and concerns of small business. It is the expectation \nthat the President would appoint six individuals, and his \nresponsibility would be to assure that those six had a sufficient range \nof backgrounds that they would be able to cover the six and, if this \namendment is added, the seventh requirement.\n  I think it is extremely important that among the six people who are \nappointed as Presidential appointees to the oversight board for the \nInternal Revenue Service there be represented in that six one or more \nindividuals who understand the needs and concerns of small businesses \nof America and can assure that those concerns are effectively \ncommunicated to the management and administration of the Internal \nRevenue Service and, if necessary, the Congress, for appropriate \nchanges in law.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator \nBond, joins me in this effort. I want to commend him for his thorough \nanalysis of the IRS bill as it affects small business and for including \nthis provision in his legislation.\n  So, Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment which would add to \nthe requirements for those persons who are serving on the IRS Oversight \nBoard that there be included expertise in the needs and concerns of \nsmall business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2347:\n       On page 176, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       ``(vii) The needs and concerns of small businesses.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  I ask for immediate consideration of this amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, we would be prepared on this side to \naccept what I consider to be a very, very good amendment. The idea of \nthis board is to give the President authority to select from a wide \nrange of experiences that will assist the Commissioner of the Internal \nRevenue Service in managing the agency, and the Commissioner has \nalready indicated--indeed, we are going to help him follow through--his \npreference to manage the IRS much differently than it currently is.\n  The IRS is currently managed using a three-tiered system that we \nadopted in 1952. There are regional and district offices, multiple \noffices, and you have all different kinds of taxpayer needs taken care \nof in each one of these district offices.\n  What the Commissioner has indicated he wants to do is reorganize \nalong functional lines. Function No. 1 is large business of which I \nbelieve there are 7- or 800,000, individual taxpayers would be function \nNo. 2, small business No. 3, and nonprofits No. 4.\n  So what the Commissioner is already attempting to do, and this law \nwould direct him, is to entirely or completely eliminate the three \ntiers in favor of this kind of functional organization. But what he is \nalready recognizing is that taxpayer needs vary not according to their \ngeography but according to the category of the taxpayer. One of the \nlargest and most important categories of radically different needs than \nthe other three is small business.\n  So what the Senator from Florida is doing is adding to the list of \nrequirements the President would have to consider when making a \nselection, and that would be some small business experience which \nreinforces very much\n\n[[Page S4407]]\n\nthe other section of this bill, which directs the Commissioner to \neliminate, as much as possible, the three-tier system in favor of this \nfunctional system of organization.\n  So I think it is a very good amendment. It is one of these amendments \nthat just has a few words in it. There is a lot more to this amendment \nthan meets the eye. I think with the addition of a small business \nexperience, this board is much more likely to be able to carry out its \nfunction, and that is to provide the kind of consistent oversight and \nadvice the Commissioner needs to manage this very important agency.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I think we are all in agreement as to the \nimportance of small business. Certainly, the current success of our \neconomy has depended in large part on the contribution of small \nbusiness. For that reason, from this side I agree that we should accept \nthe amendment, and so do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2347) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, during the last couple of months, in every \nhousehold across the country, Americans went through an annual rite. \nThey sat down at the kitchen table, pulled all their financial records \ntogether, and figured out what they owed the Government in taxes.\n  Nobody likes doing their taxes. And people dislike paying them even \nmore. Yet the vast majority of our citizens do pay their taxes. And \nthey pay them honestly.\n  In short, Americans expect their money to be used to pay for all of \nthe things that help make this nation great. In return, though, the \nAmerican people want their Government to do two things.\n  First, the American people want their Government to treat them with \nrespect and dignity as the revenue is being collected. They expect to \nhave their privacy respected, and to be treated fairly.\n  Second, Americans expect that everyone else who enjoys the benefits \ntaxes pay for will shoulder their share of the burden. That their \nneighbor down the street isn't hiding part of his income, and thus \navoiding paying his fair share of the tax. That everyone is filing \nreturns, and that the amounts claimed on those returns are accurate and \ntrue.\n  Mr. President, I truly believe the American people have the right to \nhave both of these expectations met. And I believe we here in the \nSenate shoulder a great deal of the responsibility for making sure of \nit.\n  Chief Justice John Marshall said: ``The power to tax involves the \npower to destroy.'' It is our duty as Senators to make sure this \ncountry does not use its power in that fashion.\n  Running the IRS is a study in careful balances. And I believe that \nthe IRS has somehow lost its ability to maintain one side of the \nequation over the years.\n  Many tax collectors, in their zeal to catch those among us who don't \npay their taxes, seem to have lost sight of the most important truth \nabout our tax system--that citizens have rights that must be protected.\n  Anything less undermines our ability to make a system of voluntary \ntaxation work.\n  Here's a graphic example of how the system has gotten out of whack. \nIt's contained in a recent letter from one of my constituents. It's a \nplea for help:\n\n       The problem with the IRS started in 1997. John [not his \n     real name] and I had just bought a house. I was a semester \n     away from graduating from college, and we thought the \n     [failed] business was behind us. The last week in July 1997, \n     I returned home after a day of working at my part-time job to \n     find a nasty note on my front door from [an IRS agent] \n     stating that he had `tracked' us down and expected a phone \n     call or action would be taken. I promptly called him to find \n     out the reasoning behind the note. He was very rude and \n     reluctant to give me any information, because I [was not my \n     husband]. I explained that I was his wife and he began \n     talking to me in a degrading manner. He said, ``Your husband \n     owes tax, and I expect to collect it in full.'' When I asked \n     him to explain, he very quickly said it was for [my husband's \n     failed business] and began treating me as a criminal who was \n     running from the IRS.\n       We feel we have not been treated fairly in this situation. \n     We have attempted to make good on all other situations \n     regarding this [failed] business and have not been hiding \n     from the IRS. [The IRS agent] has been extremely rude and \n     unsympathetic toward us. He has put a tax lien on everything \n     we own. He has also made comments to our accountant \n     indicating that he has been tracking our personal lives and \n     mentioning purchases and other personal matters. In [the IRS \n     agent's] eyes we are criminals cheating the government. In \n     our eyes the government is cheating us by never giving us a \n     fair chance to make good. This whole situation has cost us \n     over $700 in accounting fees and is still unresolved. We are \n     turning to you as a final attempt to resolve this problem. We \n     hope you can help us in making the government work for the \n     people not against them.\n\n  That letter sums up this issue in a nutshell: Make the Government \nwork for the people, not against them. Make Government responsive to \ntaxpayers' needs. Make service the priority of the Internal Revenue \nService. Make the IRS treat taxpayers fairly--and with respect. That's \nwhat my constituent wants. And that's what I want.\n  We certainly don't want to tie IRS's hands so much that tax cheats \nare encouraged. The rest of us end up picking up the tab when someone \ncheats. At the same time, we also can't have IRS harassing innocent \ncitizens, assuming everyone is guilty the minute they walk in the door.\n\n  I believe this legislation will help IRS find its way back to the \nreasonable balance that our tax system requires.\n  The IRS has suffered from years of neglect and lack of focus. The \nspotlight that has been turned on the Service, by the IRS Restructuring \nCommission and by the series of hearings we have held in the Senate \nFinance Committee, has already had a positive effect on the IRS.\n  The Service is expanding hours and people for its telephone answering \nservice. Taxpayers got 13 million fewer busy signals this year when \nthey called IRS to ask questions about their taxes. Toll-free calls are \nbeing answered 91% of the time--a huge improvement. Last year callers \nonly got through 66% of the time, and only 39% of the time the year \nbefore. This year, phone lines are being answered 18 hours a day. And \nfor the first time, the IRS is open on Saturdays.\n  People answering the phones are also getting better. One group of \nBaltimore IRS workers gave correct advice to 100% of recent random test \ncalls. Nationally, accuracy scores are up to 93% this year, from only \n63% as recently as 1989.\n  So more taxpayers are able to get through to the IRS when they have a \nquestion, and more of the answers they will get will be the right ones.\n  IRS has a webpage where taxpayers can download documents and forms. \nNow taxpayers don't have to run all over town just to find the right \npaperwork.\n  And the Service has had a series of ``Problemsolving Days'' around \nthe country, where taxpayers can come in and get their problems taken \ncare of. The last ``Problemsolving Day'' in my home state of Montana \nwas in Billings in January. More than half of all the taxpayers who \nparticipated walked out with their problems taken care of on the spot. \nMany of the rest have been resolved in the succeeding weeks.\n  But there are still problems at the IRS, as our hearings--and my \nconstituent's letter and plea for help--have clearly identified. And \nmany of the improvements planned by our new IRS Commissioner, Charles \nRossotti, require legislative action in order to go forward.\n  The bill before us is a very good beginning. It addresses the first \nexpectation the American people share--making sure the Government \ntreats them with respect and dignity as the revenue is being collected. \nIt does this through a series of provisions.\n  First, the bill creates a board, made up chiefly of private citizens, \nto oversee the direction the IRS is going. The Board will keep an eye \non the Service's budget, to make sure enough resources are being \ndedicated to customer service. It will help define long-term goals, and \nmake sure the Service stays on track to meet those goals. The Board \nwill ferret out problems at the IRS, and help craft solutions to those \nproblems.\n  The bill creates significant new personnel flexibilities to make it \neasier for Commissioner Rossotti to get his\n\n[[Page S4408]]\n\nown team on board and reward employees who are doing well. It requires \nthe IRS to submit an employee training plan to Congress, to help \nemployees improve the quality of their work. The bill requires IRS to \ntell Congress about taxpayer complaints of misconduct by employees, and \nto take disciplinary action against ``bad apples''. The bill also makes \nit easier for IRS employees to provide confidential information to the \nFinance and Ways and Means Committees to report allegations of employee \nmisconduct or taxpayer abuse.\n  The bill will reorganize the IRS, much as IBM was reorganized when \nthey realized they couldn't compete against newcomers like Microsoft. \nRight now, IRS is organized horizontally, by function. This means every \ntime a taxpayer has a question or a problem that crosses the Services' \nfunctional lines, they are handed off to a different person in an \nentirely different department. No one has final responsibility to \ngetting the taxpayer's problem solved.\n  There is no accountability.\n  This bill reorganizes the agency by type of taxpayer. There will be a \nseparate division for individuals, one for small businesses, one for \nlarge corporations, and one for tax exempt organizations. Employees \nwithin these divisions will be responsible for just about every type of \nproblem their assigned group of taxpayers could have. They will stick \nwith the taxpayer until his problem is solved.\n  No more passing the buck.\n  The bill also adds important new taxpayer protections to the law, to \nhelp protect citizens against arbitrary actions of IRS agents.\n  The bill will allow taxpayers to sue for negligent actions by IRS \nagents. Today they must meet a very high treshold by proving any abuse \nwas intentional.\n  The bill expands the offers-in-compromise program. It makes it harder \nfor IRS to turn down legitimate offers. The bill also requires IRS to \nleave taxpayers with more money to live on when they enter into \nrepayment agreements.\n  In our hearings, taxpayers complained about the difficulty of using \ninnocent spouse protections. The House and Senate bills take different \napproaches to solving this problem. Both make it easier for truly \ninnocent spouses to be protected from the tax debts their guilty \nspouses have accumulated.\n  These are only a few examples of the taxpayer protections built into \nthe legislation.\n  Finally, the bill before us today takes a first step toward \naddressing what may be the biggest contributor to taxpayer problems \nwith our Tax Code--Congress itself. Witness after witness at our \nhearings complained about the complexity of the Code. Witness after \nwitness complained about how hard it is to keep up with frequent \nchanges we make in the law. And they are right.\n  This bill requires that every tax bill in the future be accompanied \nby an analysis of whether it will further complicate the Code. How hard \nit will be for taxpayers to comply with the new law. As we strive to \nachieve fairness in our Tax Code, we sacrifice simplicity. With this \nbill, we will be able to clearly understand the extent of that \nsacrifice.\n  I believe that one of the hardest things to do when restructuring any \nagency, and particularly one as sensitive as this one, is to find that \ndelicate balance between giving the Government too much power and \ngiving it too little.\n  Give it too much power, and innocent citizens will be abused. This \nis, obviously, unacceptable in a civilized society. Even one single \ninstance of taxpayer abuse is one too many.\n  Law abiding taxpayers should not fear the taxman.\n  But clipping the Government's wings too closely presents its own \ndangers. Americans expect us to make sure everyone is sharing the \nburden of paying for the services our Government provides. And it is \nclear some of us are not. IRS estimates the ``tax gap'', which is the \nmeasure of tax avoidance, now is almost $200 billion a year. This \namounts to more than $1,600 per year for every tax return filed by the \nrest of us.\n  This, too, must stop. Our entire system of collecting revenue would \nunravel if taxpayers stop paying their fair share because they believe \neveryone else is cheating.\n  The bill before us today is not perfect.\n  It does not address the problem of tax non-compliance. We have left \nthat challenge for another day.\n  There are provisions in it that may seem good at first blush, but may \ncause more harm than good. We should try to fix these as the bill goes \nthrough the legislative process.\n  But I firmly believe we must not let the perfect be the enemy of the \ngood. We must not let yet another tax season go by without the taxpayer \nprotections this bill provides.\n  Passing a solid restructuring bill will do more to get the IRS on \ntrack than a hundred hearings where we sit, posture, pontificate and \nplay politics.\n  It is our responsibility to the American people to get this job done \nquickly, and to get it done right. I want to be able to go back to the \nconstituent who wrote me that letter and say, Yes, we fixed your \nproblem. And, Yes, the Government works for you, not against you.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about IRS \nreform and overall reform of the tax system.\n  Paramilitary-style raids, attempted frame-ups, retaliation against \nwhistle blowers, harassment of innocent individuals, all carried out by \na Government agency oftentimes operating outside the bounds of the law \nand with seemingly limitless authority. A premise played out within the \npages of the latest popular novel? Not exactly. These examples, \nunearthed during recent hearings here in the Senate, are taken directly \nfrom the playbook of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  The hearings, and the abuses they highlighted, have focused the \nnation's attention on the ``IRS Restructuring and Reform Act'' that is \nnow before the Senate. Included within the legislation are many good \nprovisions that would protect taxpayer rights and restrict the power of \nthe agency. Key provisions would limit interest and penalties on \ndelinquent taxes and shift the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the \nIRS in tax disputes.\n  Before I continue, Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to commend Senator Roth, the Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, for his tremendous efforts to reform the IRS and his \nleadership on tax relief.\n  I also commend the Chairman for holding the series of oversight \nhearings that exposed the abuses upon taxpayers carried out by the IRS. \nAll of us are greatly indebted to Senator Roth for that. He has done an \noutstanding job to formulate a sound and responsible IRS restructuring \nplan.\n  If enacted, these reform provisions before us today would improve IRS \nservice, make the agency more accountable, and provide better \nprotections for the taxpayers. I fully agree with Senator Roth that the \ngoal of IRS reform should be to make the IRS ``a service-oriented \nagency instead of a law-enforcement agency.''\n  Still, Mr. President, a fundamental question remains: can the IRS \nreally be fixed by reform without scrapping the Tax Code? To answer \nthis, we need to take a closer look into the problems with the IRS.\n  The passage in 1913 of the 16th amendment to the Constitution granted \nCongress the power to impose an income tax. A tiny division of the \nBureau of Internal Revenue Service was created to collect the taxes. \nEighty-five years later, this division, now known as the IRS, has grown \nto become the most powerful agency in the entire Federal Government.\n  The IRS today employs more investigative agents than the FBI and the \nCIA combined, and boasts a total workforce of more than 100,000. It is \nhard to believe, but more employees work at the IRS than in all but the \n36 largest corporations in this country. The decisions its bureaucrats \nmake daily affect every American who takes home a paycheck.\n  The agency's job is to administer and enforce the Nation's tax laws \nand collect tax revenue for the Government. To ensure that all \nAmericans pay their taxes, Congress has given the agency almost \nunlimited power--power that\n\n[[Page S4409]]\n\ngoes beyond the authority granted to any other agency in the Federal \nGovernment.\n  By law, the IRS can audit individuals or businesses. It can impose \npenalties and impose a lien on a taxpayer's property or bank accounts, \nor seize them altogether. Average taxpayers and small business owners \nhave few little administrative or legal remedies against such a \npowerful agency.\n  Its unlimited power has made the IRS a wasteful, arrogant, \nincompetent, intrusive, and abusive agency. The IRS is driven by \nillegal quotas and collection goals. It has targeted the \nunderprivileged for audits. It has mistreated hundreds of thousands of \ninnocent taxpayers. Clearly, this is an agency out of control, an \nagency in need of a complete overhaul.\n\n  But let us not forget how the IRS reached this troubled point. \nCongress deserves much of the blame for the present state of our \nhostile tax system, for it is Congress that created the IRS in the \nfirst place.\n  Congress grants the IRS its unlimited power. Congress writes the \ncomplicated Tax Code that taxes Americans' income over and over and \nprovides loopholes to thousands of special groups, making the Tax Code \ntoo complicated for even most attorneys and tax accountants to fully \nunderstand. Congress requires the IRS to squeeze more tax money out of \nthe taxpayers so that Congress has more to spend. On top of that, \nCongress does not have time to fully exercise its IRS oversight \nresponsibilities. Even while it talks reform, Congress is making the \nTax Code ever more burdensome--since last year, Congress has added 185 \nnew sections and 824 changes to the Tax Code.\n  Most IRS employees are decent, hardworking people who face an \nimpossible task: interpreting and applying the hundreds of thousands of \npages of the Tax Code and its related regulations. A recent study shows \nthat more than 8 million Americans each year receive incorrect bills or \nrefunds due to IRS errors. Each year, Money magazine hires 50 \nprofessional tax preparers to calculate a return for a sample family. \nNo two preparers have ever had the same result; answers can vary by \nthousands of dollars. It just shows that the Tax Code is confusing and \narbitrary, and this in turn encourages waste, harassment, corruption \nand abuse.\n\n  Tinkering with the system by merely restructuring the IRS will not \nsolve its fundamental flaws. It is clear that the real problem with the \nIRS is not management, or administration, but the Tax Code on which all \nIRS decisions are based. This is such an ugly agency it is hard to make \nit pretty by reforms.\n  We can replace the IRS management, we can improve its service, crack \ndown on abuses, increase its efficiency, and reduce its waste, but the \nfundamental problems will not go away. Reorganizing the IRS without \nreal reform of the Tax Code will send a false signal to the American \npeople that once we restructure the IRS, all its problem will be solved \nand there will be no need to reform our tax system. Unfortunately, as \nthe history books reveal, it is not that easy.\n  We have tried to overhaul the IRS in the past, and somehow the agency \nalways comes back more powerful and more abusive than ever before. At \nleast two versions of a ``taxpayer bill of rights'' previously enacted \ninto law have had little effect in taming the IRS. Even after last \nyear's IRS abuse hearings, which resulted in promised reforms, the \nabuses continue.\n  Mr. President, let me make this clear: it is vitally important that \nwe continue our efforts to reform the IRS, and I strongly support \nChairman Roth's work and his legislation. My point is that we should \nnot let this debate delay or derail real tax reform--to delay us from \ncarrying out the demands of the taxpayers to scrap the Tax Code and \nreplace it with one that is simpler, flatter, fairer, and friendlier.\n  This Chamber already passed a resolution to sunset the Tax Code. Now \nwe should set a date to establish a new tax system. Once we have \neliminated the Tax Code, there will be little, if any, need for the IRS \nand its playbook or its abuses.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent to be able to speak as in morning \nbusiness for 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I certainly would not object, but I ask \nthe chairman if I might be able to speak for 8 minutes by unanimous \nconsent following Senator Conrad.\n  Mr. ROTH. A total of 20 minutes then. The manager has no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I rose 2 days ago to alert my colleagues \nto the economic disaster that is befalling North Dakota with a dramatic \ndrop in farm income. And I showed this chart; the headline: ``North \nDakota Farm Incomes Washed Away In 1997,'' that showed from 1996 to \n1997 farm income dropped 98 percent in North Dakota.\n  In fact, in 1997, the total farm income in the entire State of North \nDakota, one of the most agricultural States in the Nation, was down to \nonly $15 million--$15 million--of farm income spread among 30,000 \nfarmers. That was a farm income per farm of only $500.\n  Mr. President, the Wall Street Journal yesterday had a front page \narticle entitled ``Off the Land,'' and they confirmed the basic \noutlines of the story that I ve been telling for the last 2 days on the \nSenate floor. And in their front page story, they pointed out, ``On the \nNorthern Plains, Free-Market Farming Yields Pain, Upheaval. After \nDeregulation, Drop In Wheat Prices Compels Many Growers to Quit. The \nEffect Spreads South.''\n  Mr. President, the article in the Wall Street Journal goes on to \nreport that:\n\n       Cheap wheat and bad weather are doing to Nathan Johnson \n     what they couldn't do to three preceding generations of his \n     farming family.\n       They are defeating him.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a story from northwestern Minnesota, but it is \nidentical to what is happening right across the border in northern \nNorth Dakota.\n  This story goes on to say:\n\n       Last year, a disease called scab wiped out half the wheat \n     [that Mr. Johnson] planted on the land around his family's \n     1887 homestead near the Canadian border. And now, a glut of \n     foreign wheat is pushing down the grain's price at the local \n     elevator to an unprofitable $3 a bushel. These days, Mr. \n     Johnson is trying to rent out his land and looking for work \n     in the city.\n\n  Mr. President, the article goes on to say:\n\n       Across the Northern Plains, the long migration away from \n     agriculture is turning into a stampede. From Montana to \n     Minnesota, thousands who made their living growing wheat are \n     quitting the prairie. A blizzard of barnyard auctions is \n     sending chills down the Main Streets of the towns that live \n     off farmers.\n\n  One man is quoted as saying:\n\n       ``We're doing a sale every day,'' says Brad Olstad of \n     Steffes Auctioneers Inc. in Fargo, N.D. ``Wheat is a dying \n     crop.''\n\n  And wheat, of course, is the commodity that goes to make bread, to \nmake pasta; and they are talking here about it being a dying commodity.\n\n       Bad years are nothing new around here. Wheat prices were \n     lower in 1990, when a similar coincidence of bumper harvests \n     around the globe swamped the market. The drought of 1988 \n     destroyed wheat fields. But none of that was as deadly to \n     farmers as what is happening now: deregulation.\n       Two years ago, Uncle Sam began withholding from the \n     decades-old business of protecting farmers against the \n     vagaries of weather and markets. Grain and cotton farmers no \n     longer receive ``deficiency'' payments when prices are below \n     target levels. Shelved, too, was the disaster-aid program \n     that pumped $18 million into Kennedy--\n\n  This is a small town in Minnesota that is being reported on in the \nJournal article--\n\n     and the rest of Kittson County after the 1988 drought.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The bottom line: Many of Kittson County's farmers are \n     suffering their biggest financial losses ever. ``Deregulation \n     is turning into a disaster for us,'' says Duane A. Lyberg, \n     president of the Northwestern State Bank.\n\n  Now, that tells you something about the depths of this disaster. It \nis not just farmers reporting on it, not just, as I reported yesterday, \nimplement dealers or other suppliers to farmers; but now the bankers \nare reporting to us what a financial disaster they are facing.\n\n[[Page S4410]]\n\n  In fact, I just completed 2 weeks of meetings across the State of \nNorth Dakota. And in every small town where I went, the bankers took me \naside and said, ``Senator, there is something radically wrong in \nagriculture. Our farmers are not cash flowing. And they're not going to \ncash flow.''\n  In North Dakota, the Journal article reports:\n\n       So many are throwing in the towel that state officials got \n     a federal grant last month to retrain hundreds of growers for \n     other jobs. ``I've never seen it as bad as this,'' says Roger \n     Johnson, North Dakota Commissioner of Agriculture.\n\n  They go on in this article to quote the former Secretary of \nAgriculture of the United States, and he says the following:\n\n       Unless the bankers get worried, nothing will get changed in \n     Congress, says Bob Bergland, Agriculture Secretary during the \n     Carter administration, who lives in nearby Roseau, where his \n     family grows wheat. ``The hourglass is running out for a lot \n     of farmers around here.''\n\n  That is the truth. We are in desperate trouble in the northern \nplains.\n  Let me just conclude with a final paragraph from the Wall Street \nJournal article.\n\n       Jim Tunhelm, the state legislator here, sits at his dining-\n     room table, pointing all around him, in the direction of \n     farmers he knows who are quitting. ``Arnold, Lamar, Troy,'' \n     he says. He stops at eight. ``They should have called it \n     `Freedom to go broke.' [As he referred to the so-called \n     Freedom to Farm bill we passed here in Congress in 1996.] \n     We're going to disappear at this rate,'' [he concludes.]\n\n  That is the hard reality of what is happening in my home State. A 98-\npercent reduction in farm income in 1 year. Thousands of farmers \nleaving the land.\n  I started this series of reports 3 days ago. I pointed out that North \nDakota had experienced this enormous drop in farm income. Yesterday, I \nreported on what others are saying who are close to the farm economy. \nToday, I am able to report the Wall Street Journal is confirming, in \nthis front page story, precisely what I have been saying.\n  The fact is, we have a stealth disaster in North Dakota. It is \nbrought on by low prices, by disease, and by weak Federal policy, a \nfarm bill that does not sustain farmers in the bad times, or at least \nallow them to continue, and the lack of disaster program. The only \ndisaster program we have now is low-interest loans.\n  So the Federal Government is saying to those farmers, those family \nfarmers who dot the countryside, ``If you are in trouble, go deeper \ninto debt.'' That can't be the answer. We must do better.\n  I urge my colleagues to pay attention because this isn't just a \nmatter for North Dakota. Yes, we are in the first trench, but it is \njust a matter of time before others experience what we are experiencing \nnow.\n  I thank the chair.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I very much thank the Senator from North Dakota for \ndrawing the Senate's attention to the Wall Street Journal article, and, \nmore importantly, to the plight of our farmers in the northern Great \nPlains.\n  The article mentioned Montana and Minnesota. The Senator is \nabsolutely correct. I have never seen it this bad. Just last weekend \nwhen I was home a banker pulled me aside and said virtually what you \nsaid, Senator; namely, it is getting so bad the bankers are getting \nworried about their loans and whether they will be repaid. It is true, \nthe farmers can't cash flow. It is grim.\n  I urge farm organizations to dig down deep, put their heads together \nand come up with a solution that we, the Congress, can help with.\n  We passed Freedom to Farm. Most farmers in my State supported it at \nthe time because the wheat price was high and the initial payments were \nhigh. We all knew the day would come when we would be paying the price \nfor adopting that bill but it has come a lot earlier. It has come this \nyear rather than a couple, 3 years from now and with much more \nstrength. It is hurricane force and will drive more farmers off the \nland. Small towns in eastern Montana are drying up. People are leaving. \nYou see shops on the main street boarded up. It is because the price of \nwheat, barley, and durum is so low and has been so low at a time when \nour Government has not done what it should be doing.\n\n  This is true of all administrations--to open up foreign markets, get \nthose countries to reduce their barriers so we can sell more overseas. \nI am thinking particularly of China. China does not take Pacific \nNorthwest wheat. It has not for years because of a bogus claim. That is \none of the many examples of countries erecting trade barriers that make \nit difficult for us to sell a product.\n  I very much thank the Senator for raising this issue. I urge Senators \nto listen to the Senator's statement because we are going to be facing \nthis issue here in the Senate fairly soon. I hope this is constructive \nin addressing the problems that the Senator mentions. It is happening \nin spades, today, in Montana, particularly eastern Montana.\n  I thank the Senator and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, Senator Conrad has raised the farm issue \nthe last several days on the floor of the Senate, and I appreciate the \ncomments he has made, as well as the comments of the Senator from \nMontana.\n  This is not just about dollars and cents. And it is not just a lesson \nin economics. My great-grandmother homesteaded in North Dakota when her \nhusband died. She took six kids and homesteaded on the prairie, pitched \na tent, homesteaded 160 acres, and began to run a farm. It was a hard, \ntough life, I am sure. Farming is not easy. They live out in the \ncountry. They have a yard light burning at night. Farmers get up in the \nmorning to do chores, and they work all day. If they have enough money \nto put in a spring crop and plant some seeds, they wonder whether the \ngrasshoppers will come, whether crop disease will come, whether it will \nhail and wipe out their crop. Maybe none of that will happen and they \nwill raise a crop and that crop will come out of the ground. Then they \nwill combine it in the fall and they wonder, will there be a price so \nthey can sell the crop at something more than it cost to produce.\n  The answer, sadly, except for one year in the past 20 years has been \nno. There is no price for your crop above the full economic costs of \nproduction. You do what you love to do and you lose money.\n  The article in the Wall Street Journal referenced today by Senator \nConrad talks about these farmers who decide they can't do this anymore. \nThey just quit. They have to quit.\n  I had a banker call me about two hours ago and he said, ``You know we \nonly call when there are real problems, and you know I have one of the \nmost conservative banks in the state.'' He said, ``The fact is I am now \nturning away good farmers. Year after year after year I have given them \noperating loans to go into the field in the spring. I can't do it this \nyear because they can't cash flow. And they will have to quit \nfarming.'' He said, ``That is what is happening out here in rural \nAmerica.''\n  One might ask, why does it matter? And some people in this Chamber \nthink it doesn't matter who farms. Why does it matter that we have a \nfamily farmer out on the land? Well, you can have corporate \nagrifactories gassing up their big tractors and farming coast to coast \nand you won't have anybody living out in rural America.\n  Is there a difference between having a network of family farms, and \nfarm families that dot the landscape of this country, versus having \ncorporate agrifactories that gather up land by the sections and the \ntownships and the counties and then farm as far as the eye can see \nforever? Is there a difference? It seems to me there is a huge \ndifference for this country.\n  For social and economic reasons, this country ought to care about \nhaving a network of families out on the farms in this country being \nable, year after year, to produce food for this country. If we continue \nto go in the direction we are headed, we will see thousands and \nthousands of family farmers leaving the land. It is because we have a \nfarm policy that says you can't make a living out there. It tells \nfamily farmers you can't make it. Then this country will have lost \nsomething significant.\n\n  The seedbed of family values in this country that we hear so much \nabout has always been the family farm. These\n\n[[Page S4411]]\n\nvalues roll in from the seedbed of the family farm into small towns and \ninto America's cities. We will lose something important in this country \nif we do not decide family farms are important and that we will do \nsomething to try to protect them.\n  Some say in this Chamber, let farmers operate in the free market. \nWell, there is no free market. Do you think farmers can raise a cow and \nship it to China? I think not. Can they raise a pig and sell it in \nChina? I don't think so. Do you think farmers can compete against \nCanada, which sends unfairly subsidized durum into our markets? Can \nfarmers compete against the European communities that subsidize their \ncommodities at 8, 10, and even 12 times the level of U.S. subsidies in \nrecent years in trying to get foreign markets for European wheat? Is \nthat fair? Is that free? I don't think so. Yet, we tell our farmers, \nyou just go ahead and operate in that marketplace. We will just call it \nfree.\n  What happens in this free marketplace? What happens is that the \npeople who haul the grain make record profits.\n  The people who process the grain make record profits. The people who \ntrade the grain make record profits.\n  The only people who suffer the losses year after year, sufficient so \nthat they are now going out of business in record numbers, are the \npeople who buy the tractors, get up in the morning and plant the seed \nin the ground, harvest the crop in the fall, and try to sell it. Those \nare the people who are losing money.\n  You go to your grocery store and ask yourself a question. When the \nprice of wheat was $4.50 or $5.50 a bushel and it plummeted to $3.30 a \nbushel, ask yourself what happened to the price of a loaf of bread in \nthe grocery store. Did you see that price come down? I don't think so. \nHow about when the price of beef plummeted? Did you go to the meat \ncounter in your grocery store and see that the price of beef came down? \nI don't think so.\n  What does it say about this economic system of ours when we say to \nthe people who do the hard work, the people who wear the work clothes, \nand start the tractor, and plow the ground, and plant the seed, and \nharvest: ``You can't make any money. It is everybody else in this \nprocess who can make record profits. But if you grow the seed, you lose \nmoney.''\n  When they take that wheat into a processing plant and puff it up and \nsell it on the grocery store shelf as puffed wheat breakfast food, they \ncan charge more for the puff than the farmer is going to get from the \nwheat. One suffers and goes out of business, and the other makes a \nrecord profit.\n  If this Congress and this country doesn't start caring a bit about \nwhether we have family farmers in our future, this country is going to \nlose something very important. When we talk about this subject around \nhere, everybody talks about economics and dollars and cents. This isn't \njust about dollars and cents. This is not about knowing the cost of \nsomething. This is about knowing the value of something. We need to \nknow the true value of family farmers in this country.\n  I am enormously frustrated. This article in the Wall Street Journal \nchronicles what we see and what we know every day in the streets of \nNorth Dakota, in our small towns, and out on the country roads, and the \nsame is true in Montana. We have heard it farmers who come to our \nmeetings and stand up. One farmer comes to mind who came to a meeting \nof mine. He was a big, burly guy and had kind of a beard. It was not a \nlong beard, but kind of a short beard. He had friendly eyes. He stood \nup. He was a tall fellow. He said, ``My granddad farmed, my dad farmed, \nand I have farmed for 23 years.'' And then his chin began to quiver. He \ngot tears in his eyes, and he said, ``But I have to quit this year \nbecause I don't have the money to continue. I'm out of business.''\n  He was the third generation in the family to farm. He was going out \nof business because this country has a farm policy that says we are \ngoing to pull the safety net out from under family farmers. Now, we had \nbetter reconnect that safety net if this country cares about having a \nfamily farmer left in its future.\n  Senator Conrad, myself, Senator Baucus, Senator Daschle, Senator \nWellstone, and so many others on both sides of the aisle, care about \nthe future of family farmers. We must, it seems to me, convince the \nrest of this Congress that this current approach is an approach that \nleads to failure.\n  Let me read a paragraph in the Wall Street Journal article:\n\n       The situation in Kittson County suggests that \n     deregulation--\n\n  Which is the description of the current farm policy, which I voted \nagainst proudly--\n\n       is staying, and for a grim reason: Farmers are giving up. \n     Nobody is organizing the type of protests that attracted \n     national attention the last time so many farmers here were in \n     trouble. That was in the mid-1980s debt crisis, when Randy \n     Swenson would travel from his Kittson County farm to Fargo \n     and Bismarck to join demonstrators demanding a federal \n     bailout. Now, the 46-year-old grower is just quitting.\n\n  I say to those out there on the family farm who have struggled, who \nrisk everything in trying to make a living every single day--and I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in this--that they ought not to give up \nhope. There are plenty of us in Congress who understand that family \nfarming is a way of life that this country ought to nurture and protect \nand help in its future.\n\n  I hope, as we proceed to discuss this in the coming weeks, that we \ncan impress the need for a change upon those who were the architects of \nthis farm program. The current program puts farmers into the \nmarketplace, whatever that marketplace happens to be. There are those \nwho think this is fine, because after all they think it is a free \nmarketplace. I hope they come to understand that the marketplace is not \nfree. It has never been free.\n  We can't have farmers compete against unfair trade. We can't have \nfarmers compete in a marketplace dominated by millers who want low \nprices in the marketplace and grocery manufacturers who want lower \nprices in the marketplace. We can't ask them to compete against scab \ndisease that will wipe out the crop yield and crop quality. We can't \nask them to compete against a railroad that will haul their grain to \nmarket but charge them 20 or 30 or 40 percent more than is justifiable.\n  If somebody thinks that is a free marketplace, then somebody doesn't \nknow what ``free'' or ``marketplace'' really means. We can do better \nthan that. There are enough of us here to raise enough dust to require \nthat we do better, so that in the coming days some of this policy can \nchange to be helpful to family farmers.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I don't know if the Senator noticed in the Wall Street \nJournal article, former Secretary of Agriculture Bob Bergland said, \n``Unless the bankers get worried, nothing will get changed in \nCongress.''\n  Isn't it the case that you and I just met yesterday morning with the \nbankers from our State and those bankers are worried? We had banker \nafter banker from across the State of North Dakota tell us they are \ngoing to wind up farming. We just got a report that, for the first time \nin anyone's memory, land in the Red River Valley of North Dakota, which \nis the richest farmland in the world, will not be farmed this year; it \nwill not be farmed.\n  Isn't it the case, Senator Dorgan, when we talked to our bankers, \nthey told us they anticipate thousands of farmers leaving the land this \nyear in North Dakota and a much more serious situation next year unless \nwe take action?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is exactly the case. I just hope that as we finish \nthese comments now, we will all understand that there is work to do. \nWhen you see reports like this--reports that don't surprise us because \nwe have been hearing it for some long while--we should understand that \nwhile part of this country is doing quite well and there is a lot of \ngood economic news, there are also troubled spots in our economy that \nare causing enormous hurt and pain to people who don't deserve it.\n  America's family farmers are wonderful people. They are the people in \nthis country who work, who grow, who risk, who come together, neighbor \nto neighbor, to help each other. But they can't help each other when \nthey go to the market and discover that the price of wheat is $3 or \n$3.30, or when they go\n\n[[Page S4412]]\n\nto the field and discover that scab wiped out half the quantity of \ntheir grain, or when they go to the railroad and discover that the \nprice to haul the wheat to market is vastly inflated, or when they go \nto the border up in Canada and discover unfair shipments of grain that \nundercut their prices, or when they say, I would like to sell my wheat \nto China, or my beef to China, but you can't get wheat or meat into \nChina in any meaningful quantity because we don't have open markets \noverseas.\n  It is not fair to put farmers in that position, and we should not. It \nseems to me that we have a responsibility to provide a basic safety net \nif we want to protect a network of family farmers to be present in this \ncountry's future. I think we ought to do that. I think it is a priority \nfor us in this Congress, and I hope that a number of us can work \ntogether on a bipartisan basis to see that this occurs in the coming \nweeks and months.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is H.R. 2676, the IRS \nreform legislation.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/06/senate-section/article/S4409-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4412-S4413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ASTHMA INHALERS\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, today, as you may be aware, is \nAsthma Awareness Day. I rise to discuss the issue of CFC-propelled \nasthma inhalers.\n  CFC-propelled inhalers are a necessary tool for proper management of \nasthma and other respiratory illnesses. Over 30 million Americans \ndepend on these inhalers in order to function normally in their daily \nlives. In many cases, they are literally the difference between life \nand death.\n  I recently joined my colleague, Senator DeWine, in introducing S. \n2026, the Asthma Inhaler Protection Act. This bill is a revised version \nof legislation that I introduced last year in response to the Food and \nDrug Administration's announcement of its plans to issue a rule that \nwill phase out the production of CFC-propelled inhalers.\n  The FDA's announcement to phase-out metered-dose inhalers was \nprompted by the Montreal Protocol agreement to eliminate ozone \ndepleting chemicals, including CFCs. In the U.S., the manufacture of \nCFCs was discontinued in January of 1996. CFCs may still be used, \nhowever, as long as their use qualifies as an ``essential use.'' \nCurrently, inhalers are considered as ``essential use'' and are exempt \nfrom the CFC ban.\n  As the United States contemplates total elimination of CFCs and \nremoval of the essential use designation for inhalers, we face several \nissues.\n  First of all, how fast should we phase out CFC inhalers and will \npatients' health be jeopardized? It is my understanding that the amount \nof CFCs released by metered-dose inhalers accounts for less than 1.5 \npercent of the total amount emitted into the atmosphere. Is the \nenvironmental benefit of phasing out inhalers without taking into \naccount the full needs of patients worth placing lives in danger?\n  As a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and \nthe Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, I support the goal of \nridding our environment of ozone depleting chemicals.\n  However, from a patient perspective, any transition to CFC-free \nalternatives that does not take into account the needs of all patients \nwill do more harm than good.\n  Under the FDA's initial proposal, a whole class of inhalers could be \nremoved from the market if only three alternatives exist. The method by \nwhich the FDA has grouped inhaler medications into classes assumes that \nthey are medically and therapeutically equivalent. I suggest to my \ncolleagues this is FALSE.\n  Inhalers vary in terms of formulation, dosage strength, delivery of \nmedication, and their effectiveness for patients. Patients frequently \ntest several inhalers under physician supervision before they find the \ninhaler that works best for them. To deny patients their inhaler \nwithout a suitable range of alternatives could potentially put their \nlives at risk.\n  Another concern that cannot be overlooked is how the removal of \nexisting products and their generic counterparts will influence the \nmarketplace. A decrease in competition has obvious consequences in \nterms of cost and the availability of drugs on the shelf.\n  Finally, the FDA should take into account other countries' strategies \nfor phasing out CFCs in inhalers in order to ensure that the U.S. takes \nthe best and most responsible approach. I know that Canada, for \nexample, has rejected the class approach taken by the FDA and proposed \na policy that will require a proper range of alternatives to exist for \neach medication type. It also provides for a transition period so \npatients can ease off of their current medication and make sure that \nthere is a new product that accommodates their needs.\n  The Asthma Inhaler Protection Act addresses all of these issues by \nincluding three requirements. First, before any further rulemaking, the \nFDA must conduct assessments and report to Congress on the health and \nenvironmental risks associated with its initial proposal. It must also \nconsider whether any measures adopted by the meeting of the Montreal \nProtocol this November will facilitate the United States' transition \naway from CFC inhalers.\n  Second, the FDA is required to develop criteria by which ``essential \nuse'' allowances for CFC-propelled inhalers will be removed. These \ncriteria shall require that a range of alternatives are available for \neach medication type, and that they are comparable in terms of dosage \nstrength, delivery systems and safety and efficacy. Furthermore, the \nalternatives must be available in sufficient numbers to meet consumer \ndemand.\n  Finally, the Asthma Inhaler Protection Act includes steps to ensure \nthat manufacturers will begin to transition away from inhalers that \nemploy CFCs. Under the bill, no new applications for products \ncontaining CFCs will be considered by the FDA after 1998 unless they \nrepresent a significant advance in technology. Any new approvals, \nhowever, will be subject to the same criteria as I described earlier.\n  Madam President, the transition to non-CFC propelled inhalers in the \nUnited States must be well-planned and take into account both patient \nand environmental concerns. It is clear that the FDA needs to rethink \nits approach. We knew this last year after the FDA published its \nproposal and was flooded by more than 10,000 comments from concerned \npatients, providers, state medical boards, and advocacy groups. These \nconcerns were again raised last month during a Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee hearing which Chairman Jeffords held at my request.\n  The Asthma Inhaler Protection Act will ensure that the FDA balances \npatients needs with environmental concerns, and above all, does not \njeopardize the lives of millions of Americans who depend on CFC \nmetered-dose inhalers.\n  It is simply a matter of ensuring that the 30 million Americans \ncurrently dependent upon these inhalers--and all of us have seen them; \nthese little canisters that asthmatics carry with them every day \neverywhere they go--we simply must ensure that as the FDA moves forward \nthat they will do so in a way that ensures that patients all across \nthis country are not allowed to go without medical care that they so \ndesperately need; and that the policy of the FDA will be such that \nthese patients will know that they are not going to have less choice \nthan they have now; that the particular peculiar medical needs that \nasthmatics and others of respiratory diseases have will be met; that \nthey will be assured that the needs that they have can be addressed; \nand, that the FDA will take those concerns into account as they move \nforward.\n  I believe the FDA will be responsive. This legislation, though, is \nthere, and I am looking forward to working with Senator DeWine, \nCongressman Patrick Kennedy and Congressman Mark Foley on the House \nside to ensure that as the FDA moves forward with its rulemaking that \nit will do so in a way that is going to ensure that 30 million\n\n[[Page S4413]]\n\nAmericans are cared for and are not left in the lurch worried that \ntheir very lives might be in danger.\n  I hope all of us on this day, the first Asthma Awareness Day, will do \nour part to educate the American people about the serious health \nimpact, particularly upon our children, that asthma is having, and the \ndramatic increase that we have seen in asthma in this country, and that \nthe FDA in their, I think, well-motivated goal of removing these \nchemicals from our environment will do so in a way that the health and \nsafety of the American people is protected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes \nto speak as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, my colleagues from North Dakota, \nSenator Conrad and Senator Dorgan, said it well moments ago when they \nwere speaking about the Wall Street Journal piece that came out \nyesterday, Tuesday, May 5 regarding what has to be described as a farm \ncrisis. In this piece, former Secretary of Agriculture Bob Bergland is \nquoted. Jim Tunheim, a State legislator from northwest Minnesota, is \nalso quoted.\n  I want to talk about what is happening in my State of Minnesota \nbecause I believe it will be incumbent upon all of us here in the \nSenate and in the House of Representatives as well to take some action.\n  I was at a gathering in Crookston, MN some weeks ago. As I walked \ninto the school, there was a sign posted outside that said, ``Farm \nCrisis Meeting''. It brought back awful memories of the mid-1980s when \nI went to probably hundreds of farm crisis meetings. What I saw then \nall across Minnesota were foreclosures; people being driven off their \nfarms where they not only lived but where they worked as well. I saw a \nlot of broken dreams and a lot of broken lives and a lot of broken \nfamilies. This is now happening again.\n  This very fine piece in the Wall Street Journal talks about this farm \ncrisis in very personal terms.\n  I want to say to colleagues that I know of no other way to say it. \nSome 2 years ago, when we passed what was called the Freedom to Farm \nbill, I called it then the Freedom to Fail bill. And I think that is \nexactly what is happening. All of the discussion about the market \npresupposes that we have Adam Smith's invisible hand in agriculture. \nBut what we have instead is a food industry where the conglomerates \nhave muscled their way to the dinner table exercising raw economic \npower over farmers, consumers, taxpayers, and family farmers. Wheat \nfarmers, corn growers and other farmers--vis-a-vis these large \ncompanies that they deal with don't have very much clout at all.\n  This was a good bill for some of the big grain companies. There are \nonly a few. But it was not a good bill for family farmers.\n  Now, in northwest Minnesota, a combination of dealing with scab \ndisease, wet weather over the last several years, and, most important \nof all, this Freedom to Farm bill, which has driven prices down, which \ndoesn't give the farmers a loan rate to have some leverage in the \nmarket, which doesn't give them a safety net, is driving farmers off \nthe land.\n  We need to take some action. The Secretary of Agriculture supports \nlifting the cap on the loan rate. And we can legislatively try to raise \nthat loan rate so that we can give farmers a price in the marketplace.\n  I just want to say to my colleagues, I told you so. That is the way I \nwill put it. I told you so. And northwest Minnesota is just a harbinger \nof what is going to happen across this country. Prices are low. Farmers \nare being driven off the land. There is a tremendous amount of economic \npain. And it is not just the farmers. It is the communities where they \nlive, where they go to church or to synagogue, where they buy their \nproducts, where they send their kids to school.\n  We have a serious crisis in northwest Minnesota. I am hearing from \nfarmers in other parts of my State as well. I think rural America is \ngoing to go through some economic convulsions as a result, in part, of \nthis legislation that we passed. We have to give farmers a fair price \nin the marketplace. We secured them some loan funding in the disaster \nappropriations bill we passed last week, which gives them at least some \nloan assistance for spring operations. But it doesn't make that much \ndifference long-term. It can keep them going for awhile, but if they \ndon't get a decent price in the marketplace, they don't have a prayer.\n  That is what this piece in the Wall Street Journal is about. That is \nwhy I come to the floor of the Senate. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, who come from farm \nStates. We have to do something. We are here to try to do well for \npeople. We have to do better for family farmers in Minnesota and across \nour country.\n  I thank my colleague from Texas again for his graciousness, and I \nyield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/06/senate-section/article/S4413-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4413-S4428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, since no one is here to speak, I thought \nI would go ahead and say a few words. I have several amendments I am \ngoing to be offering, and I will, obviously, speak at that time. But I \nwanted to let my colleagues know about a story that ran on the 4th of \nthis month, which was 2 days ago, on KTVT, Channel 11, a CBS affiliate \nin Dallas.\n  What struck me about this story is how symptomatic the story is of \nwhat we saw consistently in our hearings before the Finance Committee \nand how consistently this kind of thing is happening all over the \ncountry.\n  The story was the lead story on the 10 o'clock news on the 4th of \nMay. The story is about tax collectors who aren't paying taxes. \nBasically, what happened is an investigative reporter asked the \nInternal Revenue Service for records related to tax collectors who \nthemselves were violating the Tax Code, and did this ever happen, and, \nif so, what did the IRS do about it and what kind of records were kept. \nIt is the kind of request that government at all levels gets every day \nfrom the media. Government officials do not always like to produce the \nrequested information but, nonetheless, it is produced.\n  Well, the bottom line is, as you might have guessed, the Internal \nRevenue Service stated that it has no such data. Then an IRS employee \nslipped a document to the TV reporter, and the document showed that \nlast year nearly 4,000 IRS employees did not file or pay taxes.\n  Collectively, according to reporter O'Connor in this story, they owe \nUncle Sam more than $10 million. And this reporter said that this \ninformation coming into their hand forced the IRS to break this down \ninto local numbers. The reporter then says, ``We have learned that in \nnorth Texas, between 1993 and 1996, 137 IRS employees did not file or \npay their taxes. Last year alone, 14 IRS agents owed $400,000'' in \nunpaid taxes in north Texas.\n  Then what I wanted to call to my colleagues' attention is an \nextraordinary, at least in my mind, interview which sounds exactly like \nthe testimony our committee heard over and over and over again. Listen \nto this. The reporter is asking Mary Durgin, who is Chief of Tax \nCompliance for the IRS--the reporter is asking the Chief of Tax \nCompliance for the IRS the following questions and let me just read the \ntranscript.\n\n       Reporter O'Connor. You know of no Federal liens ever being \n     filed against an IRS employee?\n       Ms. Durgin. Um, I'm not aware of any.\n\n  The reporter asks the next question.\n\n       Reporter O'Connor. Do you know how many reprimands have \n     been given in the last year?\n       Ms. Durgin. I don't.\n       Reporter O'Connor. Do you know how many employees have been \n     suspended?\n       Ms. Durgin. I don't.\n       Reporter O'Connor. Fired?\n       Ms. Durgin. I don't. We don't keep those statistics.\n       Reporter O'Connor. Why would you not know that if you're \n     the head of--\n\n  Before she can say ``tax compliance,'' Ms. Durgin says, ``because I \ndon't count them.''\n  Now, I intend to send this to the Internal Revenue Service this \nafternoon and ask them to check this out, but this is exactly the kind \nof answer that we have gotten over and over and over from the Internal \nRevenue Service. And I intend to offer an amendment, probably tomorrow, \nthat will give the head of the Internal Revenue Service the power to \nterminate any employee of the Internal Revenue Service who fails to \nfile a tax return that should be filed or who willfully violates the \ntax laws of this country.\n  Now, I don't know what is behind this story. I have obviously not \nverified what has been said by this reporter. But I would have to say \nthat if 4,000 IRS employees last year either didn't file a return or \ndidn't pay taxes, that is a very, very serious charge. And I think the \nhead of the IRS ought to have the ability to terminate the employment \nof somebody whose job it is to collect taxes from other people and at \nthe same time they don't pay their own taxes.\n  Now, as you can imagine, this story interviews a businessperson who \nhad their assets frozen, had all kinds of problems because there was a \ncharge that he had not paid his taxes, and that is contrasted against \nthe assertion that 4,000 IRS agents last year either didn't file a tax \nreturn or didn't pay their taxes.\n  I think this is a very serious matter. We ought to have a provision \nin the new law that says without regard to any other provision of law, \nif you work for the Internal Revenue Service and you willfully violate \nthe Tax Code, you ought to lose your job.\n  I think that is something that is needed. I think it is a provision \nthat we were already looking at, but I wanted to make my colleagues \naware of this story on the CBS affiliate in Dallas night before last \nand about this extraordinary interview with Mary Durgin who, although \nshe is the Chief of Tax Compliance at the IRS, doesn't know if any \naction has ever been taken at any time, in any place, under any \ncircumstances, against any agent who violated the Tax Code.\n  That seems to me to be extraordinary, and, quite frankly, I would \nhave trouble believing it had we not had exactly the same thing and the \nsame answers given to very similar questions before our committee \nwhere, in fact, with all of the concerns that were raised last year, \nwith all of the statements that were made about wrongdoing, little \nevidence exists that any individuals who had accusations made against \nthem in those hearings or related to those hearings has had any \ncorrective action taken.\n  As I said at the hearing, and it is something that I will certainly \nrepeat tomorrow in offering this and other amendments, my concern with \nthe Internal Revenue Service is not that you get some bad people when \nyou hire 100,000 people. I mean, people are humans. They make mistakes. \nSome people seem to be more prone to them than others. And very smart \npeople from time to time do very dumb things. With the IRS employing \n100,000 people we ought not to be surprised that we have some people \nwho do bad things and some people who do dumb things. But that is not \nwhat alarms me about our current situation at the Internal Revenue \nService.\n  What alarms me is we seem to have a system where people who do bad \nthings never have bad things happen to them. We have a system where, \nwhen people do good things like going to their supervisors and saying \nthat other people are violating the law or violating the procedures of \nthe Internal Revenue Service, bad things tend to happen to those good \npeople. The difference between a good system and a bad system is not \nthat under the good system you don't have people who do bad things. You \ndo. But under a good system, people who do bad things end up being \npunished; people who do good things end up being rewarded, and as a \nresult, people learn from rewards and penalties and so you get more \ngood behavior and you get less bad behavior. That is the hallmark of a \ngood institution.\n  Looking at all the abuses that we heard about during the Finance \nCommittee hearings, the amazing thing to me was not that these things \nhappened. The amazing thing is it doesn't appear that bad things ever \nhappened to the people who did the bad things. It doesn't appear that \npeople who violated the law, violated procedures, abused taxpayers, \nabused their fellow employees, were penalized. It appeared as if--based \non the testimony that we heard--the IRS system was set up to protect \nits senior people or to provide an environment in which you reward \nunproductive and undesirable behavior. You would have to conclude that \nthe structure has historically been one aimed at protecting its own \nversus protecting the taxpayer instead of creating a system that tries \nto reward productive behavior.\n  I think this is something we need to deal with. I think the bill that \nis before us is a dramatic improvement over the bill in the House. I \ncongratulate Chairman Roth. I think he has done an outstanding job. I \nthink when we started these hearings many people were skeptical about \nthem. I certainly was skeptical. But I think the hearings have\n\n[[Page S4415]]\n\nbrought to light real abuses. And the important thing, obviously, for a \nlegislative body, is not just to find out what is wrong but to try to \ndo something about it.\n  I think we have a good bill before us. I don't think it solves all \nthe problems. I would have to say I am very skeptical about this \nadvisory board. I don't understand an advisory board that is supposed \nto advise the Secretary of the Treasury and the IRS Director, and the \nSecretary of the Treasury is a member of the advisory board. I don't \nunderstand how you advise yourself. It seems to me that gives the \nSecretary of the Treasury two bites out of the apple, and that is \nprobably a mistake.\n  There are very real ethical problems that have been raised by the \nrelevant agencies of Government that deal in ethics in having the head \nof the Treasury Employees Labor Union as a member of this advisory \nboard, since that member, by the very nature of his job and source of \nemployment, has a constant conflict of interest. I don't understand how \nyou can change the ethics rules of the Government to put people in a \nposition where they constantly have a conflict of interest and expect \nmuch to come out of this advisory board. So, frankly, I know many \npeople are talking about the advisory board. I know they have high \nhopes for it. I have very little in the way of high hopes that we are \ngoing to get much out of this advisory board.\n\n  But what I think we are doing in this bill that will dramatically \nchange behavior is, No. 1, we are shifting the burden of proof in \ndisputes between taxpayers and the IRS. We are going to have some \npeople who will say that in doing so we are jeopardizing our ability to \ncollect taxes because the taxpayer is the only person who has access to \nthe financial data and records that substantiate the claims made on the \nindividual tax return. I think we have come up with an innovative way \nof resolving this. Let me give you the argument for shifting the burden \nof proof, and then describe the innovation that I think answers those \nconcerns.\n  If you commit a crime, the police come out and investigate the crime, \nthey gather evidence, they turn the evidence over to the prosecutor, \nthe prosecutor evaluates the evidence, and in doing so, evaluates not \nonly whether a crime was committed but evaluates the work of the police \ndepartment and any abuse it might have committed along the way. And if \nthe prosecutor is convinced there might be a case, he takes it before a \ngrand jury that evaluates the work of the police, the work of the \nprosecutor, and the facts. Then, if the grand jury indicts a person for \na crime, they go into court where people have a jury of their peers, \nthey generally have an elected judge or an appointed judge, and they \nhave an independent prosecutor.\n  Our problem with the Internal Revenue Service is that we are dealing \nwith one agency that is literally investigator, prosecutor, judge, and \njury all wrapped into one so that we have no effective checks and \nbalances. As the ancient Greeks once observed, power corrupts. That is \nbasically our problem in the Internal Revenue Service.\n  We have not fixed that problem, in my opinion. But the way we tried \nto get at it is to at least give you one thing you have if you are \naccused of being a common criminal, basically saying if you are a \ntaxpayer you ought to have rights at least equivalent to a common \ncriminal in dealing with your Government. The right that we want to \nguarantee is that the burden of proof is on the IRS to prove that you \ndid something wrong, whereas now it is literally true that if you are \naccused by the Internal Revenue Service of violating the Code, the \nburden of proof is on you.\n  Here is the innovative way we have tried to protect our ability to \ncollect taxes and guarantee this right as well. I thank Senator Roth \nfor working with me on this and for the solution that he and his staff \nhave come up with.\n  The way the bill works is, if the Internal Revenue Service accuses \nyou of violating the law or violating the rules with regard to the \ncollection of taxes, if you present to them on a timely basis the \nfinancial data that a reasonable person could be expected to have kept, \nif you turn it over to them when requested, at the point that the \ntaxpayer has demonstrated compliance with those requirements, and only \nthen, the burden of proof shifts from the taxpayer to the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  I think that answers all the concerns that were raised by IRS, all \nthe legitimate concerns that were raised by law professors around the \ncountry about shifting the burden of proof. There were other concerns \nthat this would produce endless hearings and rulings before courts. But \nwe have dealt with that concern.\n  Another reform contained in the bill and which I think is very \nimportant, and is something that I have been a champion of along with \nour chairman, is strengthening the principle that if you are audited, \neither in your family's tax return or your business tax return, and you \nhad to go out and hire lawyers and accountants to defend yourself--and \nyou may spend thousands of dollars defending yourself--that at the end \nof the day if you are found to have complied with the law, that the IRS \nis responsible for reimbursement of the costs you have incurred in \ndefending yourself.\n  So if I am an honest taxpayer and I paid my taxes and the IRS audits \nme and I have to go out and hire an accountant and a lawyer to defend \nmyself, and we go through 18 months of contention, and finally there is \na ruling that says I didn't violate the law, under our bill now, the \nInternal Revenue Service will now find it more difficult to avoid \nhaving to compensate me for my cost of hiring a lawyer and hiring \naccountants and defending myself.\n  Not only is that fair, but that is going to change behavior, because \nwe are going to make this data public, we are going to list publicly \nand report to the Congress on the instances where the IRS has had to \npay people these costs. We are going to force the Internal Revenue \nService to make better judgments about whom to go after and whom not to \ngo after.\n  A final wrinkle on this, which I think is very, very helpful, is that \nif you offer to settle with the Internal Revenue Service and you, say, \noffer to pay $15,000 to settle this dispute, and the IRS says, ``No, we \nwon't take your $15,000; we are going to take you to court,'' if at the \nend of the proceedings you are found to owe less than $15,000, not \ncounting penalty and interest built up during the time where the \ndispute exists, then the IRS will have to pay your legal and accounting \ncosts from the time you made the offer until a final settlement is \neventually reached.\n  This is a long way from the checks and balances we have in the \ncriminal justice system. I would like to go further in separating the \nfunctions of the IRS so that we have more checks and balances, but I \nthink our bill is a dramatic improvement over the House bill. I am very \nproud of what we have done. I hope we can do more. I congratulate our \nchairman.\n  I understand that Senator Thompson is here, so I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2356\n\n(Purpose: Striking the exemptions from criminal conflict laws for board \n                   member from employee organization)\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Thompson), for himself and \n     Mr. Sessions, proposes an amendment numbered 2356.\n       On page 180, beginning with line 7, strike all through page \n     181, line 17.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, the amendment I am offering, with \nSenator Sessions and with the support of Chairman Roth, strikes the \nprovision of title I of the bill which provides for a special waiver of \nthe criminal conflict of interest laws for the employee organization \nrepresentative on the newly organized oversight board.\n  As chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I have a specific \ninterest in the application of Government ethics laws and any waivers \nof these criminal statutes which might be granted to Federal employees.\n  During markup of the measure, the Finance Committee adopted an \namendment adding a member to the oversight board who would be a \nrepresentative of an employee organization representing substantial \nnumbers of IRS employees. However, because of the inherent conflict of \ninterest in the new member's\n\n[[Page S4416]]\n\nposition, the committee adopted a subsequent amendment waiving four \nessential ethics laws as they would apply to this particular board \nmember.\n  It is this specific provision that I propose to strike. Under the \nwaivers as granted, the employee organization representative would not \nbe subject to the same ethics rules as the other members of the \noversight board and would not be subject to the same ethics that apply \nto other public employees. The bill, as reported, exempts the employee \norganization representative from key ethics laws when the \nrepresentative is acting on behalf of his or her organization.\n  The Office of Government Ethics reviewed these waivers and found them \nvery troubling. In a letter addressed to the majority leader, Senator \nLott, minority leader Senator Daschle, and the floor managers of this \nbill, the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, Stephen Potts, \ndescribed these conflict of interest waivers as unprecedented and \ninadvisable and antithetical to sound Government ethics policies and, \nthus, to sound Government.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the referenced \nletter.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                             U.S. Office of Government Ethics,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: This Office has reviewed H.R. 2676, the \n     Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of \n     1998, as it has been reported by the Finance Committee and, \n     we understand, is soon to be taken up by the Senate. At the \n     request of both the majority and minority, we provided \n     technical assistance to the Finance Committee staff with \n     regard to drafting the language of provisions setting forth \n     the ethical considerations for the Members of the Internal \n     Revenue Service Oversight Board. We believe those provisions \n     are written in a clear and technically correct manner.\n       However, one provision of the bill, the proposed 26 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7802(b)(3)(D), provides for waivers of applicable \n     conflict of interest laws for one Member of that Board. We \n     believe that this provision is antithetical to sound \n     Government ethics policy and thus to sound Government. Such \n     across-the-board statutory waivers for someone other than a \n     mere advisor is unprecedented and, we believe, inadvisable.\n       We understand and agree that the employees of the Internal \n     Revenue Service should have an opportunity to be heard in any \n     decisions that may affect them. As we stated in a letter to \n     the Finance Committee, there are standard ways of allowing \n     input from interested parties without allowing the interested \n     party to be the actual decision-maker in a Governmental \n     matter. It is the latter role that is fundamentally at odds \n     with the concept that Government decisions should be made by \n     those who are acting for the public interest and not those \n     acting for a private interest. The one private interest that \n     is being waived in each case for this Board Member is the one \n     most fundamentally in conflict with his or her duties to the \n     public.\n       On the other hand, we cannot recommend that the waivers be \n     eliminated for the individual appointed to such a position. \n     That elimination would leave this individual extremely \n     vulnerable to charges of criminal conduct for carrying out \n     many Oversight Board actions or for carrying out his or her \n     private duties for the employee organization. The fact this \n     vulnerability exists exposes the pervasiveness of the \n     conflicts for an officer or employee of an employee \n     organization to serve on the Oversight Board.\n       Rather, we recommend the elimination of the position on the \n     Board that creates such inherent conflicts. The elimination \n     of the position could be coupled with a requirement that the \n     Board consult with employee organizations. While we think a \n     reasonable Board would consult without that requirement, \n     requiring consultation might provide some assurance to the \n     various employee organizations that they will be heard.\n       The criminal conflict of interest laws should not be viewed \n     as impediments to good Government. They are there for a \n     purpose and should not be waived for mere convenience. Some \n     may point out that certain provisions of these laws are \n     waived by agencies quite frequently. That is true. Some of \n     the laws anticipate circumstances where a restriction could \n     be waived and set forth the standards that must be met to \n     issue waivers. Agencies can and do issue such waivers, but \n     the waivers must meet the tests set forth in the statutes. \n     For those conflicts laws that do provide for waivers (not all \n     do), we believe that it would be extremely difficult for a \n     reasonable person to determine that the interests this \n     individual Board Member will undoubtedly have through his or \n     her affiliation with the organization could meet those waiver \n     tests.\n       In order to meet our recommendation, we believe the \n     provisions of Subtitle B, sec. 1101(a) should be amended to \n     eliminate proposed sections 7802(b)(1)(D), (b)(3)(A)(ii) and \n     (b)(3)(D). All other references to an individual appointed \n     under section 7802(b)(1)(D) should be removed and wherever a \n     number of members of the Board is indicated (such as a Board \n     composed of nine members or five members for a quorum) that \n     number should be altered to reflect the elimination of this \n     position.\n       We appreciate the opportunity to express our concerns and \n     our recommendations. These are the views of the Office of \n     Government Ethics and not necessarily those of the \n     Administration. We are available to answer any questions you \n     or any other Member of the Senate may have with regard to \n     this letter or the conflict of interest laws. We are sending \n     identical letters to Senators Daschle, Roth and Moynihan.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Stephen D. Potts,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, waiving these conflict of interest \nstatutes establishes a very bad precedent. We have an opportunity here \nto avoid a serious conflict of interest pitfall, and I hope all \nSenators will agree and approve adoption of this amendment.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, I would like to speak for a minute on \nthe amendment just offered by the Senator from Tennessee and the \nSenator from Alabama striking the provision in title I concerning the \noversight board and specifically concerning the employee representative \non that board, and even more specifically the language that will enable \nthat board member to function on the board; that is to say, language \nwhich, by the way, is not precedent setting.\n  There are many other cases where people have been given protection \nfrom very specific areas of conflict of interest in order to be able to \ndo their work. In this case, the only protection against conflict of \ninterest charges is postemployment, since the individual selected from \nthe Department of Treasury is working for the IRS.\n  Certainly, we want the law to be written so they are able to go back \nto work with the IRS or do whatever work they had in connection with \nthe employee's representative association without being prevented from \ndoing so. So that is the only protection that this language provides.\n\n  There are really three sort of threshold questions that Members have \nto both ask and answer as they deliberate this particular amendment. \nThe first is one that the Senator from Texas just raised a minute ago, \nwhich is skepticism about the nature of this board.\n  Is this board going to be able to get the job done? I believe \nstrongly it is. It is not an advisory board. It is a board with a \nconsiderable amount of power and authority to guide the Commissioner of \nthe Internal Revenue Service. It is a board that has been put together, \nunder statute, to have the skills necessary to be able to advise the \nCommissioner on a variety of different things and to give the \nCommissioner input. The board will be making a budget recommendation to \nthe Treasury Secretary. That is a considerable amount of power.\n  The board will forward three names to be Commissioner of the Internal \nRevenue Service to the President. The board can also instruct the \nPresident they believe the Commissioner should be removed from office. \nThere are other powers enumerated in title I. Certainly one can be \nskeptical, as one always needs to be with any kind of a board. I may be \nproven wrong. I think this board will provide a substantial amount of \nguidance and assistance to the Commissioner. I think the powers that we \nhave given this board are right.\n  I believe it is as well important to remember that what this \nlegislation is attempting to do is create some balance in oversight. \nThe executive oversight organization, this new board, should give \ntaxpayers a sense that the IRS is more accountable, along with the \ntaxpayer advocate provisions that are also contained in title I. \nHowever, it is important for us to make certain that Congress has the \nright amount of oversight.\n  The Restructuring Commission that met for over a year--Senator \nGrassley\n\n[[Page S4417]]\n\nand I were both on that Commission--we heard time after time after time \nthe taxpayers, and the providers that are assisting the taxpayers, \nsaying that the biggest problem is Congress. There is inconsistent \noversight. There are six committees to whom the Commissioner must come \nto report. The IRS is not Sears and Roebuck; they have 535 elected \nMembers who are the board of directors.\n  One of the great tests to discover whether or not we understand what \nthe IRS is doing is asking yourself the question: Do we know what the \nIRS budget is? Do you know how much we appropriate on an annual basis? \nIt is about $7 billion this year, against about $1.6 trillion of tax \nrevenue. They collect 95 percent of all the revenue that this Congress \nauthorizes. We authorize the moneys that are to be spent and we specify \nwith our tax laws how that money is to be collected and who is to be \nexempted.\n  I made the point many times that we talk a great deal on this floor \nabout the need for simplification. One of the most powerful witnesses \nthat the Finance Committee had before us was an individual, a tax \nlawyer who helps taxpayers, who was pointing out some abuse in our Tax \nCode. He was saying to us, as long as you tax income, as long as you \nhave a tax on income, it is likely, as income becomes more and more \ncomplicated, and more and more complex, it is likely the IRS is going \nto become more and more involved in making determinations whether or \nnot an individual has voluntarily reported the right amount of income.\n  And we change our Tax Code. I guess 2 or 3 weeks ago, when the \nCoverdell IRS bill was passed--I do not want to reargue that bill, but \nno one can argue that that increased not only the complexity of the \nCode and requires the IRS to work harder, but we have asked them to now \nrewrite the Code. That is the 63rd change since 1986.\n\n  In addition to that, the IRS is going to have to make certain that \npeople who claim that deduction, claim to be able to use that \neducational IRA, they are going to have to provide receipts. Because \nthe law says that you can use the education IRA for any expense that is \nconnected to the education of the child in the school, and thus we are \ngoing to have to have the IRS out there if something is claimed and \nthey can be audited and have to produce all those records and produce \nproof. They are not being required to produce the proof and records by \naccident, Mr. President. They are being asked to produce the records \nand proof because we wrote a law that said they had to do it.\n  So one of the things we are trying to get with this oversight board \nis some balance and get to a point where both the executive branch and \nthe legislative branch can reach agreement on what we want the mission \nof the IRS to be so they can make good investments in tax system \nmodernization.\n  The Senator from Alabama is on the floor. He and I started this thing \nback in 1995 with our oversight efforts in appropriations. We saw that \nnearly $4 billion had been wasted in the tax system modernization. \nEvery witness, public and private, that came before the Restructuring \nCommission said the reason, No. 1, is you do not know what you want to \nuse the technology for. You do not get shared consensus. You do not get \nto a point where you agree--the Congress and the executive branch--what \nthe purpose of the technology is going to be. And as the man said, ``If \nyou don't know where you're going, any road will take you there.''\n  That is exactly what the IRS has been doing. They have been deploying \ntechnology in a very dysfunctional organization, and as a consequence \nthe technology will not do what they promised us it was going to do.\n  So threshold question No. 1 is, do you think this new oversight board \nis going to get the job done? I think it will. I think it will \ndramatically change the kind of accountability taxpayers get, and \nespecially if we combine that with new oversight requirements on the \npart of the Congress. I am confident that oversight board--in \ncombination with new oversight requirements of the Congress--I am \nconfident that oversight board will increase the accountability and the \noperating efficiency and provide the Commissioner the kinds of guidance \nthat the Commissioner needs.\n  Threshold question No. 2 is, who do you want to be on the board? What \nsort of composition? What sort of makeup? There is very little \ndisagreement. As I hear from colleagues, we ought to have people with \nprivate sector expertise. The Senator from Florida earlier came to the \nfloor and asked for some change in the bill to put somebody with small \nbusiness experience on this board. I think it is very important that we \ndo so. Both Chairman Roth and I agreed to accept that. That has been \naltered, accepted, incorporated into the language.\n  But in addition, Mr. President, we also heard from people who have \ngone through the restructuring that the IRS is going to go through. And \nmake no mistake about it, Mr. Rossotti, with the new powers that \nChairman Roth has written into this bill that he will have, Mr. \nRossotti has a lot of work to do. He is going to go from a three-tier \ngeographical system that has 10 regional centers and 33 district \noffices--I mean a tremendously complicated geographical organization \nthat started in 1952--he is going to go from that to an organization \nthat is along functional lines: Small business, individual business, \nlarge taxpayer and nonprofit; four different functional categories.\n\n  There is going to be a lot of personnel decisions to be made and a \nlot of personnel changes that have to be made. In addition, if he \ndeploys the technology correctly, as we insist he do, and as the \nelectronic filing section of this title of this bill allows him to do, \nthere is going to be a lot of personnel decisions that have to be made.\n  As we heard in the Restructuring Commission, if you are going to make \nthat kind of tough Restructuring Commission, you are better off having \na personnel representative on the board. That is why the employee \nrepresentative is on the board. We are not putting an employee \nrepresentative on the board for political reasons, but putting one on \nthe board to make sure you have an individual who can sell and who can \npersuade and can help get these kinds of restructuring decisions \nimplemented and make certain that there is going to be a minimal amount \nof resistance on the employees' side.\n  We heard most eloquently from the new tax authorities in Australia \nthat went through a very similar restructuring as we are doing here. \nAnd we took their example, as well as many other private sector people \nwho talked about what happens when you restructure, to say that we \nought to have an employee representative on the board.\n  Now remember, this board lasts for 10 years. It sunsets after 10 \nyears. Congress may decide that it does not need the board at all \nanymore, may revisit threshold question No. 1 and threshold question \nNo. 2. The composition of the board can be revisited at that time as \nwell. We may, after these restructuring decisions are made, after you \nhave the IRS reorganized along functional lines, and after the \ntechnology has been fully invested in and implemented, this Congress \nmay decide that there is no need to have the representative of the \nemployees' association on this board. I feel very strongly going in \nthat we need it. That is a threshold question.\n\n  You may find you don't want it. You may have a legitimate belief \nthat, no, that ought not to happen. Fine. But if you are going to have \nthat person on the board--and I believe a majority of this Senate wants \nan employee representative on the board--if you are going to have an \nemployee representative on the board, make it possible for that \nindividual to do the job.\n  Why would you put somebody on the board and then neuter him with a \nstatute that says there will be a conflict of interest? That is what \nthis conflict of interest language does. It does not remove this \nrepresentative from all the other conflict of interest laws in every \none of the other private sectors that people have to abide by. It is \nnot a precedent. There are hundreds of individuals throughout \nGovernment who have been given similar kinds of protection in order to \nbe able to do their job.\n  I urge colleagues, as they come down and consider this, because it \nwill be one of the complicated legal, constitutional issues, you have \nto walk yourself through three questions:\n  No. 1, do you think this oversight board will do the job? If you \ndon't support the oversight board, it almost doesn't matter what the \ncomposition is.\n\n[[Page S4418]]\n\n  No. 2, do you think you ought to have an employee representative on \nthere to be able to get the support needed to do the tough personnel \ndecisions that this Commissioner will have? Look seriously at new \nauthorities we are giving the Commissioner. They are almost \nunprecedented. We are giving this Commissioner of the Internal Revenue \nService, I think quite appropriately, new authorities to be able to \nhire, new authorities to be able to fire.\n  The distinguished Senator from Texas earlier indicated he was going \nto offer an amendment adding to the list of reasons that an employee \ncan be fired. There are specific lists--I think it is five or six \nitems--that if an employee of the IRS does something, they can be fired \nfor cause. You don't have to go through the normal personnel \nprocedures. Just on the face of it, say if an employee does something \nlike that, they ought to be terminated.\n  The Commissioner has substantial new authority. They will need the \nfull participation and cooperation of the employees of the IRS in order \nto be able to get it done.\n  I come to the threshold question No. 2 and say absolutely yes, we \nought to have an employee representative on this board. If you answer \nthat question yes, you have to make certain that the laws are written \nso the individual can do the job.\n  What we will have, unfortunately, is a debate about the conflict of \ninterest stuff before we have done whether or not the person ought to \nbe on the board. It is far better for us to take up the amendment that \nwill be offered by some that we not have a Treasury employee \nrepresentative on the board at all.\n  If that is your position, if that amendment is successful, we strike \nthe employees representative, the conflict of interest thing is \nirrelevant. But if we end up with an employee representative on the \nboard--to pass this amendment, which would make it impossible for that \nrepresentative to do their job --it seems to me to put the cart before \nthe horse and do something I think no Member wants to do, which is \nbasically creating something that will not be able to do the job that \nwe wanted to do.\n  I hope Members will vote against the Thompson-Sessions amendment. I \nhope they will listen to the arguments that will be offered in detail \nby many people who have great experience with conflict of interest law. \nListen to the arguments of Senator Levin. Listen to the arguments of \nSenator Glenn. Listen to the arguments of those who understand how it \nis that we deal with conflicts of interest. We deal with them all the \ntime.\n  This language is in response to the Office of Government Ethics \nconcerns about this position. They, frankly, take the position they \ndon't want an employee representative on there under any circumstances, \nno matter what you do. Take that position, but that is a policy \ndecision that we have to make. We have to decide, Do you want an \nemployee representative on? I say yes. Once you have the employee rep, \nwe write the law so the individual is able to do the job. That is what \nwe are attempting to do with the language that the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee and the distinguished Senator from Alabama are \nproposing to strike.\n  I hope this amendment is defeated. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The amendment proposed by the \nSenator from Tennessee and the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, just for a few minutes I will also talk \nabout the IRS reform legislation and a suggestion that I have that I \nthink would improve it. I am at this point in time well aware that the \npending business is another amendment, so I will only speak on this \nsubject if I can.\n  I think perhaps the most important power given to Congress in the \nConstitution is bestowed to Congress in article I, section 8, the power \nto tax. This authority is vested in Congress, as the President and \nSenate know, because as elected representatives, Congress remains \naccountable to the public, and when they determine tax policy, this \nshould be more so.\n  Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Service effectively has the power \nto raise taxes through the use of its interpretive authority. \nTherefore, what I want to talk to the Senate and my colleagues about \nthis afternoon for a few minutes is an amendment, which I am not \noffering now but I will in a future time, which will build upon past \nlegislative initiatives that afforded protections to taxpayers from \nattempts by the Internal Revenue Service to bypass Congress and raise \ntaxes through the regulatory decrees.\n  In 1996, Congress passed the Congressional Review Act, which provides \nthat when a major agency rule takes effect, Congress has 60 days to \nreview it. During this time period, Congress has the option to pass \nwhat we call a disapproval resolution. The Stealth Tax Prevention Act \nwould expand the definition of a ``major rule'' to include any IRS \nregulation which increases Federal revenue.\n  For example, if the Office of Management and Budget finds that the \nimplementation and the enforcement of a rule has resulted in an \nincrease of Federal revenues over current practices for revenues \nanticipated from the rule on the date of the enactment of the statute \nunder which the rule is promulgated, the rule will be found to be major \nin scope. Therefore, the amendment, or the legislation that I would \nlike to see us adopt, sooner rather than later, would be to allow \nCongress to review the regulation and to prevent back-door tax \nincreases on hard-working Americans.\n  An excellent example of this occurred last year when the Internal \nRevenue Service attempted to increase taxes through the regulatory \nprocess. In this instance, the IRS disqualified a taxpayer from being \nconsidered a limited partner if they ``participated in the \npartnership's business for more than 500 hours during the taxable \nyear.'' The effect of this redefinition would have been to make these \nindividuals subject to a 2.9 percent Medicare tax. President Clinton \nhad included the identical provision in his universal health care \nlegislation in 1994. When the administration's plan failed, the IRS \nattempted to subject limited partnerships to the same tax increase by \nusing its regulatory powers.\n  I believe the intent of the Founding Fathers was to put the power to \nlay and collect taxes in the hands of the elected Members of Congress \nand no one else--not in the hands of the bureaucrats who are shielded \nfrom public accountability, but in the hands of Congress, who is \naccountable to the American people.\n  The proposed Stealth Tax Prevention Act that I want to see become law \nwould be particularly helpful in lowering the tax burden on small \nbusiness, which suffers disproportionately from IRS regulations. I \nbelieve Americans are paying a higher share of their income to the \nFederal Government currently than at any time since the end of World \nWar II. Allowing bureaucrats to increase taxes even further at their \nown discretion through the regulatory process, through interpretation \nof the Tax Code, I believe is intolerable.\n  I believe this legislation is right and should be passed, and it is \nclearly in the spirit of the IRS reform legislation. This type of \nlegislation would help rein in the power of the Internal Revenue \nService and would leave the tax policy where it belongs, to elected \nMembers of Congress, not unelected and not unaccountable IRS \nbureaucrats. I strongly urge my colleagues to get with me, to join me \nin the future in an effort to join the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, NFIB, and the National Taxpayers Union, as well \nas a lot of my colleagues who would be supporting this type of \nlegislation.\n\n  The bottom line is that the stealth tax legislation that I have been \ntalking about would improve accountability and it would put it where it \nbelongs--in the hands of Congress and not bureaucrats. I think it is \nsomething we have to consider and I believe we will consider in the \nfuture. I have talked to the chairman of the Finance Committee about \nthis, as well as other members of the Finance Committee, and they seem \nto be very interested in this. I am going to try to work with them in \nthe future.\n  I yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama that I appreciate the fact that he is not raising it on this \nlegislation before us, because it is not relevant. But\n\n[[Page S4419]]\n\nI also sympathize very much with the problem he has identified. I, \nindeed, would be happy to work with him because I do not think it is \nappropriate to legislate by regulation. I think that is what he seeks, \nand that is what I would be pleased to work with him on in the future.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman's statement. I \nhave worked with him before. I just think it is very, very important \nfor the American people that we, as Members of the U.S. Senate and \nHouse, should be the people who lay taxes, or reduce taxes, according \nto the Constitution. But that is not what is happening. The Internal \nRevenue Service is doing it through the back door. We should do things \nthrough the front door because that is the American way, and I think it \nis accountable. I have worked with the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska on this for several years and got some of this going at his \nsuggestion.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I agree with Senator Roth. This is a very \nimportant matter and issue, and I pledge my full cooperation to work \nwith the distinguished Senator from Alabama as well.\n  I call to your attention, with the National Taxpayer Advocate, I \nthink, we are going to get pretty close to this issue. In addition, by \norganizing--and the law requires it--the IRS along functional lines, we \nwill now have small business organized as a single category.\n  One of the things Mr. Rossotti has already indicated is that he is \nlikely to take some of the secondary recommendations that our \nCommission made. We have large numbers of relatively small businesses \nout there who expend a lot of money and don't pay any taxes at all. \nThey have to comply with the code. He believes there may be some \nopportunity for us to significantly relieve a number of individuals--\nmillions, in his words--that might otherwise have to fill out a form. \nSo I think what the Senator has brought to our attention is a very \nimportant problem; it is taxation without representation. It is \nfrustrating. I think we are going to get more accountability with this \nlaw, and we are going to have vehicles through the taxpayer advocate to \ndo the very thing the Senator is talking about. I appreciate it, and I \npledge my full cooperation to work with him on this.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will wrap it up on this point at this \ntime. I am certainly not going to wrap up this issue. I think this \nissue is just now becoming ventilated here and shared with my \ncolleagues here in the Senate. A lot of us have known this for a long \ntime. But the IRS reform bill that Senator Roth and Senator Kerrey have \nbeen pushing here is about, among other things, the agency overstepping \nits authority and, in a lot of instances, there are horror stories of \nabusing taxpayers. But I can't think of a worse way to abuse taxpayers \nthan when the IRS raises taxes through the back door, by the regulatory \nprocess, and then we think, how did they do this or why did they do \nthis? Why did we give them the authority to do this? Yet, ultimately, \nMr. President, we are accountable to the voters, as we should be.\n  I think this is relevant. I am not going to offer it now in deference \nto the chairman and the Senator from Nebraska. But I want to make it \nclear that this is just the beginning of this fight because this makes \na lot of sense to the American people.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak to the point that \nthe Senator from Alabama just raised. That point would be one of \nagreement. It would be to say that I have had the experience myself of \nhaving to get corrective legislation through. People would be surprised \nto know that a certain tax law that was in place legally for a long \nperiod of time was changed by a faceless bureaucrat, who increased the \nrevenue and taxed somebody in a way where they hadn't been taxed \nbefore. And then we have a situation where those of us who want to \ncorrect what this faceless bureaucrat did find ourselves not only \ngetting the bill written, finding all of the cosponsors that one needs, \nbut also, then, when you actually get to the point of offering the \namendment, you have to come up with an offset because there is \nsupposedly a cost, not from the original legislation, but because some \nfaceless bureaucrat is reinterpreting a tax law, which reinterpretation \nbrings more revenue in; and then, if we want to go back to where \nCongress originally was, we have to dig up revenue and have an offset \nto correct something that Congress never intended in the first place.\n  So you can see that what the Senator from Alabama is trying to do is \njust to bring a little common sense to the Washington nonsense. I \napplaud him for doing it and also applaud him for not doing it on this \nbill. I commit myself to working with him. I would like to, at this \npoint, ask him to see that I am added as a cosponsor to the original \nbill he put in, which has a number already.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would be glad to add you as a cosponsor. I believe we \nare going to pick up a lot of Senators on both sides of the aisle, I \nhope.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are just talking about common sense. \nIn other words, Congress passes a law. We want to tax at a certain \nlevel and a certain group of people. A lot of times those laws have \nbeen in place for a long period of time. Congressional intent was \nfollowed for a long period of time. And then there is somebody sitting \nin some bureaucracy--in this case, the Treasury Department--that says, \noh, no, that is not what Congress intended; this is what they intended. \nThen he changes it. We don't have a process for reviewing that. This \nlegislation will give a process for that review. But we will not find \nourselves in a position of having to correct something that is contrary \nto congressional intent, but also with the idiotic situation that we \nsomehow have to come up with revenue to offset a change of policy that \nwe never intended in the first place.\n\n  So I applaud the Senator and thank him for not bringing it up at this \npoint.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, first, I would like to say that I \nappreciate very much Senator Shelby's suggestion for reform of the \nunilateral ability of IRS to increase taxes. I would like to ask my \nfellow Senator from Alabama if he would allow me to be a cosponsor of \nthat.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Will the Senator from Alabama yield to the other Senator \nfrom Alabama?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would be happy to do that. I think what we need to do \nin the next few weeks, working together with some of my colleagues like \nSenator Kerrey and others on the other side of the aisle, is to let our \ncolleagues know what this is and what it does. If we pass this \nlegislation in the future, it is going to be another step toward \naccountability for us with the American people. I think it is very \npossible. I will be glad to add the Senator on.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. President, I would like to first congratulate Senator Roth and \nhis committee on their effort to reform the Internal Revenue Service. I \nthink they have made great progress, and the bill is to be greatly \npraised, is long needed, and I am delighted to see where we are \ndiscussing this matter.\n  I do, however, feel that it is important to join with Senator Fred \nThompson of Tennessee, who spoke earlier this afternoon on his proposal \nto not waive applicable conflicts of interest laws with regard to \nindividuals who sit on the IRS Oversight Board. I do not believe this \nis the appropriate thing to do. I believe we need to deal with this \nforthrightly. It should not be allowed to happen.\n  Mr. President, I spent almost 15 years as a Federal prosecutor. I \nprosecuted criminal cases on a regular basis. I personally tried judges \nand public officials for fraud and corruption. My office did many of \nthose cases. It was an insidious thing as it occurred.\n  We have crafted over the years a series of laws that are designed in \nsuch a way that those laws protect the public from conflicts of \ninterest and other types of unhealthy relationships that would put that \nperson in office in a position in which his total fidelity is to\n\n[[Page S4420]]\n\nanything other than the government which he represents. That is what we \nare looking for. Somewhere in the Book of Ecclesiastes the preacher \nsaid ``A bribe corrupts the mind.'' A conflict of interest corrupts the \nmind. The person is torn. You cannot serve two masters. You can only \nserve one master. A member of a board of the oversight of the Internal \nRevenue Service ought to have a clear mind with one motive, and that is \nto improve and enhance the effectiveness of that institution which is \nfundamentally necessary. At least under the present Tax Code it is \nnecessary.\n  So I believe this is an important matter. I would like to share with \nthe Members of this body the Code sections of the law that would \napparently be violated and could potentially clearly be violated by an \nappointment of the kind suggested here; that is, a member of the \nInternal Revenue Service Union on the oversight board.\n  This is suggested in this fashion: It follows under the rubric of \nbribery, graft, and conflict of interest in the United States Code. It \nis title 18 U.S. Code, section 203. It makes it a crime to seek himself \nor agree to receive any compensation as an agent or attorney for a \nthird party when a person is working as an officer for the Federal \nGovernment.\n  We are talking about appointing a member to the board representing \nthe Federal Government helping us to develop an effective Internal \nRevenue Service while at the same time receiving compensation as a \nunion official in an organization that may well have a conflict of \ninterest with the Internal Revenue Service. They are advocates. There \nis nothing wrong with that. Union members are advocates. Their \ncommission, their heart and soul is committed to getting the maximum \nreturn for their members. It is not the same interest as a member of \nthe board should have, which is in the public interest. You can't serve \ntwo masters.\n  I suggest that is a potential violation of the law if this member \nwere to be on the board. It is not theoretical. We are talking about \nreal conflict.\n  Section 205 of title 18 of the Criminal Code makes it a crime for any \nFederal employee to appear as an agent or attorney on behalf of anyone \nin a proceedings to which the United States is a party.\n  In other words, you can't have a Federal employee of the Government \nappearing in an action against the Government. Frequently the union is \ncontesting with the Government. So now we have a person on one side of \nthe lawsuit supposedly having his responsibilities solely to the best \ninterest of the public of the United States at the same time being paid \nto represent his union members who may well be standing against what \nthat interest is.\n  Title 18 of section 207 makes it a crime to make certain \ncommunications to an official of the Federal Government on behalf of \nany other person if the communications are made with intent to \ninfluence.\n  It makes it a crime to make certain communications to an official of \nGovernment on behalf of any other person if they are made with the \nintent to influence. This section is a dangerous section for any board \nmember who is an officer of the union. It was designed really to deal \nwith post-employment communications. But in this instance he would \nobviously be making communications both ways.\n  Title 18, section 208, is the general conflict of interest provision \nfor the United States. It makes it a crime for a Federal employee to \nparticipate ``personally and substantially'' in any way in a matter \nwhere he himself, his family, a partner or others have ``a financial \ninterest.''\n  This individual is paid by the union. It is in his financial interest \nto do the best bargaining he can, the most money and benefits he can \nfor his union members. Yet he is serving on the offer side, the board, \nthat is supposed to be protecting the public interest.\n  I would say, first of all, that I see there is a real danger that \nthis member, if appointed as suggested, would in fact be in violation \nof any one or perhaps all four of those criminal statutes. If any of \nthese violations are committed--and there are penalties of up to 1 year \nin jail for violation of them, and if any of them were done willfully \nthe penalties go up to 5 years in jail, and are a felony. What is \nwillful? It is knowingly and with intent to violate the law. I would \nsay, first of all, we have four potential violations of criminal law by \nthis appointment.\n  The Finance Committee to its credit recognized there was a problem. \nWell, they should have. There is a problem. And it is not theoretical. \nIt is very real because the member they want to put on this board has a \nconflict of interest.\n  They say, ``Well, let's just change this law. Let's pass as part of \nour bill a proposal to exempt them from it, and just say it won't apply \nto this nominee to the board. And that would solve all of our \nproblems.'' Well, I wish it were so simple that we could do that. You \ncan call a cat a dog but it is still a cat. You can say there is no \nconflict of interest but it is still there under these circumstances. \nThat is what the law was passed for.\n  I think we need to give some real credit to the Office of Government \nEthics.\n  Mr. President, I serve on the Senate Ethics Committee. We hear \ncomplaints periodically. Many of them are not well founded at all. But \nwe go over them one by one. Staff people analyze them. We read the Code \nand we see if we have a conflict of interest. If we do, we deal with \nthat. A lot of Senators have been severely damaged because of founded \nethics complaints against them over the years.\n  But I would just say to you that it is important for this institution \nto make sure that what we are doing is consistent with the highest \npossible standards of ethics and law in this nation.\n  The Office of Government Ethics took the extraordinary step on May \n1st of writing a letter dealing with this special project; this very \nspecial thing. This is what they said.\n  First of all, they said the criminal conflict of interest laws should \nnot be viewed as impediments to good government. What does that mean? \nCriminal conflict of interest laws should not be viewed as an \nimpediment to good government. In other words, what they are saying is \nthe criminal ethics laws are for good government. They are not trying \nto stop good government. They are trying to stop conflicts of interest \nthat lead people in the position that they cannot effectively carry out \ntheir duties.\n  They go on to say--I am quoting directly--these laws ``are there for \na purpose and should not be waived for mere convenience.''\n  Mr. President, I totally agree. I know it sounds like, well, we just \nhave a problem. This is just a technical thing. We can just pass this \nlaw and exempt this board member from it, and that will be the only \nboard member on the Commission exempt from the ethics law, the only \none, but we will just do that because, well, it is convenient. We would \nlike him to be on the Board, and we will just waive the ethics law. But \nyou can't do that and expect it to go away. There is a conflict of \ninterest that the law legitimately was set up to prohibit to make sure \nthat we have an uncorrupted individual on that board. A member who does \nnot have influences on them financially or otherwise that would cause \nthem to do acts that are not in the public interest. I believe very \nsincerely that we have to deal with this issue and that it will not go \naway.\n  We must not do this. It would be a downward slope, a retreat from \nhigh standards of ethics--actually, a retreat from basic ethics. This \nisn't some gray area; this is flatly prohibited by present criminal law \nfor which you can get 5 years in the slammer. U.S. attorneys are \nprosecuting people who do these kinds of things with these kinds of \nconflicts. To pass a law to say everybody else has to adhere to them \nexcept for one individual because he or she is special is a big \nmistake.\n  I can see how people may have not thought it through. I hope all \nMembers of this body will give it most serious thought. It would be a \nmistake for us to blithely go along and think this waiver of the ethics \nlaw is just a mere technicality and see it as somehow an impediment to \ngood Government. As the Government Ethics Office said, it is not an \nimpediment to good Government; it is good Government. And it is put \nthere for a purpose and should not be waived for mere inconvenience.\n  Mr. President, I certainly know that the members of this committee, \nthe Finance Committee, who worked so hard,\n\n[[Page S4421]]\n\nare determined to reform the Internal Revenue Service. I know they want \nto do what they can. I know they want the influence of the IRS's \nmembers who have insight into how this enterprise ought to be operated. \nThey have some good insight, and they have made some good, constructive \ncomments to this legislation. But there are other ways, as the \nGovernment Ethics Office suggested, to allow them to have input. There \nare other ways to allow them to be able to shape any kind of rules, \nregulations or reforms that are made. There are ways to do this without \ngiving up the fundamental principle that a man or woman can only serve \none master, not two, and should not be holding public office with a \nclear conflict of interest.\n  I thank the Chair. I urge my fellow Senators to vote against this \nproposal.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I find myself this afternoon speaking \nagainst a lot of my friends with whom I generally agree most of the \ntime, and so I am somewhat chagrined that I have to oppose my good \nfriend from Alabama and the position he has just taken as he spoke in \nfavor of the Thompson amendment. I rise in opposition to it.\n  This amendment is not about conflict of interest laws. That is not \nits intent. It is about having an employee representative serve on the \noversight board. I believe very strongly that we must have the employee \nrepresentative on this oversight board. As you have already heard \nSenator Kerrey say, he agrees with that. We both had the honor of \nserving on this National Commission on the Restructuring of the IRS. We \nwere the only two Senators to do so. I think our year's experience \nthere taught us something, and that is the value of having people who \nspeak for and work with the employees, other than in a management \ncapacity, to show their good intent, that they want Government to \nfunction in an efficient manner and to serve the customers well.\n  That would be true of Rob Tobias, who is the current President of the \nNational Treasury Employees Union. He served with us on this \nCommission. I was very impressed with him and with his work. With his \nhard work and support, the Commission, by a very strong majority--we \nprobably would have had a majority otherwise, but such a slim majority \nthat I don't feel we would be here with such a strong piece of \nlegislation as we do now--issued a report that calls for far-reaching \nreforms at the IRS. The employees organization and their representative \ncontributed substantially to this report and to making sure there were \nstrong, substantive recommendations.\n\n  I believe that he or another employee representative will have the \nsame effect while serving on the IRS Oversight Board. He and the \nmembers of his organization want real change at the IRS. The IRS \nemployees care about where they work and how they serve the people. \nThey want the IRS to run smoothly and their customers to be happy with \nthe service they receive. They are caught up today in this culture of \nintimidation, a culture that says, ``We don't care anything about the \ntaxpayers, we don't care how we treat the taxpayers,'' whether as a \ntaxpayer or just as an American citizen who is doing business with \nthem. I believe they want to take pride in where they work and the \nactions of the Internal Revenue Service. The employee representative \nwill help ensure that the oversight board makes this happen.\n  For this reason, Senator Kerrey and I included an employee \nrepresentative on the IRS Oversight Board when we introduced the first \nIRS restructuring bill last July, S. 1096. For this reason, we offered \nthe amendment that put the employee representative back on the \noversight board during the Finance Committee debate because the \nchairman's mark did not have this in it.\n  Now, remember, the House of Representatives passed their bill by a \nvote of 426 to 4--426 to 4--and that bill in the House had an employee \nrepresentative serving on the oversight board. We have strong support \nfor this principle. If we are going to have an employee representative \nthen on the oversight board, we need to let him do more than just serve \nthe coffee while the meetings are going on, because if we do not have \nthis language in the bill that the Thompson amendment wants to take \nout, he would not have the same power that we give to other members of \nthat oversight board. Otherwise, we lose the benefit of that expertise. \nOtherwise, we lose the benefit of the enthusiasm of the organization \nand its representative to make real change at the Internal Revenue \nService. Let me say, in short, otherwise, we are just simply wasting \nour time. This is a part-time advisory board. Consequently, it is a \ngood place to use his advice.\n  The bill before us, as drafted, sets up additional requirements that \nthe employee representative must meet. I would like to read from the \ncommittee report.\n\n       The employee representative is subject to the same public \n     financial disclosure rules as a private life board member. In \n     addition, the employee organization is required to provide an \n     annual financial report with the House Ways and Means \n     Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. Such report is \n     required to include the compensation paid to the individual \n     employee by the employee organization and membership dues \n     collected by that organization.\n\n  In addition, this person must have been confirmed by the Senate of \nthe United States before serving on the IRS Oversight Board. These laws \nhave been waived for similar purposes before. This is not new; it is \nnot landmark. The point being made-- that everybody should abide by the \nsame laws--albeit true, but remember, as Senator Kerrey said, we make \nthose laws. We are making this policy to make this person an effective \nmember of the IRS Oversight Board.\n  I conclude by saying that the conflict of interest laws are designed \nto alleviate hidden conflicts of interest. Now, this employee \nrepresentative has no hidden agenda. We know who he works for. And \nguess what. The employee representative on the board works for an \norganization that represents employees. Again, the issue is not waiver \nof laws. The issue is having an employee representative being able to \nserve, and effectively serve, on the oversight board. This, of course, \nis a back-door way, if this amendment were to be adopted, to get rid of \nthe employee representative. Or, if he wasn't gotten rid of, it would \nbe making him an ineffective member of the oversight board, gutting the \nmain intent that we have of his inclusion on the board, because we \nthink there can be a contribution, a real contribution, made.\n\n  So, in my opinion, if my colleagues would accept my year's work on \nthis issue, being a member of this IRS Restructuring Commission, I ask \nmy colleagues to vote against the Thompson amendment. After my work on \nthe National Commission on Restructuring, I think, regarding the bill \nwe have, and even a much stronger bill that we have now because of the \nwork of the Senator from Delaware on the legislation, improving it very \nmuch as a result of the committee hearings, we need to move forward. \nThis would really cause problems if this person is not able to serve on \nthis board.\n  So I emphasize again, this was in the House Ways and Means bill. It \nwas approved by the House of Representatives by 426 to 4, to have an \nemployee representative on the board.\n  I think all the arguments are very strong. I make no apologies for \nthose arguments and would want to have this amendment defeated, the \nThompson amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, first, I would like to say I regret I cannot \nagree, on this particular issue, with my distinguished friend from \nIowa, for whom I have the greatest respect. We are, more often than \nnot, on the same side of an issue. But, because of the overwhelming \narguments, at least in my judgment, to the contrary, I must rise in \nstrong support of the amendment offered by the Senators from Tennessee \nand Alabama.\n  This amendment would strike the special waiver of all the criminal \nconflict of interest laws that were necessary to accommodate having an \nIRS employee representative on the IRS oversight board. Let me say that \nwhat I say today in no way is in disrespect to the individual who would \nprobably be the employee representative, Mr. Tobias. By all reports, he \nis a most dedicated, informed man. But, as I\n\n[[Page S4422]]\n\nsaid, the problem is that this amendment would strike the special \nwaiver of all the criminal conflict of interest laws that were \nnecessary to accommodate having such a representative, and waiving all \nthe conflict of interest laws is bad policy. It establishes very bad \nprecedent.\n  When this issue was debated during the Finance Committee markup \nsession, the Deputy Director of the Office of Government Ethics, the \noffice that was set up and created to ensure that conflicts of interest \ndo not arise in the Government, testified that she was not aware of any \ncase where all the criminal conflict of interest laws have been \nstatutorily waived for a single person.\n  Last Friday, the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, in \nidentical letters to the majority leader, the minority leader, Senator \nMoynihan, the ranking member, and myself, said that waiving the \nconflict of interest laws for one board member, ``is antithetical to \nsound Government ethics policy and thus to sound Government. Such \nacross-the-board statutory waivers for someone other than a mere \nadvisor is unprecedented and, we believe, inadvisable.''\n  Let me repeat, this statement that it is inadvisable comes from the \nOffice of Government Ethics.\n  I ask unanimous consent a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Office of\n\n\n                                            Government Ethics,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: This Office has reviewed H.R. 2676, the \n     Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of \n     1998, as it has been reported by the Finance Committee and, \n     we understand, is soon to be taken up by the Senate. At the \n     request of both the majority and minority, we provided \n     technical assistance to the Finance Committee staff with \n     regard to drafting the language of provisions setting forth \n     the ethical considerations for the Members of the Internal \n     Revenue Service Oversight Board. We believe those provisions \n     are written in a clear and technically correct manner.\n       However, one provision of the bill, the proposed 26 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7802(b)(3)(D), provides for waivers of applicable \n     conflict of interest laws for one Member of that Board. We \n     believe that this provision is antithetical to sound \n     Government ethics policy and thus to sound Government. Such \n     across-the-board statutory waivers for someone other than a \n     mere advisor is unprecedented and, we believe, inadvisable.\n       We understand and agree that the employees of the Internal \n     Revenue Service should have an opportunity to be heard in any \n     decisions that may affect them. As we stated in a letter to \n     the Finance Committee, there are standard ways of allowing \n     input from interested parties without allowing the interested \n     party to be the actual decision-maker in a Governmental \n     matter. It is the latter role that is fundamentally at odds \n     with the concept that Government decisions should be made by \n     those who are acting for the public interest and not those \n     acting for a private interest. The one private interest that \n     is being waived in each case for this Board Member is the one \n     most fundamentally in conflict with his or her duties to the \n     public.\n       On the other hand, we cannot recommend that the waivers be \n     eliminated for the individual appointed to such a position. \n     That elimination would leave this individual extremely \n     vulnerable to charges of criminal conduct for carrying out \n     many Oversight Board actions or for carrying out his or her \n     private duties for the employee organization. The fact this \n     vulnerability exists exposes the pervasiveness of the \n     conflicts for an officer or employee of an employee \n     organization to serve on the Oversight Board.\n       Rather, we recommend the elimination of the position on the \n     Board that creates such inherent conflicts. The elimination \n     of the position could be coupled with a requirement that the \n     Board consult with employee organizations. While we think a \n     reasonable Board would consult without that requirement, \n     requiring consultation might provide some assurance to the \n     various employee organizations that they will be heard.\n       The criminal conflict of interest laws should not be viewed \n     as impediments to good Government. They are there for a \n     purpose and should not be waived for mere convenience. Some \n     may point out that certain provisions of these laws are \n     waived by agencies quite frequently. That is true. Some of \n     the laws anticipate circumstances where a restriction could \n     be waived and set forth the standards that must be met to \n     issue waivers. Agencies can and do issue such waivers, but \n     the waivers must meet the tests set forth in the statutes. \n     For those conflicts laws that do provide for waivers (not all \n     do), we believe that it would be extremely difficult for a \n     reasonable person to determine that the interests this \n     individual Board member will undoubtedly have through his or \n     her affiliation with the organization could meet those waiver \n     tests.\n       In order to meet our recommendation, we believe the \n     provisions of Subtitle B, sec. 1101(a) should be amended to \n     eliminate proposed sections 7802(b)(1)(D), (b)(3)(A)(ii) and \n     (b)(3)(D). All other references to an individual appointed \n     under section 7802(b)(1)(D) should be removed and wherever a \n     number of members of the board is indicated (such as a Board \n     composed of nine members or five members for a quorum) that \n     number should be altered to reflect the elimination of this \n     position.\n       We appreciate the opportunity to express our concerns and \n     our recommendations. These are the views of the Office of \n     Government Ethics and not necessarily those of the \n     Administration. We are available to answer any questions you \n     or any other Member of the Senate may have with regard to \n     this letter or the conflict of interest laws. We are sending \n     identical letters to Senators Daschle, Roth and Moynihan.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Stephen D. Potts,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Senators note importantly, I think, how we are a nation of \nlaws and we are, indeed, a nation of laws. When it comes to Government \nservice, perhaps the most important set of laws is the criminal \nconflict of interest laws. Many of these laws trace their origins back \nto the Civil War era. They were enacted in the 1860s in response to \nmisconduct in the procurement process. These laws embodied the \nprinciple that a Government servant, even a part-time servant, has an \noverriding responsibility to serve the best interests of the American \npublic. The punishment for violating this public trust includes \nimprisonment of up to 5 years and penalties of up to $250,000. The \nseverity of the penalties reflects the critical importance that these \nlaws play in our Government. They serve to protect the public's trust \nin Government employees and the laws are designed to prevent Government \nemployees from taking actions that could jeopardize this public trust.\n  Let me give a few real-life examples of what could happen if the \nconflict of interest laws are waived for the IRS employee \nrepresentative. Just suppose that a representative of the IRS employees \nunion serves on the oversight board and the union files a lawsuit \nagainst the oversight board. If the conflict of interest laws are \nwaived, the union representative could work with the union in preparing \nthe lawsuit and at the same time--at the same time--work with the \noversight board in defending against the lawsuit. Taxpayers would be \noutraged by this conduct, and rightfully so.\n  Just suppose the union is asked to make a formal presentation to the \noversight board. The union representative can make the formal \npresentation and then participate in the oversight board's \ndeliberations with respect to the presentation. What message does this \nsend to the taxpayer? What does this do to the public trust in \nGovernment employees and in what Congress is trying to do to improve \nthe IRS?\n  Let me quote again from the letter by the Office of Government \nEthics:\n\n       The criminal conflict of interest laws should not be viewed \n     as impediments to good Government. They are there for a \n     purpose and should not be waived for mere convenience.\n\n  Mr. President, the criminal conflict of interest laws should not and \nmust not be waived for a single individual. To do so would seriously \nerode the sacred trust that the public has placed in its employees to \ndo what is in the Nation's best interests. For these reasons, I \nstrongly support this amendment and I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, again, I say to colleagues there is a \nthree-part test that one has to go through in this regard: A, do you \nwant an oversight board; B, who do you want on the board; and, C, how \nare you going to deal with apparent conflicts of interest?\n  The conflict of interest issue is a very serious issue and, indeed, \nour committee, in order to confirm Mr. Rossotti, had to deal with that. \nWe wrote an agreement, a letter, I believe, of understanding between \nMr. Rossotti, a private sector individual with significant private \nsector interests who was willing to come in and serve his country in \nthe Government.\n  I talk to colleagues all the time about one of the problems we have \nin\n\n[[Page S4423]]\n\nGovernment today is it is getting harder and harder to get anybody to \nserve. Why? Because there is a perception that as soon as you come in \nand work for the Government that somehow you are going to be the crook.\n  I would be real careful with some of the rhetoric on this particular \nissue. We made an exception with Mr. Rossotti as a consequence and \nconcerns about conflict of interest, and we didn't ask the Office of \nGovernment Ethics to comment on him, but we did on this one because \nmany in the committee don't like this idea of having an employee \nrepresentative on the board, nor does Government Ethics.\n  Let me talk about this idea of conflict of interest. According to the \nOffice of Government Ethics, at least 609 exemptions under section \n208(d)(1) were granted in 1997. Why? It is very important to \nunderstand. Why did we grant an exemption? The answer is because we \nhave an interest. There is an important interest involved here, \nsomething that we want to do. So we find ourselves saying the interest \nis not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of \nthe services which a government may expect from such officer or \nemployee. That is the standard we use.\n  There were 609 exemptions granted because we have an interest in \nmaking certain that something gets done. That is what we have here. One \nof the worst excuses--I used to be in business before I got into \npolitics. One of the reasons I got into politics is I got worn out \nlistening to people say, ``I know what you are asking for is right, \nbut, gosh, if I have to do it for you, then I have to do it for \neverybody.''\n  There is nothing more frustrating than to have somebody say, ``I \ndon't want to set a dangerous precedent here.''\n  We need to decide what is right. Is it in the Nation's interest in an \neffort to restructure the IRS that is going to require significant and, \nI argue, traumatic personnel decisions, to have a representative of the \nTreasury employees' association on there? They represent 95 percent of \nover 100,000 employees. And we answered yes. The House answered yes. \nThe Restructuring Commission answered yes, because there is an interest \nthat we have.\n  Do we waive all conflict of interest requirements? Members should \nremember, every member of this board has to be recommended by the \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate. We all know around here, you can \nfile a hold on anybody for any reason you want. If there is a conflict \nof interest, file a hold. That individual is likely never to get \nconfirmed. In addition, for cause this individual can be removed at any \ntime. The President can remove the individual from the board as a \nconsequence of something they see they don't like, something they see \nthey view as a perception of a conflict of interest, let alone a real \nconflict of interest.\n\n  Lastly, I will say if this individual is guilty of a conflict of \ninterest, there will be charges filed against him or her and, indeed, \nevery single member of this board is going to have to file an annual \nreport indicating what their financial holdings are in order to avoid a \nconflict of interest.\n  Again, we all understand it is getting increasingly difficult to get \npeople to serve because of the invasive nature of the examination. Talk \nto a friend of yours who has had an FBI background investigation. Gosh, \nthey are out there talking to people you knew in the fourth grade. You \nwouldn't want to talk to people I knew in the fourth grade to find out \nwhether I am going to be able to serve on some board or commission.\n  Let me just list for colleagues who are worried about this conflict \nof interest--we decided there is an overriding interest to have an \nemployee representative on there as a consequence of the tremendous and \ntraumatic changes that are going to occur over the next couple of years \nas the new authorities of this Commissioner are used to reorganization \nand restructure the IRS.\n  In addition, this representative is going to be required to have \nfull, public, financial disclosure by the employee organization \nrepresented. All members of this oversight board will be required to do \nthat. In addition, the employee organization is required to file \ndetailed financial information with the House Ways and Means Committee \nand the Senate Finance Committee. The information would include \nmembership dues and compensation of all employees.\n  In addition, it requires the employee representative to be subject to \nall the conflict of interest statutes applicable to special Government \nemployees, except to the extent they apply to the employee \norganization.\n  Mr. President, as Members no doubt know, we have a bill and a thing \ncalled a report. It says, ``The Internal Revenue Service Restructuring \nand Reform Act of 1998, April 22, 1998.--Ordered to be printed; Mr. \nRoth, from the Committee on Finance, submitted the following Report.''\n  This report describes the rationales and reasons for doing all these \nthings. Let me read to colleagues who are wondering about this thing \nand really whether or not you want an employee representative on this \nboard. As I said, if you do, you have to give that individual the \nauthority and power to be able to do something, and we have made a \njudgment as a consequence of that overriding interest that we are going \nto write language in here that deals with apparent conflict. It doesn't \nwaive all other conflicts, as I have just tried to address. But even \nthe report does that. Let me read it to you:\n\n       In general, the bill provides that the employee \n     representative or Board member is subject to the same ethical \n     conduct rules as private-life Board members.\n\n  Let me repeat this, because there is an inference in some of the \nstatements down here that somehow we are waiving all conflict of \ninterest rules. Not true. This individual is going to be subject to the \nsame ethical conduct rules as private-life board members.\n\n       However, the bill modifies the otherwise applicable ethical \n     conduct rules so that they do not preclude the \n     employee representative from carrying out his or her \n     duties as a Board member and his or her duties with \n     respect to the employee organization.\n\n  That is all we are doing. We say there is an overriding interest. We \nhave to make sure the employee can carry out their job, so we provide \nspecifically language in here that enables them to do it. Otherwise, \nwhy put them on the board?\n\n       In particular, the employee representative is not \n     prohibited from (1) representing the interests of the \n     employee organization before the Federal Government; (2), \n     acting on a Board matter because the employee organization \n     has a financial interest in the matter.\n\n  They are precluded from conflicts dealing with procurements. They are \nprecluded from taking bribes. They are precluded from all the other \nthings that other board members are precluded from doing. All the rest \nof the things that all the board members are precluded from doing, this \nindividual will be as well. Indeed, in the footnote, it says:\n\n       Certain limitations to this exception to the otherwise \n     applicable ethical rules would apply.\n\n  The rules pertaining to bribery would continue to apply. In addition, \nthe representative would be acting on a matter in which he or she has a \nfinancial interest.\n  If some U.S. attorney, some prosecutor wants to bring charges against \nany member of this board for violating conflict of interest statutes, \nthey are going to be able to do it. Everybody who has asked, whether it \nis by this President or future Presidents, ``Gee, Mr. and Mrs. Jones, \nwould you be willing to serve on this board?'' They understand what is \nat stake. They understand the nature of American politics today. They \nunderstand if you walk into the arena willing to serve your country, \nyou may find yourself saying, ``God, I wish I never said yes. All of a \nsudden I am more miserable than I thought I ever would be, because \nsomebody has an ax to grind or grudge to fulfill is going after me all \nof a sudden.''\n  We have made a decision that we think as a result of the tremendous \ndecisions that are going to have to be made by the Commission to \nrestructure an organization that has 100,000 human beings--these are \nfamily people; these are people who have good jobs and are trying to \nget the job done. All they are doing is trying to execute our law.\n  One of the most amusing things down here is to hear people talk about \nthe IRS as if they think it is a Sears and Roebuck or some private \norganization.\n\n[[Page S4424]]\n\n It is like the kiss of the Spider Woman. We are the creator of the \nIRS. We write the laws here.\n  In response to the OGE's concerns, we put language in here, and even \nOGE says we have adequately taken care of it. They just don't want an \nemployee representative on there at all, no matter what you do with the \nlaw. No matter what you do with the language of the law, they are going \nto take the position that an employee representative shouldn't be on \nthere.\n  Fine, let them take that decision. We made the decision we want that \nemployee representative on there, and once we made that decision, we \nhave to make certain we deal in a reasonable way so that with the law, \nthat individual can do what we have asked them to do.\n  I have great respect for the Senator from Alabama and the Senator \nfrom Tennessee and, obviously, the distinguished chairman of our \ncommittee. I hope this amendment will be rejected.\n  I ask if the chairman--we have had two votes today, and we have, I \nthink, somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 amendments that we are \nlikely to deal with. The majority leader indicated he would like to \nwrap this up tomorrow night. I am wondering if we can get a time \nagreement. We have a couple others that are fairly contentious that it \nseems to me we need to get down here.\n  I would hazard the guess that nothing I have just said is going to \npersuade anybody one way or the other. This is one where everybody has \npretty well made their minds up. Maybe they will be persuaded because \nof the eloquence and the logical manner of the chairman, but I think \nthis is one where people have made up their minds. So let us insert our \nstatements in the Record and go to a rollcall vote so we can get to the \nfinal passage of the bill, as the majority leader wants to, by tomorrow \nnight.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Let me say, on this question of completion of consideration \nof this legislation, I strongly agree that we want to move as \nexpeditiously as possible. It is my intent that we will complete the \nlegislation tomorrow, staying as late as may be necessary.\n  Mr. President, I would like to respond to some of the earlier \ncomments made on the granting of waivers to the conflict of interest \nlaws. I would like to point out that the waiver granted Mr. Rossotti \nwas made by the same Office of Ethics that made a very persuasive \nargument here that we should not waive the criminal conflicts of \ninterest as has been done under the legislation.\n  Let me point out that there is a major difference between receiving a \nspecific agency waiver under section 208 of the ethics law, which is \nwhat the Senator was referring to, and a wholesale statutory waiver of \nall the conflict of interest laws, which is what is contemplated in the \nIRS bill.\n  Again, what Mr. Rossotti got was a specific agency waiver under \nsection 208. To get a specific agency waiver under section 208, the \nemployee must disclose the situation which gives rise to the conflict, \nand the agency need only to determine that the conflict--and I quote--\n``is not so substantial to affect the integrity of the services which \nthe Government may expect from the employee.''\n  The problem with the IRS employee representative is that the \nconflicts are so substantial and pervasive that the representative \nwould almost never qualify for a waiver. And that is not my conclusion, \nthat is the conclusion of the Office of Government Ethics. Quoting from \ntheir letter dated March 27, 1998, the director wrote:\n\n       While section 208 does contain a waiver provision, it \n     applies only where the financial interest involved is ``not \n     so substantial'' as to be deemed likely to affect an \n     employee's service. We believe that it would be almost \n     impossible for an officer of a union to legitimately meet the \n     test set forth in the statute because of his own and the \n     union's financial interest that would be affected by the \n     matters before the Board.\n\n  The director repeated this point in his letter dated May 1, 1998, \nsaying:\n\n       For those conflicts laws that do provide for waivers (not \n     all do), we believe that it would be extremely difficult for \n     a reasonable person to determine that the interests this \n     individual Board Member will undoubtedly have through his or \n     her affiliation with the organization could meet those waiver \n     tests.\n\n  The quoted language also raises a second important point, which is \nthat some of the conflict of interest laws do not provide for waivers \nat all.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is this: A statutory waiver of all the \ncriminal conflict of interest laws for one person is simply wrong, it \nis very bad policy, and it establishes a dangerous precedent.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say to the chairman, do you see what we are doing \nhere, as a matter of principle, any different than if this body were to \npass a law to exempt an individual from the bribery laws?\n  Mr. KERREY. I hope the answer is no, for gosh sakes. We understand \nwhat the nature of bribery is.\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes. A bribery law is part of the criminal code. I would \nnot exempt it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This is a criminal provision. We have been using the \nword ``ethics,'' but it is really a criminal provision, isn't that \nright, Mr. Chairman?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Criminal law of the United States. And I can see, \ntherefore, why the Ethics Committee would suggest it was unprecedented \nthat the U.S. Congress would pass a law to exempt someone from the \ncriminal law of the United States. I hope that is unprecedented. And my \ncomplaint, I say to the chairman, just simply is this--to say that I \nunderstand what the Senators have been trying to do. I understand their \ngood intent. But I think we are confusing ourselves with the law of the \nUnited States. This is a very bad thing. It is a very bad policy. It \nshould not happen. And we need to vote on it. I appreciate the chairman \nyielding.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I don't know on what basis the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware answers the question that, yes, it \nis like giving an exemption to bribery law. In our own report, we say \nthe rules related to bribery would continue to apply. I mean, that is a \nred herring, raising the issue of bribery. Look, I feel like I am \narguing the red queen here.\n  We made a decision as a consequence of an overriding interest that we \nwant a Treasury employee representative on this board. Why? What is the \ninterest? Do you want to get the restructuring done or not? No? You are \nopposed to it? Fine. Say no. But our Commission heard from people, both \nin the private sector and the public sector, that have done this sort \nof thing. They said, ``Folks, if you want to get the job done''--\nunderstand we're talking about traumatic changes in how people work. \nYou can imagine, we would want a Senate representative on a board that \nwas going to be restructuring this place. Do you think anybody would \nsay, ``Gee, we've got a conflict. We can't sit on a board that might \nreduce the number of people here from 100 to 80\"? I don't think so. I \nthink one of us would want to be on that board. And we would write to \nthe Office of Government Ethics and say, ``To heck with you. We'll \nfigure out a way to get it done.''\n\n  That is what we are talking about here. The employee representative \nwill enable us to get the job done. We have to have a substantial \nreduction in forces as a consequence of this restructuring. It is going \nto be traumatic. It is going to be difficult. And over and over I have \nsaid we heard from both public and private sector people: Get somebody \nwho's going to have to sell this thing on this board.\n  So now you are left with the question, how do I do that? Obviously, \nthey still represent the employee's union. Obviously, they still have a \njob responsibility out there in some fashion. Well, we have to deal \nwith that specific conflict. It is not a carte blanche, broad-based \nwaiver that includes such things as bribery. Come on.\n  If you do not want a Treasury representative on there, don't put him \non there. If you think the law is going to produce a conflict, well \nthen, file a complaint, and go down to the Government Ethics Office and \nsay this individual has a conflict. Any citizen is going to have the \nopportunity to do that.\n  But I caution Members. That is why we are having a tough time getting \nanybody to serve. We go through this\n\n[[Page S4425]]\n\nnominating process all the time around here, and we find ourselves with \nfriends saying, ``My gosh, I don't want to serve in that capacity. Look \nat all the things I've got to go through in order to be a public \nservant today.''\n  Mr. Rossotti is a very good case in point--a very good case in point. \nA strict interpretation of the ethics rules would have caused us to \nsay, ``Mr. Rossotti, I understand that you are willing to say yes to \nthe President, but we have to respectfully say no. We are just not \ngoing to do it. We're not going to allow you. You have all this private \nsector experience, all this management experience, but it's a conflict. \nYou've got ownership of stock in a company that does business with the \nIRS, therefore, you're disqualified.''\n  That is what we are dealing with here. The Commissioner of the IRS \nhas a company that does business with the IRS. Now, can we deal with \nthat? The answer is absolutely yes, because it is a compelling interest \nto get it done. Likewise, there is a compelling interest as a result of \nthe traumatic change.\n  I ask any Member here, again, if there was a board out there that was \ngoing to make a decision that could reduce in force the number of \npeople in the Senate from 100 to 80, would we say, ``Well, we don't \nneed to have a representative on there because we have a conflict''? I \ndon't think so.\n\n  We asked to be on the board, and we deal with the Office of \nGovernment Ethics, and we figure out a way to make certain that \nconflict is narrowly drawn, because of the overriding interest of the \nemployee representative on the board who will make these decisions.\n  If you don't want the board, fine; I understand that. The Senator \nfrom Texas is skeptical about the board. Skepticism in many ways is \ndeserved. You never know if the board will be great or not. I think it \nwill be great. If you don't want an employee representative, fine; say \nso. But please don't get down here and say that we are doing something \ncomparable to waiving the bribery statute. That is not what we are \ndoing.\n  We are going to have a very, very difficult time if this degenerates \ninto a debate about loosening up our ethics law to allow all kinds of \ncriminal conduct. We are not doing that. It is a narrowly drawn \nexception to enable the individual to do a job we want the individual \nto do.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Essentially, the amendment offered by the Senator from \nTennessee is an amendment to take an employee off the board. That is \nthe point. The real question we have to ask ourselves is: Do we want \nthis restructuring to work or not? We create a Board, give the Board \ncertain powers, and the Restructuring Commission, led by Senator \nGrassley from Iowa and Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, concluded there \nshould be among board members an employee representative. That was \ntheir conclusion. They believed that would help restructuring work.\n  Why? Because so many of the problems that we have with the IRS, most \nof the problems that were documented at the Finance Committee hearings, \nare employee problems--that is, rogue employees, employees who were \ncovering up, employees doing this or that. Also problems with \nmanagers--some of them were doing their job, some were not.\n  Obviously, an employee who is on the Board will be able to tell the \nBoard what is going on, what is not going on, what the views of the \nemployees are, and so forth.\n  Now some suggest that the Board should just consult with employees. \nThat will not work. You need somebody there on the Oversight Board who \nwill be able to not only report to the employees what is going on, but \nbe able to send back to employees what board policy is if we are going \nto get restructuring to work.\n  We need teamwork here. We don't need an adversarial relationship. We \nare not talking about Board versus employees. We are talking about a \nBoard which will make restructuring work. Just think about it. An \nemployee on the Board will help make this work.\n  If you want an employee, you want a good employee; right? You want a \ngood representative on the Board. How do you make sure you get a good, \nsolid employee on the Board? First, you have the President appoint the \nemployee. That is the what the bill provides. Obviously, the President \nwill appoint somebody he or she thinks is a person who will do a very \ngood job because it is in his interest to make IRS restructuring work.\n  What is another check? Confirmation by the Senate. I say to my \ncolleagues, if you don't like the employee representative that the \nPresident nominates to the Board, you can vote against him or her. \nDuring the confirmation process, you have an opportunity to check into \nthe background of this appointee. You can check to see whether this is \na good or bad person. That is a real good check which will enable you \nto get a sense whether this is a person who has conflicts or who will \nbe a public servant--who will be narrowly representing his or her \nprivate interests or his or her organization. You can get a sense of \nthese matters through the confirmation hearings.\n  In addition to that, the President can remove any Board member, \nincluding the employee representative, at will--that is, without cause, \nat will.\n  Finally, the employee representative is subject to the same \nrestrictions as the private life Board members; examples are \nthe disclosure requirements and the 1-year restriction after service on \nthe board.\n\n  Now, the main point here is: If you are going to have an employee on \nthe Board, how do you make sure that there are no conflicts of \ninterest? I remind my colleagues, when this bill passed the House 426-\n4, there were no restrictions; there was no waiver provision in the \nbill. They just said, OK, have an employee. Well, we have improved the \nbill by rewriting this provision.\n  I remind my colleagues, all the conflict of interest statutes apply \nto the employee representative, except for the very narrowly tailored \nsituation where conflicts arise because of his status as employee \nrepresentative. That is, because the employees he represents work for \nthe IRS and he or she is compensated by the employee organization. \nOtherwise, all conflict of interest statutes apply.\n  The comparison was raised about these waivers being like waiving \nviolations for bribery, a criminal offense. Of course, bribery is a \ncriminal offense. That is irrelevant. Murder is a criminal offense too. \nThere are all kinds of criminal offenses in our criminal law. That is \ntotally irrelevant to what we are talking about here.\n  The narrow, technical question here is: Are the provisions and the \nsafeguards that are written into this statute, in the committee report, \nsufficient to make sure that the employee representative does a good \njob and represents the public interest? Of course, that assumes you \nwant an employee on the Board in the first place.\n  Frankly, I do believe that most of those who are arguing to remove \nthe waiver are really arguing to remove the employee. It is a back-door \nway to get the employee off the Board. That is what is going on here. \nThat is what the argument is really all about. It is just a back-door \nway to accomplish an objective instead of dealing with it frontally, \ninstead of saying, ``We don't want an employee representative on the \nBoard.''\n  I feel very strongly that if we want this restructuring Board to \nwork, it makes sense to have an employee representative on it. There \nare lots of checks to make sure this employee is performing public \nservice instead of some private interest.\n  The amendment before the Senate, if it passes, will make it very, \nvery difficult for any employee to serve on the Board. I don't think \nthat is what we want to do. It is not good for the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. It seems the criticism of the amendment, first of all, \nis that there is no conflict anyway with regard to these employees \nserving on this board. Of course, if that is the case, there was no \nreason for the exemption. So by having the exemption in there, it is an \nopen admission there is an inherent and obvious conflict of interest.\n  The question is whether we want to do something about it. Do we want \nto single out this particular individual and say, ``With regard to \nyou--nobody else, but with regard to you--these\n\n[[Page S4426]]\n\nconflict of interest provisions will not apply; we don't care if you \nhave a clear and obvious conflict of interest''?\n  Secondly, it is said that this is very, very narrow as far as the \nexemption is concerned, but the bill, as reported, exempts a union \nrepresentative from four key ethic laws when the representative is \nacting on behalf of his or her union. Those four laws are a part of \nchapter 11, title 18, United States Code, entitled ``Bribery, Graft, \nand Conflicts of Interest.''\n  What are those provisions that we are exempting here? Generally \nspeaking, title 18, section 203, makes it a crime to ``demand, seek, \nreceive, accept, or agree to receive or accept'' any compensation as an \nagent or attorney for a third party when a person is working as an \nofficer or employee of the Federal Government.\n  That is one of the things we would be exempting this employee from.\n  The other section, section 205 of title 18, which is the criminal \ntitle, makes it a crime for any Federal employee to appear as an agent \nor attorney on behalf of anyone in a proceeding to which the United \nStates is a party.\n  So that is the second thing we would be exempting this particular \nmember from.\n  Thirdly, section 207, makes it a crime to make certain communications \nto an official of the Federal Government on behalf of any other person \nif the communications are made ``with the intent to influence.''\n  This is the third exemption that would apply.\n  Lastly, section 208, which is a general conflict-of-interest \nprovision which makes it a crime for a Federal employee to participate \n``personally and substantially'' in any way in a matter where he, \nhimself, his family, a partner, or certain others have ``a financial \ninterest.''\n  So, one just has to make a decision as to whether or not you feel \nthat this particular employee on this particular board--whether or not \nyou feel the employee ought to be on the board or not; we are not \ntaking them off the board by this amendment; presumably, there are some \nthings that this member could decide that would not present a conflict \nof interest--but you simply have to decide whether or not you want to \ntake this particular employee and treat him or her differently than \nanybody else in the Government. This is the sort of thing that we have \nspent substantial time in Governmental Affairs on with regard to the \nethics provisions and their applicability to employees.\n\n  I do not think it would be a good policy to have this exemption. As I \nsay, if there is no particular conflict with regard to any particular \nmatter that is before the board, all this is irrelevant anyway. There \nis no need for the exemption anyway. But if, in fact, they are on the \nboard and they are seeking compensation from a third party while \nworking for the Federal Government, or if they are appearing as an \nagent on behalf of anybody else who has a matter before the board, or \nif they are making communications with intent to influence when they \nare on the payroll of somebody else, this basically has to do with \nwhether or not it is a good idea to put somebody on the board to make \ndecisions with regard to themselves and their fellow employees, who \nthey represent. Certainly, they would have the ability to give their \ninput in lots of different ways.\n  But as far as decisions are concerned, we have seen the problems that \nwe have had with regard to IRS employees. Do we think we should place a \nrepresentative of the IRS employees on this board to make decisions as \nto what to do with the people with the problem? Certainly they should \nbe heard, but should they be on the board? Number one, OK, put them on \nthe board; number two, should we exempt them from all of the ethical \nrules, or these four particular ethical conflict of interest \nprovisions? I think we should not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first of all, let me once again say that \nwe make exceptions in order to accomplish something that we believe is \nimportant to accomplish. We accommodate the exception in order to stay \nwithin the guidelines of the Office of Government Ethics. We did that \nfor Mr. Rossotti. He would not be the commissioner of the IRS if we \ntook a strict interpretation of the conflict of interest law. We just \nwould not do it. He would be disqualified, as would anybody with any \nreal private sector interest or any real private sector experience.\n  It is ridiculous, it seems to me, to suggest that we never make \nexceptions. This is an exceptional case. We make them all the time. We \nmeasure it carefully, and we take care to make certain that the other \napplicable parts of the conflict of interest law are still enforced. \nThat is what we have done here. The Senator from Tennessee is quite \nright when he says, gee, you are making an exception of this \nindividual. Yes, we are. Why? He is the only employee representative. \nIf there were 7 employee representatives on the board, we would be \ndoing the same thing for everybody. That is what is going on. We have \none representative because there are going to be traumatic changes in \nthe IRS as a result of new authorities we are granting the commissioner \nin title I. Look at the new authorities we are granting.\n  I draw a parallel to this body. If we were granting some board \nauthority to make reductions around here, we would want to be on that \nboard. We would want to participate in that decision. And somebody \nwould say we have a conflict, but we would figure out a way to deal \nwith that, rest assured, if that were the case. That is what we have \ndone here. We have not exempted this individual. Just look at the \nstatute. We have not exempted this individual from all other conflicts \nof interest--only the conflict that deals with the fact that he works \nfor the IRS. That is what we are trying to deal with here. If you have \nsome specific ways you want to deal with that so you can get the job \ndone, we can do it. To stand out here and say, gee, we are making an \nexception, as if that is remarkable, yes, we are and we are trying to \ndeal with an exceptional circumstance, as we did with Mr. Rossotti in \nthe first place.\n\n  So, again, I say to colleagues that there is a threshold decision \nhere. Do you want an IRS representative on the board at all? If you do, \nyou have to deal with the concerns OGE has raised. That is what we have \ndone.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I refer to the position of the Office of \nGovernment Ethics on this. They have considered this matter and wrote \nto the minority leader. One provision of the bill provides for waivers \nof applicable conflict of interest laws for one member of that board. I \nam quoting now:\n\n       We believe that this provision is antithetical to sound \n     Government ethics policy and thus to sound Government. Such \n     across-the-board statutory waivers for someone other than a \n     mere advisor is unprecedented and, we believe, inadvisable.\n\n  So the comparisons to Mr. Rossotti, who formerly had a position in \nthe private sector, are inapplicable. As far as this body is concerned, \nwe spent a great deal of time answering to perceived conflict of \ninterest situations. I doubt if we would ever be in a situation of \nexempting ourselves from any of those considerations here.\n  So this is a very narrowly tailored provision. I understand the \nsentiment of having some input, having as broad an input as possible. \nHopefully, there would be a way to have that kind of input from the \nemployees on perhaps a less formalbasis. But there is an overriding \nissue here, Mr. President. I don't think we can willy-nilly say that \nany time we want to make an exception to the ethics rules because we \nwant to get the thing done. We can say that in almost every situation.\n  So I must agree with the ethics letter that has been made part of \nthis Record, which says it is unprecedented and antithetical to good \nGovernment ethics policy and therefore to good Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe temporarily laid aside so we can deal with an amendment to be \noffered by the Senators from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl and Mr. Feingold, who \nhave an amendment that both sides have agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object, briefly. I wanted to clarify something.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Nebraska \nis recognized.\n\n[[Page S4427]]\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New York be able to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object. I would like to have 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has the Senator from Nebraska yielded the \nfloor?\n  The Senator from Alabama----\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I have never objected to a person going \nforward for a minute or 2 minutes, but there is a way to try to \naccomplish this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, with regard to my raising the question \nof bribery as being the same in principle as what we are discussing \nhere, I would like to make a statement. Maybe I was misunderstood. I \nwould like to just say that, fundamentally, we are waiving the \napplicability of sections 203, 205, 207 of the United States Criminal \nCode. The bribery section is section 201 1.\n  As a matter of principle, I just wanted to make the point that what \nwe are being asked to do here is to waive the criminal law of the \nUnited States with regard to this particular individual, and the Ethics \nCommittee has said it is unprecedented. That means this body has never \ndone this in its entire history. This is a legal mistake. I am not here \nconcerning myself with the individuals who make up the board. I am here \nbecause it was called to my attention that this problem existed. I am a \nformer Federal prosecutor and a member of the Ethics Committee of this \nbody, and I believe this is a legal mistake--a legal mistake we should \nnot make. That is why I am making my comments now. I am very sorry to \ninterrupt the Senator from New York, but it was important to clarify \nthe record, I thought.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How long will the Senator from New York speak?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. No longer than 5 minutes.\n  (By unanimous consent, the remarks of Mr. D'Amato are printed in \ntoday's Record under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, while I support H.R. 2676, the Internal \nRevenue Service restructuring bill that is now before the Senate, I \nwould like to express my opposition to any amendment that would seek to \nremove an IRS employee representative from the citizens oversight board \nestablished in that legislation.\n  Mr. President, the idea of having an employee representative on the \noversight board is hardly a novel one. In fact, that idea has been \nincorporated into virtually every IRS reform proposal that has been \nmade in the last couple of years, including:\n  The recommendation of the bipartisan Commission to Restructure the \nInternal Revenue Service;\n  H.R. 2676, the House IRS reform bill that passed that body by a vote \nof 426-4.\n  The Senate Finance Committee's version of the IRS bill, which we are \nnow considering; and\n  The recommendation of the Administration.\n  That an employee representative has been deemed an essential part of \nthe proposed oversight board in particular--and IRS reform in general--\nshould not be surprising.\n  The IRS is an enormous agency of over 100,000 employees. The IRS \nreform bill we are now considering gives the proposed oversight board \nsignificant authority to review and approve plans for this agency's \noperation--its strategic plans, its reorganization plans, its budget \nrequests, and other fundamental operational matters.\n  Without the cooperation and input of the IRS' employees in this \nprocess, how can we possibly expect the Board's responsibilities to be \ndischarged in a manner that will make the oversight board an effective \ninstrument of reform?\n  Let us not forget that IRS employees have been instrumental in \nbringing to light much of the information that has caused Congress to \nundertake the reform efforts before us now.\n  Let us also recall that IRS employees have expertise in the operation \nof the agency that is unique and irreplaceable. This expertise is \nabsolutely integral to effecting the kinds of changes that we in \nCongress--and more important, the American people--want and expect.\n  Mr. President, the idea of having employee input in the basic \nmanagement decisions of major enterprises is not a novel one. In fact, \nthe placement of an employee representative on the IRS oversight board \nmirrors similar steps taken in several private sector businesses. For \nexample:\n  Northwest Airlines has a union representative on its Board of \nDirectors;\n  Similarly, the steelworkers union holds a position on the Boards of \nDirectors of several of our nation's biggest steel companies.\n  Thus, both the private sector and--in this legislation--the public \nsector have recognized the value of having employee input and \nparticipation in the management of major enterprises.\n  Those who seek to eliminate employee participation on the oversight \nboard charge that a union representative on the board will have \nconflicting interests that will hinder the board's effectiveness. Mr. \nPresident, My colleagues should note that this union representative:\n  Is subject to nomination by the President and confirmation by the \nSenate;\n  Must make full financial disclosure in accordance with current laws, \nlike all other Board members;\n  Is, unlike other Board members, subject to additional disclosure \nrequirements, including requirements to file financial disclosure \ninformation with the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means \nCommittees.\n  Will receive a waiver of conflict of interest laws along the lines of \nthose granted in over 1000 cases a year, where the public benefit of \nthe individual's participation in government decisionmaking outweighs \nthe potential benefit arising out of that participation.\n  In short, Mr. President, the union representative will face greater \nscrutiny than any other member of the Board; such scrutiny will ensure \nthat this representative will discharge his or her duties diligently \nand responsibly. Moreover, the House and the Senate Finance Committee \nhave determined that the public benefit of having an employee \nrepresentative on the Board outweighs the potential conflict by having \nhim or her on the Board. I think this determination is indisputably \ncorrect, and should not be disturbed by the full Senate.\n  In closing, let me make a few remarks about federal employees in \ngeneral.\n  It has become all to fashionable in recent years for Congress to \nberate federal employees and to denigrate the many contributions they \nmake to our nation.\n  Federal employees render invaluable service to this nation. They work \nhard and are proud of that work. Many of them are highly educated and \nskilled. In short, they bring a great deal of expertise and dedication \nto their roles as civil servants.\n  Such dedication ought to be recognized, applauded, and, most \nimportant in this context, utilized to help the government's efforts \nbecome more responsive to our constituents. We are now engaged in such \nan effort. To remove federal employees from the oversight board would \nbe shortsighted and a disservice to the nation. I therefore urge my \ncolleagues to preserve the current composition of the oversight board \nand to defeat any amendment that would change that composition by \nremoving the employee representative.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it's fair to say that the so-called tobacco \n``debate''--and I characterize most of the rhetorical chatter as ``so-\ncalled'' because it (1) has amounted to little more than posturing, and \n(2) has created enormous uncertainty and unease for the thousands of \nfine Americans who earn their living in the tobacco industry.\n  The public health community (and its ``Amen corner'' in Congress) \nwould delight in putting the tobacco companies out of business rather \nthan seriously and honestly addressing the issues facing the hundreds \nof communities in North Carolina and other states that are economically \ndependant on the tobacco industry. Mr. President, it's unfortunate that \nthis issue has become so politicized that usually rational members of \nCongress have been totally irrational in their exaggeration of the \nentire situation.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, it is not anywhere in recorded history that \nanyone ever began smoking because a gun had been leveled at his or her \nhead with orders to smoke, or else. There is no Senator who doesn't \nsupport efforts to curtail youth smoking, and not one parent has come \nforward asserting that Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man have more control \nover their children than they do.\n  But all the pious, exaggerated political nonsense aside, farmers must \ncontinue to grow their legal crop in order to provide for the \nlivelihood of their families.\n  Sometime back, I promised the farm leaders of North Carolina that I \nwould meet with the chief executives of all tobacco companies to \nencourage them to buy the maximum amount of U.S. tobacco possible in \n1998. I have kept that commitment. I have indeed met with the leaders \nof all companies, one by one. Their concern for tobacco farmers, and \nfor all other citizens who earn their livings ``in tobacco'', was \nimmediate, impressive and sincere.\n  There is no doubt in my mind, as a result of these meetings, that \nleaders of the tobacco companies do indeed intend to purchase as much \nU.S. tobacco as possible this marketing season.\n  In fact, some CEOs assured me that they plan to purchase more U.S. \ntobacco this marketing season than they purchased in 1997. One company \nleader emphasized his company's plans to increase its purchases of U.S. \nleaf every year through 2002.\n  The tobacco companies understand the need to purchase at least this \nyear's effective quota in order to prevent another substantial decrease \nin quota next year. There will be a lot of personal bankruptcies in \nNorth Carolina if our farmers are faced with another 10 to 17 percent \nreduction in quota. But I am confident--and I do expect--that the \ntobacco companies will honor their commitment to me and the tobacco \nfarmers of this country to purchase U.S. tobacco this marketing season.\n  Mr. President, everyone in the tobacco community--particularly the \ntobacco companies--realizes that the tobacco farmers should have been \nincluded in the so-called ``National Tobacco Settlement'' in the first \nplace.\n  Tobacco farmers and manufacturers are at a crossroads that may very \nwell define their destiny. They can either choose to work in good \nfaith, or they can choose not to. If they choose to harbor ill-will and \nmistrust, the destruction rampant in this industry will be far greater \nthan anything Congress could ever levy by politics or legislation.\n  Mr. President, during these obviously difficult times in tobacco \ncountry, squadrons of politicians in Washington and elsewhere are eager \nfor headlines back home at the expense of the farmers. No one knows \nwhat will happen with the McCain bill, nor with any other tobacco \nlegislation that may come forward. But I can promise you this: there \nwill continue to be a number of special interest groups that will try \nto exploit the fears of the tobacco farmer for their own gain.\n  I can counsel our folks back home to avoid being disillusioned. If we \nwork together and in good faith, the tobacco farmers of America will \ncontinue to have a future, no matter the threats and pleadings from the \npolitical chorus--which is becoming a little more discordant with every \npassing day.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I want to say to the Senator from North \nCarolina, independent of the subject matter to which he just spoke, \nthat I see him and the way he lives, and he is one tough bird. I admire \nhis courage and I admire the way he keeps after it.\n  I just wish him the best of health.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Roth and Senator \nMoynihan for having accepted the Leahy-Ashcroft amendment which will \nprovide electronic access to the IRS information on the Internet. This \namendment will require the IRS to maintain its web site with current \nforms, instructions and publications so people anywhere with access to \nthe Internet can have access to those forms.\n  To allow the public to have easy, efficient electronic access to all \nthe IRS information that may be needed to adequately prepare a tax \nfiling is a real benefit to the people, and I thank Senator Roth and \nSenator Moynihan for accepting the Leahy-Ashcroft amendment which will \nprovide electronic access to the IRS information on the Internet. And I \nthank Senator Leahy for his involvement in that measure.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the bipartisan amendment introduced \nby Senator Leahy and me has been adopted into the current legislation. \nThis amendment will give individuals the ability to access a great deal \nof material from the IRS. Revenue rulings,\n\n[[Page S4429]]\n\ntreasury regulations, internal revenue bulletins, and IRS general \ncounsel memorandum are just a few of the documents that will routinely \nbe made available in an easy to use format. This information should \nprovide for an easier and more understandable approach to tax planning \nand preparation. Individuals will be able to see rulings that may be \nsimilar to a situation they are in currently and plan accordingly.\n  A central idea that I have carried from the time I was elected as a \nU.S. Senator was that the federal government be open and accessible to \nthe public. I spent time traveling around Missouri, and visited every \ncounty, to demonstrate to students how they could access information \nabout the federal government through my website. To rural and urban \nareas the power of the Internet is tremendous--so much that was far \nfrom reach is now accessible. This amendment moves IRS information \ncloser to the public in an orderly educational way.\n  As has been mentioned here, the tax code has become increasingly \ncomplex and onerous. My wife is a tax attorney, she even teaches tax \nlaw at Howard University, and we do not even prepare our own tax forms. \nMy hope is that this modest effort will provide the public with timely, \nreliable information that may assist in their efforts to prepare their \ntaxes.\n  The effort is clearly a first step, that along with the rest of the \nprovisions of this piece of legislation should provide the taxpayer \nwith much more protection than they currently enjoy. Again, I thank the \nFinance Committee for its work, and Senator Leahy for his advocacy on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be set aside and that \nI be allowed to send an amendment to the desk for consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2348\n\n (Purpose: Striking the presumption that electronic verifications are \n       treated as actually submitted and subscribed by a person)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft], for himself and \n     Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 2348.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 261, strike lines 4 through 7, and insert ``and \n     subscribed''.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the amendment which I have just sent to \nthe desk, known as the Ashcroft-Leahy amendment, would strike a one-\nsentence provision that holds taxpayers as guilty until proven \ninnocent. The IRS would deem a minimum level of security of a personal \nidentification number code assigned each taxpayer for purposes of \nelectronic filing as actually more binding than an analog signature.\n  Let me just sort of put that in ordinary language. Ordinarily, it is \nthe responsibility of the IRS in seeking to act upon a tax return to \nprove that the signature is actually the signature of the person who \npurportedly signed it. For those individuals signing electronically, \nthis provision would be reversed so that a person who signs \nelectronically would be discriminated against as compared to an \nindividual who signs in analog form.\n  That is a problem, but it is really not nearly the problem that comes \nwhen you just open the door to the legal nightmare for taxpayers who \nmight be victims of electronic identity theft, where their identity is \nstolen electronically, whose pin codes or real electronic signature is \nfraudulently used. And secondly, not only does it subject people to \nthat kind of risk, but it makes very bad technology policy. As we begin \nto welcome the use of technology to alleviate the kind of burden that \nis both on taxpayers and on the individuals in the bureaucracy, it is \ntime for us to welcome the kind of technology which would provide valid \nauthentication but not to switch to individuals who provide their tax \nreturns via the Internet or via electronic filing a kind of \ndiscrimination which would be a disincentive for them to use the \nprogram.\n  The IRS is wedded to technology that is decades old. The kind of \nthings they are talking about, the PIN code system would only make \nmatters worse. A PIN code that anyone can type is not a secure means of \nauthenticating documents. As we proceed into the future of electronic \nsignatures with the use of a wide variety of technologies that will \nprovide for authentication, it is important that we not, in the law, \nplace this prejudice against the use of technology.\n  Currently, the Internal Revenue Service plans to implement electronic \nfiling by means of a taxpayer PIN code that would actually be more \nauthoritative than a written signature, so the person filing with a \nwritten signature would not undertake some of the responsibilities and \nliabilities people do with the electronic filing. That disparity in the \nway people are treated is not reasonable, it is not appropriate, and it \nis counterproductive. The IRS should use the best technology available \nfor protection of such sensitive information and help to ensure the \nfuture of electronic commerce.\n  So we offer this Ashcroft-Leahy amendment which simply would strike \nthe one-sentence provision that reverses, in terms of signatures on the \nInternet, the normal burdens of proof and the normal responsibility of \nthe person proving up the document to prove the authenticity of the \nsignature. To change in this respect for those who file electronically \nwould be to repudiate hundreds of years of legal tradition, in terms of \nthose seeking to prove up documents, that they prove the signature when \nthey prove up the document.\n  Madam President, the Finance Committee version of this bill would \nestablish a presumption against taxpayers filing electronically signed \ntax returns which does not exist for paper returns and which could have \ndevastating consequences. Unless the Senate strikes this presumption, \nand opposes a similar provision in the House-passed version of this \nlegislation, we will be leaving open the very real possibility that \ntaxpayers who have been the victims of electronic identity theft will \nfind themselves presumed guilty. Do we really want the innocent victim \nof a malicious computer hacker, forging spouse, a conniving business \npartner, or an embezzling accountant, to be confronted with a \npotentially insurmountable evidentiary hurdle when they assert that \nthey either did not sign a tax document, or that the document has been \nmaterially altered since they signed it? What is worse is that this \nprovision only places this burden on those who file electronically--\nanother bias against technology.\n  Electronic tax filing is clearly the wave of the future and is the \nbest method for both the IRS and taxpayers. For tax year 1997 24.2 \nmillion returns--one in five--were filed electronically, up from 19 \nmillion in the preceding year. Electronic filing is more efficient and \naccurate for all parties, but taxpayers should not be asked to give up \nrights in order to use this better technology. Certainly we did not ask \nfor a greater burden to be placed on taxpayers who use a typewriter \ninstead of a pen to prepare their taxes.\n  This language in the IRS bill is the first federal statutory language \ndealing with the authentication of electronic interaction between \ncitizens and the Federal government. It is very important that we set \nthe right precedent. But this presumption is completely at odds with \nthe view of legal experts on electronic commerce and evidence and would \nset precisely the wrong precedent. If this presumption becomes law \ninevitable ``horror stories'' will result. For many Americans, \nelectronic authentication of their tax returns will be their first \nexperience with an all-electronic transaction. We must be careful that \nwe do not permit situations to occur which will cause the public to \nfeel that electronic commerce and transactions should be avoided if \nthey want to preserve their rights.\n  This presumption is antithetical to the jurisprudence developing in \nthe area of cyberlaw. There are several measures being considered in \nCongress dealing with broad issues of electronic signatures, and none \nof them proposes to set such an adverse evidentiary standard against \nthose who employ electronic authentication. The drafting committee of \nthe National Conference\n\n[[Page S4430]]\n\nof Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, which is laboring to produce a \nmodel Electronic Authentication Act for consideration by state \nlegislatures, has just voted to delete any presumptions pertaining to \nelectronic signatures from that civil law measure. The Committee \non Cyberspace Law of the American Bar Association's Business Law \nSection discussed this IRS presumption at their last meeting and voted \nto authorize communications to the Senate opposing the provision. \nAdditionally, the Working Groups on Evidence and on Law and Regulation \nof the Information Security Committee of the ABA's Science and \nTechnology Section recommended that no presumptions as to identity and \nintent should attach to an electronic signature.\n\n  With many of the experts in this developing legal area reaching \nconsensus that presumptions should not operate against electronic \nsignatories even in a civil law context, how can we justify \nestablishing one which can be utilized against taxpayers in criminal \nprosecutions?\n  Let's be clear on what this legislation does in its present form. It \nauthorizes the IRS to develop procedures for the acceptance of \nsignatures in digital and electronic form so that electronically filing \ntaxpayers no longer have to send a signed paper form 8453 to the IRS. \nThat is good policy. It establishes the principle that an \nelectronically signed tax document shall be treated for all civil and \ncriminal purposes as a paper document. And that too is good policy. But \nit permits the IRS to provide for alternative means of subscribing to \nelectronic documents until it adopts procedures for digital and \nelectronic signatures. And it would allow any IRS-authorized method of \nsubscription to create a presumption that the taxpayer actually \nsubmitted and subscribed to the tax document--a presumption in both \ncivil and criminal cases.\n  Worse yet, the legislative history of this provision, in both the \nHouse and Senate bills, is silent as to the minimum standards for \nauthentication technologies that can be adopted by the IRS as well as \nto the evidentiary burden which must be overcome by taxpayers who \nallege that they have been victims of identity theft. What, in fact, is \nthe IRS planning to use for authentication of electronic tax documents? \nTheir plans are public, and they consist of issuing a PIN number to \ntaxpayers and relying on that as the primary means of electronic \nauthentication through the year 2007. A PIN number is not generally \nrecognized as an electronic or digital signature for electronic \ncommerce purposes, and it is certainly not secure or reliable.\n  The Finance Committee recently held hearings on the plight of \ninnocent spouses, many of whom were caught up in tax disputes when \ntheir spouse forged their name on a fraudulent tax return. This \nprovision would make it easier for such a fraud to be perpetrated in \nthe future, as the malicious spouse would simply have to type their \nmarriage partner's PIN number on an electronic return rather than forge \ntheir signature on paper. And the victimized spouse would be worse off, \nbecause they would have to overcome an evidentiary presumption which \ndoes not exist for an ink signature. This presumption is dangerous.\n  We have not only failed to require that the IRS utilize only secure \nand reliable authentication methodologies, but we have also given it \ncarte blanche to determine what burden a taxpayer must bear to overcome \nthis evidentiary hurdle. This is completely at odds with other \nprovisions of the bill which seek to alter the burden of proof in tax \ndisputes in favor of taxpayers. It has been observed that proving a \nnegative can be an impossible task. Yet this provision would let the \nIRS require taxpayers to somehow prove that they did not place their \nPIN number, not a digital signature, on a tax document which they may \nwell have never seen.\n  Striking this presumption will in no way diminish the ability of the \nIRS to rapidly implement an all-electronic tax system. It will simply \ncompel the IRS to choose secure and reliable authentication \ntechnologies and associated procedures for signing tax documents which \ncreate strong evidence of identify and intent. Electronic signatures do \nnot require any assist from an evidentiary presumption to meet the \nlegal requirements of a binding signature. To the contrary, electronic \nand digital signature technologies are already available which provide \nbetter evidence than an ink signature on paper. Further, these \ntechnologies not only provide superior authentication, but they also \naccomplish something that no pen on ink signature can--they provide \nirrefutable evidence as to non-repudiation by demonstrating that not a \nsingle word on a document has been altered, added, or deleted since the \ntime it was signed. With such technologies readily available at \nreasonable cost, why should we permit the use of insecure and \nunreliable methodologies coupled to an anti-taxpayer presumption? After \nstriking this presumption an electronic tax document will still have \nthe same legal standing as a paper document. It will still constitute \nprima facie evidence as an authentic and reliable writing. But, if \nquestions arise regarding the genuineness of an electronic signature, \nor under the current IRS plan a mere PIN number, and the intent with \nwhich it was attached, they will be resolved on the basis of the \navailable evidence and will not be prejudged by a presumption against a \ntaxpayer.\n\n  This amendment is already supported by several groups, including the \nElectronic Frontier Foundation, Americans for Tax Reform, Eagle Forum, \nCitizen's For A Sound Economy, National Taxpayer's Union, the Chamber \nof Commerce, the Association of Concerned Taxpayers, Black America's \nPAC, Citizens Against Higher Taxes, Regulatory Policy Center, and the \nSeniors Coalition. These are groups that have had the vision to look to \nthe future of electronic commerce and electronic interaction with our \ngovernment and have seen that bad precedent now will severely damage \nefforts in the future. I also want to thank Senator Leahy and his staff \nfor their quick response and solid work on this important provision.\n  This may seem like an esoteric issue. It is an evidentiary concern \nwithin a tax bill regarding procedures and technologies with which most \nof us are not yet very familiar. But a massive shift to electronic \ncommerce, transactions, authentication and evidence is underway which \nwill soon revolutionize the manner in which the public and private \nsectors conduct their business. That is why it is so important that we \ntake the correct first steps. I urge my colleagues to join me and act \nto delete this dangerous presumption from the IRS bill. This \nlegislation will only fulfill our goal of enhancing taxpayer rights if \nwe adopt the principle that those rights should be identical regardless \nof whether taxpayers file physical or virtual documents.\n  I want to especially thank the Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, \nfor his involvement in these issues and his sensitivity to the need to \nhave a forward-looking, future-oriented policy expressed towards \nelectronics, electronic data transmission, the filing electronically of \ntax returns. I personally thank Senator Burns of Montana, who has asked \nthat he be added as an original cosponsor of the Ashcroft-Leahy \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Burns be included as an original \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I strongly support the amendment offered \nby my friend from Missouri and commend the Senator from Missouri for \nwhat he has just said.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this effort. It strikes the one sentence in \nthis IRS reform bill that I believe takes away the rights of a \ntaxpayer. I know that is not the intent of the sponsors of this \nlegislation. They have done a very good job trying to reform the IRS. I \nthink we can correct this error.\n  The bill as currently written would create a rebuttable presumption \nby the Internal Revenue Service that any tax return which has been \nsigned by electronic or digital means has actually been submitted by \nthe person associated with the virtual signature. That is a rebuttable \nassumption that is unnecessary. It is adverse to the taxpayers' \ninterests. But worse, it is likely to deter taxpayers from accepting \nall-electronic tax filing.\n  More and more things are being done online, more and more things are \nbeing\n\n[[Page S4431]]\n\ndone electronically, and more and more taxpayers are getting used to \ndoing a lot of their commercial transactions electronically. And they \nshould be able to do the same with the one thing that every one of us \nhas to do at least once a year, and that is file a tax return. We may \nor may not order from an electronic catalog, we may or may not buy \nthings over the Internet, but sometime during the year we have to pay \nour taxes. If we are used to using things electronically, we should be \nable to file our tax return electronically.\n  But unless the sentence we are talking about is removed from this \nbill, a taxpayer filing an all-electronic tax document will face a \ngreater evidentiary burden in any subsequent dispute with the IRS than \na taxpayer who signed a paper return with pen and ink. An electronic \nsignature should have no less and no greater status in the tax context \nthan a physical signature.\n  The presumption would provide unintended assistance to perpetrators \nof tax frauds, forgeries, and electronic identity thefts such as the \n``innocent spouse'' cases recently reviewed by the Finance Committee. \nIt could even reverse the presumption of innocence and due process of \ntaxpayers in criminal prosecutions by the IRS. None of us want to do \nthat.\n  We have laws regarding authentication of electronic and digital \nsignatures, but they are in their infancy. Several States, including my \nhome State of Vermont, are crafting legislation to promote secure and \nreliable digital signatures. Senator Ashcroft and I, by working \ntogether to craft bipartisan Federal legislation on digital signatures, \nare trying to do precisely that. Congress should not be giving the \nInternal Revenue Service unrestricted authority in this emerging area \nof cyberspace law.\n  If you adopt the Ashcroft-Leahy amendment, then, if you have an \nelectronically authenticated tax document, it will still be treated \nunder the bill, for all civil and criminal purposes, the same as a \npaper return. That principle of equality is the correct standard. \nCitizens should not be required to forfeit rights to use new \ntechnology.\n  If somebody is used to using the Internet, if they are used to using \ntheir computers in electronic commerce, they should not suddenly have a \nroadblock go up to say, ``But not on your tax returns. You have to go \nthe old-fashioned way.'' If people are going into the computer and \ndigital age, they ought to be able to do that for their tax returns, \ntoo.\n\n  I commend what Senator Roth, the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee, and Senator Kerrey and Senator Moynihan and Senator \nGrassley have done here to bring us into the electronic age and to \nbring us to a more modern system with the IRS. What the Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Ashcroft, and I are trying to do is to make sure we go \neven further into the modern age. Our amendment is supported by such \ndiverse groups as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Electronic Frontier \nFoundation, and Americans for Tax Reform.\n  So I hope my colleagues will support the Ashcroft-Leahy-Burns \namendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I congratulate my colleagues, Senator \nAshcroft and Senator Leahy. Senator Leahy and I have been on many \nissues with regard to the Internet. I think Senator Leahy, whenever we \ntalk about this issue, what we want to do with it, also understands \nanother issue called encryption and how important security is. We have \nbeen around to see this thing grow and blossom. They go hand in hand, \nbasically, as we use this technology more.\n  My friend from Missouri being very interested in this, as chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Communications, we will continue to work on these \nkind of issues. This should be an easy amendment for this body to \nsupport--in fact, for this Congress to support. If you want to continue \nto use the same burdensome and bureaucratic methods that we have used \nin the past, then don't support this amendment. Don't support this \namendment if you like the status quo. If we, as a voice of our \nconstituents, are truly interested in IRS reform for taxpayers, then we \nneed to support it. More and more Americans are becoming Internet \nsavvy, and the day is not far off when most of the business and \npersonal transactions will take place on the Internet. We are already \nbanking; we are handling financial transactions on the Internet. So why \nshould this not be one that we can use, at least once a year?\n  The Internet is just not for surfing anymore. If you want to surf, I \nguess you can go to California. But in Montana and rural areas, our \nconnection to these kinds of services is going to come through that \nmedium.\n  We need electronic commerce. It is going to be the future of the new \nway, and we have to accept that and learn to use it.\n  Adopting this amendment will encourage the American taxpayer that we \nare interested in reforming the way the IRS does business. There is no \nreason to treat electronic tax filers any different than taxpayers \nusing the traditional filing methods.\n  The deployment of electronic commerce will ultimately save American \ntaxpayers not only time, but it will save them money. Such \ndiscriminating treatment makes no sense and has a far-reaching negative \nimpact in delaying the benefits to both the U.S. Government and \ncitizens in conducting business electronically.\n  The amendment at issue is a perfect example of that. What possible \njustification is there in placing the presumption upon the taxpayer \nimproving a case simply because he chose to file his tax return \nelectronically instead of putting it in an envelope? It is just \nunproductive.\n  If we are not supposed to look to the future, then what are we \nsupposed to be doing around here? Are we not supposed to make our \nFederal Government friendlier and more accessible to the taxpayer? I \nwould say yes, we are. Are we not supposed to have a visionary agenda \nregarding the IRS? I say we should.\n  We in Congress should strive for a consistent treatment for \nfunctionally equivalent transactions, and I believe this will be one of \nour most significant challenges as we move into the next century.\n  More and more businesses, and communications generally, will be \ntransacted over the Internet. That is why I am a cosponsor of this \namendment. It will level the playing field for all taxpayers, \nregardless of the method they choose in filing their taxes.\n  The Internet offers unlimited opportunity to both business and \npersonal transactions. We need to foster those opportunities. We need \nto make it easier for taxpayers to file their taxes.\n  Our antiquated understanding of how transactions have to be treated \nhistorically is not the way we can do things in the future. This is why \nI am an advocate of a variety of different measures that would foster \nand encourage commerce and communication over the Internet, including \nthe Internet Tax Freedom Act. And the use of encryption comes into this \nalso, because the technology itself will never bloom until we can have \nsome confidence in the security of the information that we send over \nthe Internet. We have to work on that just as much. The continuing \nbuildout of broadband infrastructure is very important. We will \ncontinue to develop that to make sure that it is accessible to every \nAmerican and not just a chosen few, regardless of geographic location.\n  Madam President, I ask support of this amendment because I think it \nis very important if we are really serious about changing the way the \nIRS does business.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, in spite of what the Senator from \nMontana just said, I continue to support his amendment. There is no \nrebuttable presumption on my part. I believe it is a good amendment, \nand I am prepared to accept it.\n  I want to comment before the distinguished chairman of the committee \nrises to accept the amendment. I call to your attention that this title \nI consider to be one of the most important ones in the bill. I \nappreciate this may be the only amendment on this title. Congressman \nPortman and I put a lot of time and attention into it. I call to your \nattention that it starts off by saying:\n\n\n[[Page S4432]]\n\n\n\n       It is the policy of the Congress that--\n       (1) paperless filing should be the preferred and most \n     convenient means of filing tax and information returns, and\n       (2) it should be the goal of the Internal Revenue Service \n     to have at least 80 percent of all such returns filed \n     electronically by the year 2007.\n\n  The House actually mandates 80 percent. This just says the goal. \nLater, I will try to get an amendment, and I urge you to look at it--I \nwill get you copies of it--which will add a third item which would say \n``the Internal Revenue Service should work cooperatively and not \ncompetitively with the private sector to increase electronic filing of \nsuch returns consistent with the Office of Management and Budget \nCircular A-76.''\n  If this is going to develop correctly, I believe the IRS has to \nmanage the competition with the private sector. We have to write the \nrules so the private sector can be called upon to answer the questions \nof how to use the technology correctly. I hope we can get an amendment \nadopted which will instruct the IRS not to compete but to work \ncooperatively with the private sector to get this done.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, as my distinguished colleague indicated, \nthis matter has been cleared with both sides. The amendment is \nacceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2348) was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the previous consent agreement, the following \namendments also be considered in order to H.R. 2676, the IRS reform \nbill, with all other provisions of the previous agreement still in \neffect: Grassley, refund offset; Grassley, Iowa pilot project; \nGrassley, taxpayer advocate council; Nickles, relevant. I ask unanimous \nconsent for these additions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9:30 a.m. on \nThursday, the Senate resume consideration of the Thompson amendment No. \n2356, and that the time until 10 o'clock a.m. be equally divided in the \nusual form. I further ask unanimous consent that at 10 o'clock a.m., \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on, or in relation to, the Thompson \namendment, and that no amendments be in order to the Thompson amendment \nprior to its disposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Roth, and I will try to manage this bill so \nwe can get it done tomorrow. There are what, 15 amendments \napproximately now on both sides. In order to get it done, Members who \nhave amendments, I hope after we have our vote tomorrow morning, will \nstay on the floor and offer them so we can finish this bill. If we \ndon't, it is likely there will be an extremely late session tomorrow \nnight. Most of the controversial items on this piece of legislation \nreally have been dealt with. We have the Treasury employees \nrepresentative amendment to be dealt with tomorrow. We have the \nTreasury Secretary to be dealt with tomorrow. Most of the controversial \nstuff has already been resolved. I hope Members who have amendments \nwill come down here with them as quickly as possible so we can finish \nthis important piece of legislation tomorrow.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. I want to underscore what the distinguished Senator just \nsaid. It is important that we complete consideration of this \nlegislation tomorrow. But in order to do so, it is of critical \nimportance that those with amendments come down early so that we can \ndispose of them expeditiously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/06/senate-section/article/S4428-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, I want to extend my appreciation to every \nMember of this Senate for unanimously passing a resolution that \ndedicates today to be National Eating Disorder Awareness Day.\n  The purpose is to raise awareness and educate others so that we can \nend the silence that has shrouded eating disorders for so long. The \nreason this is important is, this affects 8 million people. Eight \nmillion people in this country have eating disorders; the vast majority \nof them are women.\n  A recent study of a group of fourth graders reveals that 50 percent \nof these little students believed they were overweight. Eighty-one \npercent of the girls in the same group reported that they had already \nbeen on diets. These are 9-year-old kids.\n  Today, younger and younger children are adopting restrictive eating \nprocedures and patterns. What begins as abnormal behavior toward food \nand weight control may develop into anorexia, bulimia, and other forms \nof disordered eating.\n  As with any illness, I believe it is wise to invest in resources and \nprograms working toward prevention. By heightening awareness and \nincreasing education, we can save many young children before they \nbecome trapped in a life-threatening cycle of an eating disorder.\n  I extend my appreciation to the entire Senate for allowing this \nresolution to pass. It sends a message to the country that we care \nabout the 8 million people who have eating disorders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/06/senate-section/article/S4432-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        URGING PRESIDENT CLINTON TO RETRACT ULTIMATUM TO ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, the reason I rise at this time is because \ncertain matters have come to my attention and they are disturbing. \nToday, I have sent a letter to the President of the United States in \nregard to this.\n  Mr. President, Israel is our closest ally, it is our most trusted \nfriend among the nations of the Middle East. We have a long history of \nworking together and supporting one another for the benefit of both \nnations and all of our people.\n  Now as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Israel's independence, we \nshould reaffirm our commitment to their peace and security and our \nsupport for their continuation as a strong, reliable, independent \nnation.\n  I am proud of what Israel has accomplished over 50 years. I am proud \nof their commitment to freedom and justice. Israel should be praised \nfor what it has accomplished and for doing so over a very long period \nof time in which it has faced terrorism from within and without its own \nborders.\n  Israel has always fought its own battles. Its young have shed much \nblood to protect their freedom and they continue to this day to defend \ntheir right to exist. And their very right to exist is being \nthreatened. Nations hostile to Israel throughout the region are a \ncontinuing threat to Israel's existence. And the Palestinian Authority \nto this day has yet to recognize Israel's legitimate right to exist.\n  It is wrong for the Clinton administration to pressure Israel to \nforgo its own security needs at this critical time. It is just wrong. \nIt is counterproductive. It is dangerous to a legitimate peace effort. \nThe brave Israeli citizens who stand ready to defend their nation \nshould be supported by us in every fashion. To place an ultimatum on \nIsrael at this time undermines the peace process and it denies a good \nfriend the right to determine its own security needs. It is not just \nbad policy; it is wrong.\n  I urge President Clinton in the strongest terms to retract his \nultimatum to Israel and to return America to our proper role as a \nfriendly mediator in the search for peace and security for all nations \nin the Middle East.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/06/senate-section/article/S4432-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4432-S4433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        U.S. FOREIGN OIL CONSUMPTION FOR WEEK ENDING APRIL 24TH\n\n  Mr. Helms.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a commendable \ngroup of Vermont teens. Oftentimes, society shortchanges teenagers by \nplacing unfair stereotypes upon them and by not listening to what they \nhave to say. The eighth grade students of Barton Academy have written \nan article to prove that they, as teens, are vital members of their \ncommunity and of society as a whole. I was particularly impressed with \nnot only the message but with the eloquence of this article. I ask \nunanimous consent that the article be printed in the Congressional \nRecord so that all Senators may read the words of these fine teenagers.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the 1997 Vermont Kids Count]\n\n                          Youth Health Issues\n\n       The following article, written by a class of Barton eighth \n     graders, introduces this section on youth health issues. It \n     provides the much-needed perspectives of teenagers, drawing \n     attention to not only their daily lives but to the heart of \n     many teen issues--the adult society in which they live and \n     grow.\n\n\n              teens defend themselves against stereotypes\n\n       We present ourselves not as problems to society, but as we \n     really are, 32 teens looking at themselves and society. Not \n     statistics, but the real thing, us. We would like to present \n     what we do that we are proud of, feel we have accomplished, \n     and what we have given to others. We come from all social and \n     economic backgrounds and come together each day in our town \n     school. We have our ups and downs with each other, but get \n     along more often than we do not. Life is not perfect, but \n     neither is yours.\n       If you knew us, lived with us, celebrated and grieved with \n     us there would be no need for this response. However, it is \n     our experience that most adults simply ignore, disregard or \n     fear teens. How many adults can you see in any given line at \n     a movie even nod recognition of a teen's humanity, much less \n     start a short conversation? We want to start that \n     conversation.\n       Hey Mister, did you know that some of us do barn chores \n     before we even go to school every morning. We do evening \n     chores, too. In between, we go to school, make honor roll on \n     occasion, play sports, participate in band and chorus and \n     ride the roller coaster of adolescence.\n       Some of us have part-time jobs to earn the money we want \n     for things. We shovel snow, mow lawns, baby-sit and clean \n     houses for less than minimum wage. We've saved our money for \n     a few years to get what we wanted. We also earn money to buy \n     some of our own clothing, sports equipment and entertainment. \n     Some of us even earn money to contribute to family \n     necessities. Imagine that.\n       We have a sense of community. Who do you see picking up the \n     trash along our roads and fields during Green Up Day? Who is \n     collecting bottles for a class trip? Who are the crossing \n     guards so younger children won't get hit by cars? Whose \n     clothes have thoughtfully been gone through and chosen with \n     care to give to clothing centers, or victims of fires? We \n     have given our clothes, our bicycles, games, money and music \n     to others in need just because we were asked.\n       We, the 32 teens of the eighth grade of Barton, have \n     volunteered to carry elders' grocery bags just because we saw \n     them struggling. We also volunteer to shovel out our \n     grandparents' dooryards, and even accept the money they \n     insist we take because we know it makes them feel good, too. \n     We march and play our musical instruments in Memorial Day and \n     Veterans Day parades in honor of those who served. Sometimes \n     we go to local nursing homes and play our instruments or \n     sing. Sometimes we go just to share and talk.\n       Most of us have family responsibilities that we honor. We \n     split wood and stack it; and move it from one place to \n     another. We trudge through snow and mud to gather sap and \n     help sugar. We do the laundry for the family, set the table, \n     cook some meals, and clean up afterward and empty the trash. \n     We grumble, but we do the chores. We watch our younger \n     brothers and sisters. For the most part, we think we are \n     pretty helpful. Some of us were even responsible for bringing \n     the possibility of recycling into our homes.\n       Did you know that teens in our community volunteer to tutor \n     younger children? Some of the teens at Lake Region Union High \n     School coach our junior hoop program and referee our games. \n     Most of us would gladly lend a hand if we were asked.\n       Society says that our job is school. Mandatory. We do that, \n     too. We go, learn, try to learn, and try to learn again. \n     Sometimes we give up but not too often. The dropout rate at \n     Lake Region union High School is less than 2 percent, \n     according to Lake Region Annual Report, Jan. 15, 1997. We \n     might not be in the top 10 percent of the world's smartest \n     kids, but do we really need to be? Society is a problem to us \n     sometimes, too. If you want to separate society into parts, \n     we, as teens and citizens, are not responsible for the \n     pollution of the world, the genocide in most corners, \n     poverty, houseless people, pornography, gridlock and the \n     corruption of our national leaders. Drugs are everywhere. Do \n     we manufacture them or smuggle them into the country? Society \n     has taught us from the first time we viewed a sporting event \n     that beer is where it's at. How are we to sort out the mixed \n     messages we are bombarded with? We listen weekly to the \n     adults in the news who compare us unfavorably with the test \n     scores of other countries. We do not make the movies rated \n     PG-13 that include more profanity than we would ever think of \n     using. Where are the everyday role models that you would like \n     us to emulate?\n       Our advice--get to know a teen up front and personal. We \n     don't like the word scapegoat for anyone. It makes it too \n     easy to cast the first stone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/06/senate-section/article/S4433-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/06/senate-section/article/S4433-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4433-S4434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT CONCERNING THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE \n   UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND UKRAINE CONCERNING PEACEFUL USES OF \n           NUCLEAR ENERGY--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 122\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to sections 123b. \nand 123d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153 \n(b), (d)), the text of a proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the \nUnited States of America and Ukraine Concerning Peaceful Uses of \nNuclear Energy, with accompanying annex and agreed minute. I am also \npleased to transmit my written approval, authorization, and \ndetermination concerning the agreement, and the memorandum of the \nDirector of the United States Arms\n\n[[Page S4434]]\n\nControl and Disarmament Agency with the Nuclear Proliferation \nAssessment Statement concerning the agreement. The joint memorandum \nsubmitted to me by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy, \nwhich includes a summary of the provisions of the agreement and various \nother attachments, including agency views, is also enclosed.\n  The proposed agreement with Ukraine has been negotiated in accordance \nwith the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended by the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Act of 1978 and as otherwise amended. In my judgment, the \nproposed agreement meets all statutory requirements and will advance \nthe nonproliferation and other foreign policy interests of the United \nStates. The agreement provides a comprehensive framework for peaceful \nnuclear cooperation between the United States and Ukraine under \nappropriate conditions and controls reflecting our common commitment to \nnuclear nonproliferation goals.\n  The proposed new agreement with Ukraine permits the transfer of \ntechnology, material, equipment (including reactors), and components \nfor nuclear research, and nuclear power production. It provides for \nU.S. consent rights to retransfers, enrichment, and reprocessing as \nrequired by U.S. law. It does not permit transfers of any sensitive \nnuclear technology, restricted data, or sensitive nuclear facilities or \nmajor critical components of such facilities. In the event of \ntermination, key conditions and controls continue with respect to \nmaterial and equipment subject to the agreement.\n  Ukraine is a nonnuclear weapon state party to the Treaty on the \nNonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Following the dissolution of \nthe Soviet Union, Ukraine agreed to the removal of all nuclear weapons \nfrom its territory. It has a full-scope safeguards agreement in force \nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to implement its \nsafeguards obligations under the NPT. Ukraine was accepted as a member \nof the Nuclear Suppliers Group in April 1996, and as a member of the \nNPT Exporters Committee (Zangger Committee) in May 1997.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \nagencies in reviewing the proposed agreement and have determined that \nits performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable \nrisk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved \nthe agreement and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress \ngive it favorable consideration.\n  Because this agreement meets all applicable requirements of the \nAtomic Energy Act, as amended, for agreements for peaceful nuclear \ncooperation, I am transmitting it to the Congress without exempting it \nfrom any requirement contained in section 123a. of that Act. This \ntransmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both sections \n123b. and 123d. of the Atomic Energy Act. My Administration is prepared \nto begin immediately the consultations with the Senate Foreign \nRelations and House International Relations Committees as provided in \nsection 123b. Upon completion of the 30-day continuous session period \nprovided for in section 123b., the 60-day continuous session provided \nfor in section 123d. shall commence.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to condition the use of appropriated funds for the \npurpose of an orderly and honorable reduction of U.S. ground forces \nfrom the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n\n                    the bosnia force realignment act\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the bill that I introduce today, on behalf \nof the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, and myself, is \nan attempt to reduce the American portion of the NATO deployment to \nBosnia and Herzegovina. It does so in a carefully staged manner over \nthe next 2 years, going from the administration-planned force size of \n6,900 ground troops at the end of this June, to 2,500 troops in \nFebruary, 2000. In the interim, the amendment calls for a force size of \n5,000 U.S. troops to be arrived at by February 1999, and 3,500 by July \n1999.\n  This is a gradual drawdown to a level which more accurately \napproximates the size of the forces of France and Germany at this time. \nThe United States would continue to honor its commitment to NATO to \nplay an appropriate role in the Bosnia stabilization force, but the \namendment provides\n\n[[Page S4436]]\n\ncrucial leverage on our allies in Europe to assume the leadership role \nthat is appropriate for them in an operation near their borders in \nEurope.\n  The current plan by the administration, including the requirement for \nmeeting a series of general benchmarks in the areas of democratization, \nan independent press and judiciary, and other reforms, could keep the \nUnited States with the leading force in Bosnia for an indefinite \nperiod. I do not believe the American people will support the \nproposition of a semi-permanent deployment with no end-game. \nNevertheless, this year, for the first time, the President has said \nthat there is no definite end-game, or exit schedule which he would \npropose. Thus, the pressure is off our allies to pick up more of the \nleading role, and our allies are perfectly content to keep the United \nStates spending some $1.8 billion per year on this operation, in \naddition to the funds we contribute to NATO on an annual basis.\n  My good friend from the state of Michigan, the ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee, Mr. Levin, has also been concerned over the \npermanent nature of the American deployment and the lack of leadership \nbeing displayed by our European partners. He has offered a proposal, as \na provision in the supplemental appropriations bill, which was approved \nby the conference committee on that bill, to urge the President to \nreach an agreement on the deadlines for closure on the various \nbenchmarks in the President's report. This is a good amendment by Mr. \nLevin, and it is a very good starting point, and I am supportive of it, \nbut I am afraid that it does not contain the kind of pressure that \nwould cause the administration to act decisively with our allies on the \nmatter of sharing the burden of leadership in Bosnia. I do not think \nthat the Levin amendment, which, as I say, I strongly support, goes far \nenough.\n  The administration seems not to work very effectively, except under \nthe pressure of explicit deadlines and an explicit schedule with \nspecific numbers, dates, and goals. This specificity is provided by the \namendment which Mrs. Hutchison and I presently intend to offer to the \nfiscal year 1999 Department of Defense authorization bill when it comes \nto the floor. I hope that my colleagues will have a careful look at the \ndetails of the amendment. I believe that it deserves strong bipartisan \nsupport. It is a responsible approach, and it provides the time and the \nimpetus for our allies to get their acts together and begin to take \nresponsibility for the peace of the European Continent. The United \nStates will continue to play an important supporting role in this \neffort, but I hope we will begin to wean our allies from the \noverdependence upon the United States that they currently exhibit.\n  Reports over the last few days on the very disturbing developments in \nthe Serbian province of Kosovo need the focus of the Senate and the \nadministration and of all Americans. These events demonstrate my point. \nWe may well have a catastrophe in the making, and the question of \nheading off, or at least containing ethnic unrest in Kosovo must be \naddressed by the administration, as well as by NATO. I don't see any \nevidence that the administration is moving in the direction of \nproviding that kind of address. There may be steps that we need to take \nright now to prepare for worst-case eventualities. The administration \nneeds to inform the Senate in detail on its policy regarding the \npossible scenarios involving the situation in Kosovo.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Hutchison and myself does provide \nthat the forces which we move out of Bosnia proper can be redeployed to \nthe periphery of that troubled region--into Hungary, for instance, and \nparticularly into Macedonia, in an effort to demonstrate to the Serbs \nand other parties that NATO will not stand for the spreading of the \nethnic conflict beyond the borders of Bosnia and Serbia. But the spread \nof the ethnic conflict in Kosovo is a separate issue which must be \naddressed by the administration, and I hope that the administration \nwill get busy and give us just such an address. Everything possible \nshould be done to forestall a spread of the ethnic conflict in Kosovo. \nBosnia and its violent disposition must be contained and must not be \nallowed to infect the rest of Europe. We cannot countenance the spread \nof the ethnic violence into the southern Balkans, and we must do \neverything that we can to forestall the involvement of Greece and \nTurkey in future instabilities caused by the Bosnia and Kosovo \nsituations.\n  The reduction in U.S. forces over a two-year period arranges a sure \nbut gentle glidepath during which a reconfiguration of the composition \nof allied forces can be accomplished without opening up vulnerabilities \nfor U.S. forces or causing uncertainties on the part of Serbian \nelements as to the staying power of NATO, while Bosnian unrest remains \na threat to the peace of the continent. Yet, history must move in \nEurope, and the role of leadership on the ground, through the presence \nof American armies, must transition to one where a healthier balance of \nresponsibility is created. This transition is especially important in \nlight of the recent developments in Kosovo. In the long run, in an era \nwhere new states are being incorporated into NATO, and new practices of \nconsensus-building and peacekeeping must be developed among the states \nof the alliance, Europe must begin to get a surer grasp of its own \ndestiny through a spirit of close cooperation among its European NATO \npartners.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will review the details of \nthe amendment, and will choose to co-sponsor it.\n  Mr. President, I send the bill to the desk on behalf of the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, and myself and I ask \nthat the title be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill to condition the use of appropriated funds for the \n     purpose of an orderly and honorable reduction of U.S. ground \n     forces from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Texas and I \nexpect this bill to be referred to the appropriate committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be appropriately referred.\n  Mr. BYRD. As of now, Mr. President, I yield the remainder of whatever \ntime I would have had to Mrs. Hutchison, that she may add it to the \namount of time that she would have had under the request.\n  Let me express my appreciation for her cosponsorship of this \namendment. She will work hard on its behalf as I will, and I feel \nhonored and fortunate to have her as cosponsor of the bill. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, how much time is left on our amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-four minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I want to say how pleased I am to be working with my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from West Virginia, who was honored last \nnight on the Senate floor for having cast the most number of votes of \nany Senator in the history of our country--15,000. It was quite \nawesome. I am pleased to have someone of his stature and experience to \ntake the lead on this very important act that we hope the Senate will \npass in the form of an amendment to the defense authorization bill, or \nfailing that, the appropriations bill, because it is time that Congress \nstep up to the line and fulfill its constitutional responsibility for \nallocating the military dollars.\n  Mr. President, as the senior Senator from West Virginia has stated, \nour bill will begin the orderly and honorable withdrawal of U.S. ground \nforces from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  U.S. forces in Bosnia have accomplished the military mission assigned \nto them. They were sent to enforce the Dayton peace accords by keeping \nthe warring factions separated. We all owe our troops a debt of \ngratitude for having done this with no combat loss of life to any \nAmerican.\n  I have just returned this weekend from my seventh trip to the \nBalkans. I saw a well-trained professional force capable of performing \nany mission that we would give them as long as we give them the support \nthey need. But I also saw a force on a mission with no clear direction \nand certainly no exit strategy. It has no end date. These troops\n\n[[Page S4437]]\n\nhave been spending more and more time away from home than at any other \npoint in their careers.\n  The continuing and open-ended commitment of U.S. ground forces in \nBosnia is subject to the oversight authority of Congress. When we \nnarrowly voted to support this mission in 1995, I voted against it \nbecause I was afraid what would happen is exactly what is happening. We \nare now in an open-ended mission. This was not supposed to be an open-\nended mission. It was supposed to be a 1-year commitment. That deadline \nwas missed and the next deadline was missed.\n  It is very important that we have an exit strategy. The Secretary of \nDefense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, have said an exit \nstrategy and an exit date is most important if we are not going to have \nmission creep. But, in fact, what I fear is that we do have mission \ncreep in Bosnia, and as a matter of fact, we also have deadline creep.\n  NATO forces have increased their participation in police activities, \nsomething for which they are not trained. General Joulwan has said our \nmilitary forces are not trained for police missions, and yet that is \nwhat they are doing more and more.\n  U.S. commanders in NATO have stated on several occasions that, in \naccordance with the Dayton peace accords, the principal responsibility \nfor law enforcement rests with the parties to the Dayton agreement--the \nSerbs, the Croats, and the Muslims.\n  In a recent letter to Congress, President Clinton identified a host \nof additional missions that seem to go well beyond the peacekeeping \nscope of the U.S. forces in Bosnia and are aimed really at nation-\nbuilding. These include--and I quote from his letter-- ``supporting * * \n* the conduct of elections and the installation of elected officials,'' \nand ``supporting * * * media reform efforts.''\n  During our recent trip we were briefed that establishing a rule of \nlaw and a judiciary were also among the criteria that must be \nestablished prior to our troops' withdrawal.\n  Mr. President, these are goals that could take 50 years to achieve, \nand they define a mission without an exit strategy. I would just say \nthat the distinguished Senator who is presiding at this moment was also \nin the meetings we had in Bosnia this weekend. I think I speak for all \nof us who were there in saying that what we were told about an end date \nis a recipe for a mission with no exit strategy. Congress has had \nlittle to say, as the President has authorized an ever-longer \ncommitment of troops for an ever-growing number of missions.\n\n  I believe that exceeds the war power authority of the President, \nalthough this is debatable and I cannot say that it is totally clear. \nBut while the Constitution leaves some issues unsettled regarding war \npowers, there is no such conflict over the power of the purse. The \nCongress alone has the power. We have the responsibility to provide the \nmoney for our military and to look at the big picture.\n  The big picture, Mr. President, is that our troops are being flung \naround the world in police missions and peacekeeping missions, and we \nare losing the edge that a superpower must have to be able to act when \nno one else can or no one else will.\n  Senator Byrd and I do not want Congress to ever shrink from its \nconstitutional responsibility. And it is Senator Byrd who understands \nthe Constitution better than anyone on this floor. But I, as a new \nMember, am trying to see things in a way that our Founding Fathers \nintended and to remain true to the balance of power that they attempted \nto create.\n  Our bill is aimed at getting our European allies to start taking a \ngreater share of the responsibility for their own regional security \nmatters. This will free the United States to respond where our allies \ncannot or will not and where the United States is the only power that \nis capable of doing so.\n  It is in the interest of our allies that we maintain the capability \nto keep the world safe from threats that would endanger our mutual \nsecurity. The United States has nearly twice the number of troops on \nthe ground as our next closest ally, Great Britain. We have three times \nmore than the French and German allies.\n  Our bill provides for a gradual-phased timetable of reduction of the \nlevel of U.S. troops so that by February in the year 2000 the American \nground combat level would not exceed 2,500. This timetable is \nconsistent with the stated objectives of the Clinton administration.\n  In a recent letter to several Senators, President Clinton said, ``The \ndeployment will not be open-ended. . .SFOR will be progressively \nreduced.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia and I hope to aid the \nadministration by offering a credible and orderly timetable for such \nreductions so that we can provide the ability to finance the mission \nwith some sense that we will know what to expect.\n  Our bill provides 6,900 troops by June 30, 1998; 5,000 by February 2, \n1999; 3,500 by June 30, 1999; and 2,500 by February 2, 2000.\n  Our bill exempts from these totals those forces that are needed to \nprotect the U.S. troops as the drawdowns proceed. We also exempt those \nforces necessary to protect U.S. diplomatic facilities. Most important, \nwe exempt any U.S. ground forces which may be deployed as part of NATO \ncontainment operations in regions surrounding the Republic of Bosnia \nand Herzegovina.\n  It is my belief that one of our principal objectives in the Balkans \nshould be to prevent the conflict in Bosnia from spilling over into \nneighboring European countries. Should the President propose to \nestablish a NATO containment perimeter around Bosnia, our bill would \npermit that.\n  Why is our legislation needed? What does it have to do with military \nreadiness? Just last week this Congress approved adding a half a \nbillion dollars to the Bosnia operation. This brings our total to $8 \nbillion. The President has asked for another $2 billion for the next \nyear. That makes a $10 billion operation, five times the original \nestimate this administration gave Congress.\n  Where is this money coming from? It is coming from future readiness. \nWe are borrowing from the future to pay for a mission that is clearly \ncapable of being performed by countries other than the world's only \nsuperpower. If they can do this, the United States can be ready to \nrespond in other areas where we have mutual security threats with our \nallies, such as the Middle East and Asia.\n  There are ample indications that our readiness has begun to suffer as \nwe have drawn forces and resources off to support regional conflicts. \nIn the U.S. Pacific Command, the commander in chief testified before \nCongress that some forces required for long-term commitments in the \nAsia-Pacific area of responsibility are now positioned in the Persian \nGulf. He further reports that the Pacific fleet is short over 1,900 \nsailors in key technical ratings.\n  In the Pacific Air Forces, the F-16 cannibalization rate is 12.8 \npercent--a more than 100 percent increase since 1995 due to lack of \nspare parts.\n  The Army faces similar shortfalls. A recent Army Times report \nrevealed that while the 1st Armored Division was staffed at 94 percent, \nits combat support and service support specialties were filled at below \n85 percent, and captains and majors were filled at 73 percent. \nNoncommissioned officers are also in short supply in the divisions, \nparticularly sergeants. In the 10th Division, 24 of 162 infantry squads \nwere not fully or only minimally filled.\n  According to Major General Carl Ernst, commanding general of the \nArmy's premier infantry training post at Fort Monroe, VA, this is \nhaving a serious negative impact on the Army. General Ernst recently \ntold a congressional panel at Fort Monroe, ``We are now dangerously \nclose to the breaking point.''\n  What about the Air Force? In the Air Force, only 29 percent of the \npilots eligible for a $60,000 bonus to sign up for 5 more years signed \nup. That is half the number that took that bonus last year.\n  Our military is stretched to the breaking point. Our military cannot \ncontinue to provide peacekeeping operations all over the world. This \ncauses them to lose the skills for which they have been trained and \ndulls their fighting edge. We are letting it happen because the \noperations tempo is too high and the amount of money we have is finite.\n  What is suffering is the quality of life of our military. We are \nlosing our most experienced people. Also our modernization suffers as \nwe try to keep our\n\n[[Page S4438]]\n\nbest planes in the air, with the parts that they need to function, and, \nperhaps most important, the systems that we will need to meet the \nfuture security risks of our country and those of all of our allies. \nThis includes the threat of an incoming ballistic missile with a \nnuclear, chemical, or biological weapon. We know that 30 countries in \nthe world have ballistic missile capabilities, yet we are not deploying \nas quickly as possible any defenses.\n  What the Senator from West Virginia and I are asking is that our \nallies, who are perfectly capable of performing these peacekeeping \nmissions as well as anyone can, take that responsibility. Let the \nUnited States build our forces through modernization and technology and \ndevelop missile defense systems so that we can be there if there is a \nreal threat to our mutual security. We cannot have a military that is \nunable to respond. We must not have a military that is not respected by \nour allies, nor our adversaries.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has stood for the constitutional \nresponsibility of Congress. I hope to follow in his footsteps in always \nreminding our Senate of the importance that we uphold our one-third of \nthe balance of power in our Government. Our one-third is that we must \nbe the stewards of the funds. Only Congress was empowered to declare \nwar. I do not believe that our Founding Fathers intended for us to be \nsending troops abroad in operations other than war. They intended it to \nbe a tough decision, to put our troops in harm's way.\n  Mr. President, I am going to stand for the U.S. \nSenate's responsibility to assure that we do not fling our troops \naround the world in operations other than war and dissipate our \nresources and our readiness. I am proud to cosponsor with the Senator \nfrom West Virginia the bill that will begin the orderly and responsible \nexit from Bosnia, with our allies, as a team, coming together and \nsharing this burden in a way that meets the regional test and meets our \nresponsibility in the world to do that which no one else can.\n\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his leadership in this \narea. I hope we will have the strongest bipartisan support for our bill \nso that we can make this law, so that our allies will know that when we \nsay we are going to do something--whether it is something they like or \ndon't like--that we will keep our word. That is in their best interests \nas well as ours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six and a half minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Texas for a very \nknowledgeable and forceful statement, well articulated, and one which \nshows a great deal of wisdom with respect to the impact upon the \nreadiness of our military forces, the impact caused by having our \nforces in Europe under the circumstances which we have described.\n  Mr. President, in order that Senators may be well informed as to the \nsubstance of the bill which the Senator from Texas and I are \nintroducing, I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2036\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bosnia Force Realignment \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) United States Armed Forces in the Republic of Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina have accomplished the military mission \n     assigned to them as a component of the Implementation and \n     Stabilization Forces.\n       (2) The continuing and open-ended commitment of U.S. ground \n     forces in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is subject \n     to the oversight authority of the Congress;\n       (3) Congress may limit the use of appropriated funds to \n     create the conditions for an orderly and honorable withdrawal \n     of U.S. troops from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       (4) On November 27, 1995, the President affirmed that \n     United States participation in the multinational military \n     Implementation Force in the Republic of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina would terminate in about one year.\n       (5) The President declared the expiration date of the \n     mandate for the Implementation Force to be December 20, 1996.\n       (6) The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff expressed confidence that the Implementation \n     Force would complete its mission in about one year.\n       (7) The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff expressed the critical importance of \n     establishing a firm deadline, in the absence of which there \n     is a potential for expansion of the mission of U.S. forces;\n       (8) On October 3, 1996, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff announced the intention of the United States \n     Administration to delay the removal of United States Armed \n     Forces personnel from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     until March 1997.\n       (9) In November 1996 the President announced his intention \n     to further extend the deployment of United States Armed \n     Forces in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina until June \n     1998.\n       (10) The President did not request authorization by the \n     Congress of a policy that would result in the further \n     deployment of United States Armed Forces in the Republic of \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina until June 1998.\n       (11) Notwithstanding the passage of two previously \n     established deadlines, the reaffirmation of those deadlines \n     by senior national security officials, and the endorsement by \n     those same national security officials of the importance of \n     having a deadline as a hedge against an expanded mission, the \n     President announced on December 17, 1997 that establishing a \n     deadline had been a mistake and that U.S. ground combat \n     forces were committed to the NATO-led mission in Bosnia for \n     the indefinite future;\n       (12) NATO military forces have increased their \n     participation in law enforcement, particularly police, \n     activities;\n       (13) U.S. Commanders of NATO have stated on several \n     occasions that, in accordance with the Dayton Peace Accords, \n     the principal responsibility for such law enforcement and \n     police activities lies with the Bosnian parties themselves.\n\n     SEC. 3.

An original bill to amend title 17, United States Code, to \nimplement the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and \nPhonograms Treaty, to provide limitations on copyright liability \nrelating to material online, and for other purposes; from the Committee \non the Judiciary; placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                    Digital Millennium Copyright Act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee is reporting today, is important for our \neconomy, for our creative industries and for the future of the \nInternet. This legislation is based on the WIPO implementing \nlegislation, S. 1121, recommended by the Administration and introduced \nlast year by the Chairman, Senators Thompson and Kohl and me.\n  Following intensive discussions with a number of interested parties, \nincluding libraries, universities, small businesses, online and \nInternet service providers, telephone companies, computer users, \nbroadcasters, content providers and device manufacturers, the Committee \nwas able to reach unanimous agreement on certain modifications and \nadditions incorporated into the bill and making this bill a product of \nwhich we can all be proud.\n  Significant provisions were added to the bill in Title II to clarify \nthe liability for copyright infringement of online and Internet service \nproviders. These provisions set forth ``safe harbors'' from liability \nfor ISPs and OSPs under clearly defined circumstances, which both \nencourage responsible behavior and protect important intellectual \nproperty rights. In addition, during the Committee's consideration of \nthis bill, an Ashcroft-Leahy-Hatch amendment was adopted to ensure that \ncomputer users are given reasonable notice of when their Web sites are \nthe subject of infringement complaints, and to provide procedures for \ncomputer users to have material mistakenly taken down put back.\n  This bill contains a number of provisions designed to help libraries \nand archives. First, libraries expressed concerns about the possibility \nof criminal sanctions or potentially ruinous monetary liability for \nactions taken in good faith. This bill makes sure that libraries acting \nin good faith can never be subject to fines or civil damages. \nSpecifically, a library is exempt from monetary liability in a civil \nsuit if it was not aware and had no reason to believe that its acts \nconstituted a violation. In addition, libraries are completely exempt \nfrom the criminal provisions.\n  Second, the bill contains a browsing exception for libraries. \nLibraries have indicated that in an online environment dominated by \nencrypted works it may be impossible for them to gain access to works \nto decide whether or not to acquire them. The current version of the \nbill permits libraries to circumvent access prevention technologies in \norder to make a good faith determination of whether or not it would \nlike to buy a copy of a work. If the library decides that it wishes to \nacquire the work it must negotiate with the copyright owner just as \nlibraries do today.\n  Third, the Chairman, Senator Ashcroft and I crafted an amendment to \nprovide for the preservation of digital works by qualified libraries \nand archives. The ability of Libraries to preserve legible copies of \nworks in digital form is one I consider critical. Under present law, \nlibraries are permitted to make a single facsimile copy of works in \ntheir collections for preservation purposes, or to replace lost, \ndamaged or stolen copies of works that have become commercially \nunavailable. This law, however, has become outmoded by changing \ntechnology and preservation practices. The bill ensures that libraries' \ncollections will continue to be available to future generations by \npermitting libraries to make up to three copies in any format--\nincluding in digital form. This was one of the proposals in the \nNational Information Infrastructure Copyright Protection Act of 1995, \nwhich I sponsored in the last Congress. The Register of Copyrights, \namong others, has supported that proposal.\n  In addition, the bill would permit a library to transfer a work from \none digital format to another if the equipment needed to read the \nearlier format becomes unavailable commercially. This change addresses \na problem that should be familiar to anyone whose office has boxes of \neight-inch floppy disks tucked away somewhere.\n  These provisions go a long way toward meeting the concerns that \nlibraries have expressed about the original bill, S. 1121, introduced \nto implement the WIPO treaties.\n  Another issue that the bill addresses is distance learning. When \nCongress enacted the present copyright law it recognized the potential \nof broadcast and cable technology to supplement classroom teaching, and \nto bring the classroom to those who, because of their disabilities or \nother special circumstances, are unable to attend classes. At the same \ntime, Congress also recognized the potential for unauthorized \ntransmissions of works to harm the markets for educational uses of \ncopyrighted materials. In the present Copyright Act, we struck a \ncareful balance and crafted a narrow exemption. But as with so many \nareas of copyright law, the advent of digital technology requires us to \ntake another look at the issue.\n  I recognize that the issue of distance learning has been under \nconsideration for the past several years by the Conference on Fair Use \n(CONFU) that was established by the Administration to consider issues \nrelating to fair use in the digital environment. In spite of the hard \nwork of the participants, CONFU has so far been unable to forge a \ncomprehensive agreement on guidelines for the application of fair use \nto digital distance learning. The issue is an important one, and I \ncommend Senator Ashcroft for his attention to this matter.\n\n  We made tremendous strides in charting the appropriate course for \nupdating the Copyright Act to permit the use of copyrighted works in \nvalid distance learning activities. The Chairman, Senator Ashcroft and \nI joined together to ask the Copyright Office to facilitate discussions \namong interested library and educational groups and content providers \nwith a view toward making recommendations that could be incorporated \ninto the DMCA at the April 30 mark up. The Copyright Office did just \nthat, once again providing a valuable service to this Committee.\n  Based on the Copyright Office's recommendations, we incorporated into \nthe DMCA a new Section 122 requiring the Copyright Office to make \nbroader recommendations to Congress on digital distance education \nwithin six months. Upon receiving the Copyright Office's \nrecommendations, it is my hope that the Senate Judiciary Committee will \npromptly commence hearings on the issue and move expeditiously to enact \nfurther legislation on the matter. I know that my fellow members on \nthis Committee are as anxious as I am to complete the process that we \nstarted in Committee of updating the Copyright Act to permit the \nappropriate use of copyrighted works in valid distance learning \nactivities. This step should be viewed as a beginning--not an end, and \nwe are committed to reaching that end point as quickly as possible.\n  Senator Feinstein had sought to clarify when a university would be \nheld responsible for the actions of its employees in connection with \nits eligibility for the safe harbors spelled out in title II of the \nbill. Chairman Hatch, Senator Ashcroft and I agreed with Senator \nFeinstein that the best way to address this issue is to have the \nCopyright Office examine this issue in a comprehensive fashion, because \nof its importance, complexity, and implications for other online \nservice providers, including libraries and archives.\n  Amendments sponsored by Senators Ashcroft, Hatch and I were also \ncrafted to address the issues of reverse engineering, ephemeral \nrecordings and to clarify for broadcasters the use of copyright \nmanagement information in the course of certain analog and digital \ntransmissions.\n  Legislative language was incorporated into the bill to clarify that \nthe law enforcement exemptions apply to all government agencies which \nconduct law enforcement and intelligence work, as well as to government \ncontractors engaging in intelligence, investigative, or protective \nwork.\n  Chairman Hatch, Senator Ashcroft and I agreed to language to assuage \nthe concerns of the consumer electronics\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\nmanufacturers, and others, that the bill might require them to design \ntheir products to respond to any particular technological protection \nmeasure. We also agreed to incorporate provisions into the bill \nclarifying that nothing in the bill will prevent parents from \ncontrolling their children's access to the Internet or individuals from \nprotecting personal identifying information.\n  By reaching agreement on this bill, this Committee is helping to \ncreate American jobs, protect American ingenuity, and foster an ever \nmore vibrant Internet. In short, the WIPO treaties and this \nimplementing legislation are important to America's economic future. \nThe bill addresses the problems caused when copyrighted works are \ndisseminated through the Internet and other electronic transmissions \nwithout the authority of the copyright owner. By establishing clear \nrules of the road, this bill will allow electronic commerce to flourish \nin a way that does not undermine America's copyright community.\n  In a recent letter about the DMCA, Secretary Daley said, ``The United \nStates must lead the way in setting a standard that will protect our \ncreative industries and serve as a model for the rest of the world. And \nwe need to act as quickly as possible.''\n  This bill is a well-balanced package of proposals that address the \nneeds of creators, consumers and commerce well into the next century. I \nurge all of my colleagues to support the Digital Millennium Copyright \nAct and work for its prompt passage.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the Digital \nMillennium Copyright Act of 1998. In my view, we need this measure to \nstop an epidemic of illegal copying of protected works--such as movies, \nbooks, musical recordings, and software. The copyright industry is one \nof our most thriving businesses. But we still lose more than $15 \nbillion each year due to foreign copyright piracy, according to some \nestimates.\n  This foreign piracy is out of control. For example, one of my \nstaffers investigating video piracy on a trip to China walked into a \nHong Kong arcade and bought three bootlegged computer games--including \n``Toy Story'' and ``NBA '97''--for just $10. These games normally sell \nfor about $100. Indeed, the manager was so brazen about it, he even \nagreed to give a receipt.\n  Illegal copying has been a longstanding concern to me. I introduced \none of the precursors to this bill, the Motion Picture Anti-Piracy Act, \nwhich in principle has been incorporated into this measure. And I was \none of the original cosponsors of the original proposed WIPO \nimplementing legislation, the preliminary version of this measure.\n  In my opinion, this bill achieves a fair balance by taking steps to \neffectively deter piracy, while still allowing fair use of protected \nmaterials. It is the product of intensive negotiations between all of \nthe interested parties--including the copyright industry, telephone \ncompanies, libraries, universities and device manufacturers. And every \nmajor concern raised during that process was addressed. For these \nreasons, it earned the unanimous support of the Judiciary Committee. Of \ncourse, as with any legislation, some tinkering may still be needed.\n  I am confident that this bill has the best approach for stopping \npiracy and strengthening one of our biggest export industries. It \ndeserves our support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Warner) (by \n        request):\n  S. 2038. A bill to amend the John F. Kennedy Center Act to authorize \nappropriations for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts \nand to further define the criteria for capital repair and operation and \nmaintenance; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n           the john f. kennedy center for the performing arts\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the John F. Kennedy \nCenter for the Performing Arts Authorization Act. I am introducing this \nbill at the request of the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees, in my \ncapacity as Chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. \nJoining me as cosponsors of the bill are the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \nSenators Warner and Baucus.\n  The concept of a national center for the performing arts originated \nduring the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. President \nEisenhower envisioned a national cultural center in the nation's \ncapital, and in 1958, with the support of Congress, he signed into law \nthe National Cultural Center Act, which established the Center as an \nindependently administered bureau of the Smithsonian Institution. \nFollowing the death of President Kennedy, the Congress in 1964 renamed \nthe Center in honor of the late president.\n  The Kennedy Center was opened to the public in September 1971. The \nresponse was overwhelming--so much so that the Center's Board of \nTrustees requested help from Congress in maintaining and operating the \nCenter, for the benefit of the millions of visitors. In 1972, Congress \nauthorized the National Park Service to provide maintenance, security, \nand other services necessary to maintain the facility. For the next two \ndecades, the Park Service received federal appropriations for the \nmaintenance and operation of the Presidential monument.\n  In the early part of this decade, however, it became clear that the \nKennedy Center facility--which had not seen comprehensive capital \nrepair since its opening--had deteriorated significantly due to both \nage and intensive public use. Those repairs that had taken place--such \nas the 1977 repair of the leaking roof--were undertaken in response to \nthreatening conditions. The Board of Trustees, with the support of the \nPark Service, therefore set out to achieve a more effective long-term \napproach to management of the facility, with one entity responsible for \nboth the care of the physical plant and the staging of performance \nactivities.\n  In 1994, therefore, Congress approved and the President signed the \nJohn F. Kennedy Center Act Amendments (Public Law 103-279). That Act \nauthorized the transfer of all capital repair, operations, and \nmaintenance of the facility from the Park Service to the Board of \nTrustees.\n  The Act also directed the Board to develop a comprehensive, multi-\nyear plan for the restoration and ongoing maintenance of the Kennedy \nCenter. In 1995, the Board delivered the Comprehensive Building Plan, \nwhich set forth a long-term, two-stage program for the remediation of \nsubstandard building conditions, as well as continuous maintenance for \nthe future. Phase I, scheduled for Fiscal Years 1995 through 1998, has \nconcluded successfully. During this time, several major projects were \ncompleted, including the installation of a new, energy-efficient \nheating and cooling system, replacement of the leaking roof and roof \nterrace, and the major renovation of the Concert Hall. Phase II is \nscheduled to take place over the next eleven fiscal years, through \nFiscal Year 2009. This stage will involve the massive ``Center Block'' \nproject, during which the Opera House will be overhauled, as well as \nprojects to make improvements to the plaza, improve accessibility to \nthe theaters, install fire and other safety technology, and make a host \nof other repairs designed to ensure that the facility meets life safety \nstandards.\n  That brings us to the legislation I am introducing today. For the \nmajor Phase II projects to get underway, Congress must revise the 1994 \nAct to authorize appropriate funding for the next several fiscal years. \nThe bill I am introducing today authorizes significant funding levels \nfor the next eleven fiscal years for maintenance as well as capital \nrepair work.\n  Over the next several weeks, I and other members of the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works intend to review carefully the planned \nrepair activities and the authorization request. The Kennedy Center is \na living Presidential memorial and a national monument, and as such \ndemands a high standard of maintenance and upkeep. As an ex-officio \nmember of the Board, and Chairman of the authorizing Committee, I am \ndedicated to the appropriate restoration and preservation of the \nfacility, which millions of Americans have enjoyed for more than a \nquarter of a century. Nevertheless, it is Congress' duty on behalf of \nthe taxpayers to scrutinize this request closely. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the Senate, the Administration, and the \nKennedy Center Board\n\n[[Page S4441]]\n\nto ensure that we allocate federal resources in an effective and \nresponsible manner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2039. A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate \nEl Camino Real de Tierra Adentro as a National Historic Trail; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        the el camino real de tierra adentro national trail act\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \namend the National Trails System Act to designate El Camino Real de \nTierra Adentro as a National Historic Trail. This legislation is \nimportant to New Mexico and contributes to the national dialogue on the \nhistory of this country and who we are as a people.\n  In history classes across the country, children learn about the \nestablishment of European settlements on the East Coast, and the east \nto west migration which occurred under the banner of Manifest Destiny. \nWe in New Mexico, however, also know the story of the northward \nexploration and settlement of this country by the Spanish, a little \nknown but important piece of America's history.\n  My legislation recognizes a proud chapter in American history; the \nnorthward exploration and settlement of the Southwest by the Spanish. \nBuilding upon a network of trade routes used by the indigenous Pueblos \nalong the Rio Grande, Spanish explorers established a migration route \ninto the interior of the continent which they called ``El Camino Real \nde Tierra Adentro,'' the Royal Road of the Interior. My bill will amend \nthe National Trails System Act to designate El Camino Real de Tierra \nAdentro as a National Historic Trail, and give the National Park \nService a mandate to develop interpretive displays explaining the \nimportance of the trail during the Spanish settlement of the southwest \nUnited States.\n  This legislation is especially appropriate in this year of the \nCuartocentenario, which commemorates the 400th anniversary of the \nestablishment of the first Spanish capital at San Juan Pueblo, the \nfirst terminus of the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro.\n  In 1598, almost a decade before the first English colonists landed at \nJamestown, Virginia, Don Juan de Onate led a Spanish expedition which \nestablished the northern portion of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. \nThe road was the main route for communication and trade between the \ncolonial Spanish capital of Mexico City and the Spanish provincial \ncapitals at San Juan de Los Caballeros, San Gabriel and then Santa Fe, \nNew Mexico.\n  From 1598 to 1821 El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro facilitated the \nexploration, conquest, colonization, settlement, religious conversion, \nand military occupation of the borderlands. The Spanish influence from \nthat period can still be seen today in the ethnic and cultural \ntraditions of the southwestern United States.\n  In the 17th century, caravans of wagons and livestock struggled for \nmonths to cross the desert and bring supplies up El Camino Real to \nmissions, mining towns and settlements in New Mexico. On one section \nknown as the Jornada del Muerto, or Journey of Death, they traveled for \n90 miles without water, shelter, or firewood. Wagons heading south \ncarried the products of New Mexico to markets in Mexico.\n  El Camino Real became an integral part of an international network of \ncommerce between Europe, the United States, New Mexico and other \nprovinces of the Mexican republic. The route is a symbol of the \ncommercial exchange and cultural interaction between nations and \ndiverse ethnic groups that led to the development of the southwestern \nUnited States. It is also a proud symbol of the contributions of \nHispanic people to the development of this great country.\n  As we enter the 21st century, it's essential that we embrace the \ndiversity of people and cultures that make up our country. It is the \nsource of our dynamism and strength. I look forward to helping to \nadvance our understanding of our rich cultural history through this \ninitiative.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2039\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``El Camino Real de Tierra \n     Adentro National Historic Trail Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro (the Royal Road of the \n     Interior), served as the primary route between the colonial \n     Spanish capital of Mexico City and the Spanish provincial \n     capitals at San Juan de Los Caballeros (1598-1600), San \n     Gabriel (1600-1609) and Santa Fe (1610-1821);\n       (2) the portion of El Camino Real in what is now the United \n     States extended between El Paso, Texas, and present San Juan \n     Pueblo, New Mexico, a distance of 404 miles;\n       (3) El Camino Real is a symbol of the cultural interaction \n     between nations and ethnic groups and of the commercial \n     exchange that made possible the development and growth of the \n     borderland;\n       (4) American Indian groups, especially the Pueblo Indians \n     of the Rio Grande, developed trails for trade long before \n     Europeans arrived;\n       (5) in 1598, Juan de Onate led a Spanish military \n     expedition along those trails to establish the northern \n     portion of El Camino Real;\n       (6) during the Mexican National Period and part of the \n     United States Territorial Period, El Camino Real facilitated \n     the emigration of people to New Mexico and other areas that \n     were to become part of the United States;\n       (7) the exploration, conquest, colonization, settlement, \n     religious conversion, and military occupation of a large area \n     of the borderland was made possible by El Camino Real, the \n     historical period of which extended from 1598 to 1882;\n       (8) American Indians, European emigrants, miners, ranchers, \n     soldiers, and missionaries used El Camino Real during the \n     historic development of the borderland, promoting cultural \n     interaction among Spaniards, other Europeans, American \n     Indians, Mexicans, and Americans; and\n       (9) El Camino Real fostered the spread of Catholicism, \n     mining, an extensive network of commerce, and ethnic and \n     cultural traditions including music, folklore, medicine, \n     foods, architecture, language, place names, irrigation \n     systems, and Spanish law.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       Section 5(a) of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1244(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by designating the paragraphs relating to the \n     California National Historic Trail, the Pony Express National \n     Historic Trail, and the Selma to Montgomery National Historic \n     Trail as paragraphs (18), (19), and (20), respectively; and\n

MUSLIMS\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Lieberman) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 94\n\n       Whereas the American Muslim community, comprised of \n     approximately 5,000,000 people, is a vital part of our \n     Nation, with more than 1,500 mosques, Islamic schools, and \n     Islamic centers in neighborhoods across the United States;\n       Whereas Islam is one of the great Abrahamic faiths, whose \n     significant contributions throughout history have advanced \n     the fields of math, science, medicine, law, philosophy, art, \n     and literature;\n       Whereas the United States is a secular nation, with an \n     unprecedented commitment to religious tolerance and \n     pluralism, where the rights, liberties, and freedoms \n     guaranteed by the Constitution are guaranteed to all citizens \n     regardless of religious affiliation;\n       Whereas Muslims have been subjected, simply because of \n     their faith, to acts of discrimination and harassment that \n     all too often have led to hate-inspired violence, as was the \n     case during the rush to judgment in the aftermath of the \n     tragic Oklahoma City bombing;\n       Whereas discrimination against Muslims intimidates American \n     Muslims and may prevent Muslims from freely expressing their \n     opinions and exercising their religious beliefs as guaranteed \n     by the first amendment to the Constitution;\n       Whereas American Muslims have regrettably been portrayed in \n     a negative light in some discussions of policy issues such as \n     issues relating to religious persecution abroad or fighting \n     terrorism in the United States;\n       Whereas stereotypes and anti-Muslim rhetoric have also \n     contributed to a backlash\n\n[[Page S4443]]\n\n     against Muslims in some neighborhoods across the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas all persons in the United States who espouse and \n     adhere to the values of the founders of our Nation should \n     help in the fight against bias, bigotry, and intolerance in \n     all their forms and from all their sources: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) Congress condemns anti-Muslim intolerance and \n     discrimination as wholly inconsistent with the American \n     values of religious tolerance and pluralism;\n       (2) while Congress respects and upholds the right of \n     individuals to free speech, Congress acknowledges that \n     individuals and organizations that foster such intolerance \n     create an atmosphere of hatred and fear that divides the \n     Nation;\n       (3) Congress resolves to uphold a level of political \n     discourse that does not involve making a scapegoat of an \n     entire religion or drawing political conclusions on the basis \n     of religious doctrine; and\n       (4) Congress recognizes the contributions of American \n     Muslims, who are followers of one of the three major \n     monotheistic religions of the world and one of the fastest \n     growing faiths in the United States.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. Con. Res. \n94, which encourages religious tolerance toward Muslims in America. I \nam proud to join my colleague, Senator Joe Lieberman, in co-sponsoring \nthis legislation. S. Con Res. 94 calls upon Congress to lead the effort \nin condemning anti-Muslim intolerance and discrimination.\n  Many may ask why a resolution such as this needs to be introduced in \nCongress. The answer is, unfortunately, that some Muslims in America \nhave been subjected to discrimination and harassment based simply upon \ntheir religious beliefs. This, Mr. President, is inimical to the \nprotections of our Constitution, and to our long-held, fundamental \nbeliefs concerning religious tolerance and pluralism.\n  It is important to note that Islam is one of the three great \nmonotheistic religions based upon the teachings of Abraham. The \nAmerican Muslim community, numbering close to 5 million, is a vibrant \npart of our nation. The many mosques, Islamic schools and centers \nacross America serve to remind us all that Islam has contributed to \nadvancements in the fields of mathematics, science, medicine, law, \nphilosophy, art and literature. Furthermore, many Americans of the \nMuslim faith are leaders in their communities, and successes in their \nprofessions.\n  It is my sincere hope that our colleagues will join us in taking a \nstand against anti-Muslim intolerance and discrimination by co-\nsponsoring this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Abraham in \nsubmitting this resolution recognizing the need--indeed the \nobligation--for our nation to show greater tolerance towards Americans \nof Muslim faith. Tolerance for people of all faiths was among the \nfounding principles of our nation. Since the early 17th Century, when \nthe Puritans fled to America seeking the religious freedom that was \ndenied them in England, our nation has cherished religious pluralism \nand ingrained in its people the value of allowing every person to \nworship according to the dictates of his or her own conscience. When \nthe Framers drafted the Constitution, they saw this principle as so \nimportant, so sacrosanct, that they enshrined religious freedom not \nonce, but twice, in the Bill of Rights' very first Amendment. Perhaps \nbecause of this constitutional mandate, or perhaps because of the \nresulting tolerance the First Amendment has engendered in our society, \nour nation has in the more than 200 years since it began become a haven \nfor those seeking both refuge from religious persecution and a society \naccepting and nurturing of a pluralism in religious beliefs.\n  Indeed, like millions of their coreligionists, my own grandparents \ncame to the United States from Central and Eastern Europe early this \ncentury, in part to escape the discrimination they suffered on account \nof their Jewish faith and heritage. They and those of us who descended \nfrom them ultimately found an acceptance in this country that is \nvirtually unparalleled in history. As a result of this country's \ncontinued willingness to welcome people of different faiths like my \ngrandparents, both we and American society have been enriched.\n  Unfortunately, the traditional American values of religious tolerance \nand acceptance thus far too often have been denied to a more recent \ngroup of arrivals and their descendants. Despite the tremendous \ncontributions Muslim Americans are making to American society, and \ndespite the fact that Islam shares a common origin--and common values--\nwith America's two other predominant monotheistic religions, Americans \nof Islamic faith have been subjected to harassment and discrimination \nsolely on account of their religion and heritage. This must end. It is \ntime for us to reaffirm our commitment to religious pluralism and \ntolerance. It is time for us to loudly proclaim that a diversity of \nreligious beliefs and traditions enriches rather than diminishes our \nsociety because religion--including Islam--is a great source of values \nand good deeds in our democracy. It is time for us to extend to our \nMuslim citizens in practice the promise of our nation's ideals: \ntolerance of and gratitude for their religious beliefs.

Mr. President, I rise today to give a brief \ntribute to Mr. Bruce Bohnsack from my home state of North Dakota. Mr. \nBohnsack operates a grain and soybean farm which has been in his family \nfor more than 100 years. As a producer, Bruce has a keen interest in \nfarm policy issues and has been active in the affairs of a farmer owned \ncredit cooperative--the Farm Credit System.\n  Bruce's active involvement in Farm Credit has been on various levels. \nHe is a member of the Federal Land Credit Association of Fargo and has \nserved as director of that association for 18 years. Bohnsack joined \nthe board of the St. Paul Farm Credit Bank in 1987--at a time of crisis \nfor the bank and the Farm Credit System as a whole.\n  The Farm Credit System of the mid-1980s was fighting a battle for \nsurvival. One of the things that saved the System was the leadership of \nFarm Credit board members like Bruce Bohnsack. Bruce and his colleagues \nin St. Paul made a number of sound business decisions of critical \nimportance to the institutions and the farmers they serve. One such \ndecision was to combine the St. Paul and St. Louis Farm Credit Banks to \ncreate AgriBank, FCB. This first voluntary merger of Farm Credit banks \nin the history of the System helped to ensure the efficiency and \neffectiveness of the wholesale bank while retaining local \naccountability at the association level.\n  Bruce and other farmer elected lenders in the System also provided \nhelpful input to the Committee on Agriculture when we drafted the \nAgricultural Credit Act of 1987. The 1987 Act is one of the great \nsuccess stories in recent years for which Congress and the Farm Credit \nSystem can both be justifiably proud. Since 1987 the Farm Credit System \nhas experienced a remarkable turn around. It is now better capitalized \nand better positioned to serve farmers than ever before in its history. \nCongress played a role in this turn around by providing Farm Credit \nwith a loan not a grant. The principal and interest on the loan made \npossible under the 1987 legislation is being repaid by the System \nseveral years ahead of schedule.\n  Bruce Bohnsack's interest in farm policy issues is also reflected in \nhis service on the St. Paul District Farm Credit Council and national \nFarm Credit Council boards of directors. As chairman of these two \nboards, Bruce was as an advocate for Farm Credit in the halls of \nCongress and in North Dakota. While he no longer serves on these \nboards, you can bet he will continue to be active in North Dakota \nFarmers Union, North Dakota State Township Officers Association, his \nlocal Lutheran church and other farm and community groups.\n  On behalf of North Dakota farmers, I would like to thank Bruce \nBohnsack for his years of service to the Farm Credit System and \nAmerican agriculture. We wish him well in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/06/senate-section/article/S4448-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4448-S4449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  FIRST LIEUTENANT JOSEPH VAN OOSTERHOUT RETIRES FROM MICHIGAN STATE \n                                 POLICE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

He is retiring from the State Police after 23 years and 9 \nmonths of dedicated service.\n  First Lieutenant Van Oosterhout joined the Michigan State Police \nafter serving in the United States Navy during the Vietnam War from \n1967 to 1971. After serving in the military, he attended Western \nMichigan University where he worked towards the Bachelor's Degree he \nlater earned while with the State Police. He was enlisted in the \nMichigan State Police in 1974, first stationed at the Benton Harbor \nPost and later to the Detroit Post and White Pigeon Post. In 1982, Van \nOosterhout was promoted to Sergeant in the Traffic Services Division in \nLansing. In 1987, he was assigned as Assistant Post Commander at the \nYpsilanti Post. In 1992, he was promoted to Post Commander at the Iron \nMountain Post. Also in 1992, he was transferred to the Negaunee Post as \nPost Commander where he has served ever since.\n  Throughout his career, First Lieutenant Van Oosterhout has received a \ngreat deal of recognition for his excellent service. In 1988, he was \nrecognized as being the police officer in Michigan who had contributed \nmost to traffic safety. He received one Departmental Award for breaking \na crime ring and another for making a drug bust that had ties to \nseveral states.\n\n[[Page S4449]]\n\n  Van Oosterhout, husband to Becky and father to Leah, Sarah, Joe and \nAndrew, will be remembered for his excellent service and dedication to \nthe Department of State Police, friendly demeanor and concern for those \nhe worked with.

Mr. President, the Senate recently voted on an \nimportant piece of legislation, the Coverdell A+ Savings Account bill. \nI believe it is important to clarify my position on several amendments \noffered to this bill.\n  In general, I believe the best way to ensure effective education \npolicy is to direct as many dollars and resources as possible to the \nlocal level. By giving localities the resources and flexibility they \nneed, I am confident that communities and parents will best direct \nthose funds to meet the unique and diverse needs of their children. For \nthis reason, I support the Coverdell A+ Savings Account bill. This \nlegislation, puts resources at the most local level: with parents. \nParents will now have the ability to save for and meet the educational \nneeds of their children. Whether it means hiring a tutor for their \nchild, buying a home computer, finding an alternative educational \nsetting, or saving for college, parents will be in the position to take \npositive steps towards providing a positive educational future for \ntheir children.\n  For similar reasons, I supported an amendment offered by Senator \nGorton to give states the option of (1) continuing to receive federal \neducation programs under the current funding system; (2) receiving \nfederal education programs as a block grant going directly to the state \nwithout federal regulations; or (3) receiving federal education \nprograms in a block grant going directly to the local education agency \nwithout federal regulations. By allowing local education agencies to \nreceive federal resources without federal red tape and bureaucracy, we \nwill be putting more power and flexibility in the hands of the people \nmost closely involved with educating children. As a safe-guard to \nensure that an appropriate level of federal funding continues, Senator \nGorton's amendment insists that if future funding dips below the \ncurrent level of funding, the programs would be forced back into the \ncurrent categorical funding.\n  I also supported an amendment offered by Senators Mack and D'Amato \nwhich would allow states to use existing block grant funds under the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act to fund teacher testing and \nmerit pay programs in the state. I believe this amendment would allow \nstates to develop important programs to help ensure quality teachers in \nthe classroom and to pay those teachers accordingly.\n  Finally, I supported an amendment that was offered by Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison which clarified the federal position on same-sex \nschools. This amendment would allow same-sex classrooms and schools to \nbe eligible to receive federal funding as long as comparable education \nopportunities are offered for students of both sexes. I believe the \nfederal government must allow states and communities to find creative \nsolutions to meeting the educational needs of their children.\n  Again, I support the philosophy behind the Coverdell bill and the \nGorton amendment which places control, resources, and decision making \nwith parents and local communities. Unfortunately, most of the \namendments offered by Democrats, while noble ideas, fund their programs \nby eliminating the education savings accounts and by focusing the \nprograms and power at the federal level. While there were many \ninteresting ideas debated, such as the amendment offered by Senator \nLevin which would increase the lifetime learning education credit for \nteachers or the amendment offered by Senator Landrieu to provide \nincentive grants for Blue Ribbon Schools, each proposal was paid for by \ndefunding the A+ Savings Accounts. For that reason, I could not support \nthese weakening amendments.\n  Senator Glenn offered an amendment which would eliminate the ability \nof parents to use their tax-free savings to pay for private school \ntuition or homeschooling expenses. The provision included in the A+ \nbill is identical to the provision supported by President Clinton and \nthe Democrats in the Balanced Budget Act which allows parents to save \n$500 a year for college expenses. The Balanced Budget Act, which was \nsigned into law by the President, does not differentiate between \nprivate and public colleges. It is inconsistent to subsidize a more \nlimited number of college students and not offer the same benefit in K-\n12 education.\n  Senator Mosely-Braun offered an amendment to eliminate the Coverdell \nA+ Savings accounts and to use the money instead to create a federal \nschool construction program. While I recognize the need for adequate \nschool construction, I believe the Coverdell bill more adequately \naddresses the needs for school construction through a provision \nincluded in the legislation offered by Senator Graham. This provision \nfosters public private partnerships for school construction and \nmaintains the function of school construction at the local level. The \nbill provides for $3 billion in tax-exempt bond funding for school \nconstruction.\n  I voted against an amendment offered by Senator Kennedy which would \nforgive a maximum of $8,000 in student loans for teachers entering \n``high need areas or subjects'' and would pay for this provision by \neliminating the A+ Savings Accounts. I opposed this amendment because \nthe Higher Education Reauthorization Act approved by the Senate Labor \nCommittee contains similar incentives of student loan forgiveness for \nteachers entering inner-city or rural teaching environments.\n  I opposed an amendment offered by Senator Boxer which would create a \nnew $250 million federal after-school program. While I support after-\nschool mentoring and tutoring programs for children, I believe these \nprograms should be operated at the local level. In addition, the \nfederal government already funds 4 after-school care programs and 19 \nexisting federal programs that provide tutoring and mentoring for \nstudents on a one-on-one basis.\n  I am encouraged by the Senate's action on the Coverdell A+ Savings \nbill and the amendment offered by Senator Gorton. I look forward to \nadditional debate on education issues and new and innovative proposals \nto place greater control and resources at the local level.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/06/senate-section/article/S4449-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4449-S4450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REGARDING INTERNATIONAL PROJECT EVALUATING AND FACILITATING \n            INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 224, submitted \nearlier by Senator Stevens and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 224) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate concerning an international project to evaluate and \n     facilitate\n\n[[Page S4450]]\n\n     the international exchange of advanced technology.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, last spring, the Duma Chairman of the \nCommittee on the Problems of the Russian North, Vladimir Goman, met \nwith Senator Cochran and myself to ask us for our participation in a \nnew project which would help facilitate Russia's efforts in the \nremediation of nuclear wastes.\n  Since that meeting, the Russian Duma has passed a Resolution pledging \nfunding and infrastructure for the Advanced Technology Research Project \n(ATRP). In Europe, industry and key decision makers of the European \nParliament, the German Bundestag, the Union of European Labor Parties, \nand several national nuclear waste management and research and \ndevelopment institutions, including the Swiss NAGRA, have all pledged \ntheir support for the ATRP.\n  This ATRP, originally proposed by the Russian Duma, with \nparticipation from academia, private industry and governmental and \npublic organizations, is a privately funded, neutral organization. It \nwill facilitate information exchange on nuclear waste management \ntechnologies, and the development of a worldwide nuclear waste \nmanagement technology marketplace. It is the goal of this project to \nadvance self sufficiency in nuclear waste management in Russia and to \nglobally provide advanced and affordable solutions to nuclear waste.\n  ATRP will be entirely privately funded through private industry, \npublic interest, and scientific organizations. This Private-Public \nPartnership will be implemented through ATRP's global nuclear waste \ntechnology clearinghouse, database, conferences, workshops, and trade \nshows worldwide. The objective is advanced, safer, and efficient \nnuclear waste management at the lowest possible cost.\n  The management of nuclear waste is one of the world's most pressing \nconcerns and perhaps Russia's greatest ecological threat. ATRP will \nhelp Russia help itself by developing an international market for \ntechnology exchange. It will also benefit United States and all other \nnuclear nations by making nuclear waste management technology more \nreadily available in the international market place.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this Resolution \nwhich will help us all work toward an international solution to this \nvery pressing issue of nuclear wage management.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to; that the preamble be agreed to; that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements \nrelating to the resolution appear at the appropriate place in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.
