Let me begin by talking just for a moment about trade.\n  I generally come to the floor to talk about NAFTA, which is our trade \nrelationship with our neighbor to the north, Canada, and our neighbor \nto the south, Mexico. Let me limit that this morning to our trade with \nCanada.\n  I say on a broader scale that our NAFTA trade agreement in my \njudgment has been a failure. We now have a $40 billion combined deficit \nwith our two neighbors, Canada and Mexico. Prior to the enactment of \nNAFTA, the trade agreement with our two neighbors, we had a much more \npositive balance of trade. But since the enactment of NAFTA, we now see \na nearly $40 billion combined trade deficit, which I think is a very \nserious problem. It is a growing problem, and one that we must deal \nwith.\n  But let me just deal with one part of the trade problem with Canada \ntoday. There is an avalanche of Canadian grain that is moving across \nour border, flooding into our marketplace, and that is depressing grain \nprices here in this country and taking money out of the pockets of \nAmerican farmers.\n  This might be a fairly boring subject to some, but not if you are a \nfarmer. If you are a farmer out there struggling, and you see the \nprices drop for wheat, Durum, barley, and other things you are \nproducing, and then see Canada flood our markets with Canadian grain, \nyou get pretty angry about it, and justifiably so.\n  We had an agreement with Canada, something called tariff rate quotas, \nfor a year which established levels of Canadian shipments of wheat, \nDurum, and other wheat coming into this country. That tariff rate quota \nexpired, but the administration indicated they would unilaterally \nenforce that quota. Well, at this point Canada has shipped a quantity \nof grain into this country that is already above the tariff rate quota \nfor this marketing year. And it is shipping Durum wheat into this \ncountry at a level that will exceed the tariff rate quota as well. It \nhas not yet done so, but will exceed the tariff rate quota.\n  Canada seems not to care very much about what this country thinks \nabout these trade arrangements. We had a consultation with Canada about \na week or two ago in Montreal, I believe, and the Canadians responded \nin a way that was wholly unsatisfactory to these issues. In essence, \nthe Canadians seemed to be saying, I am told, that they intend to do \nnothing about it and they intend to continue to ship their grain into \nthis country.\n  I am asking the President to do a couple things. One, inasmuch as the \nCanadians are not exercising a good neighbor policy on this trade, we \nshould take some action.\n  Just to back up for a moment, when the United States-Canada Free \nTrade Agreement was enacted by Congress, the Trade Ambassador, then \nTrade Ambassador Clayton Yeutter, said to Congress that the evidence of \ngood faith in this trade relationship is that there will not be an \nincrease in grain coming across our border following the enactment of \nthis trade agreement. Well, that was not worth the paper it was written \non. But that is the assurance he gave in writing to Congress. Of \ncourse, we have been flooded with Canadian grain ever since.\n\n  Here is what we ought to do. First, the United States ought to target \nCanadian foreign markets overseas. We ought to use our export \nenhancement funds in Venezuela, South Africa, West Africa, Tunisia, for \nexample, to replace Canada as a major wheat supplier to those markets. \nIf Canada is going to cause injury to our domestic marketplace for \nwheat, then it is time for us to go after their foreign markets and \nhave them pay a price for their behavior under this trade agreement.\n  Second, I think the administration ought to take immediate action to \nunilaterally stop Canadian wheat shipments from coming into this \ncountry. They said they would unilaterally enforce the tariff rate \nquota. Canada has already exceeded that tariff rate quota on spring \nwheat and other wheat, and will exceed it on Durum. The administration \nshould shut the border to additional wheat shipments coming into this \ncountry.\n  Third, the Canadian Wheat Ambassador is coming to this country, I \nbelieve, this week. I intend to seek a meeting with the Canadian Trade \nMinister, and ask some of my colleagues to participate in that. I am \nalso going to seek a meeting with the Trade Ambassador and deliver to \nhim personally my concern about what is happening with Canadian grain.\n  The fact is, grain prices are collapsing in this country. Family \nfarmers are struggling to make a living, and at the same time they are \nseeing their prices collapse and their income go down. The Canadian \ngrain is flooding across our border. It does not make any sense at all.\n  I will share one additional point with my colleagues. I went to our \nborder with Canada. I of course come from North Dakota, and we share a \nlong border with Canada. I went to the border in a little, orange, 12-\nyear-old truck with some Durum wheat in the back. We went to the border \nto take that Durum wheat into Canada. And all the way to the border we \nsaw 18-wheel trucks coming from Canada to the United States hauling \nCanadian grain--all the way to the border, truck after truck after \ntruck after truck, coming into the United States hauling Canadian \ngrain.\n  We got to the border in this little, orange, 12-year-old truck with a \nlittle Durum in the back. And guess what. You could not take one \ngrocery sack full of American Durum wheat into Canada, not one. Not \nonly couldn't you get this little, orange truck with Durum into Canada, \nyou could not take a grocery bag full of wheat into Canada. That trade \nrelationship is unfair, and it ought to be changed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/07/senate-section/article/S6876-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6876-S6877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRADE WITH CHINA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me turn to a second trade issue just \nvery briefly. That is the issue of trade with China. We are going to \nconfront, in the coming weeks, the issue of most-favored-nation trading \nstatus with China.\n  I was in Beijing a few months ago and met--along with Senator \nDaschle, the minority leader, and some others, Senator Kempthorne, \nSenator Glenn, and Senator Leahy--with the President of China. The \nPresident of China talked about the trade between the United States and \nChina, and said that they were enjoying this trade relationship. They \nshould. This trade relationship is too much now a one-way relationship \nbetween the United States and China. China now has a $40 billion trade \nsurplus with the United States, or, to put it another way, we have a \n$40 billion merchandise trade deficit with China. It is unforgivable \nthat kind of failure in trade should occur.\n  Now, let me talk just a little about that. I have put on the easel a \nchart that shows merchandise trade deficits. We have had a lot of talk \nin this Chamber about budget deficits and a lot of work to deal with \nbudget deficits. Nobody talks about trade deficits. We have the largest \nmerchandise trade deficit in American history right now. What does that \nmean? That translates into jobs leaving this country. That is what the \nmerchandise trade deficit means--a weaker manufacturing sector in \nAmerica and jobs moving overseas.\n  Now, the largest merchandise trade deficit in history occurs because \nwe have a significant merchandise trade deficit with a number of \ncountries, one of which is China. Here is what has happened in \nmerchandise trade deficits with China in recent years. Go back 10 years \nand what you will see is a massive increase in the merchandise trade \ndeficit with China, now nearly $40 billion. The growth in United States \nexports to China is not nearly as strong as the growth in imports from \nChina.\n  Now, people say if you read a newspaper about our trade with China, \nhere is the way they do it. It is like dancing the jig. They say, did \nyou know our exports from the United States to China are up triple? We \nhave tripled our exports. Yes, that is right here. It went from $3.6 \nbillion in 1980 to $11.9 billion in 1996. So we read that in the paper, \nand they do this all the time, we have tripled our exports from the \nUnited States to China. You think, gee, what a\n\n[[Page S6877]]\n\nterrific thing for our country. They do not tell you the other half of \nthe story. Imports from China are up 46 times--not triple, 46 times. \nThey went from $1 billion to $51 billion. So the people that give you \nonly half the story say, gee, we have tripled our exports to China, but \nthey don't tell you that the amount of imports from China are up 46 \ntimes.\n  Now, just a short trade quiz. To which countries did the United \nStates export more goods than it did to China in 1996? Did we import \nmore goods to Australia than we do to China? China has 1.2 billion \npeople. Did we export more to Australia than to China? What about \nBelgium? Did we export more to Belgium than China or Brazil or the \nNetherlands or Singapore? Did we export more to those countries than \nChina? To which of these countries did we export more than to China? \nThe answer is, all of them. We are a sponge for China, sending us all \nof their goods. Very close to half of all Chinese exports come to the \nUnited States of America.\n  What does China buy from us? Well, here is what they buy from us. In \nthe trade flow with China they buy cereal, textile fibers, fertilizers, \nand some aircraft. What do we buy from China? Electronics, heavy \nmachinery, toys and games, and footwear. This trade relationship is not \nfair, it does not make sense, and it weakens our country.\n  All of the debate here in Congress is about the most-favored-nation \nstatus and human rights. I was in China the day they sent Wang Dan to \nprison--I think for 9 years--sent him to prison because he criticized \nthe government. If you criticize this Government, is somebody going to \nsend you to prison? No, we have something called a Constitution. You \nare welcome to criticize this Government. It is part of what this \ncountry is about; the hallmark of freedom is free speech. In China, \nWang Dan found free speech might be free but only up to a limit. You \ncriticize your government, you spend years and years in prison.\n\n  So, human rights are important. Yes, we ought to be concerned about \nhuman rights with respect to China and with respect to most-favored-\nnation status. But even if the human rights issue were addressed and \neven if that issue were resolved, what about the abiding trade problem \nwith China with respect to the imbalance of trade, a $40 billion trade \ndeficit and growing? What about that? What about the other deficit, the \ntrade deficit?\n  This administration and this Congress needs to deal with the other \ndeficit, and that is part of this issue. I hope the journalists, \nnewspapers, and others would also start writing about this, carry some \nop-ed pieces about it. You cannot even get this information in an op-ed \npiece. They will not carry it.\n  What about the $40 billion trade deficit? Why ought not we as \nAmericans expect that if we buy all of these goods from China, they \nought to buy a massive quantity of American-manufactured goods as well? \nChina says it wants airplanes, needs airplanes. Guess what? Instead of \nsaying we will buy your airplanes manufactured in the United States, \nthey say we want American manufacturers to manufacture their airplanes \nin China. It makes no sense. That is not fair trade.\n  We will have a discussion this month about most-favored-nation status \nwith China, and yes, part of it should be about the issue of human \nrights. But part of it also needs to be about the abiding, growing and \ndangerous trade deficit that we now have with China and about \nreciprocal trade treatment that would require China to understand that \nwhen it sells into our marketplace, it must also then buy in the \nAmerican marketplace goods that China needs and uses.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan pertaining to the introduction of S. 989 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN.

The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, momentarily, when the draft of my amendment \narrives, I will send it to the desk. For the moment, I will simply \nmention that the amendment I am about to offer, I will offer on behalf \nof myself, Senator Bingaman, Senator Domenici, and Senator Levin.\n  Mr. President, I indicate that additional original cosponsors will be \nSenators Hagel, Jeffords, Chafee, Specter, D'Amato, Frist, Gorton, \nSnowe, Collins, Kennedy, Biden, Kerrey of Nebraska, Lieberman, Byrd, \nReed of Rhode Island, Daschle, and Robb.\n  I want to especially recognize Senator Domenici for his contribution \nto our work on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, let me state at the outset that Congress established, \nin 1991, with strong bipartisan support, what is known as the Nunn-\nLugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, the CTR.\n  Last year, the Senate, in a 96 to 0 vote, amended and enlarged this \nimportant program through the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici legislation entitled \nthe Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act.\n  The CTR program at the Department of Defense, along with its \ncompanion programs at the Department of Energy--namely, the Materials \nProtection Control and Accounting Program [MPC] and the International \nNuclear Safety Program--have played significant roles in our efforts to \nreduce the risk to the United States from loose nukes and the dangers \ninherent in the operations of Soviet-designed nuclear reactors.\n  Each of these programs plays a key role in enhancing stability around \nthe world and contributes to circumscribing the threats that emanate \nfrom weapons and materials of mass destruction.\n  The defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1998, as reported out \nof the Committee on Armed Services, cut the funding for the Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program and the Materials Protection, Control and \nAccounting Program and totally eliminated all funding for the \nInternational Nuclear Safety Program.\n  Our amendment is designed to restore the funding cuts in these three \nprograms.\n\n\n                      reduction in the ctr request\n\n  Mr. President, the Armed Services Committee has recommended a cut of \n$60 million in the President's request of $382.2 million for the fiscal \nyear 1998 for the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. The sponsors of \nthis amendment believe that this is a mistake.\n  The Nunn-Lugar program's impact on the threat posed by former Soviet \nweapons of mass destruction can be measured in the 81 ICBM's destroyed, \n125 ICBM silos eliminated, 20 bombers destroyed, 64 SLBM launchers \neliminated, 58 nuclear test tunnels sealed, and the 4,500 warheads \ntaken off strategic systems aimed at us--Mr. President, let me repeat \nthat, 4,500 former Soviet warheads which were pointed at the United \nStates have been removed by the Nunn-Lugar program--all at a\n\n[[Page S6878]]\n\ncost of less than one-third of 1 percent of the Department of Defense's \nannual budget. Without our Cooperation Threat Reduction Program, \nUkraine, Kazakstan, and Belarus would still have thousands of nuclear \nweapons. Instead, all three countries are nuclear-weapons-free.\n  Although the CTR Program has accomplished much, much work essential \nto U.S. national security interests remains to be done. This includes:\n  The elimination of ICBM's, SLBM's, and heavy bombers as required \nunder the START I Treaty, followed by START II and perhaps START III; \nincrease safety and security for the transport and storage of remaining \nRussian nuclear warheads; an end to production of weapons-grade \nplutonium; chemical weapons reduction; and other efforts to reduce \nweapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet Union and the threat \nof proliferation.\n  The President's fiscal year 1998 budget request of $382.2 million was \na bare-bones request based on a difficult prioritization of potential \nprojects.\n  Stated simply, Mr. President, there are tens of things which need to \nbe done, a long list prioritized and squeezed into the $382.2 million \nbare bones request. Many programs that the Congress supported in the \npast failed to make the list. Indeed, there are several key projects \nthat cannot be funded even at the $382.2 million level which would \naccelerate our strategic arms elimination programs in Russia and \nUkraine.\n\n  I am told that the committee reduction in the President's request was \nmotivated in part because:\n  Unobligated moneys remain for Belarus, which cannot be spent as long \nas that country has not been recertified for the CTR program; the \nGovernment of Japan has suggested it might purchase fissile material \ncontainers for a major CTR project at Mayak in Russia, thereby freeing \nup some CTR funds previously planned for that project; and finally, \nunobligated funds for the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs.\n\n  In fact, Mr. President, there are no extra funds available. There are \nno unobligated funds that have not been designated for specific \nprojects and specific countries.\n\n\n                        Belarus Decertification\n\n  The decision by the President not to recertify Belarus for the time \nbeing resulted in $37.2 million that cannot be obligated until Belarus \nis certified. The Department of Defense plans to use $15 million of \nthis sum to partially fund a classified project that has been briefed \nto Members and notified to the Congress. A copy of that notification is \navailable in S-407 for any Member to read. The remainder of the Belarus \nfunds are intended to remain in reserve to implement previously \nnotified projects in Belarus in the event that Belarus is recertified \nin fiscal year 1998.\n  Mr. President, I support the maintenance of these funds in a reserve \nto implement previously notified projects. Even though the SS-25's have \nleft Belarus for Russia, much remains to be done in the area of \nstrategic system infrastructure elimination. SS-25's are mobile; they \ncould be returned under certain circumstances. Thus, while Belarus is \ncurrently nuclear weapons free, much remains to be done to insure that \nit remains in that status.\n\n\n                      Japanese Container Purchase\n\n  The Japanese are negotiating with the United States manufacturer, \nWestinghouse, to purchase some fissile material storage containers for \na storage facility at Mayak, Russia. This project is a major component \nof the CTR program. While the Department of Defense is not yet certain \nhow many, if any, the Japanese will purchase, it could be that a \nJapanese purchase would decrease the DOD requirements for container \npurchases by as much as $15 million. Accordingly, the Department of \nDefense plans to use this $15 million to augment some of the funds from \nthe Belarus account for the classified project. The remaining fiscal \nyear 1997 container funding in the amount of $23.5 million are being \nnotified to Congress to enable purchase of containers to complete the \n50,000 container requirement.\n  In short, Mr. President, the Congress has been notified on a new, \nclassified nonproliferation project which will use all of the CTR funds \nno longer needed for fissile material container, and many of the \nobligated funds previously planned for Belarus in the event Belarus is \nnot recertified. This project is important and time-sensitive and \ndeserves our support.\n\n\n                         Unobligated CTR Funds\n\n  Mr. President, the issue of unobligated CTR funds is an annual one. \nInevitable delays in obligating funds in a given fiscal year result \nfrom the annual certification process, a very complicated process from \nthe beginning of the nonnuclear legislative efforts in 1991.\n  For example, the Department of Defense did not have authority to \nspend fiscal year 1997 CTR funds until April 1997, following completion \nof the certification process and notification to Congress of intent to \nobligate the fiscal year 1997 funds.\n  Mr. President, this means simply that well over half of the year was \nconsumed due to the legislative requirements of the certification \nprocess and the notification of intent to Congress.\n  Over the life of the CTR Program, DOD has notified to the Congress \nintent to obligate approximately $1.8 billion. Of this amount, $1.3 \nbillion has been obligated, and an additional $38.5 million soon will \nbe notified. Therefore, DOD has $513 million--not $700 million--in \ncurrently unobligated CTR funds.\n  For fiscal year 1997, DOD has so far obligated $208 million, with \nplans to obligate another $200 million by the end of the fiscal year. \nAs defined in the CTR Multi-year Program Plan reported to Congress \nearlier this month, the remaining $313 million in unobligated funds \nhave been committed to specific countries by signed agreement and are \nearmarked for specific CTR projects. For example, we have agreements \nand have earmarked funds for SS-18 ICBM elimination in Russia and SS-24 \nelimination in Ukraine.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that execution of these funds has \nbeen thoroughly planned, and agreements with recipient nations have \nbeen signed to allow this assistance for eliminating these strategic \nsystems to proceed per the DOD plan.\n\n\n        the material protection, control, and accounting program\n\n  Mr. President, let me turn to the second program for which we seek to \nrestore full funding through this amendment--this is, the Material \nProtection, Control, and Accounting Program.\n  Mr. President, most Members can appreciate the direct benefits to our \nsecurity from assisting in the elimination of strategic weapons systems \ntargeted on the United States. Perhaps more difficult to comprehend is \nthe threat posed by the potential leakage of weapons-grade nuclear \nmaterials.\n  The Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Program seeks to \nsecure hundreds of tons of weapons-usable nuclear materials in the \nformer Soviet Union and elsewhere which are inadequately secured and \nare at risk of falling into the hands of criminal elements, terrorist \norganizations and rogue states. In sort, this programs works to prevent \nthe theft or diversion of weapons-usable materials--plutonium and \nhighly enriched uranium.\n  The Department of Energy, in cooperation with Russia, the newly \nindependent states, and the Baltic States, has put in place equipment \nat 18 sites to safeguard plutonium and weapons-usable uranium, and \nagreements are in place to enhance safety and security at over 30 \nadditional sites, including research laboratories and storage sites. If \nthis program is reduced by the $25 million recommended by the \ncommittee, there would be delays of at least 2 years in securing these \nsites and an estimated increased cost of $70 million.\n  In short, Mr. President, after a slow start in the early 1990's, \nMPC improvements are now underway at over 50 sites in Russia, the new \nindependent states, and the Baltic States. Let me give some specific \nexamples: MPC upgrades at Obninsk and Kurchatov in Russia have \nradically improved security for several tons of weapons-usable \nmaterial; upgraded MPC systems for all weapons-usable nuclear \nmaterials in Latvia, Lithuania, Uzbekistan, Georgia, and Belarus are \ncomplete; nuclear material detectors have been installed at all \npedestrian pathways at the Siberian Chemical Combine (Tomsk-7) and the \nChelyabinsk-70 nuclear weapons design institute. These monitors provide \na major improvement to the security of many tons of weapons-usable \nnuclear material at these\n\n[[Page S6879]]\n\nsites; a national MPC training center has been established at \nObninsk, Russia, with support from DOE and the European Union; by the \nend of this month, more than 1,000 nuclear specialists from the former \nSoviet Union will have participated in MPC training courses and \ntechnical exchanges under the auspices of the program; work is underway \nto strengthen Russia's nuclear regulatory system; and MPC upgrades \nfor the Russian Navy, some 8 to 10 facilities in 1998, the icebreaker \nfleet, and for nuclear materials during transportation are underway at \nseveral sites.\n\n  Mr. President, it is noteworthy that the National Research Council \nrecently completed an independent external assessment of this MPC \nprogram, and the National Research Council concluded; and I quote:\n\n       U.S. commitment to the program should be sustained and \n     funding should be continued at least at the level of FY 1996 \n     (funding) for several more years, and increased if high-\n     impact opportunities arise.\n\n  In short, the Energy Department through this program has enhanced the \nsecurity surrounding hundreds of tons of nuclear weapons material, but \nthe vast majority of material remains poorly secured.\n  Mr. President, fiscal year 1998 is one of the peak-activity years for \nthe program, with work in progress at all large Russian nuclear sites \ncompromising many hundreds of tons of highly enriched uranium and \nplutonium. If we reduce the fiscal year 1998 budget by $25 million, it \nwould kill program momentum, a momentum based on years of negotiations, \nconfidence building, and windows of opportunity.\n  Mr. President, if we do not restore these program cuts, then I fear \nthat work that has already been done to secure U.S. security interests \nand establish project foundations would need to be done again at \nconsiderable financial, time, and political costs. These costs would be \nespecially great for the high-priority dismantlement and navy sites \nthat we are attempting to secure. For example, security of fresh highly \nenriched uranium naval fuels is at a crucial stage. It is the largest \nproject with the Russian Ministry of Defense--a key player in the \noverall nuclear-material security picture. It is crucial to maintain \nthe program momentum. Security upgrades at the first facility are \nunderway, and 6 to 12 additional facilities will be targeted in the \n1998-2002 timeframe.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that, in my judgment, the MPC \nProgram is one of the two most critical programs the U.S. Government \nconducts for ensuring the strategic national security of this country. \nIt ranks alongside the equally critical Stockpile Stewardship Program \nfor maintaining the credibility and reliability of the U.S. nuclear \ndeterrent.\n\n\n                  International Nuclear Safety Program\n\n  Last, Mr. President, our amendment seeks to restore funds to the \nInternational Nuclear Safety Program. The Department of Energy is \nworking with the international community to increase nuclear safety \nworldwide, particularly in those countries of Eastern and Central \nEurope and the former Soviet Union that operate Soviet-design nuclear \nreactors.\n  The program's focus is on projects that improve the operation, \nphysical condition, and safety culture at nuclear power plants; the \nestablishment of nuclear safety centers in the United States and \ncountries of the former Soviet Union; and technical leadership to \npromote sound management of nuclear materials and facilities.\n  Mr. President, by way of background, it should be noted that the 1986 \nChernobyl nuclear reactor disaster highlighted the dangers associated \nwith all operating Soviet-designed nuclear power reactors, particularly \nthose of the older, Chernobyl-type design. The safety of these reactors \nis very much in the interest of the United States. Another nuclear \naccident could well destabilize political and economic conditions in \nthe nascent democracies of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe \nand cost the United States vast sums in relief assistance.\n  This International Nuclear Safety initiative is designed to address, \nthrough cooperative and technical innovation, the serious global \nproblems in the interrelated fields of nuclear safety and \nnonproliferation. This activity involves engineers, manufacturers, and \nscientists from many countries, and upon the DOE expertise in nuclear \nmatters and our national laboratories to conduct this cooperation.\n  Thus far, Mr. President, the Department of Energy has implemented \nunder this program more than 150 plant-specific safety projects, \ninvolving 17 plant sites throughout the former Soviet Union and Eastern \nand Central Europe, eight design and scientific institutes, and 21 \nUnited States commercial companies. Already, under this program, a \nnumber of key activities have been completed, including:\n  Establishing nuclear safety training centers in Russia and Ukraine; \ntransferring United States-style emergency operating procedures to a \nmajor Russian plant; completing nuclear safety system improvements at \nthree Russian plants; and establishing the Ukraine International \nResearch Center on Nuclear Safety, Radioactive Waste, and Radioecology.\n  Mr. President, this last program activity is particularly important. \nThe objectives of the Ukraine Center, located near the Chernobyl plant, \ninclude: Providing support for safety improvements for all nuclear \npower plants in Ukraine; to providing a focal point for international \ncooperation in addressing the environmental, health and safety issues \ncreated by the Chernobyl accident; and reducing the socioeconomic \nimpacts of closing the Chernobyl plant.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Energy also implements the United \nStates program to assist Ukraine in shutting down the Chernobyl nuclear \npower plant, including measures for dealing with the deteriorating \nsarcophagus covering the damaged unit. These activities, however, are \nfunded through another program.\n  Mr. President, unless we restore the moneys to this program as this \namendment seeks to do, we will be unable to proceed with some priority \nactivities in 1998, that include:\n  Management and operational safety improvements at Soviet-designed \nnuclear power sites; engineering and technology upgrades at Soviet-\ndesigned nuclear power sites; additional detailed plant-specific safety \nassessments; assistance in the development of an independent nuclear \nregulator; and support for international nuclear safety data exchanges \nand cooperative research and development between the Russian \nInternational Nuclear Safety Center and the United States Center at \nArgonne National Laboratory in Idaho.\n  This program is part of a larger international effort designed to \nreduce the risks inherent in these Soviet-designed reactors in the near \nterm and to assist Russia and the newly independent states to implement \nself-sustaining nuclear safety programs and to achieve international \nnuclear reactor safety norms.\n  Mr. President, I cannot assure this body that if we fully restore the \nfunding for this program, another Chernobyl will never take place. But \nI can say that this program request is one of the best policy \ninstruments available to reduce the risk that the world will face \nanother Chernobyl-like disaster.\n  In summary, our proposed amendment would restore the cuts made by the \ncommittee to these programs: $60 million in the cooperative threat \nreduction programs; $25 million to the MPC Program; and $50 million \nto the International Nuclear Safety Program.\n  In my view, failure to restore these funds to these important \nprograms could have severe consequences. It could diminish our ability \nto further reduce the prospect that terrorist or rogue states would \nacquire weapons-grade material; it could diminish our ability to assist \nin the permanent removal of missiles, launchers, and other delivery \nvehicles from the former Soviet strategic arsenal; and it could \nhandcuff our ability, in cooperation with others, to improve operating \nsafety at high-risk nuclear reactor sites in the former Soviet Union \nand elsewhere, and thus dramatically reduce the risk of further \nChernobyls.\n  I am most hopeful that all of my colleagues will support this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the Grams \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S6880]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 658\n\n (Purpose: To increase (with offsets) the funding, and to improve the \n   authority, for cooperative threat reduction programs and related \n                     Department of Energy programs)\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair, I thank Members for \nallowing me to offer this important amendment at this time, and I \nreiterate my hopes that all colleagues will support this activity. I \npoint out the debate describes the substantial achievements of the \ncooperative threat reduction programs. The difficulty is always getting \nmoneys through the pipeline, but I believe the statement I have given \nis self-explanatory with regard to these major issues.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Indiana would \nrespond to this question before I make my own statement in strong \nsupport of his amendment, in gratitude for his amendment, and his \nleadership in this area. Did I understand the Senator said that he \nasked consent to lay his amendment aside?\n  Mr. LUGAR. No. May I respond to the distinguished Senator. I asked \nthe Grams amendment be laid aside and then, having gotten agreement by \nthe Chair, I sent my amendment to the desk and asked for unanimous \nconsent it be made in order, which the Chair granted.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. We are hopeful this amendment can be \naccepted, so I am glad this amendment would not be laid aside. Again, I \ncommend the Senator from Indiana for the extraordinary leadership that \nhe and Senator Nunn, when Senator Nunn was in this body, have shown in \nthis area which contributes so much to the security of this Nation.\n  One of the most cost-effective and successful defense programs that \nwe have to reduce threats to our country and to enhance our national \nsecurity is the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program that Senator Lugar \nand Senator Nunn started in 1991. This program at the Department of \nDefense, and its companion programs at the Department of Energy, have \nproduced important results in reducing the threat of proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical and biological \nweapons and their materials. I was disappointed that the bill before \nthe Senate, as it came before the Senate, does not authorize the \nfunding level requested by the administration for these important \nprograms, so I fully support the Lugar amendment.\n  In addition to commending Senator Lugar, I particularly want to \ncommend Senator Bingaman for his effort to restore these funds during \nthe Armed Services Committee markup process. Since 1991, these threat \nreduction programs helped three Newly Independent States, Ukraine, \nBelarus, and Kazakhstan, to completely rid themselves of some 6,000 \nnuclear weapons that they inherited from the former Soviet Union. The \nCTR programs have also permitted Russia to implement the START I treaty \nahead of schedule, helping eliminate over 800 Russian nuclear missiles \nand bombers. These are weapons that will never again threaten the \nUnited States.\n  The Department of Energy has worked to secure tons of nuclear weapons \nmaterials, primarily plutonium and highly enriched uranium, that were \nand to a significant extent still are under inadequate safeguards and \nvulnerable to theft or diversion. Keeping these dangerous materials out \nof the hands of would-be proliferators reduces the likelihood that \nnuclear weapons will threaten us. There is just no more important thing \nthat we can do for our Nation's security than to secure these nuclear \nmaterials and to eliminate these missiles.\n  The job, though, is only partly finished, and much more needs to be \ndone. That is why it was so disappointing that the committee bill \nreduced the budget request for these programs by $135 million, \nincluding a reduction of $60 million for the Department of Defense \ncooperative threat reduction programs; a reduction of $25 million for \nthe Department of Energy Materials Protection, Control and Accounting \nProgram; and a reduction of $50 million, which was the total amount \nrequested for the DOE International Nuclear Safety Program.\n  Given the great concern that the committee has appropriately \nexpressed for the danger of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons \nand materials and the committee's interest in taking steps to reduce \nthis danger, those reductions were surprising indeed. In my view we \nshould be considering what additional efforts we can take to reduce \nthese threats. While the threat from such proliferation is more likely \nand immediate than the threat from a ballistic missile attack on the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S6881]]\n\nStates, Congress has pushed to increase funding for national missile \ndefense while reducing funding for cooperative threat reduction. We are \nunderfunding the latter program at our clear peril.\n  There are numerous cooperative threat reduction programs that need to \nbe funded on an urgent basis. For example, Ukraine decided in mid-May \nto eliminate all of its SS-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles, a \ndecision which the United States encouraged and welcomed. We should \nhelp Ukraine eliminate these missiles so that they can never again be \nused.\n  Furthermore, there remain large quantities of nuclear materials that \nneed to be secured and accounted for. The list of unfunded cooperative \nthreat reduction and related DOE projects is long and it represents an \nurgent opportunity for the United States to take tangible and permanent \nsteps to reduce threats to our security. For a tiny fraction of the \ndefense budget we can accomplish extraordinary gains. The proliferation \nin nuclear safety problems remains considerably larger and more serious \nthan the response has been so far.\n\n  One of the allegations which was made which supported these cuts in \ncommittee was that there was $700 million in unobligated cooperative \nthreat reduction funds floating around, and thus it was argued that the \ncooperative threat reduction programs could absorb a $60 million cut. \nBut that is not the case. The cooperative threat reduction has $513 \nmillion in unobligated funds but of this, $200 million will be \nobligated by the end of the year and all of the remaining $313 million \nhas been committed to specific countries by signed agreements.\n  On another part of this program, which was the reduction in the DOE \nMaterials Protection, Control and Accounting Program, by the end of \nJune 1997, all of the fiscal year 1997 funds were obligated and sent to \nthe laboratories for implementation. The assumption that the 1998 \nfiscal year request can be reduced and offset with uncosted balances \nfrom fiscal year 1997 or fiscal year 1996 without programmatic impact \nis incorrect. The net result of a reduction of fiscal year 1998 funds \nwould be a reduction in the planned programmatic activities. There is a \ncritical need for this program. The materials protection, control and \naccounting programs have a clear and direct relationship to the \nnational security policy of reducing the amount of fissile material \navailable for threat or diversion.\n  So, I hope we can be fully up to the challenge of taking advantage of \nthis opportunity to eliminate some of the most serious threats to our \nsecurity. In order to take advantage of this opportunity, we must at \nleast fully fund these threat-reduction and safety programs at the \nrequested level. I hope in the future the administration and the \nCongress will agree to provide higher levels of funding for these \nprograms, which, again, are as important to our national security as \nany programs that I know. So, I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of \nthe Lugar amendment and I hope all of our colleagues will support this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, behind me are some charts that may help \nMembers understand the issues that we are discussing today. I cited, in \nmy opening statement, as did the distinguished Senator from Michigan, \nthe extraordinary work that has been done with cooperative threat \nreduction over the years. This chart makes it graphically clear--4,500 \nwarheads deactivated. The background of this situation was one that, at \nthe end of the Soviet Union, the time of the dissolution of the Soviet \nUnion, a number of military officers came to this country from Russia, \na number came from Ukraine and Belarus, Kazakhstan and other new \nstates--but the four that I cite originally were all nuclear states, \nand the questions they posed to the administration of our country and \nMembers of Congress who are interested in this, was strictly, we \nbelieve--they said, ``You have a vested interest in working with us to \ndeactivate warheads,'' and indeed we did. Mr. President, these 4,500 \nwarheads that have been deactivated were all aimed at us. That is the \nheart of the cooperative threat reduction programs--cooperation in \nreducing the threat to us, of warheads aimed at us.\n  Likewise, 99 ICBM's have been destroyed. They are no longer in the \npicture at all, in the process of working through, especially, the \nnonnuclear status for Ukraine, for Kazakhstan; 140 ICBM silos have been \neliminated, they are totally out of the picture, in cooperative threat \nreduction; 20 bombers have been destroyed, and so forth.\n  From time to time over the 6 years of the cooperative threat Nunn-\nLugar reduction program debates, Members come on this scene--perhaps \nnew to the entire argument--and ask why are we spending money in \nRussia? Why are we working with Russians on nuclear matters? Mr. \nPresident, we are working with Russians to destroy ICBM's, silos, \nwarheads that are aimed at us. In my judgment we ought to do as much of \nthis as we can. I would simply say the thought that some moneys might \nbe nibbled away from the program simply does not meet the security \nneeds of our country. Clearly, we ought to have a high-priority \nreactivation of all projects that will lead to our security in this \narea.\n  Mr. President, let me describe a process that has been discussed in \neach of the last 6 years. It is namely how do you get from the priority \nof what you want to do, to money that is available, obligated, and \nspent? The cooperative threat reduction programs each year have many \nchallenges to overcome before funds can be obligated. In my opening \nstatement I cited the fact it was April of this year before the funds \nthe Congress appropriated last October could get into action. Why? \nBecause, from the very beginning of the Nunn-Lugar CTR program, an \nextraordinary number of procedural challenges have been placed in the \nlegislation.\n  They were placed there by those who were, frankly, skeptical that \nmoney ought to be spent with the Russians for any purpose. But, in any \nevent, by April of this year, we finally had gone through all the hoops \nof that situation.\n  The program requires government-to-government agreement, negotiations \nthen with Russia, with Ukraine, with Kazakhstan, with Belarus, to \nestablish the legal framework for each of these transactions. Each of \nthe implementing agreements has to be negotiated for each project with \nthe ministry responsible in that country for the project.\n  Once the agreements are in place by country, by project, by ministry, \nthen a definition phase of the project can begin and that can be \nlengthy as the Department of Defense negotiates the details with the \nrecipient country.\n  Then a contracting process follows. The Department of Defense uses \nits standard Federal acquisition regulations for all CTR assistance, \nnormally contracting with United States firms to provide that \nassistance. That assistance mandates free and open competition and \nmaximum protection of taxpayer dollars, but it is lengthy, Mr. \nPresident, having gone through all the hoops of the implementing \narrangements and the requirement definitions, then the contracting \nprocess, identically the same as it is with the Department of Defense \nfor everything else in the world with U.S. firms, open competition. All \nof that must occur.\n  Finally, on an annual basis, DOD must certify the recipient nations \nare still eligible. We have heard now that Belarus is not, for a \nvariety of reasons, but may become eligible again as its politics and \nsituation may change. Our security problems, with regard to Belarus and \nthose weapons, have not changed, I might add. But once certification, \nagain, is complete, DOD must notify Congress in considerable detail as \nto how it intends to obligate the appropriated funds. After that \nnotification, and only after that notification, can new agreements of \namendments to the existing implementing agreements be negotiated, and \nonly then can DOD obligate the funds which begin the procurement cycle.\n  Mr. President, from time to time during this 6-year period of time, \nthis lengthy process of certification and notification and \nrenegotiation and bidding and notification of Congress has taken so \nlong that the whole fiscal year is complete, appropriations committees \nhave taken the moneys off the table, and we go back through the whole \nprocess of reappropriating what already had been appropriated.\n  I do not argue with the procedures. I simply say they are tediously \ncareful\n\n[[Page S6882]]\n\nto make sure that everybody has a very good idea of precisely what is \noccurring, how U.S. firms, in competition with each other, might deal \nwith it and with full notification of the Congress of all of this.\n  I reiterated this because I heard in the distinguished other body \ndebate during which it was blandly asserted that there is plenty of \nmoney in the pipeline. The argument in the other body no longer \ncentered around the validity of the program but simply said there is \nlots of money available, no need, really, to further appropriate any \nmore.\n  I am asserting there is no more money available, as a matter of fact, \nfor a long list of priority things our country should do for our own \nsecurity, and to nibble away and cut pieces here and there is not in \nour national interest, it is not good public policy, and that is why it \nis time to take time to simply reiterate, through the charts, that \ndollar for dollar, year for year the money is obligated, it is called \nfor, it is spoken for, it is competed for, and it is examined.\n  Mr. President, we ought to get on with the process so that there is \nno ambiguity if we want to continue to work with the Russians to \ndestroy ICBM's, take warheads off ICBM's, if we want to contain fissile \nmaterial that is dangerous, if we want to work with Chernobyl-type \nreactors so they don't explode, not only creating damage in the \ncountries in which the explosion occurs, but through the fallout damage \nthroughout the world.\n  This is grim and serious business. For these reasons, I really ask \nstrong support of our amendment. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly in support of \nthis amendment that Senator Lugar has offered and commend him for his \nleadership on this very important issue. Senator Lugar and Senator Nunn \nestablished this program, promoted this program, and have led the \nSenate in gaining support for this program over these last several \nyears. I see it as one of the few shining examples that we can point to \nto indicate that we are aware of the new reality, the new post-cold-war \nreality that we face with Russia and with other former Soviet Union \ncountries.\n  Let me briefly describe, as Senator Lugar has and Senator Levin has, \nwhat the amendment does. It would add or restore to the bill before us \namounts that were cut at the subcommittee level to get it back to the \nlevel of funding that the administration requested in three different \nareas. One is what is referred to as MPC funds--that stands for \nmaterials protection control and accounting funds--for the Department \nof Energy. The second is $50 million being restored for the \nInternational Nuclear Safety Program, again, in the Department of \nEnergy. And the third item is $60 million that is being restored in the \ncooperative threat reduction programs which are operated and \nadministered by the Department of Defense.\n\n  Mr. President, the legislative provisions that accompany this provide \ngreater flexibility in administering the CTR Program. They allow fiscal \nyear 1997 funds for international border security to be available for \nobligation for 3 years and allow the Customs Service to use fiscal year \n1997 funds that were provided to purchase new equipment to also be used \nto provide assistance to employees to allow that new equipment to be \nfully integrated into the operations of the Customs Service.\n  This amendment and the funds that these programs contain are intended \nto reduce the danger of so-called loose nukes, or nuclear weapons that \nmight fall into the hands of terrorists, might fall into the hands of \npeople not authorized to have those weapons; also, to help reduce the \ndanger that fissile material, material that is essential to making of \nnew nuclear weapons, not fall into those same hands. The funds are \nintended to help destroy ICBM silos and launchers in the former Soviet \nUnion and to generally help reduce the risk in the near term from the \noperation of Soviet-designed nuclear powerplants.\n  Mr. President, the arguments have been well laid out by Senator Lugar \nand Senator Levin, as well. This is a program that has accomplished a \ntremendous amount already in reducing the risk of nuclear weapons.\n  I had the good fortune earlier this year, about 2 months ago, to \ntravel to Russia and to visit some of the facilities that we are \nspending funds at to work on these cooperative programs with the \nRussians. I traveled there with Mr. Paul Robinson, who is head of \nSandia National Laboratory, and with others who work with him at Sandia \nNational Laboratory on these cooperative threat reduction programs and \nDepartment of Energy programs. I also traveled there with others from \nthe Department of Energy Los Alamos National Laboratory. The general \nimpression I received in visiting Chelyabinsk-70, which is one of the \nclosed cities that the Russians established in order to develop and \npromote their nuclear weapons activity, the general impression was that \nthese funds are being extremely well used and are, in fact, increasing \nthe security that surrounds fissile materials and other materials that \ncould be used in connection with nuclear weapons.\n  We met with Minister Mikhaylov who is head of the Ministry of Atomic \nEnergy, MINATOM, and, again, I was impressed with the willingness to \ncontinue the cooperation to work with our own Department of Energy in \nmaking progress on these programs.\n  We met with admirals from the Russian Navy. They have a very \nsignificant problem of fresh uranium that can be used as fuel in their \nnuclear reactors, how to secure that, how to protect it from possible \nseizure by terrorists. They clearly wanted our help. They are obtaining \nour help. They need substantially more help in the years ahead. I felt \ngood about the level of cooperation that is occurring there.\n  My general conclusion from the trip was the same as the one stated by \nSenator Lugar in his statement earlier, and that is that there is a \nlong list of useful projects that funds in these programs can be put \nto. We are not short of useful activities to work on. The contrary is \nthe case. There are a great many things that the Russians need to do to \nprotect and to reduce the risk of theft of nuclear materials. We are \njust now beginning to make serious progress on that. The funds that \nwill be restored by this amendment are essential to making that \nprogress. I very much believe that when you look at the entire U.S. \ndefense budget and say, which of the funds are the most cost-effective, \nwhere are we getting the most national security return for the dollars \nspent, the funds being spent in these programs are clearly very high on \nthat list.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I hope that we \ncan get a unanimous vote. This is a program that needs bipartisan \nsupport. This is not a program that should become the subject of \npartisan dispute in the U.S. Senate. It is too important to our safety \nand to our future and to the future of the world for us to find \nourselves in some kind of partisan dispute over funds like this or \nprograms like these.\n  Mr. President, in concluding, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nto me from the Secretary of Energy, Federico Pena, dated June 19, \nexpressing his strong support for this amendment be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1997.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, \n         Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: I am writing to offer my strong \n     support for an amendment that I understand will be offered in \n     the Senate to restore the Administration's budget request for \n     the Department of Energy's Materials Protection, Control and \n     Accounting and International Nuclear Safety programs. \n     Additionally, I support restoration of funds for the \n     Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction program. \n     These programs serve vital U.S. national security interests \n     and seek to forestall the far greater costs that could result \n     from inadequately secured nuclear material and weapons or a \n     nuclear accident like Chornobyl.\n       The Materials Protection Control and Accounting (MPC) \n     program is working to secure hundreds of tons of weapon-\n     usable nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union that are \n     inadequately secured and at risk of falling into the hands of \n     criminal elements, terrorist organizations and rogue nations. \n     If the program were reduced by $25 million as recommended by \n     the Committee, there will\n\n[[Page S6883]]\n\n     be a significant increase in total program costs and a delay \n     in achieving the program objectives by approximately two \n     years. Time and program momentum matter. Less than three \n     years ago, we secured kilograms of material at one site in \n     Russia. Today, the MPC program has secured tens of tons of \n     material at 25 sites, and is working at a total of 50 sites \n     where nuclear material is at risk in Russia, the Newly \n     Independent States, and the Baltics. However, unless funds \n     are restored to this program, the work that could secure \n     hundreds of tons of nuclear material at the largest defense-\n     related sites will be in jeopardy. I urge your support for \n     full funding to continue this vital work.\n       The International Nuclear Safety program is the best policy \n     instrument available to ensure that the world will not face \n     another Chornobyl-like disaster. It is vital to our overall \n     national security goal of helping to stabilize the former \n     Soviet Union. It supports the independence of Ukraine and \n     Lithuania and the emerging free market democracies of Central \n     and Eastern Europe. The focus is on projects that improve the \n     operation and physical condition of nuclear power plants in \n     the region. The program also enhances the nuclear safety \n     culture and regulatory infrastructure of countries with \n     Soviet designed reactors. Such reactors left behind by the \n     Soviet government continue to operate with deficiencies that, \n     if not corrected, could result in a serious nuclear accident \n     that would severely impact the region's political and \n     economic stability, the environment and our national \n     interests. Restoration of the $50 million program request is \n     essential to help prevent that from happening.\n       The Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program has been \n     essential to destroying and dismantling hundreds of ballistic \n     missile launchers, silos, heavy bombers and removal of \n     warheads from strategic systems. Without this program, \n     Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakstan might retain nuclear weapons, \n     instead of being nuclear weapons free. The CTR program also \n     supports implementation of an agreement between the U.S. and \n     Russia to ensure that production of weapons-grade plutonium \n     in Russia is stopped by converting the three plutonium \n     production reactors exclusively to a power-producing mode. I \n     support the complete restoration of funds to this vitally \n     important program.\n       In each of the three areas mentioned, the costs of \n     preventive are much less than the costs of inaction. I urge \n     you to uphold America's leadership, interests and commitments \n     by preserving and fully funding these essential programs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Federico Pena.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, 6 years ago, the Congress voted to take \nsome dramatic steps to reduce the threat of nuclear terrorism when it \napproved the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program--CTR. \nSince that time, as a result of work being done by CTR programs, over \n1,400 nuclear warheads that were aimed at the United States or our \nallies have been removed; 64 submarine ballistic missile launchers have \nbeen eliminated; 54 intercontinental ballistic missile silos, 61 SS-18 \nICBM's, and 23 strategic bombers have been eliminated. Today, Ukraine, \nBelarus, and Kazakhstan no longer have any nuclear weapons with which \nto threaten the United States or our allies.\n  Support for the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program has run high and \nenjoys bipartisan support. Last year in the Senate, in a 96-to-0 vote, \nwe enacted the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Defense Against Weapons of Mass \nDestruction. This program and its companion programs in the Department \nof Energy have repeatedly withstood attempts to undo the progress that \nhas been made in reducing the threat of nuclear terror. Legislators \nfrom both sides of the aisle are able to see the important benefits to \nthe United States, and to understand the need to move beyond cold war \nattitudes that prevent us from meeting today's national security needs \nto prevent nuclear terrorism.\n  This year, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted along partisan \nlines to cut $135 million from the CTR Program, the Materials \nProtection Control and Accounting Program, and the International \nNuclear Safety Program. The benefits gained from those programs are so \nimportant that I must appeal to my colleagues on the floor of the \nSenate to restore those funds so we can continue the valuable work \nbeing done to minimize the possibility that some person or some rogue \ncountry could threaten the United States or any other nation with \nnuclear weapons.\n  I've already mentioned some of the benefits gained through the CTR \nProgram. Much more work remains to be done to dismantle Russian missile \nlaunchers, silos, and aircraft. I urge my colleagues to continue to \nsupport this program which reduces the threat to the United States in \nsuch a direct manner. The $60 million cut by partisan vote in the \ncommittee should be restored in order to continue work that is \nessential to our national security interests.\n  The Materials Protection Control and Accounting--MPC in \nthe Department of Energy--DOE--is intended to prevent theft of \nsmuggling of nuclear materials that could be used in nuclear weapons or \nfor other forms of terrorism. DOE has put security equipment in place \nat 18 sites to safeguard those nuclear materials, and agreements are in \nplace to expand security procedures and equipment at 30 additional \nsites. I recently observed the work being done by this program first \nhand during a visit to Russia's nuclear research facilities. I felt \nrelieved to know that the Russians are now better able to control and \nmonitor their own nuclear materials than ever before. I am also aware, \nhowever, that the Russians have hundreds of nuclear sites needing \nadditional security measures to prevent theft and unauthorized use. A \ngreat deal of work needs to be done, and it is important that the \nCongress continue to fully fund the MPC Program in our own national \nsecurity interest. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to support our \namendment to restore $25 million to the MPC Program so that this \nvaluable work can continue without pause.\n  The committee also voted on partisan lines to cut all of the funding \nrequested for the International Nuclear Safety Program--INSP. This \nprogram began in the wake of international concerns over the damage \ndone by the Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster. The Russians continue \nto operate reactors that are similar in design to the one at Chernobyl, \nand that pose a similar risk of a catastrophic accident. The INSP \nProgram, managed by the Department of Energy, is designed to reduce \nthose risks for Russia's older reactors and to help Russia and Newly \nIndependent States to establish self-sustaining nuclear safety programs \nthat enable them to reach international nuclear reactor safety \nstandards. It is in our national and international interest to do what \nwe can to ensure that those reactors are safe. I urge my colleagues to \nvote to restore this important program.\n  As I suggested earlier, the Congress has repeatedly demonstrated its \nconviction that CTR, MPC, INSP, and related programs serve our \nnational security interests. To those who say these programs are a form \nof foreign aid to the Russians, I concur that ultimately the Russians \nmust assume full responsibility for these programs. Until they are \nfinancially and technologically capable of doing so, it is essential to \nour own interests that we assist them in putting effective security \nprograms into place. We know how expensive it is to support the \nstrategic offensive and defensive weapons systems designed to ensure \nour security against nuclear weapons. We also know how dangerous and \nvulnerable this country could be to nuclear terrorism which, in some \ncases, we may not be able to effectively protect ourselves from. For \nthose modest expenditures for CTR, MPC, and INSP, we buy ourselves a \nsignificant measure of security worth many times the funds invested. I \nurge my colleagues in the Senate to continue their bipartisan support \nfor these programs and vote to restore their funding.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a strong \nletter of support from the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, and \na strong letter of support from William Cohen, Secretary of Defense, \nfor our amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1997.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to urge you to support \n     restoration of the $135 million cut from the FY 98 Defense \n     Authorization Bill by the Senate Armed Services Committee for \n     three key arms control and nonproliferation initiatives: the \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, the Material Protection \n     Control and Accounting program and the International Nuclear \n     Safety program.\n\n[[Page S6884]]\n\n       Reducing threats to U.S. national security from the former \n     Soviet arsenal of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons \n     continues to be one of our highest security priorities. \n     Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakstan are today nuclear weapons-\n     free, largely through encouragement and direct assistance \n     from the DOD Cooperative Threat Reduction program. This \n     program has been essential to the destruction and/or \n     dismantlement of nuclear weapons.\n       The Department of Energy's Material Protection and \n     Accounting (MPC) program and its International Nuclear \n     Safety program are also providing essential assistance. The \n     MPC program is targeted at improving the security of \n     nuclear material at 40 facilities in the former Soviet Union. \n     Over time, this could prove just as productive as the initial \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction programs in eliminating nuclear \n     weapons. The International Nuclear Safety program, a \n     principal instrument of our efforts to improve the safety of \n     Soviet-era civilian nuclear power reactors, could head off \n     another Chernobyl in the New Independent States and the \n     countries of Eastern and Central Europe.\n       Congressional reductions in these programs risk eroding our \n     ability to come up with solutions to important security \n     problems and undermine the effectiveness of our initiatives \n     in this region. These programs are making a difference \n     against today's threats to the American people. I urge your \n     support in restoring these funds.\n           Sincerely,\n     Madeleine K. Albright.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1997.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Senate Armed Services Committee \n     (SASC) reduced by $60 million the President's budget request \n     for the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program during its \n     consideration of S. 450, the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 1998. This cut to CTR funding undermines \n     our ability to accomplish the program's important national \n     security goals for FY98, and will put at risk the objectives \n     for fiscal year 1999. I strongly urge the Senate to restore \n     the full CTR request.\n       The CTR program has been essential to the reduction of \n     hundreds of submarine-launched ballistic missile launchers, \n     intercontinental ballistic missile silos and heavy bombers in \n     the former Soviet Union, and to the removal of 4000 warheads \n     from strategic systems. Without CTR, Ukraine, Belarus and \n     Kazakstan might still have thousands of nuclear weapons; \n     instead, they are all nuclear-weapons-free. Although the CTR \n     program has accomplished much, essential work remains to be \n     done. This includes: the elimination of intercontinental \n     ballistic missiles and silos, submarine-launched ballistic \n     missile launchers and heavy bombers under START I, followed \n     by START II and III; increased safety and security for the \n     transport and storage of remaining Russian nuclear warheads; \n     an end to production of weapons-grade plutonium; chemical \n     weapons destruction; and other efforts to reduce weapons of \n     mass destruction in the former Soviet Union and the threat of \n     their proliferation.\n       Contrary to the SASC rationale for the cut, the loss to the \n     program cannot be made up with prior years' funds. All \n     unobligated CTR funds have already been earmarked for \n     specific projects. The FY98 budget request of $382.2 million \n     is a bare-bones request based on a difficult prioritization \n     of a long list of potential projects. Indeed, there are \n     several worthwhile projects, which would accelerate our \n     strategic arms elimination program sin Russia and Ukraine, \n     that we are not able to fund at even the $382.2 million \n     level. The CTR program is achieving demonstrable results with \n     a very tight budget.\n       Again, I strongly urge the Senate to support this important \n     national security program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bill Cohen.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 658, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment. On page 2 of the amendment, change line 12, which currently \nreads, ``$56 million'' to ``$40 million.'' I send that modification to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The modification follows:\n\n       On page 2 of the amendment change line 12, which currently \n     reads ``$56 million'' to ``40 million dollars''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Biden of Delaware, who is a \ncochairman of the Senate's NATO Observer Group, is necessarily absent \nto attend the NATO summit in Madrid. Senator Biden is an initial \ncosponsor of Senator Lugar's and my amendment, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that his statement of strong support for this amendment be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n Mr. BIDEN. The amendment of Senator Lugar and others will \ncorrect a situation that threatens the very security of the United \nStates. Unless recent efforts to cut the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program and similar programs of the Department of Energy are \noverturned, we and our children will all be in greater danger. I am \nproud to be an original cosponsor of this amendment and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The administration's request for the important Nunn-Lugar program is \nfor $382.2 million. Last week, the Armed Services Committee cut $60 \nmillion from that important program. At the same time, the House \nNational Security Committee cut $97.5 million from the Nunn-Lugar \naccount, and reportedly those cuts were from different parts of the \nprogram. Thus, over 40 percent of the Nunn-Lugar program is now at \nrisk.\n  The Armed Services Committee also cut $25 million from the Energy \nDepartment's program of international assistance in nuclear materials \nprotection, control and accountability, as well as all $50 million in \nits program of international nuclear safety assistance. The former \nprogram is vital to protecting the American people against the \ndiversion of nuclear material from former Soviet laboratories to \ncountries like Iran, Iraq or Libya that would like to build or buy \nnuclear weapons. It also helps keep nuclear material out of the hands \nof terrorists, who could use it to poison innocent people in Moscow or \nTokyo or Tel Aviv--or right here in Washington. Nuclear safety \nassistance helps guard against future Chernobyl incidents, which pose \nfallout dangers far beyond the borders of the former Soviet countries \nin which they might occur.\n  The Nunn-Lugar program makes significant contributions to the \nnational security of our country. Through this program, we have helped \nRussia to remove over 1,400 strategic nuclear warheads from deployment \nsites to storage areas, to await dismantlement. We have helped Russia \nto eliminate 64 SLBM launchers, 54 ICBM silo launchers, 61 SS-18 ICBM's \nand 23 strategic bombers. And we have helped Belarus, Kazakstan, and \nUkraine to eliminate their strategic nuclear forces and to repatriate \nall their nuclear warheads to Russia.\n  But the work of the Nunn-Lugar program is far from completed. Over \n400 Russian SLBM launchers remain to be eliminated. Nearly 100 ICBM \nsilo launchers must still be destroyed, along with over 190 SS-18 \nmissiles and another 7 strategic bombers. Over 130 tunnels must be \nclosed at a former nuclear test site in Kazakstan. Massive stocks of \nold, but still very dangerous, chemical weapons must be destroyed. And \nsecurity must be improved in Russian storage and transportation of \nnuclear material.\n  There are two basic ways to increase our national security. One is to \nmaintain the finest military and intelligence services in the world. We \ndo that, and I am very glad that we do.\n  But we do that at great expense, and at some risk. For none of us can \nguarantee that nuclear deterrence will work forever, especially in a \nRussia where troops and officers and nuclear scientists go for months \nwithout pay--Russia where, within the past year, generals and lab \ndirectors have closed the door to their offices and put bullets through \ntheir heads, out of despair over what has happened to their programs \nand their personnel.\n\n  The other basic way to increase our national security is to work with \npotential foes to reduce the threat that they pose to U.S. interests or \nU.S. forces. We do some of this through arms control agreements, but \noften we wonder whether other countries are obeying those agreements.\n  The Nunn-Lugar program is a way to make sure that Russia and other \nformer Soviet states actually do reduce their bloated strategic nuclear \nforces. It isn't free. The administration has asked for $382 million \nfor this program in fiscal year 1998.\n  But let's put that in perspective. The defense budget reported out by \nthe Armed Services Committee is $268 billion. So a fully-funded Nunn-\nLugar program would cost only one-seventh of 1 percent of the defense \nbudget. The Armed Services Committee added $2.6 billion to the \nadministration's request for defense spending. So the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram costs only 14 percent of the increase. And the Armed Services \nCommittee's cut in this program could be restored using only 2.3 \npercent of that increase.\n\n[[Page S6885]]\n\n  The Energy Department's program of international assistance in \nnuclear materials protection, control and accountability--known as \nMPC similarly vital to our national security. Just as the Nunn-\nLugar program helps the Russian military to improve its security for \nnuclear materials, the MPC program helps dozens of laboratories in \nthe former Soviet Union to improve their security for nuclear \nmaterials.\n  What are we talking about here? Often it's as simple as bars on the \nwindows, locks on the doors, and doors that will take more than a \ncrowbar to open. Just as often, however, the need is for completely \nrevised accountability schemes so that institutions with nuclear \nmaterials will always know where those materials are. That is a \ncomplicated task, and it requires a change in mind-set as much as \nchanges in forms or procedures.\n  DOD personnel who participate in Nunn-Lugar programs can relate to \nthe military officers who man Russia's strategic nuclear forces. But it \ntakes scientists to build peer relationships at former Soviet \nlaboratories and spread the word about nuclear control.\n  Just last month, a committee of the National Research Council [NRC]--\nan arm of the National Academy of Sciences--reported that the MPC \nprogram is beginning to have some real success. The NRC committee says: \n``progress attributable to the joint efforts of U.S. and Russian \nspecialists in MPC greatly accelerated in 1995 and 1996'' and calls \nthat ``a significant political and organizational achievement.''\n  At the same time, however, the NRC committee found that ``the task \nhas not been completed at any Russian facility and serious efforts are \nonly beginning at most facilities.'' The committee says that ``much \nremains to be done.'' Its principal recommendation on this program is \nas follows:\n\n       For the near term it is essential that the United States \n     sustain its involvement until counterpart institutions are in \n     a position to assume the full burden of upgrading and \n     maintaining MPC programs over the long term.\n\n  This program is just taking off. If you cut it back now, it may \ncrash. But if, instead, we sustain and encourage this program, we can \nhelp former Soviet scientists to turn around what remains, frankly, a \ntruly dangerous situation.\n  President Yeltsin can assure us, as he does, that Russia would never \ngive or sell a nuclear weapon to another state. But he cannot assure us \ntoday that the dozens of Russian laboratories with nuclear materials \nwill not let potential weapons material leak out to criminals, or to \nterrorists, or to rogue states that we know are willing to pay good \nmoney for the material and technology that would enable them to \nthreaten the peace of the world and of our country.\n  President Yeltsin cannot, by himself, turn this situation around. But \nwe can help him, and that is what the MPC program does.\n  I do not pretend to know what should be cut in the defense bill. But \nI do know that Nunn-Lugar and the similar Energy Department program are \nnot cash cows to be milked for other defense purposes.\n  Just as Senator J. William Fullbright will always be remembered for \nthe Fullbright fellowship program, so will Senators Sam Nunn and Dick \nLugar be remembered for the simple, brilliant idea that it's more \nhumane and a lot cheaper to pay for destroying Russian weapons than it \nis to fight against them. Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction \nprojects and the Energy Department's MPC and International Nuclear \nSafety assistance are vital programs. They are successful programs. And \nthey deserve our full support.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for Senator Lugar's amendment, which \nwill help make this a safer world for all of us.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I returned with six of my colleagues over \nthe weekend from a day in Bosnia. Majority Leader Lott and five of our \nother colleagues spent the Fourth of July early in the morning until \nlate at night with our troops and officials in Bosnia.\n  I think it is appropriate that as we debate the fiscal year 1998 \ndefense authorization bill we reflect just for a moment on the men and \nwomen on the ground in Bosnia and the men and women who secure our \nliberties around the world.\n  Much of the debate, much of the policy reflect numbers, reflect \ngeneral overall direction. Increasingly, that policy direction is \ndebated, and should be. But we tend to forget the humanness, the very \nmen and women of what our Armed Forces are all about.\n  As my colleagues and I, on the Fourth of July in Bosnia, spent a \ngreat deal of time with the 8,500 American men and women who are part \nof that large contingent in Bosnia, I could not help but reflect on \nwhat an outstanding job these men and women do for this country, for \npeace, stability around the world.\n  I want to add the human dynamic to this debate today, and that will \ngo into tomorrow, on the DOD authorization bill. Because, after all, it \nis the men and women who are on the ground who are there every day and \nevery night who secure those liberties, for not only this country but \nfor the people in the area of Bosnia.\n  I tend to think also, when I was an infantryman in Vietnam in 1968, \nour policy in Vietnam might have been better served, Mr. President, if \nthe Secretary of Defense and more Members of the House and the Senate \nhad come to Vietnam, had spent time with the troops, listening to what \nthey think, listening to their issues and concerns and qualifications, \nand not unlike wars and peacekeeping missions throughout our history it \nstill is the man and the woman on the ground that we count on to secure \nthose liberties.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Inhofe, \nI propose an amendment that would suspend all burial entitlements in \nArlington National Cemetery or any other cemetery administered by the \nSecretary of a military department to any person convicted of a Federal \ncapital offense.\n  On Wednesday, June 18, the Senate passed S-923, denying veterans \nbenefits in Federal capital cases, by a vote of 98 to 0. This \nlegislation was introduced by Senator Specter, chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, and was intended to preclude persons \nconvicted of a capital Federal offense, entitlement to veterans \nbenefits, including burial in a national cemetery.\n  Mr. President, Arlington National Cemetery, the Soldiers and Airmen's \nHome Cemetery in Washington, DC and various cemeteries on military \ninstallations around the country are administered by the armed services \nand, as such, are not affected by the change to title 38, United States \nCode. The amendment that I propose today will deny any person convicted \nof a Federal capital offense the entitlement to burial in Arlington \nNational Cemetery, the Soldiers and Airmen's Home Cemetery, or any \nother cemetery administered by the Secretary of a military department.\n  This amendment complements the bill introduced by Senator Specter and \npassed by the Senate this past Wednesday, and completes what I believe \nwas the intent of the Senate in that vote.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we support the amendment. It has been \ncleared on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ADDITION TO END STRENGTHS FOR MILITARY TECHNICIANS.\n\n       (a) Air National Guard.--In addition to the number of \n     military technicians for the Air National Guard of the United \n     States as of the last day of fiscal year 1998 for which funds \n     are authorized to be appropriated in this Act, 100 military \n     technicians are authorized for fiscal year 1998 for five Air \n     National Guard C-130 aircraft units.\n       (b) Air Force Reserve.--In addition to the number of \n     military technicians for the Air Force Reserve as of the last \n     day of fiscal year 1998 for which funds are authorized to be \n     appropriated in this Act, 21 military technicians are \n     authorized for fiscal year 1998 for three Air Force Reserve \n     C-130 aircraft units.\n       On page 108, line 11, reduce the amount by $20,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the amendment which I am offering enables \nAir National Guard units in West Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, \nKentucky, and California to maintain their full complement of 12 C-\n130's. Without $13 million in operations and maintenance funds and $4 \nmillion in personnel funds, these units would be forced, prematurely \nand perhaps unwisely, to reduce their airlift capacity to 8 aircraft \nper unit.\n  The President's Budget for Fiscal Year 1998 reduces the Air National \nGuard inventory of C-130's in these five\n\n[[Page S6887]]\n\nstates from 12 aircraft per unit to 8 aircraft in accordance with \nearlier Air Force program decisions. However, it makes no sense to \nreduce the C-130 units until the completion of the Quadrennial Defense \nReview [QDR] process by the Department of Defense. The purpose of the \nQDR is to reassess the U.S. defense strategy, force structure, \nreadiness, modernization and infrastructure. Why not have the benefit \nof that reassessment before we make such decisions?\n  The Air National Guard C-130 units are major players in the air \nmobility plan of the United States Air Force. It is my belief that a \nreduction of the type proposed in the budget is premature, without the \nfinal conclusions of the QDR process. More and more reliance is being \nplaced upon our reserve component forces as the active duty military \nestablishment downsizes. It is not prudent to reduce the aircraft and \nmanpower levels of the very organization that is expected to respond to \nglobal crisis situations, while supporting numerous U.S. Air Force \nmobility missions in Bosnia, Southwest Asia, Central America and \nthroughout the United States. Consequently, the amendment I am offering \nwill restore the force structure, personnel, and funds necessary to \ncontinue to operate these units at 12 aircraft.\n  Mr. President, the view I have expressed is supported by General \nRonald Fogleman, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, who wrote to the \ndistinguished Minority Whip, Mr. Ford, on May 21, 1997, as follows:\n\n       The QDR report released on May 19 clearly conveys a greater \n     reliance by the Total Air Force on the reserve components. \n     Given the concerns you have raised and our focus on reserve \n     components during the QDR, it is clear that the C-130 force \n     structure requires greater scrutiny before any reductions are \n     made. Therefore, I have rescinded plans to restructure ANG C-\n     130 units in Kentucky, West Virginia, California, North \n     Carolina or Tennessee. These units will remain at the current \n     force structure level of 12 PAA. As a result, I would greatly \n     appreciate your support in maintaining these levels.\n\n  Mr. President, in a similar vein, with regard to the Air Force \nReserve, the President's Budget for Fiscal Year 1998 proposes to reduce \nC-130 units in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Colorado from 12 aircraft \nto 8 aircraft. In order to maintain these units at their full \ncomplement of 12 aircraft, an amount of $6.8 million is required in \noperations and maintenance funds and $1.4 million in personnel funds.\n  In summary, the amendment I am offering would assure that Air \nNational Guard units in West Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, \nKentucky and California, and Air Force Reserve units in Pennsylvania, \nWisconsin, and Colorado are able to continue to maintain their full \ncomplement of 12 C-130 aircraft as recommended by the Chief of Staff of \nthe United States Air Force.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared. I urge \nthe Senate to adopt the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 721) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 722\n\n (Purpose: To modify authority for the conveyance of certain lands at \n                      Rocky Mountain Arsenal, CO)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, I am here today to offer an amendment that \nwould continue the development and transformation of the Rocky Mountain \nArsenal to the Rocky Mountain Arsenal Wildlife Refuge. This has been an \nongoing cooperative effort between the Department of the Army, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Shell \nOil Co., and local, State, and Federal elected officials.\n  The Rocky Mountain Arsenal contains 17,000 acres northwest of Denver, \nCO, that was purchased by the Army in 1942 to manufacture chemical \nweapons. The Army leased the property after World War II to various \nchemical manufacturers through 1982. Needless to say, this had an \nincredible environmental impact. However, through all of this \nenvironmental abuse wildlife flourished. In fact, in 1986 a winter \ncommunal roost of bald eagles was discovered on site, an incredible \noccurrence considering the circumstances.\n  Because of its protected status, the arsenal became a haven for close \nto 300 wildlife species including deer, coyotes, owls, and eagles. \nEfforts were undertaken to preserve the wildlife habitat. These efforts \nwere rewarded in 1992 when Congress passed the Rocky Mountain Arsenal \nNational Wildlife Refuge Act, legislation that I supported as a Member \nof the other body.\n  Today, cleanup efforts are still underway, but great progress has \nbeen made. Groundwater treatment facilities are in place, 350 abandoned \nwells have been closed, and soil remediation is in progress. This has \nallowed portions of the arsenal to be opened to the public for wildlife \nviewing. This amendment allows the public the opportunity for greater \naccess to the refuge.\n  The exact purpose of this amendment is to clarify existing law to \nfacilitate the transfer of property at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal to \nCommerce City, CO, in a negotiated sale at fair market value. The city \nwill hold this land, develop it in accordance with plans made in \nconnection with the Fish and Wildlife Service and other governmental \nentities, and ultimately sell some of this land, making proceeds \navailable for the continuing development of the Rocky Mountain Wildlife \nRefuge visitor center.\n  The Government Services Administration objected to the original \nlanguage in Public Law 102-402. We have worked with GSA in formulating \nlegislative language that meets the requirements of GSA as well as my \nintent and the intent of Commerce City.\n  I am always pleased when the Federal Government can work with local \ngovernments to provide a public benefit at no cost to the taxpayer. \nThis is one such case.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Chairman Thurmond for his assistance \nand leadership on this amendment, and appreciate the hard work and \ndiligence of his staff.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment has been cleared on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 722) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. EYE SAFETY AT SMALL ARMS FIRING RANGES.\n\n       (a) Actions Required.--The Secretary of the Defense shall--\n       (1) conduct a study of eye safety at small arms firing \n     ranges of the Armed Forces; and\n       (2) develop for the use of the Armed Forces a protocol for \n     reporting eye injuries incurred in small arms firing \n     activities at the ranges.\n       (b) Agency Tasking.--The Secretary may delegate authority \n     to carry out the responsibilities set forth in subsection (a) \n     to the United States Army Center for Health Promotion and \n     Preventive Medicine or any other element of the Department of \n     Defense that the Secretary considers well qualified to carry \n     out those responsibilities.\n       (c) Content of Study.--The study shall include the \n     following:\n       (1) An evaluation of the existing policies, procedures, and \n     practices of the Armed Forces regarding medical surveillance \n     of eye injuries resulting from weapons fire at the small arms \n     ranges.\n       (2) An examination of the existing policies, procedures, \n     and practices of the Armed Forces regarding reporting on \n     vision safety issues resulting from weapons fire at the small \n     arms ranges.\n       (3) Determination of rates of eye injuries, and trends in \n     eye injuries, resulting from weapons fire at the small arms \n     ranges.\n       (4) An evaluation of the costs and benefits of a \n     requirement for use of eye protection devices by all \n     personnel firing small arms at the ranges.\n       (d) Report.--The Secretary shall submit a report on the \n     activities required under this section to the Committees on \n     Armed Services and on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the \n     Committees on National Security and on Veterans' Affairs of \n     the House of Representatives. The report shall include--\n       (1) the findings resulting from the study required under \n     paragraph (1) of subsection (a); and\n       (2) the protocol developed under paragraph (2) of such \n     subsection.\n       (e) Schedule.--(1) The Secretary shall ensure that the \n     study is commenced not later than October 1, 1997, and is \n     completed within six months after it is commenced.\n       (2) The Secretary shall submit the report required under \n     subsection (d) not later than 30 days after the completion of \n     the study.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I have an especially strong interest in preventing \nunnecessary injuries and illness among the men and women who serve in \nour Nation's military forces. The risks that these brave men and women \nface in combat are reduced through superior equipment and excellent \ntraining, but some risks remain unavoidable. As we continue to learn \nfrom the lessons of the gulf war, 6 years after the battle, the \ncomplete risks of military service are still not known. Thus, it is \nsimple common sense to ensure that we do all we can to prevent those \nrisks outside of combat that are foreseeable. One such foreseeable and \npreventable risk is eye injury on military firing ranges.\n  I thus propose an amendment to the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill, the military eye injury assessment amendment. This \namendment would address a military public health and prevention issue \nthat was brought to my attention by a retired Air Force optometrist, \nDr. John Meinhold. Dr. Meinhold was concerned about the rate of eye \ninjuries that occurred in the Armed Services, particularly at military \nfiring ranges. Unlike other public and private firing ranges throughout \nthe country, military firing ranges do not require the mandatory use of \nsafety eyewear to prevent eye injuries. Most, if not all, eye injuries \nat firing ranges could be completely prevented with a very inexpensive \nand low technology intervention, safety eyewear.\n  The requirement for protective eyewear at public and private firing \nranges is a liability issue, rather than one controlled by State or \nFederal regulations. However, there is no threat of liability for the \narmed services because of the so-called Feres doctrine, which is based \non a Supreme Court decision that ruled that service members generally \ncannot sue the Government for injuries occurred during service. These \nunnecessary eye injuries potentially affect military readiness, and in \ncases of severe injury, a soldier's military career may be suddenly \nended. The lifetime costs of a single catastrophic eye injury has been \nestimated to be $1 million per eye by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, \nbut the human costs are immeasurable.\n  A study by the Army found that eye injury data are not always tracked \nat the local level, and minor eye injuries may not always be reported \nto safety offices. It is estimated that while 90 percent of all eye \ninjuries are preventable, the incidence of wartime eye injuries has \nincreased steadily over the last 20 years.\n  Given these statistics and the human costs of such injuries, I wrote \nthe Department of Defense earlier this year to ask about this important \nsafety issue. After a series of letters and inquiries, the official \nresponse I received was that no further action was needed to prevent \neye injuries since DOD officials had determined that the risk was too \nlow to warrant spending funds on prevention. In reviewing the \nDepartment of Defense's very own statistics and studies, and in talking \nwith their health professionals, I cannot come to the same conclusion.\n  Any preventable injury that puts our service men and women at risk is \nsufficient for our concern, especially when it is one which is as \neasily prevented as this one. Even one service member who suffers from \na permanent eye injury at a firing range is one too many when that \ninjury could have been avoided. I am proposing that we simply assess \nwhether our military firing ranges should be brought up to the same \nsafety standard that all other firing ranges in our country must meet.\n  My amendment would require the Secretary of Defense to provide \nfunding for a 6-month study of eye safety at military firing ranges. \nThis study would evaluate the current medical surveillance of eye \ninjuries at small arms firing ranges across the service branches, and \nexamine current safety reporting practices and other analyses as \nnecessary to establish military eye injury rates and trends. It would \nalso develop a uniform protocol for reporting eye injuries across the \nservice branches. The results would be reported to the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee upon \ncompletion of the study.\n  I am proud to offer this amendment to protect the safety of the \nmembers of our armed services, and I encourage my colleagues to join me \nin this effort. I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member \nof the Armed Services Committee for their support and their fine staff \nfor helping to perfect this amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 723) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Retirement for years of service: regular officers in grades \n              above brigadier general and rear admiral (lower half).''.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I propose an amendment that would \nincrease the number of years of active commissioned service provided \nfor mandatory retirement of generals and admirals serving in grades of \nlieutenant general or vice admiral and general or admiral.\n  The committee has noted over the past several years that the military \nservices are moving senior officers through critical command and staff \npositions very quickly. One reason that these senior officers move so \nfrequently is that there are only a few years in which a three-or four-\nstar general or admiral can serve before reaching the mandatory \nretirement point of 35 years of service. This amendment raises the \nmandatory retirement point for three stars from 35 years to 38 years of \nservice and the mandatory retirement point for four-star officers from \n35 years to 40 years of service.\n  This amendment does not increase the number of general or flag \nofficers. Nor does it require that three- and four-star officers serve \nto the mandatory retirement point. The services still have the officer \nmanagement tools currently in effect which permit the service Chief and \nthe service Secretary to manage their officer force in the best \ninterests of their service.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment has been cleared on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 725) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

On behalf of Senator Shelby, I offer an amendment which \nwould convey 5 acres of land to Hale County, AL. The property was \noriginally donated to the Federal Government for the construction of an \nArmy Reserve Center which, due to a change in priority, was canceled.\n  I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other side. I urge \nthe Senate to adopt it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond], for Mr. \n     Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered 726.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title XXVIII, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 2819. LAND CONVEYANCE, ARMY RESERVE CENTER, GREENSBORO, \n                   ALABAMA.\n\n       (a) Conveyance Authorized.--The Secretary of the Army may \n     convey, without consideration, to Hale County, Alabama, all \n     right, title, and interest of the United States in and to a \n     parcel of real property consisting of approximately 5.17 \n     acres and located at the Army Reserve Center, Greensboro, \n     Alabama, that was conveyed by Hale County, Alabama, to the \n     United States by warranty deed dated September 12, 1988.\n       (b) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal \n     description of the property conveyed under subsection (a) \n     shall be as described in the deed referred to in that \n     subsection.\n       (c) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the conveyance under this section as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Shelby's \namendment. The amendment would return property that Hale County, \nAlabama donated in 1988 to the Federal Government for the purpose of \nconstructing an Army Reserve center. Now the Army, due to changes in \npriority, cannot construct on the site until after fiscal year 2000.\n  Since the community donated the property with expectations of a \nReserve center and the Army has not lived up to these expectations, I \nbelieve that returning the property using this special legislation is \nappropriate.

NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has fought in many wars, and \n     thousands of Americans who served in those wars were captured \n     by the enemy or listed as missing in action.\n       (2) Many of these Americans are still missing and \n     unaccounted for, and the uncertainty surrounding their fates \n     has caused their families to suffer tragic and continuing \n     hardships.\n       (3) As a symbol of the Nation's concern and commitment to \n     accounting as fully as possible for all Americans still held \n     prisoner, missing, or unaccounted for by reason of their \n     service in the Armed Forces and to honor the Americans who in \n     future wars may be captured or listed as missing or \n     unaccounted for, Congress has officially recognized the \n     National League of Families POW/MIA flag.\n       (4) The American people observe and honor with appropriate \n     ceremony and activity the third Friday of September each year \n     as National POW/MIA Recognition Day.\n       (b) Display of POW/MIA Flag.--The POW/MIA flag shall be \n     displayed on Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day, \n     Independence Day, Veterans Day, National POW/MIA Recognition \n     Day, and on the last business day before each of the \n     preceding holidays, on the grounds or in the public lobbies \n     of--\n       (1) the Capitol;\n       (2) major military installations (as designated by the \n     Secretary of Defense);\n       (3) Federal national cemeteries;\n       (4) the national Korean War Veterans Memorial;\n       (5) the national Vietnam Veterans Memorial;\n       (6) the White House;\n       (7) the official office of the--\n       (A) Secretary of State;\n       (B) Secretary of Defense;\n       (C) Secretary of Veterans Affairs; and\n       (D) Director of the Selective Service System; and\n       (8) United States Postal Service post offices.\n       (c) POW/MIA Flag Defined.--In this section, the term ``POW/\n     MIA flag'' means the National League of Families POW/MIA flag \n     recognized and designated by section 2 of Public Law 101-355 \n     (104 Stat. 416).\n       (d) Regulations.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the agency or department responsible \n     for a location listed in subsection (b) shall prescribe any \n     regulation necessary to carry out this section.\n       (e) Repeal of Provision Relating to Display of POW/MIA \n     Flag.--Section 1084 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 (36 U.S.C. 189 note, Public \n     Law 102-190) is repealed.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment is cleared on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The question is on agreeing \nto the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 727) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I take this opportunity to thank the \ndistinguished managers of S. 936, the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill, for incorporating my amendment to authorize the \nflying of the POW/MIA flag over certain Federal facilities and post \noffices.\n  This amendment contains the text of S. 528, the bill I introduced on \nApril 9, 1997. I am pleased that 23 of our colleagues joined in \ncosponsoring S. 528. These cosponsors include Senators Conrad, Cleland, \nKempthorne, Warner, Collins, Moseley-Braun, Torricelli, Faircloth, \nD'Amato, Stevens, Hutchinson, Smith, DeWine, Lott, McConnell, \nMurkowski, Gregg, Lautenberg, Allard, Shelby, Craig, Grams, and \nAshcroft.\n  This amendment would authorize the POW/MIA flag to be displayed over \nmilitary installations and memorials around the Nation and at other \nappropriate places of significance on Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, \nFlag Day, Independence Day, Veterans Day, National POW/MIA Recognition \nDay, and on the last business day before each of the preceding \nholidays. A similar amendment was included in the House of \nRepresentatives Defense authorization bill.\n  Congress has officially recognized the National League of Families \nPOW/MIA flag. Displaying this flag would be a powerful symbol to all \nAmericans that we have not forgotten--and will not forget.\n  As you know, the United States has fought in many wars and thousands \nof Americans who served in those wars were captured by enemy or listed \nmissing in action. In 20th century wars alone, more than 147,000 \nAmericans were captured and became prisoners of war; of that number \nmore than 15,000 died while in captivity. When we add to this number, \nthose who are still missing in action, we realize that more can be done \nto honor their commitment to duty, honor, and country.\n  The display of the POW/MIA flag would be a forceful reminder that we \ncare not only for them, but for their families who personally carry \nwith them the burden of sacrifice. We want them to know that they do \nnot stand alone, that we stand with them and beside them, as they \nremember the loyalty and devotion of those who served.\n  As a veteran who served in Korea, I personally know that the \nremembrance of another's sacrifice in battle is one of the highest and \nmost noble acts we can do. Let us now demonstrate our indebtedness and \ngratitude for those who served that we might live in freedom.\n  I thank the managers of the DOD authorization bill for their \nassistance with this amendment and urge its immediate adoption.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 728\n\n  (Purpose: To provide a Federal charter for the Air Force Sergeants \n                              Association)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 728) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 658\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Is the pending \nbusiness the Lugar amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the pending matter.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am a cosponsor and I intend to speak on that. Are \nthere any limitations?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are none.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. I hope that doesn't give me a \nlicense to speak too long, but I will do my best.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I'm cosponsoring today is vital to \ncontinuing the progress of our Nation's programs focused on reducing \nthe threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Our \ncolleagues Senators Nunn and Lugar initiated the Cooperative Threat \nReduction program in 1991, and I was proud to join with them in the \nNunn-Lugar-Domenici Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act \nlast year. Your votes by a 96-to-0 margin last year showed the concern \nthat all of you shared with me that proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction is a very real threat to the security of the Nation and one \nof the greatest destabilizing forces that could be unleashed on this \nPlanet.\n  In setting up the original Nunn-Lugar program and in passing the \nDefense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act, the Congress agreed \nthat our Nation's national security interests are best served by \npreventing the proliferation of any of the former Soviet weapons, \ncomponents, materials, technologies, or technologists. Congress labeled \nthe Nunn-Lugar programs as cooperative threat reduction and that phrase \nwas chosen very deliberately. The programs are indeed cooperative--they \ninvolve our establishment cooperating with their establishment, and the \nprograms involve threat reduction--reducing the threat to our Nation.\n  Senator Nunn presents a series of powerful arguments on these \nprograms in a foreword he recently authored for the book ``Dismantling \nthe Cold War.'' He discusses the transition over the last few years \nfrom a world characterized by a high risk of nuclear conflict but also \nhigh stability, thanks to the sharply bilateral nature of that world \nand the fear of using any nuclear weapons. Now we have a period of low \nrisk of massive global nuclear conflict, but also very low stability \nbecause of intensification of a wide range of real and potential \nconflicts around the globe. He notes that the current key question ``is \nwhether the U.S. and Russia, now as partners and as friends, can keep \nthe world safe from weapons of mass destruction as we reduce our \narsenals.'' He argues convincingly\n\n[[Page S6892]]\n\nagainst using the Nunn-Lugar program as a form of bribery to encourage \nRussia to undertake specific actions, simply because these programs are \nso strongly in our own best interest. In his view, ``proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction clearly is the number one national security \nchallenge we face.''\n  When we passed the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act, \nwe required the President to develop an integrated administration plan \nfor defending Americans against weapons of mass destruction. The \nPresident's budget submission for fiscal year 1998 should have been \ncoordinated with his plan. But we haven't seen that plan to date--and \nthe country needs it. I'm very concerned with the lack of coordination \nin national activities against weapons of mass destruction that this \nplan would enable and I call upon the administration to develop and \nrelease that plan. Further, I encourage that the final House-Senate \nconference report reiterate the concern from Congress that this plan \nneeds to be a high priority item for the administration. But whether or \nnot the administration fulfills this requirement, I believe that \nCongress needs to show its national leadership by fully funding the \ncooperative threat reduction efforts. With full funding, Congress can \nagain emphasize, just as we did last year, that we treat the issue of \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction very very seriously.\n  John Deutch visited with a group of Senators just a few weeks ago to \ndiscuss his concerns with proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \nHe and his colleagues argued very persuasively for increasing the funds \nfor defending our Nation against this threat above the administration's \nrequest. He argued that if the 105th Congress does not continue to \nstrengthen U.S. capabilities to prevent and respond to the full range \nof nuclear-biological-chemical terrorist attacks, the country will \nremain unacceptably vulnerable to mass destruction terrorism. He stated \nthat ``the theat of terrorist attack with weapons of mass destruction \ndelivered by unconventional means is an even clearer and more present \ndanger to American lives and liberty than the threat of attack by \nballistic missiles.'' He also took strong issue with the current \nadministration's lack of coordination of efforts to defend against \nweapons of mass destruction, and recommended that Congress take the \nlead in directing the administration to improve the coordination \nefforts. As I've already noted, this absence of a coordinating plan \nfrom the administration is serious and Congress must continue to \ndemonstrate its leadership in this area by reiterating the national \nneed for this plan.\n\n  The United States is safer today thanks to the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici \nand Nunn-Lugar initiatives. This amendment will continue our progress \nto reduce the risk from ``loose nukes'' or aging reactors of Soviet \ndesign. Through the Cooperative threat reduction programs, there are \nover 1,400 fewer nuclear warheads deployed and many ballistic missile \nlaunchers are no longer a threat to our citizens, along with many other \nmajor improvements. Three nations--Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan--no \nlonger have nuclear weapons.\n  The International Nuclear Safety Program's funding is also being \nrestored by this amendment, and it is critical to prevention of another \nChernobyl. We need to apply the expertise of our national laboratories \nto help the former Soviet states reduce any risks present in these \nreactors. To some, the solution is to shut down these reactors, but it \nisn't that simple when they are supplying power that is critically \nimportant to their regions. The International Nuclear Safety Program is \nworking and must remain at full strength.\n  Of the three programs being restored in this amendment, I'm most \nfamiliar with the Materials Protection Control and Accounting Program. \nThis program is absolutely essential to minimize the threat of nuclear \nmaterials moving to rogue states or terrorist groups. By far the \ngreatest challenge to any of these groups considering creation of \nnuclear weapons is obtaining the special nuclear materials--the highly \nenriched uranium or plutonium that provide the fission energy source \nfor the bomb.\n  In the old Soviet Union, nuclear materials were protected with guards \nand guns. The guards were well paid with stable jobs. Today, those \nguards may not have been paid by their government for months. Those \nguards may be wondering where their next meal is coming from, and more \nwilling to consider compromising the material they are charged with \nprotecting. Workers in the nuclear facilities are in similar straits, \nand within the last few months we saw the suicide of the director of \nthe Russian Chelyabinsk facility out of frustration for his inability \nto pay his workers.\n  We simply cannot rely on outdated ways of protecting nuclear \nmaterials in a country faced with the economic hardships and turmoil \nprevalent in the former Soviet Union. We need modern systems monitoring \nand controlling these materials, systems of the type that have been \ndeveloped in this country and are in place wherever nuclear materials \nare found in the United States.\n  This program is an outstanding example of international cooperation. \nWork is in progress at more than 50 sites in Russia, Kazakhstan, \nUkraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Lithuania, and Latvia. These \nsites are estimated to have 90 percent or more of the fissile materials \noutside of actual weapons--enough for tens of thousands of new weapons. \nThe program is also an outstanding example of cooperation among our \nnational laboratories--Los Alamos, Sandia, Livermore, Brookhaven, \nPacific Northwest, and Oak Ridge National Laboratories are all playing \nkey roles.\n  As just one example of the program's accomplishments, at the Siberian \nchemical facility at Tomsk-7, by some measures the largest nuclear \nfacility in the world, upwards of 100 tons of highly enriched \nuranium and plutonium are stored. Radiation monitors have now been \ninstalled at the exit portals of the facility, significantly improving \nsecurity of all the material. And a wide range of additional security \nmeasures are in progress as well.\n\n  The conference report language for the Nuclear Defense Authorization \nAct for 1998 raises the concern that the Department of Energy is not \nexpending its allocated funds in this program. I've checked on the \ndetails of this concern and learned that the accounting processes \nrequired for this program cause as much as an 8 to 10 month delay \nbetween when funds are allocated to a specific project and when they \nare reported as spent after the work is done. We maintain good \naccounting for these funds by demanding that the projects be finished \nbefore final payment. Yet the funds must be in the Department at the \ntime a contract is initiated. In contrast to the conference report, I \nlearned that all fiscal year 1996 funds are committed and all fiscal \nyear 1997 funds that the committee questioned will be fully utilized. \nMost of the fiscal year 1997 funds not reported as spent are already \ncommitted to contracts.\n  The Materials Protection Control and Accounting Program must continue \nits efforts to reduce this serious threat. We have just recently seen \nnew opportunities for the program to expand to include more of the \nRussian naval reactor fuels. We are on a course to have most of the \nknown fissile material in Russia under some degree of protection by \n2002. Significant security improvements have been completed in Latvia, \nLithuania, Uzbekistan, Georgia, and Belarus; 16 additional sites, 12 in \nRussia, 2 in Ukraine, 2 in Kazakhstan, are scheduled for completion by \nthe end of 1997. Fiscal years 1998 and 1999 are the most critical for \nimplementing security upgrades at the very large defense facilities \nwith most of the material.\n  With our amendment today, we keep these key programs on target, \nfocused on reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction. This \namendment is a significant re-emphasis of the leadership demonstrated \nby Congress in the past in preventing proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. These programs are a significant contribution toward a \nsafer and more stable world for citizens of both the United States and \nworld, both for the current generation and far into the future.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt the amendment, which will replenish the \nthree programs I have just briefly outlined, without which I believe we \nwill be taking a giant step backward in the elimination, using the most \nmodern\n\n[[Page S6893]]\n\nmeans, of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, starting \nwith nuclear and leading on into chemical and biological. We have to \nget started on the latter. Time is wasting and it is getting more and \nmore difficult and dangerous.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I just want to make a statement that \nif Senators have amendments now is the time to come forward. We are \nwaiting to take up these amendments. We are ready to take up these \namendments. There is no use in keeping the Senate in session without \ndoing business here. To do business here we have to take up these \namendments. We already disposed of a number of amendments here by \nconsent this morning. But if anybody has an amendment now is the time \nto come and offer it. It may be too late later.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I join the chairman's call for those who \nhave amendments to bring them to the floor, if possible, today or \ntomorrow. One of the problems is, however, that we are facing a cloture \nmotion vote, and, if that is approved--and it must be the first vote--a \nnumber of amendments that people have indicated they want to offer \nwould not be germane.\n  I want to spend just a moment or two on the situation that we are now \nin relative to this pending cloture motion.\n  The bill before the Senate is the product of 4 days of debate and \nthoughtful consideration during markup by the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. At the end of the markup, the committee voted unanimously to \nreport this bill to the floor. It was an 18-to-0 vote.\n  This bill is consistent with the bipartisan budget agreement, and I \nfully expect that at the proper time the Senate will give the bill a \nstrong bipartisan vote. We have not reached that time yet.\n  In recent years the Senate has debated more than 100 amendments to \nthe defense authorization bill and has taken 10 to 20 rollcall votes a \nyear. This has typically taken up to 50 to 60 hours over a period of a \nweek or so. Last year, for example, we disposed of 159 amendments with \n19 rollcall votes, and over 63 hours of debate.\n  I don't see any reason to expect that Members will be offering any \nfewer amendments, although we always can hope that might be the case, \nor that it will take significantly less time to dispose of them this \nyear than it has in the past. Like previous defense authorization \nbills, the bill before us is almost 500 pages long, and includes more \nthan 300 separate provisions.\n  But on Friday before the recess when the majority leader filed a \ncloture motion the Senate had been considering this bill--and it is a \ncomplex bill--for less than 8 hours, mostly on a Friday morning after \nmost Members had left town and after the majority leader said there \nwould be no votes. Not a single nongermane amendment has been adopted \nuntil this recent series of amendments, and no major defense-related \namendment has yet been offered.\n  The major issues before us--the base closure issue, the depot issue, \npossibly missile defense, Bosnia, NATO enlargement--have yet to be \nraised. To say the least, I was surprised to see a cloture motion filed \nat this early stage of the Senate's deliberations. That approach might \nmake some sense if there were sign of obstruction or delay in the \nconsideration of the bill. But that has not been the case. The floor \nmanagers on both sides, as the chairman has said, are prepared to \nconsider and debate any amendment that may be forthcoming. We are \nprepared to address issues and to move on with the Senate's business. \nBut we have not had an opportunity to do that. And we are not going to \nhave an opportunity to vote on any amendment prior to the vote on \ncloture tomorrow since, as I understand the schedule established by the \nmajority leader, no votes can be scheduled for today and the first vote \ntomorrow will be the cloture vote.\n  Members well know that the rules constrain consideration of \namendments in a postcloture situation. And they are extremely confining \nrules. To be in order an amendment must also be relevant but germane \nunder a very strict definition of germaneness. Under postcloture rules \nany amendment, no matter how relevant to the defense of the Nation, is \nnongermane if it expands powers available under the bill, if it \nintroduces a new subject matter, or if it funds a program not already \nfunded in the bill. Any portion of an amendment that is not germane \nmakes the whole amendment out of order, and an amendment may not be \nmodified without the unanimous consent of the Senate.\n  If we were to vote cloture the major amendments that we all expect to \nconsider in the course of the debate would be nongermane and could not \nbe voted on by the Senate. For example, we have pending before us this \nafternoon an amendment relative to the funding of the Nunn-Lugar \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program. Unless we act on that amendment \nthis afternoon--that is an amendment which is addressing one of the \ngreatest threats that is faced by this country--that amendment would \nnot be in order, and we could not even vote on it.\n  Senators who question the administration's proposal for distributing \nthe workload of the two air logistics centers closed in the last BRAC \nround would be denied the opportunity to raise the issue on this bill \nif cloture passes. That is whether or not they come and debate it this \nafternoon, and that is whether or not they come and debate it tomorrow \nmorning. The reason is because it is not germane technically to the \nbill in a postcloture situation.\n\n  I don't happen to support adding those provisions to this bill. I \ndon't think we ought to add provisions to this bill that reallocate \nworkloads. I think we ought to leave that to a fair process. But that \nis not the point.\n  Senators were asked to deliver amendments relating to this subject of \ndistributing the workload at the two air logistics centers which were \nclosed in the last BRAC round, and they would have no opportunity to \nbring their amendments back on that subject if cloture were voted on \ntomorrow.\n  Again, under the unanimous-consent rule that we are operating under, \ncloture is the first rollcall vote that this Senate is going to be able \nto have.\n  There is another major issue that should be debated and that we know \nwill be debated. That has to do with future base closure rounds. We had \na very lively discussion and debate on that in the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  There are many of us who talked in support of the amendment of \nSenator McCain relative to two new rounds of base closures. If we deny \nthose two new rounds we will be denying one of the highest priorities \nof the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But at least \nwe ought to have a vote on the subject, and if we vote on cloture \ntomorrow--which must be the first vote regardless of when the BRAC \namendment is offered, whether it is offered this afternoon or offered \ntomorrow, since under the unanimous-consent agreement that we are \noperating under the first vote must be on cloture--and if that vote \npasses tomorrow, then we would not be able to vote on whether or not to \nadd two new rounds or perhaps one new round of base closure. That is \njust not right.\n  Amendments regarding foreign policy issues that are not currently \naddressed in the bill various Senators may want to offer. Amendments \nmay be offered on Bosnia or on NATO expansion. Those amendments would \nbe out of order if cloture is voted tomorrow. The House version of this \nbill has a major Bosnia-related provision. It would cut off funds for \nUnited States ground troops in Bosnia after June 30 of next year. That \nis a highly significant issue. While we don't have to debate it in this \nbill, I think that some Senators may feel otherwise. I don't think they \nought to be barred from raising the issue should they choose, even \nthough I may not agree with their amendment.\n  Many other amendments that Members are planning to offer this year\n\n[[Page S6894]]\n\nwould be out of order. Amendments involving the funding formula for the \nNational Guard Challenge Program, amendments relative to the North \nDakota flood close claims of Air Force personnel, amendments relative \nto the reauthorization of the Sikes Act, to facilitate the preparation \nof integrated natural resources management plans for military lands, \namendments to provide recruiter access to juvenile court records, and \nso forth.\n  This is not the way that we should be doing business. We should not \nbe voting on cloture before we have had an opportunity to vote on \nimportant amendments, and we will not have that opportunity under the \nunanimous-consent agreement that we are operating under. We should not \nbe denying Members the opportunity to offer key amendments which will \nrequire rollcall votes before the amendment process is even begun in \nearnest.\n  I hope that we can continue to clear as many amendments as possible \nthis afternoon and tomorrow morning.\n  I happen to agree with the chairman. People who have amendments \nshould come down here and debate them. But the problem this cloture \nmotion creates for us is that we can't have rollcall votes until after \nthe vote on cloture tomorrow. And we know that a number of amendments \nare going to require rollcall votes--legitimate amendments involving \nbase closures and involving the depot issue which so many of our \nMembers feel so strongly about.\n  That is why I hope we will not invoke cloture tomorrow. I think that \ninvoking cloture would be unfair to Members who want to bring up \namendments which require rollcall votes and to have us dispose of those \namendments.\n  So, Madam President, again, whether or not cloture may be needed at a \nlater stage in the debate of the bill, it would surely be premature to \ninvoke cloture tomorrow before the disposition of many important \namendments, controversial amendments and tested amendments, which \narguably require rollcall votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 420\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I know I don't need to ask consent to \nreturn to the Cochran amendment. But the Lugar amendment has been \noffered and has been the pending business. I ask that we return to the \nregular order, to amendment No. 420.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  That is now the pending amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, amendment No. 420 was offered by me, \nand is cosponsored by the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator \nDurbin. It seeks to modify the existing export control policy that had \nbeen instituted by the administration with respect to the exporting of \nhigh-performance or so-called supercomputers.\n\n\n                     supercomputer export controls\n\n  Madam President, on November 14, 1994, President Clinton issued \nExecutive Order 12938, the Emergency Regarding Weapons of Mass \nDestruction, declaring that the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and the means of delivering them constitute ``an unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and \neconomy of the United States,'' and that he had therefore decided to \n``declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.'' The \nPresident reaffirmed this Executive order on November 15, 1995, and \nagain on November 11, 1996.\n  We have had several hearings recently on the subject of proliferation \nin my Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, \nProliferation, and Federal Services. And the distinguished ranking \nmember of the full committee, Senator Levin, is the ranking member of \nthat subcommittee.\n  We have examined cases of proliferation by the People's Republic of \nChina and proliferation by Russia, and I can tell you that the facts--\nbrought out in open session--are disturbing. The facts tell a story of \nboth Chinese and Russian sales of technology, components, and delivery \nsystems for weapons of mass destruction, as well as sales of highly \ncapable advanced conventional weapons and other critical military \ntechnologies, to nations like Iran. The facts demonstrate that \nPresident Clinton was entirely correct in describing this problem as a \nnational emergency.\n  Just last month, the Director of Central Intelligence sent Congress \nan unclassified report entitled, ``The Acquisition of Technology \nRelating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional \nMunitions.'' The report covers only the period July through December \n1996 and levies serious proliferation charges against, among others, \nRussia and China. The report says:\n\n       China was the most significant supplier of WMD-related \n     goods and technology to foreign countries. The Chinese \n     provided a tremendous variety of assistance to both Iran's \n     and Pakistan's ballistic missile programs. China also was the \n     primary source of nuclear-related equipment and technology to \n     Pakistan, and a key supplier to Iran during this reporting \n     period. Iran also obtained considerable CW-related assistance \n     from China in the form of production equipment and \n     technology.\n\n  The intelligence community report--and I note that this report is not \nthe product of any single part of the intelligence community, but \nrepresents the consensus view of the entire intelligence community--\ngoes on to say, and again I quote:\n\n       Russia supplied a variety of ballistic missile-related \n     goods to foreign countries during the reporting period, \n     especially to Iran. Russia was an important source for \n     nuclear programs in Iran and, to a lesser extent, India and \n     Pakistan.\n\n  Madam President, the facts that emerged during my subcommittee's \nhearings on Russian and Chinese proliferation are completely supported \nby this latest report of the intelligence community. And we should not \nbe comforted by the fact that it reports on the proliferant behavior of \nthese nations only during the last half of 1996. For those who claim \nthat Chinese and Russian behavior on proliferation is getting better, \nthe best I can say is that it certainly is not yet good enough.\n  I raise the issue of proliferation because it is the principal reason \nwe have offered this amendment on supercomputer export controls. The \nuse of high-performance computers to upgrade existing weapons \ncapabilities or develop new ones is not some fantasy or something that \nmight happen in the future. It is known fact. High-performance \ncomputers help make it possible to develop and improve weapons \ncapabilities that threaten the United States. Keeping them out of the \nwrong hands makes America safer. Dr. Seymour Goodman, in a report used \nby the administration as its basis for weakening U.S. export controls \non high-performance computers, wrote:\n\n       . . . continued export controls will slow the exacerbation \n     of existing nuclear threats. Control of HPC [high-performance \n     computer] exports, by limiting those exports or imposing \n     appropriate safeguards, to countries known to possess nuclear \n     weapons will impede their development of improved weapons and \n     reduce their confidence in their existing stockpile by \n     limiting the opportunity to conduct simulations in lieu of \n     live tests. Similar or more rigorous controls on HPC exports \n     to countries with nuclear weapons development programs could \n     impede their development of second-generation weapons.\n\n  The June 1997 Intelligence Community report to Congress couldn't be \nmore clear on this issue. It states:\n\n       . . . countries of concern continued last year to acquire \n     substantial amounts of WMD-related equipment, materials, and \n     technology, as well as modern conventional weapons. China and \n     Russia continued to be the primary suppliers, and are key to \n     any future efforts to stem the flow of dual-use goods and \n     modern weapons to countries to concern.\n\n  This amendment will help reduce the proliferation danger facing the \nUnited States by requiring an individual validated license to export \nall supercomputers to so-called Tier 3 countries, which include China \nand Russia. Because of the new export control policy for supercomputers \nannounced by the Clinton administration on October 6, 1995, there \ncurrently is no such requirement. We must act to change that policy \nnow.\n  This policy, which has been in place for almost 18 months, groups all \nnations into four country tiers and establishes export licensing \nrequirements for high-performance computers based upon their country of \ndestination. Tier 1 countries, consisting primarily of our NATO allies, \nare free to receive high-performance computers of unlimited capability \nwithout an export license from the United States, while, at the other \nend of the spectrum, Tier 4 countries, consisting of the last \ntrustworthy, cannot legally receive any of\n\n[[Page S6895]]\n\nthese supercomputers. Almost all countries in South America, Central \nAmerica, the Caribbean, and Africa are in Tier 2, and can receive \nsupercomputers capable of up to 10,000 MTOPS--MTOPS are Millions of \nTheoretical Operations per Second, the standard measure of computing \ncapability--before an export license is required.\n  The end-use and end-user are the critical factors for exports to any \nof the 50 nations comprising Tier 3. If the end-use and user are \ncivilian, the policy allows exports of supercomputers capable of up to \n7,000 MTOPS before an export license is required. If the Tier 3 end-use \nor user is military, U.S. export licenses are required for any high-\nperformance computer capable of more than 2,000 MTOPS. But it is the \nU.S. exporter, not the administration, which has the responsibility \nunder this policy for determining the end-use and user for Tier 3 \nexports between 2,000 MTOPS and 7,000 MTOPS. This responsibility, \ndifficult under any circumstances, is complicated by a company's \nnatural focus on making sales. Our amendment addresses only these Tier \n3 exports, as depicted by the diagonally-striped area on this chart, \nwhich I am going to show the Senate at some point in this discussion.\n\n  Our amendment applies to only a small portion of high-performance \ncomputer exports. In fact, according to the Commerce Department's \nBureau of Export Administration, of the 1,436 supercomputers exported \nfrom the United States from the date the new policy went into effect \nthrough March 1997, only 91 went to Tier 3 countries. That amounts to \n6.34 percent of total supercomputer exports. Does it not make sense for \nour Government to be willing to check to make sure that 6.34 percent of \nour supercomputer exports go to the right place? Is it unreasonable to \nrequire the administration to be sure that American supercomputer sales \naren't going to people and places who would damage American national \nsecurity?\n  Our amendment doesn't prohibit the transfer of a single \nsupercomputer. It requires that the existing standards for transfers be \nmonitored by our Government. Our amendment changes only one aspect of \nthe policy, shifting the burden of determining end-use and end-user in \nTier 3 countries from the exporter to the administration. Why is this \nso important? Listen to another part of last month's report to Congress \nby the Intelligence Community, which says, ``Many Third World \ncountries--with Iran being the most prominent example--are responding \nto Western counterproliferation efforts by relying more on legitimate \ncommercial firms as procurement fronts and by developing more \nconvoluted procurement networks.''\n  American exporters are not capable of determining whether a potential \npurchaser is a ``procurement front'' or part of a ``more convoluted \nprocurement network,'' and it is wrong to place this burden on them.\n  The administration, and many exporters, will tell you that the \ncurrent policy is working, that closer scrutiny isn't required, but \nlook at this chart and what it shows you. There are American \nsupercomputers in Russia's and China's nuclear weapons complexes. \nAccording to Russia's Minister of Atomic Energy, these supercomputers \nare ``10 times faster than any previously available in Russia.'' \nAccording to the Chinese Academy of Sciences--which works on everything \nfrom the D-5 ICBM, capable of reaching the United States, to uranium \nenrichment for nuclear weapons--its American supercomputer provides the \nAcademy with ``computational power previously unknown'' and is \navailable--this is a quote from them--to ``all the major scientific and \ntechnological institutes across China.'' American high performance \ncomputers are now available to help these countries improve their \nnuclear weapons and improve that which they are proliferating, courtesy \nof a policy that can be called many things, but can't reasonably \nlabelled as ``working.''\n  Just last week we learned through press reports that an American \nsupercomputer sent to Hong Kong is now in China under the control of \nthe People's Liberation Army. In addition to the 47 American \nsupercomputers that have been shipped to China since this new policy \ntook effect, 20 unlicensed American supercomputers have been shipped to \nHong Kong. At least now we know where one of the Hong Kong \nsupercomputers is. What about the others? does this look to anyone like \na policy that's working? This is a real problem. It is a problem that \nexists now. It is not a hypothetical problem. It is not a problem that \nmay develop in the future. This is a serious problem that threatens our \nnational security.\n  There are some opposing this amendment who claim that setting the \nthreshold at 2,000 MTOPS is too low, and consequently will make it \nimpossible for American computer manufacturers to sell personal \ncomputers--PC's--abroad. That is just not true. It is a last minute \ndesperation shot at the Cochran-Durbin amendment. Let's look at the \nfacts:\n  The first fact is the 2,000 MTOPS threshold opponents express concern \nover was not dreamed up by us. It is the administration's limit.\n  No. 2, industry suggests that by some time in the fourth quarter of \n1998--this date came, incidentally, from IBM's Director of public \npolicy, who recently visited with my staff about this amendment--IBM \nwill produce, according to him, a PC capable of just over 2,000 MTOPS \nfor sale in the international marketplace, he said. But IBM couldn't \nanswer several basic questions about this PC. Its Director of public \npolicy didn't know the name of the PC, the expected price that would be \ncharged for it, how many would be produced for the U.S. market, how \nmany would be produced for potential foreign market sales, or even how \nmany would be produced for this Tier 3 market, which this amendment is \nnarrowly related to. It is worth remembering that this amendment that \nwe are talking about only affects Tier 3 countries, and he's talking to \nus as if our amendment affects all sales to everybody--in the United \nStates, foreign countries, everywhere--and that is just not true.\n  IBM doesn't just build these machines overnight on an impulse or a \nwhim or a guess about what is out there in terms of potential sales. If \nit is going to have a new top-of-the-line PC out within 15 to 16 \nmonths, as they claim through this director of public policy, it must \nalready have ordered the chip to run this PC. Doesn't it stand to \nreason that if such a PC were just around the corner, IBM would be able \nto answer some of these basic questions that I said the director could \nnot answer? If not, is it possible that IBM is being overly optimistic \nabout its capability, its projections, about the timeframe involved, \nand all the other arguments that have been advanced against this \namendment?\n  Fact No. 3: Right now, according to William Reinsch, who is the Under \nSecretary of Commerce for Export Administration, ``High end Pentium-\nbased personal computers sold today at retail outlets perform at about \n200 to 250 MTOPS.''\n  Did you hear that? We are not talking about 2,000 to 7,000 MTOPS, \nlike some of these computer lobbyists are saying to Senators are going \nto be affected by this amendment. The PC's that are out on the market \ntoday are at much lower ranges of capability.\n  Let's give Secretary Reinsch the benefit of the doubt and say today's \ntop-end PCs are capable of running at 250 MTOPS. Secretary Reinsch said \non June 11 before my subcommittee in an open hearing that ``computer \npower doubles every 18 months, and this has been the axiom in the \nindustry for, I think, about 15 years.''\n  This axiom is known as Moore's Law. The math is straightforward. If \ntop-end PC's are capable of 250 MTOPS today, 18 months from now they \nwill be capable of 500 MTOPS; 36 months from now, they will be capable \nof 1,000 MTOPS; 54 months from now, in 4\\1/2\\ years, they will be \ncapable of 2,000 MTOPS. Fifty-four months from now is not, contrary to \nthe claims of some computer manufacturers, the fourth quarter of next \nyear, as was suggested to us by the director of public policy of IBM. \nOf course, Moore's Law doesn't even mean that 54 months from now there \nwill be PC's on the market capable of 2,000 MTOPS. It only suggests \nthat our manufacturers should be able to build these powerful PC's 54 \nmonths from now, if Moore's Law continues to be sustained. None of our \nmanufacturers will build PC's this powerful unless there is a broad \nmarket demand for such a highly capable PC, and it is unclear if the \nmarket will even be demanding such a powerful PC many times more \npowerful\n\n[[Page S6896]]\n\nthan today's top-of-the-line PC's in just under 5 years.\n  If 4 or 5 years from now industry's optimism proves to be correct, I \nwill be pleased to return to this floor and offer legislation modifying \nthe 2,000 MTOPS level. But the suggestion that by next year we will \nhave PC's many times more powerful than our most powerful today can \nonly be guesswork, wishful thinking.\n  Fact No. 4: IBM currently sells, again according to its director of \npublic policy, a workstation that is capable of just over 2,000 MTOPS. \nWouldn't it make sense that future demand for the much anticipated \n2,000 MTOPS PC should be similar to the current demand for the \nworkstation that is already on the market?\n  According to the Commerce Department, from January 25, 1996, when the \nadministration's supercomputer export control liberalization took \neffect, to March of 1997, 1,436 American high-performance computers \nwere exported to countries in tiers 1, 2, and 3. Of these 1,436, just \n91, or 6.34 percent, went to tier 3 countries. I do not know how many \nof these 91 were IBM's workstation that is just over 2,000 MTOPS. We \nknow that at least 6 of the 91 were not manufactured by IBM--4 Silicon \nGraphics machines that are now running at Russia's nuclear weapons \nlabs; one Silicon Graphics machine in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, \nwhich is a key part of China's nuclear weapons complex; and one Sun \nMicrosystems machine that we just learned last week is now running at a \nChinese military facility in Chungsha after being diverted from Hong \nKong. So up to 85 of the 91 exported over 14 months to tier 3 countries \ncould have been this IBM workstation, though I doubt that all of them \nconsisted of that one machine. But even if all 85 were these IBM \nworkstations, does this sound like the kind of volume that will \noverwhelm the Government's licensing apparatus? Certainly not.\n  The specter of American jobs being lost to unwieldy export controls \nis just another part of the argument against the Cochran-Durbin \namendment that is not based on the facts.\n  Another argument made against our amendment is that the right way to \nkeep organizations from getting American supercomputer technology who \nshouldn't be receiving it is for the Department of Commerce to publish \na list of prohibited end users with individual validated licenses \nrequired for any high-performance computer export to a country or \nentity on the list. This argument against the amendment at least has \nthe virtue of implicitly admitting that American supercomputers should \nnot be in Russia's and China's nuclear weapons design labs, but it is \nanother argument that is simply not based on the facts.\n  Shortly before the recent July Fourth recess, I spoke on the floor of \nthe Senate explaining why such a list would be, in many ways, worse \nthan the current situation. I won't go through all those reasons again \nin the interest of time now, but I continue to believe that such a list \nwould be necessarily incomplete because of the requirement to protect \nintelligence sources and methods. It could be used as the Department of \nCommerce's guide for proliferators, and it would make it only too easy \nto make a sale to a location not on the list, thus encouraging makers \nof weapons of mass destruction to establish phony front organizations \nfor the purposes of acquiring U.S. supercomputers. They wouldn't be on \nthat list.\n\n  In fact, the Department of Commerce on June 30 published such a list, \nand its inadequacy is obvious. The June 30 list, called by the Commerce \nDepartment the ``Entities List,'' consists of 13 locations in 5 tier 3 \ncountries that can receive an American supercomputer only if you have a \nlicense, only subject to a license. So now the total list of proscribed \nend users consists of 15 entities. On this list are Chelyabinsk-70 and \nArzamas-16 in Russia which have already received at least five American \nsupercomputers and parts of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which also \nis now manufacturing more modern nuclear weapons with America's finest \ntechnology.\n  Because of this list, now America's computer exporters know that they \nneed a license to ship a high-performance computer to any of these \nentities. What about other entities, though? What about the Chinese \ncompany that shipped ring magnets to Pakistan last year for use in its \nnuclear program? Why isn't that company on the list? It has been \nsubjected to sanctions imposed by our Government, and it is not on our \nGovernment's list as a prohibited end user. What about the Chinese \ncompany or government entity that shipped M-11 missiles to Pakistan and \nnow, according to press reports, is helping Pakistan build a factory \nfor the indigenous manufacture of M-11 missiles? Why isn't that entity \non the list? What about the Russian company or government entity \nhelping Iran to upgrade its nuclear program and ballistic missile \nprograms, why aren't they on the list?\n  Madam President, this list does not solve the problem. If anything, \nit makes it more confused, it makes it more difficult for American \nexporters to determine who should or should not receive American high-\nperformance computers. In many ways, this list is worse than nothing.\n  There are many who believe the entire high-performance computer \nexport control policy of this administration is a failure. However one \nviews this policy as a whole, there is one aspect of it that we know is \nnot working and it can be fixed now.\n  We know that American supercomputers are now in Chinese and Russian \nnuclear weapons labs. We know that they should not be there. We know \nthat our Government, with the resources of the intelligence community, \nis better able to determine the identity of end users and end uses than \nis industry. Industry has no way to be able to determine the end use \nand user of its products to the degree of confidence that our \nintelligence agencies can do.\n  Right now we have the opportunity not to impose new restrictions on \nour supercomputer manufacturers but to shift the burden of making end-\nuse and end-user determinations from industry to Government.\n  Look at this chart again and you will see that we are talking about \nonly a very small part of the overall policy. The entire chart \ndescribes the policy and shows the number of tiers, 1 through 4, the \nvarying capabilities on the basis of millions of theoretical operations \nper second, MTOPS, along the left side. And the only part of the entire \nexport business of American supercomputers that is affected by this \namendment is this part shown in the diagonal lines. The fact is, we are \ntalking about only 6.34 percent of supercomputer exports under this \npolicy that will be affected by this amendment.\n  The Cochran-Durbin amendment will not prevent a single supercomputer \nexport to anyone who should have one, but it will help ensure, though, \nthat only those who should have them will have them. The only \nsupercomputer sales that would be blocked by our amendment are those \ngoing to foreign entities who the U.S. Government determines shouldn't \nhave it. It will not prevent legitimate sales to legitimate users in \nthe U.S. or outside the U.S., but it will help prevent a repeat of the \nerrors that have allowed American supercomputers to go to Russia and to \ngo to China and be used in their nuclear weapons labs.\n  Let's be clear what this debate is about. It is about U.S. national \nsecurity. If you think Russia and China shouldn't be using American \nsupercomputers to improve the quality of their nuclear arsenals and the \nquality of the weapons systems and components and technology that they \nare selling in turn to others, vote for the Cochran-Durbin amendment.\n  President Clinton was right when he called the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction ``an unusual and extraordinary threat to \nthe national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United \nStates,'' and that it constitutes a ``national emergency.'' These \nweapons, delivery systems and technologies are more readily developed \nand enhanced by high-performance computers, and who makes those \ncomputers? The United States.\n  If the United States is going to demonstrate that it is serious about \nthis issue, we must do more than complain to Russia and China every \ntime one of those nations engage in proliferation.\n  The American fight against proliferation must start at our own \nborders.\n  I urge Senators to vote against the Grams-Boxer substitute and \nsupport the Cochran-Durbin amendment.\n\n[[Page S6897]]\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] be added as a cosponsor to our \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I rise to speak on behalf of the same amendment which my \ncolleague, the Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, has just \ndescribed.\n  I am happy to join him as a cosponsor on this important amendment. I \nonly wish my colleagues and many others who are listening to this \ndebate could have been there when Senator Cochran's subcommittee met \njust several weeks ago and really talked in depth about what we are \ndoing.\n  For the average layman, the average person in the United States, \nthere are some very technical terms involved in this debate. But the \npurpose of this amendment is very clear and very straightforward. We \nunderstand that if we give to another country certain information or \ntechnology, they are able in many ways to use it for positive reasons. \nWe fear however that if that same information and technology is given \nto a country which might use it for negative purposes, that it is \ninconsistent with the national security of the United States.\n  The Cochran-Durbin amendment is an effort to make certain that we \ncontinue to sell technology around the world, but take care not to sell \nit in those countries where it may be misused.\n  Unfortunately, the Clinton administration over the last years has had \na change in its policy, with a more expansive, more liberal trade \npolicy when it comes to supercomputers. It has been my fear, and the \nfear of the Senator from Mississippi, that some of these computers \nwhich are being purchased for nominally peaceful reasons are in fact \ngoing to be used for military purposes.\n  One of the examples which the Senator from Mississippi used in \nclosing was the whole question of weapons testing. Some 35 years ago \nwhen President Kennedy spoke to the Nation, he challenged us as a world \nto reduce nuclear arms testing so as to make this a more peaceful \nplanet. I think President Kennedy was right. And I support a weapons \ntest ban. I think the United States should continue to show leadership.\n  But we live in a different world some 3 decades later where a country \nwith a new computer, the supercomputers that we are describing, that \ncountry may have the capability to test a nuclear weapon without ever \ndetonating it. They can set up all of the parameters within the \ncomputer, test the weapon, and show its impact.\n  So if you are talking about reducing the proliferation of dangerous \nweapons--nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons--you must \nnecessarily get involved in this debate, which Senator Cochran has \ninitiated and I have been more than happy to assist in.\n  Some questions have been raised. And I wonder, just for purposes of \nclarification, if I could ask Senator Cochran a question or two for the \nrecord here. I know the Senator has covered most of this in his opening \nstatement, but I think we ought to make a clear record for our \ncolleagues on the amendment.\n  One of the first things that is said is, well, you set the standard \ntoo low. If a company wants to sell this computer, which we describe as \na 2,000 MTOPS computer, you have set it too low, set it at a standard \nso that the computers that are going to be licensed, there is going to \nbe surveillance at such a level. It will not hit the ordinary business \ncomputers.\n  I would like you to respond. And I know you did respond in the course \nof your opening remarks to that particular criticism. If you would, \nplease, I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If the distinguished Senator would yield, I appreciate \nvery much not only his question but also his very helpful involvement \nin this issue and cosponsoring the amendment.\n  But he gets to the central point of the debate here. It is not that \nthis amendment sets any new levels of prohibition or granting authority \nfor export sales. It does not change any of those levels. The level \nthat is established by the administration is the 2,000 MTOPS level. We \ndo not change that for tier 3 countries, as demonstrated in the chart I \nshowed a while ago.\n  We were told in our hearing that 250 MTOPS is about the current power \nof a PC which is sold in the market here in the country now. And that \nunder the so-called Moore's Law that doubles every 18 months. So it \nwould be 4\\1/2\\ years before you get to a level where you would even \nreach the 2,000 MTOPS level which is the trigger level for tier 3 \ncountries that have to have a license if the end use or the end user is \nmilitary. If they're civilian, you do not have to have a license at \nall.\n  What this amendment changes is who determines the end use or the end \nuser. Our amendment says it should be the administration's \nresponsibility. Current policy is that exporters have the \nresponsibility of making that determination. That is the only thing we \nchange.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could pose another question to my cosponsor on this \namendment, Senator Cochran.\n  There have been others that have said, well, why is the United States \ndoing this? If we stop selling computers around the world, whatever \ntheir capability, some other country is going to sell them. So we are \ntying the hands of American business in a futile effort to stop this \nmarch of technology.\n  I would appreciate it if my colleague, the Senator from Mississippi, \nwould address that particular complaint.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Our information, derived at our hearings through expert \nwitnesses, was that we have the highest capability of any country in \nthe world in terms of supercomputer manufacturing technology. We \nmanufacture the state-of-the-art supercomputers. We do not have any \ncompetitors. Japan manufactures some high-performance supercomputers \nbut their export policy is more restrictive than ours. They require \nlicensing, we do not.\n  What we are suggesting here is that the policy of our administration \nis flawed in that it ought to make the determination in those questions \nwhere end use and end user is relevant as to whether you can or cannot \nmake the sale, the Government ought to monitor and verify that this \nsale is permissible. And it applies to only 6.34 percent of the total \ncomputer sales of all American exporters in the export market.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague.\n  I think he noted in the course of his remarks that last week or \nperhaps the week before the administration said, well, let us put out a \nlist of 13 or 14 different entities that we think we should take care \nnot to sell to. And I agree completely with the Senator from \nMississippi that it is hardly a comfort in this argument that we are \nprotecting the interest of the United States with this list.\n  It is hard to believe that our intelligence operations would make a \ncomplete disclosure of every potentially bad purchaser around the world \nwithout in fact disclosing very sensitive classified information. It is \nfar better to take the approach which the Cochran-Durbin amendment \ndoes, which says that on a case-by-case basis there will be a license \nissued by the Government to determine whether the would-be purchaser in \nany way raises a suspicion that this technology is going to be misused, \nused against the United States.\n  I think our approach to it gives the Government the power it needs to \npolice the sales, says to the seller, the computer company, you can \ncome to the Government now and entrust that decision to an entity which \nshould know as to which purchasers should not be trusted. And that I \nthink would give the industry some peace of mind. It has to be a major \nembarrassment to these companies to realize now that they have sold \nthese supercomputers in China and in Russia and that they may be used \nfor military purposes against the United States.\n  Certainly, these companies in the United States value our security, \nthey are as patriotic as many others, and they would want to do the \nright thing. The Cochran-Durbin amendment sets up I think a good \nframework for the right decision to be made. I certainly hope that when \nthis amendment comes up for consideration that many of our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle\n\n[[Page S6898]]\n\nwill stop and pause and reflect on it. Because I think it in a way \ntakes a look at the world as it currently exists and says we do not \nwant to sell to potential enemies or to suspect nations that power that \nmight come back someday to haunt us. It is important to increase trade, \nbut not at the expense of the security of the United States.\n  I thank my colleague from Mississippi for his leadership. And I am \nhappy to join him in this effort.\n  I yield back.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be \nprinted in the Record a chart on exports of high-performance computers; \nand an unclassified report from the Director of Central Intelligence, \nas mentioned in my earlier remarks; and an editorial from the St. Louis \nPost-Dispatch suggesting that the administration should not wait, that \nit must act now on this issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n EXPORTS OF HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTERS FROM JANUARY 25, 1996 TO MARCH \n                                  1997\n\n                     [Number of systems by country]\n\nArgentina.............................................................4\nAustralia............................................................63\nAustria..............................................................17\nBelgium..............................................................38\nBrazil...............................................................15\nCanada...............................................................11\nChina................................................................47\nColombia..............................................................5\nCroatia...............................................................1\nCzech Rep.............................................................4\nDenmark..............................................................10\nEgypt.................................................................2\nFinland...............................................................2\nFrance...............................................................86\nGermany.............................................................232\nGreece................................................................1\nHong Kong............................................................20\nHungary...............................................................3\nIndia.................................................................7\nIndonesia.............................................................6\nIreland...............................................................6\nIsrael...............................................................17\nItaly................................................................42\nJamaica...............................................................1\nJapan...............................................................150\nKenya.................................................................1\nKorea, South........................................................133\nLuxembourg............................................................2\nMalaysia.............................................................33\nMexico...............................................................24\nNetherlands..........................................................23\nNew Zealand..........................................................15\nNigeria...............................................................2\nNorway................................................................7\nPeru..................................................................7\nPhilippines...........................................................4\nPoland................................................................2\nPortugal..............................................................8\nRomania...............................................................4\nRussia...............................................................10\nSaudi Arabia..........................................................2\nSingapore............................................................24\nSlovak Rep............................................................1\nSlovenia..............................................................2\nS.

As directed by Section 721, \n     subsection (b) of the Act, it is unclassified.\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       The threat from the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction and missiles is one of the highest priorities for \n     intelligence. In the US effort to counter weapons \n     proliferation, the Intelligence Community has taken an active \n     role in supporting US government initiatives to strengthen \n     export controls in supplier countries and to work with other \n     countries to prevent the sale of weapons of mass destruction \n     (WMD), advanced conventional weapons, and their related \n     technologies. While it is an extremely difficult problem, US \n     government efforts have made some progress, making both the \n     acquisition and development of WMD more difficult and costly \n     for proliferators.\n       Interdiction of WMD and the technologies necessary to \n     acquire a WMD capability is a key component in the \n     acquisition prevention effort. We see interdiction efforts \n     falling into three basic categories:\n       Preventing the transfer of materials through export \n     controls and international nonproliferation regimes;\n       Halting the transfer or the negotiation of transfer of \n     materials through diplomatic and liaison initiatives;\n       Seizing proscribed materials in transit, through law \n     enforcement agencies in cooperation with the Intelligence \n     Community.\n       Interdiction efforts are an extremely important part of our \n     overall nonproliferation strategy. By themselves, however, \n     they generally do not get countries out of the business of \n     proliferation. They do, though, buy time for other \n     initiatives that may be more successful in halting or rolling \n     back a WMD program. These other initiatives can include:\n       Diplomatic efforts designed to reduce the perceived need \n     for a WMD capability;\n       Education efforts to show that WMD-related funds would be \n     better spent elsewhere;\n       Bilateral or multilateral incentives. Such incentives could \n     be financial, including membership in an international \n     economic forum, in exchange for halting or rolling back a WMD \n     program;\n       Military assistance or security guarantees.\n       The US clearly leads the way in programs in all three \n     classes of interdiction efforts. US export license \n     applications of concern are scrutinized by a number of \n     agencies, including the Intelligence Community. The US also \n     is developing procedures to share appropriate end user \n     information with key allies in an effort to strengthen our \n     mutual export control activities. In addition, the procedures \n     for alerting other governments of impending transfers and \n     tracking resulting actions are in place and working. \n     Interdictions of shipments are occurring.\n       An example of a successful interdiction would be the \n     seizure of chemical precursors destined for Libya. Although \n     such a seizure would not halt Tripoli's aggressive chemical \n     weapons development program, at a minimum it would:\n       Slow Tripoli's ability to begin serial production of \n     chemical agents;\n       Provide the US time to persuade supplier nations or \n     companies to halt future shipments to Libya;\n       Allow the Intelligence Community and US law enforcement \n     agencies to identify and target new intelligence sources that \n     could contribute to rolling back Libya's CW program;\n       Increase the cost to Libya of its CW development program.\n       Interdiction successes rest, in large measure, not on the \n     quantity of information available to the policymaker, but on \n     the quality. This is true for all three classes of \n     interdictions. In licensing, for example, policymakers need \n     unambiguous intelligence information before making a decision \n     to deny a license, thereby denying a sale for the US company. \n     Likewise, demarches to other governments must be accurate or \n     the US will be accused of crying wolf and lose support from \n     even friendly countries. And interdictions of shipments in \n     transit often become international incidents, and potential \n     embarrassment if the targeted material is not found in the \n     shipment.\n       Actionable intelligence in support of interdiction efforts \n     requires more than cooperation between US intelligence, \n     policy, and law enforcement agencies. It demands close \n     working relationships between the United States and other \n     foreign governments committed to halting the proliferation of \n     WMD. Such relationships will, of course, include intelligence \n     sharing arrangements, but equally important are diplomatic, \n     military, and scientific exchanges at all levels.\n       As noted above, interdiction programs by themselves cannot \n     halt the proliferation of WMD. Alternative suppliers and \n     technologies, increasing use of denial and deception, and a \n     growing ability to produce indigenously weapons or their \n     component parts are opening new avenues to states or \n     organizations determined to obtain a WMD capability. The \n     increasing diffusion of modern technology through the growth \n     of the world market is making it harder to detect illicit \n     diversions of materials and technologies relevant to a \n     weapons program.\n       We are addressing these new challenges with more aggressive \n     efforts, which go beyond traditional cold-war efforts aimed \n     merely at understanding weapons and associated plans. We are \n     better integrating technical analysis with political, \n     military, and diplomatic analysis to provide policymakers \n     with information on the motivations that drive foreign \n     actions and decisions, and on influential opposition forces \n     that could support initiatives to diminish or eliminate \n     the proliferation threat.\n       Our concerns are not limited to interdicting materials and \n     technologies to state-sponsored WMD development programs. As \n     worrisome, in our judgment, are terrorist groups and cults \n     that seek to acquire or develop\n\n[[Page S6899]]\n\n     chemical and biological weapons on their own. For example, \n     the incidents staged in March 1995 by the Japanese cult Aurn \n     Shinrikyo demonstrate the use of WMD is not longer restricted \n     to the battlefield. Terrorist groups and violent sub-national \n     groups need not acquire a massive infrastructure to create a \n     deadly, arsenal. Only small quantities of precursors, \n     available on the open market, are needed.\n       Interdiction efforts are further complicated by the fact \n     that most WMD programs are based on dual-use technologies and \n     materials that have legitimate civilian or military \n     applications unrelated to WMD. For example, chemicals used to \n     make nerve agents are also used to make plastics and to \n     process foodstuffs; trade in those technologies cannot be \n     banned.\n       Nonproliferation regimes provide international standards to \n     gauge and address behavior. They provide diplomatic tools to \n     isolate and punish violators. The past few years, many states \n     have joined these regimes and outsiders are encountering new \n     pressures to join. Procurement costs have risen because of \n     the need for convoluted efforts to hide purchases. That said, \n     these regimes can be deceived by determined proliferators. \n     The sheer volume of international commerce, increased self-\n     sufficiency, and the global diffusion of technology and its \n     dual-use nature make the regimes' road ahead a difficult one. \n     Intelligence will play an increasingly important role in \n     maintaining their effectiveness. Protecting sources \n     throughout this process will be a challenge.\n       Following are summaries by country of ACW- and WMD-related \n     acquisition activities (solicitations, negotiations, \n     contracts, and deliveries) that occurred between 1 July and \n     31 December 1996.\n\n                         Acquisition by Country\n\n       We chose to exclude countries that already have substantial \n     ACW and WMD programs such as China and Russia, as well as \n     countries of lower priority that demonstrated little \n     acquisition activity of concern.\n\n\n                                 egypt\n\n       During the last half of 1996, Egypt obtained Scud-related \n     ballistic missile equipment from North Korea and Russia.\n\n\n                                 india\n\n       India sought some items for its ballistic missile program \n     during the reporting period from a variety of sources. It \n     also sought nuclear-related items, some of which may have \n     been intended for its nuclear weapons program.\n\n\n                                  iran\n\n       Iran continues to be one of the most active countries \n     seeking to acquire all types of WMD technology and advanced \n     conventional weapons. Its efforts in the last half of 1996 \n     have focused on acquiring production technology that will \n     give Iran an indigenous production capability for all types \n     of WMD. Numerous interdiction efforts by the US government \n     have interfered with Iranian attempts to purchase arms and \n     WMD-related goods, but Iran's acquisition efforts remain \n     unrelenting.\n       For the reporting period, China and Russia have been \n     primary sources for missile-related goods. Iran obtained the \n     bulk of its CW equipment from China and India. Iran sought \n     dual-use biotech equipment from Europe and Asia, ostensibly \n     for civilian uses. Iran was actively seeking modern tanks, \n     SAMs, and other arms from the Commonwealth of Independent \n     States (CIS), China, and Europe. Besides some large projects \n     with China, Iranian nuclear-related purchases were not \n     focused on any particular countries and were only indirectly \n     related to nuclear weapons production.\n\n\n                                  iraq\n\n       We have not observed Iraq purchasing advanced conventional \n     weapons or WMD-related goods, although it has purchased \n     numerous dual-use items.\n\n\n                                 libya\n\n       Despite the UN embargo, Libya continued to aggressively \n     seek ballistic missile-related equipment, materials, and \n     technology from Europe, the CIS, and the Far East. CW-related \n     purchases diminished, however.\n\n\n                              north korea\n\n       North Korea's WMD programs are largely indigenous. We \n     observed no significant procurement involving ACW or WMD-\n     related goods.\n\n\n                                pakistan\n\n       Pakistan was very aggressive in seeking our equipment, \n     material, and technology for its nuclear weapons program, \n     with China as its principal supplier. Pakistan also sought a \n     wide variety of nuclear-related goods from many Western \n     nations, including the United States. China also was a major \n     supplier to Pakistan's ballistic missile program, providing \n     technology and assistance. Of note, Pakistan has made strong \n     efforts to acquire an indigenous capability in missile \n     production technologies.\n\n\n                                 syria\n\n       Syria continued to seek CW- and Scud-related goods during \n     the reporting period. Russia and Eastern Europe were the \n     primary target for CW-related purchases, while North Korea \n     and Iran have become important suppliers of Scud-related \n     equipment and materials.\n\n                             Key Suppliers\n\n\n                                 china\n\n       During the last half of 1996, China was the most \n     significant supplier of WMD-related goods and technology of \n     foreign countries. The Chinese provided a tremendous variety \n     of assistance to both Iran's and Pakistan's ballistic missile \n     programs. China also was the primary source of nuclear-\n     related equipment and technology to Pakistan, and a key \n     supplier to Iran during this reporting period. Iran also \n     obtained considerable CW-related assistance from China in the \n     form of production equipment and technology.\n\n\n                                 russia\n\n       Russia supplied a variety of ballistic missile-related \n     goods to foreign countries during the reporting period, \n     especially to Iran. Russia was an important source for \n     nuclear programs in Iran and, to a lesser extent, India and \n     Pakistan. Russia also negotiated the sale of advanced weapon \n     systems, such as the SA-10 to Cyprus, and is an important \n     target for Middle Eastern countries seeking to upgrade and \n     replace their existing arms.\n\n\n                              north korea\n\n       North Korea continued to export Scud-related equipment and \n     materials to countries of concern during this reporting \n     period.\n\n\n                                germany\n\n       Among Western nations, Germany was the favorite target for \n     foreign WMD programs. German export controls were effective \n     in thwarting many of these attempts, but some dual-use goods \n     were exported, purportedly to civilian end users.\n\n\n                                 trends\n\n       Despite our efforts, countries of concern continued last \n     year to acquire substantial amounts of WMD-related equipment, \n     materials, and technology, as well as modern conventional \n     weapons. China and Russia continued to be the primary \n     suppliers, and are key to any future efforts to stem the flow \n     of dual-use goods and modern weapons to countries of concern.\n       Countries determined to maintain WMD programs over the long \n     term have been placing significant emphasis on securing their \n     programs against interdiction and disruption. In response to \n     broader, more effective export controls, these countries have \n     been tying to reduce their dependence on imports by \n     developing an indigenous production capability. Many Third \n     World countries--with Iran being the most prominent example--\n     are responding to Western counterproliferation efforts by \n     relying more on legitimate commercial firms as procurement \n     fronts and by developing more convoluted procurement \n     networks. Should countries such as Iran ever become self-\n     sufficient producers and exporters of WMD-related goods and \n     conventional weapons, however, opportunities to prevent \n     acquisition will be dramatically limited.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, July 6, 1997]\n\n                  China's Dangerous Computer Diversion\n\n       The Chinese have done it again--diverted machinery \n     supposedly purchased for commercial purposes to military \n     uses. Predictably, China denies all, but the U.S. State and \n     Commerce departments say they have proof that China diverted \n     a supercomputer that can be used to upgrade military \n     hardware. The Clinton administration is rightly calling \n     attention to the problem, but may have been lax in allowing \n     it to happen in the first place.\n       Supercomputers can process so much data so quickly that any \n     nation possessing one can significantly upgrade its weapons. \n     That's why sales of supercomputers for military purposes \n     require a license. But under a Clinton edict adopted in 1995, \n     sales of supercomputers for commercial purposes don't. That \n     appears to have been a mistake.\n       U.S. officials have discovered that a supercomputer \n     manufactured by Sun Microsystems was sold to a Hong Kong \n     company, then purchased by the Chinese government. It was \n     supposed to be sent to a science institute in Beijing, but \n     ended up instead in Changsha where it is being used for \n     military applications, the U.S. says.\n       China denies it, as it also rejects State Department \n     charges that it has been selling nuclear and ballistic \n     missile technology to Pakistan and Iran. These wouldn't be \n     China's first untruths; last year, China diverted a huge \n     metal stamping machine sold by McDonnell Douglas for \n     commercial airline manufacture to military use.\n       All supercomputers are capable of so-called dual use, that \n     is, of being employed for both peaceful and military \n     purposes, so they must be carefully monitored. Though the \n     United States has been fairly successful in that effort with \n     its sales to Russia, China has been largely uncooperative. \n     Congress is so concerned that the House has passed a bill \n     reinstating the requirement that all supercomputers sold \n     abroad for any purpose be licensed--and their use be tracked.\n       In 1995, the administration deregulated the sale of \n     supercomputers for peaceful purposes on the ground that if \n     America doesn't sell its machines, the Europeans or the \n     Japanese would sell theirs. But the importance of slowing the \n     spread of higher grade nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles \n     requires the U.S. to prevent the sale of supercomputers which \n     defeat that purpose, never mind helping the computer industry \n     compete abroad. Only strict licensing is safe, and our \n     competitors should be pressured to follow that policy. The \n     administration shouldn't wait for Congress, but require it \n     now.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S6900]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I would like to make a parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Would the Cochran amendment be germane in a postcloture situation if \ncloture were approved tomorrow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time the amendment does not appear to \nbe germane in a postcloture situation, but the sponsor of the amendment \nhas not had the opportunity to make his case for germaneness, and the \nChair would rule on germaneness only after cloture had been invoked and \nafter the sponsor had an opportunity to make his arguments for the \namendment being germane.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I appreciate the Chair's care.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If the Senator will yield in response to that response \nby the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Would there be any way to modify the amendment to make \nit germane in a postcloture situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Once cloture is invoked, it would take \nunanimous consent to modify the amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The reason I raise this, Madam President, is this is an \nexample of where we are prematurely faced with a cloture vote. I say \npremature, because we have not had an opportunity to vote on key \namendments and will not have an opportunity to vote on key amendments, \nincluding the Cochran amendment, before cloture. Because under the \nunanimous-consent agreement that we are operating under, cloture is \ngoing to be voted on first. That is the first vote tomorrow.\n  It strikes me as being unfair to amendments and to those sponsors of \namendments who have put in a serious effort on major security issues.\n  I do not know how I am going to vote on the Cochran amendment. I am \nstudying the amendment. It raises a very significant issue relative to \nAmerican security. But it is not technically germane because of our \npostcloture rules. It surely is relevant to this bill in any, I think, \ngeneral sense. We are talking about the security of this Nation and we \nare trying to weigh the issue here, the pros and cons of the Cochran \namendment. Surely, it is a serious national security issue which the \nSenator from Mississippi has raised, the chairman of a subcommittee \nwhich has had hearings into a very important issue.\n  So I urged before that we not invoke cloture tomorrow for a number of \nreasons and stated that there were a number of very significant pending \namendments that would be or might be ruled nongermane after cloture, \nand I failed to list this amendment as an example of that type of \namendment that could very well fall although I think by any reasonable \ndefinition of national security this surely is relevant to that issue.\n  So I commend my good friend from Mississippi for raising this issue.\n  Again, it is an issue that I am going to be giving some real study to \nthis evening. It is a very thoughtful amendment. It is a carefully \ndrawn amendment. It is based on a current classification. And I want to \ncommend him on it and hope that he will be able to at least have a vote \non his amendment. That very well will be impossible if cloture were \ninvoked tomorrow.\n  Madam President, I want to ask another parliamentary inquiry because \nthere is a second-degree amendment which is also pending, a second-\ndegree amendment to the Cochran amendment. I ask the Chair the \nfollowing question.\n  Would the question put relative to the Grams amendment receive the \nsame response from the Chair as my question relative to the Cochran \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. After conferring with the Parliamentarian, the \nChair would give the same response to the question with regard to the \nGrams amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I am just notifying Senators that if \nthey have any amendments, come over and we'll take them up. This is the \ntime and this is the place. We are just killing time here, wasting \ntime, wasting the Government's time, wasting our time waiting on people \nto come in and offer amendments. I want to say to my colleagues, if you \nhave an amendment, come on over here and let's take it up and get \naction on it. I am here waiting to cooperate. Thank you very much.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee for asking the quorum call be rescinded and I thank the Chair \nfor waiting. I knew today we would be discussing the Department of \nDefense authorization bill. As soon as I completed work on our hearings \nfor tomorrow, the Government Operations Committee, I notified the floor \nthat I would be coming over and I thank the Chair for waiting and I \nthank the distinguished chairman for waiting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss an \namendment which has been circulated with both the majority and \nminority, which refers to establishing procedures for a report not \nlater than 90 days after the enactment of the defense authorization \nbill, for the Secretary of Defense to submit to the congressional \ndefense committees a report containing the following: No. 1, an \nassessment of the current policies and practices of the Department of \nDefense with respect to the protection of members of the Armed Forces \nagainst terrorist attack abroad, including any modifications of such \npolicies or practices that are proposed or implemented as a result of \nthe assessment; and, second, an assessment of the procedures of the \nmilitary departments intended to determine accountability, if any, in \nthe command structure in instances in which a terrorist attack results \nin the loss of life at an installation or facility of the Armed Forces \nabroad.\n  This report is being sought because of what happened on June 25, \n1996, when a bomb detonated not more than 80 feet from the Air Force \nhousing complex known as Khobar Towers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, \nkilling 19 members of the Air Force and injuring hundreds more, as many \nas 400 more.\n  This incident came under very intensive scrutiny by the Intelligence \nCommittee, which I chaired last year. I have very serious reservations \nas to the adequacy of the Department of Defense response to the kind of \nthreat which was posed by having those living quarters within 80 feet \nof a fence.\n  The Department of Defense had a report on June 13, 1996 from the \nBureau of Intelligence and Research, Department of State, highlighting \nsecurity concerns in the region in which Dhahran was located. \nPreviously, in January 1996, the Office of Special Investigations of \nthe Air Force issued a vulnerability assessment for the complex, and \nthat assessment highlighted the vulnerability of perimeter security at \nthe complex, given the proximity of the complex to a boundary fence and \nthe lack of the protective coating mylar on its windows. And then, just \n8 days before the terrorist attack, the Department of Defense received \nan intelligence report detailing a high level of risk to the complex. \nThat report went to the highest levels of the Department of Defense and \nhad the picture of Khobar Towers on it.\n  Immediately after the incident occurred, the Secretary of Defense, \nWilliam J. Perry, said that it was very unusual to have a bomb of the \nmagnitude of 3,000 to 5,000 pounds used in the Mideast. I took issue \nwith that statement on a factual basis that on October 23, 1983, \naccording to the results of the Long Commission, a bomb weighing 12,000 \npounds had killed 283 marines in Beirut, in the Mideast. That is the \nsame region where, regrettably, terrorist attacks have become all too \ncommonplace. So it struck me as strange that the Secretary of Defense \nwould say that a bomb weighing 3,000 to 5,000\n\n[[Page S6901]]\n\npounds was unusual in the Mideast, when there had been a bomb of 12,000 \npounds, as I say, in 1983, detonated, giving tremendous warning for \njust this kind of attack; and that, in fact, a reading of the Long \nCommission report, for anybody who had read it, would have demonstrated \nthe kind of threat which was posed by a high-powered bomb detonated \nnear a fence in that area.\n  I personally saw that fence in August 1996 when I visited Khobar \nTowers in Dhahran as part of my effort and the Intelligence Committee's \nefforts to try to find out exactly what had happened there. We had \ntestimony from General Peay, who was the four-star commander in the \narea, who testified before a Senate committee in early July. Asked \nabout the closeness of the perimeter fence to those living quarters, \n``Was it too close?'' he said words to the effect of, ``I don't know. I \njust don't know.''\n\n  Certainly after the fact it is hard to understand how a ranking \ngeneral would not know that that fence was too close to the living \nquarters and, realistically, before the fact, it seems hard to \nunderstand how the commanding general would not know about the \nextraordinary and unwarranted danger which was faced by the airmen who \nwere living in those quarters.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, had \nvisited Dhahran in the spring of 1996 and was within sight of Khobar \nTowers, although, as I understand it, he did not actually visit Khobar. \nBut a question to be raised and a question to be answered, which has \nnot yet been answered by the Department of Defense, is why the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff when in the area, within sight of Khobar \nTowers, knowing what the security risks were, did not take a look at \nthat facility and make an assessment as to the vulnerability, since he \nwas on the spot. That is especially true in light of the fact that \nthere had been an attack in Riyahd, Saudi Arabia, in November 1995, \nkilling a number of Americans, and that four Saudis had been executed \nby the Saudi Government in late May 1996, which would give rise to a \nconcern as to what the militants in Saudi Arabia would do next. That \nwas especially troublesome to the United States from a number of points \nof view, one of which was that the FBI, charged with investigating \nthose matters overseas, had not been given access to those terrorists \nbefore they were executed.\n  So, here you have the general on the spot, a brigadier general, with \nthe fence 80 feet from the towers, you have the four-star general in \ncommand of the overall area even after the fact, not knowing whether \nthere was an unacceptable risk, and you have the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff in the vicinity, within sight of Khobar Towers, and no \ncorrective action taken notwithstanding all of these warnings which had \nbeen given in a number of contexts about the danger which was present \nthere.\n  Following the attack on Khobar Towers, a commission was formed with \nGeneral Downing, a retired four-star general, in command. When he \ntestified before the Intelligence Committee on September 19, 1996, \namong other questions I asked him about a series of criteria \nestablished by the Secretary of Defense, Secretary William J. Perry, \nabout what the responsibility was of the Secretary of Defense.\n  General Downing testified that even under Secretary Perry's two \nstandards they were not met. The first two standards articulated by \nSecretary Perry were ``establishing the policies and guidance for our \ncommanders, including the policy and guidance for force protection.''\n  I asked General Downing:\n\n       . . . Was there an adequate policy and guidance on force \n     protection?\n\n  General Downing's response:\n\n       No, there was not, Senator.\n\n  Then I asked about Secretary Perry's second criterion, organizing and \nstructuring the Department of Defense in such a way that force \nprotection is optimal. Then the question was:\n\n       So did they meet the second criterion which stated \n     ``organizing and structuring the Department of Defense in \n     such a way that force protection is optimal?''\n\n  General Downing:\n\n       The answer is no.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that at the conclusion of my \nremarks this extract from the hearings before the Intelligence \nCommittee be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in sequence, the committee then learned \nthat there had been a report on the force protection issue, ``Force \nProtection in Southwest Asia, An Air Force Perspective,'' dated \nSeptember 17. Our committee learned about this as a result of a report \nin the press, the Washington Post specifically, on October 10, 1996. So \nby letter dated October 17, 1996, Senator Robert Kerrey, vice chairman \nof the Intelligence Committee, and I, in my capacity as chairman, wrote \nto Secretary of the Air Force, Sheila Widnall, asking for a copy of \nthat report.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter dated October 17, 1996, be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the next sequence of events was a letter \nwhich I sent to Secretary Perry, with a copy to Air Force Secretary \nWidnall, dated November 5, 1996, which reads as follows:\n\n       This letter constitutes a formal complaint on the \n     obstruction by you, others and the Department of Defense on \n     the inquiry by the Intelligence Committee to determine \n     whether there was an intelligence failure relating to the \n     terrorist attack in Dhahran on June 25, 1996 on the \n     following:\n       1. Prohibiting key witnesses from being interviewed by this \n     Committee (Brigadier General Terryl Schwalier, Colonel Gary \n     Boyle, Lt. Colonel James Traister).\n\n  Notwithstanding our efforts to interview these key personnel, the \nDepartment of Defense precluded the Intelligence Committee from \nconducting those interviews.\n  Second, in my letter to Secretary Perry, I pointed out the concerns \nwe had on prohibiting General Downing from testifying before the \nIntelligence Committee except on the terms set forth by the Secretary \nof Defense with that questioning only being in closed session. With our \ninterest in having an open session, with General Downing having told \nthe Intelligence Committee that he was employed by the Department of \nDefense and had to comply with instructions not to testify in open \nsession, the impact of that was obvious. When General Downing testified \nin closed session that Secretary Perry had not even followed the \nSecretary's own criteria for force protection, it was not much of an \nimpact contrasted to what it would have been had it been in open \nsession.\n  The third item:\n\n       Refusing to give this committee access to an Air Force \n     report which, as reported in the Washington Post on October \n     10.\n\n  Then, finally, on November 6, after this letter was faxed on November \n5, we received a response from General Trapp dated November 6, 1996, \nwhich I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Then there is my reply dated December 5 stating that \nthat reply was insufficient, and referring to other letters. I ask \nunanimous consent that my letter of December 5 be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 4.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I then note an article in the New York \nTimes dated December 12, 1996, which discussed release of another \nreport which apparently had been leaked to the New York Times for \nreasons set forth in the New York Times article, which said:\n\n       Officials sympathetic to the Air Force position made \n     available Wednesday selected parts of a classified review the \n     Air Force conducted into the bombing. The review, written by \n     Lt. Gen. James F. Record, commander of the 12th Air Force, \n     cites, for example, the assessment of a senior U.S. \n     intelligence official in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, that the \n     intelligence reports given to General Schwalier ``did not \n     give a target'' for the terrorist attack.\n\n  So, by this time, some of the Air Force were dissatisfied with \nGeneral Downing's report and wanted a report\n\n[[Page S6902]]\n\nwhich would satisfy them. So another report had been commissioned, this \ntime to be written by Lt. Gen. James F. Record.\n  On seeing that additional news leak of the report, which the \nIntelligence Committee did not have a copy of, Mr. President, I then \nwrote to Secretary Widnall on the same day, December 12, noting the \naccess by the New York Times but no access by the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  Again, I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article of \nDecember 12, and my letter to Secretary Widnall dated December 12 be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 5 and 6.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the next series of events, I note a \nstory in the New York Times which, again, makes reference to these \nreports which the Intelligence Committee never had access to, quoting \n``Gen. Ronald Fogleman, the Air Force Chief of Staff, arguing that the \ncase for accountability is nothing more than a Washington scalp hunt.''\n  I then wrote, again, to Secretary of the Air Force, Sheila Widnall, \non April 25, 1997, noting the comments by General Fogleman and again \nasking that these reports be made available to the Senate, to me, and \nto the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  I again ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks \ncopies of the New York Times article dated April 15, 1997, together \nwith my letter dated April 25, 1997, be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 7 and 8.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, all of these letters to Secretary of the \nAir Force went unanswered. Then, on May 21 of this year, the Air Force \nhad the responsibility of coming to the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee. I had an opportunity, finally, to ask Secretary Widnall \nthese questions and why there had not been any response to any of these \nletters of inquiry and the question of General Fogleman on this \nsubject.\n  Finally, subsequent to that meeting, I received a very brief letter \nfrom Secretary Widnall, in fact, after I had bumped into her in the \nhallway on the 7th floor of the Hart Building and said to her, ``Madam \nSecretary, why don't you at least respond to the letters saying that \nyou can't respond if that is your point because there is an inquiry \nunderway?''\n  In the context of all the letters which had been written and that \nconversation, I finally received a letter saying she could not respond, \nthe matter was being reviewed now by the new Secretary of Defense, and \nthat, in due course, a copy of the report would be obtained by \nSenators.\n\n  Here we are on July 7, 1997 and still no copy of the report has been \nmade available to this Senator or, to the best of my knowledge, to \nother Senators, but copies of the report were made available to the \nnews media as it suits the purposes of the Department of the Air Force \nand the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. President, in offering this amendment, it is my hope we will have \na statement of law requiring a report so we know what action is being \nconsidered in the future to protect personnel of the Department of \nDefense from terrorist attacks. News reports of the past week, an \narticle in the Washington Post a week ago yesterday, reported the \nSecretary of Defense expected to make a finding sometime during the \nmonth of July. It is my hope that when the Secretary of Defense speaks \non the subject, that he will go beyond the conduct of General \nSchwalier, which was criticized in the early report, and will pick up \nthe issues of the conduct of the Department of Defense generally.\n  Brigadier General Schwalier's conduct was criticized in the Downing \nreport, but, to my way of thinking, that is not nearly enough of an \nanswer as to the conduct beyond Brigadier General Schwalier, moving to \na four-star general, moving to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General Shalikashvili, and moving to the Secretary of Defense \nhimself, William J. Perry.\n  In this context, it is my judgment that the record shows forcefully \nand conclusively that there were warnings all along the line; that when \nyou have a fence 80 feet from living quarters of hundreds of Air Force \npersonnel within easy distance of a large bomb, a bomb, according to \ndefense estimates, the Secretary of Defense, of 3,000 to 5,000 pounds, \nsubstantially smaller than the experience of the 12,000-pound bomb in \nBeirut in 1983, that there was forceful, obvious, and conclusive \nneglect of duty. It goes beyond the brigadier general on the scene. It \ngoes to the commanding four star general, it goes to the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff and it goes to the Secretary of Defense.\n  If we are to have confidence in what the Secretary of Defense does in \nputting young men and women in harm's way, then there has to be \naccountability for the 19 airmen who died on June 25 in Khobar Towers \nand for the 400 who were wounded. That, Mr. President, is what I hope \nwill come from the findings of the Secretary of Defense.\n  In the meantime, this requirement for a report will be some help to \nthe future. But if we permit on this record those responsible, those in \nthe chain of command to go by unscathed, unreprimanded, unaccounted \nfor, then it is a blank check and open invitation for this kind of \nconduct to be repeated in the future.\n  The problems of terrorism are too serious to turn our back on what \nhappened at Dhahran on June 25, 1996. I personally consider inexcusable \nthat we have had more than a year pass and nothing has been said in an \nofficial way by the Department of Defense, the Department of the Air \nForce, and all of the components, this is to say nothing about who the \nterrorists are who have escaped punishment, and that is a matter which \nyet has to be reckoned with.\n  But within our own Department of Defense, we have a right to expect \nbetter, and I, for one, am awaiting the report of the Secretary of \nDefense to see what the position of the Department of Defense is. But \nat least as to the future, we will have some indication as to what \nprecautionary measures will be taken for the future, but there also has \nto be an answer for the past. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Closed Hearing: The Downing \n              Report on Khobor Towers, September 19, 1996\n\n       Chairman Specter. I am going to try to finish up in the \n     course of the next few minutes. It's been a long morning for \n     you, I know, gentlemen.\n       I want to go to Secretary Perry's testimony on his \n     articulation of the responsibility of the Secretary of \n     Defense, and what I want to try to do is get your insights, \n     your judgment, General Downing, having headed the task force \n     and having done the investigation, having a lot of experience \n     in the military, from 1962 when you graduated from West \n     Point, to 1996, when you had retired, this is what Secretary \n     Perry said as to his responsibility.\n       I manifest this responsibility in four important ways. \n     First of all, by establishing the policies and guidance for \n     our commanders, including the policy and guidance for force \n     protection.\n       I think I already know your answer from your report, but \n     was there an adequate policy and guidance on force \n     protection?\n       General Downing. No, there was not, Senator.\n       Chairman Specter. Secondly, by organizing and structuring \n     the Department of Defense in such a way that force protection \n     is optimal. And I would include in that his testimony later \n     where he said, quote, ``But General Downing is correct in \n     saying that we do not have a budgetary focus on force \n     protection, nor do we have a budgetary focus in our resource \n     allocation process, in the institutional process by which we \n     decide how to pass funds out to different programs.'' So did \n     they meet the, quote, ``organizing and structuring the \n     Department of Defense in such a way that force protection is \n     optimal.''\n       General Downing. The answer is no. We gave them some \n     recommendations on how to do that better.\n       Chairman Specter. And third, and I guess this is included \n     in what I just said, by allocating resources to our \n     commanders, including resources for force protection.\n       General Downing. Sir, we--that was one where we did not \n     find--we found that--there was not a good structure for it, \n     but that they had not been denied funds for force protection. \n     The field had not been denied funds for force protection.\n       Chairman Specter. And finally, by carefully selecting and \n     supervising the military and civilian leadership in the \n     Department of Defense--and I asked you if that was meant, \n     first as to the Secretary, and then as to the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff, who have these reports up from General Peay's unit as \n     to delegation of authority and guidance, etc. Was that \n     criterion met?\n       General Downing. Senator, I believe that the Secretary met \n     that and that the inherent responsibility of commanders for \n     force\n\n[[Page S6903]]\n\n     protection is something I don't believe the Secretary of \n     Defense has to tell a commander he needs to do.\n       Chairman Specter. How about as to the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff?\n       General Downing. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, we felt and we \n     recommended that they change those command relationships.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                             Select Committee on Intelligence,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 17, 1996.\n     Hon. Sheila E. Widnall,\n     Secretary of the Air Force,\n     The Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Widnall: As you know, the Committee is \n     reviewing the adequacy of intelligence support and its use by \n     consumers in the context of the recent terrorism incidents \n     affecting your forces in Saudi Arabia. Recently it came to \n     our attention that the Air Force completed a report entitled \n     ``Force Protection in Southwest Asia, An Air Force \n     Perspective,'' dated 17 September 1996. This report was \n     quoted in Washington Post article appearing October 10, 1996.\n       Since we have been unable to obtain a copy of the report \n     through your legislative liaison office, we are forwarding \n     our request for a copy of this report directly to you and ask \n     for your assistance. Given the widespread coverage of the \n     report in the media and its importance to our ongoing \n     oversight responsibilities, there can be little justification \n     for not promptly providing a copy to the Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter,\n       Chairman.\n     J. Robert Kerrey,\n       Vice Chairman.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n\n                                  Department of the Air Force,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 1996.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is in response to your joint letter \n     of October 17, 1996, regarding what you describe as a \n     document concerning force protection in Southwest Asia that \n     was referred to in a Washington Post article on October 10, \n     1996.\n       Contrary to the implications in the article, the Air Force \n     has not issued a report entitled ``Force Protection in \n     Southwest Asia, An Air Force Perspective.'' Rather, a \n     preliminary briefing was prepared by the Office of the Deputy \n     Chief of Staff, Plans and Operations, for internal use on the \n     consideration and evaluation of the protection of our forces \n     against terrorism following the bombing of Khobar Towers in \n     Saudi Arabia. That preliminary briefing has now been given to \n     Lieutenant General Record for his use in reviewing this \n     matter and considering issues of accountability. When \n     Lieutenant General Record's process is complete, we will be \n     glad to provide the Committee with the results of his review \n     and related official documents.\n       A similar letter is being provided to Vice Chairman Kerrey \n     who joined you in your letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Lansford E. Trapp, Jr.,\n                                    Director, Legislative Liaison.\n\n                               Exhibit 4\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                             Select Committee on Intelligence,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 5, 1996.\n     Hon. Sheila E. Widnall,\n     Secretary of the Air Force,\n     The Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Widnall: I want you to know that I consider \n     the letter from Brig. Gen. Lansford E. Trapp, Jr., of \n     November 6, 1996, totally insufficient in response to the \n     letter from Senator Kerrey and me to you dated October 17, \n     1996, and the copy of the letter which I sent to you dated \n     November 5, 1996, with the original going to Secretary Perry.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\n                                                Arlen Specter.\n\n                               Exhibit 5\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 12, 1996]\n\n    Air Force Inquiry Clears General in Saudi Bombing That Killed 19\n\n                           (By Eric Schmitt)\n\n       Washington.--The Air Force has concluded that the general \n     in charge of a military housing complex in Saudi Arabia where \n     19 Americans were killed and 500 wounded in a terrorist \n     truck-bombing last June took reasonable steps to protect \n     against attack and should not be punished in any way.\n       The finding contradicts a major conclusion of a separate \n     Pentagon investigation in September that singled out the Air \n     Force officer, Brig. Gen. Terryl Schwalier, for failing to \n     adequately safeguard the Khobar Towers complex in Dhahran, \n     where the blast occurred.\n       Senior Pentagon officials, who described the results of the \n     Air Force inquiry Wednesday on condition of anonymity, said \n     the Air Force found the deaths a terrible tragedy, but not \n     the fault of Schwalier.\n       The officials said the inquiry concludes that none of the \n     10 officers responsible for the safety of the troops in \n     Dhahran violated any laws, Air Force regulations or codes of \n     conduct.\n       Under military law, the Air Force decides who, if anyone, \n     should be held accountable for a disaster like the Dhahran \n     bombing. The punishments range from mild reprimands to court-\n     martial proceedings that can lead to prison terms. In this \n     case, the Air Force recommended that no punishment of any \n     kind was warranted.\n       Officials said Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall and Gen. \n     Ronald Fogleman, the Air Force chief of staff, had approved \n     the decision to exonerate the officers. They said that the \n     finding was expected to be announced later this month. \n     Defense Secretary William Perry has the authority to overrule \n     the Air Force decision, but Pentagon officials said that he \n     would be unlikely to do so.\n       ``Surely there is a desire to hang somebody for this,'' \n     said a senior Pentagon official who supports the Air Force \n     decision. ``But as you look back over the evidence it's \n     pretty hard without 20-20 hindsight to say, `I'd have done \n     that.' ''\n       The truck bomb exploded on Schwalier's last day as \n     commander of the air base and housing complex in Dhahran. He \n     is now in a Pentagon job overseeing Air Force operations and \n     is awaiting a promotion to major general.\n       ``It's the wrong call,'' one official involved in the \n     initial Pentagon investigation said of the Air Force's \n     decision to exonerate the general. ``It just bothers me from \n     standpoint of the families. It's not right.''\n       The question of responsibility in the bombing has caused \n     deep strains among the armed services.\n       While some senior officers have been reprimanded for their \n     roles in recent military disasters, it is rare for a general \n     to face court-martial.\n       When two Air Force F-15 fighters flying over northern Iraq \n     mistakenly shot down two U.S. Army helicopters in 1994, \n     killing all 26 people aboard, only a captain serving as a \n     weapons-control officer in an AWACS control place went to \n     trial. He was acquitted.\n       Similarly, none of the 16 officers, including two generals, \n     who were disciplined in connection with the crash in April in \n     Croatia that killed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and 34 \n     others, were court-martialed.\n       But a Defense Department investigation, headed by a retired \n     Army officer, Gen. Wayne A. Downing, issued a scathing report \n     that said Schwalier ``did not protect his forces from a \n     terrorist attack.''\n       The Pentagon report said Schwalier did not heed \n     intelligence reports that Khobar Towers was highly vulnerable \n     to terrorist attack, even though there had already been one \n     deadly terrorist bombing against U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.\n       Among a number of warnings was one eerily prescient. A \n     security officer wrote that the tightened security on the \n     base could lead terrorists to strike with a truck bomb at the \n     base's fence.\n       Air Force officials said they weighed the same evidence \n     that Downing's commission examined, but came to very \n     different conclusions about culpability.\n       Officials sympathetic to the Air Force position made \n     available Wednesday selected parts of a classified review the \n     Air Force conducted into the bombing. The review, written by \n     Lt. Gen. James F. Record, commander of the 12th Air Force, \n     cites, for example, the assessment of a senior U.S. \n     intelligence official in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, that the \n     intelligence reports given to Schwalier ``did not give a \n     target'' for a terrorist attack.\n       In addition, Record's review quotes the U.S. consul general \n     in Dhahran, David Winn, saying, ``No one really thought that \n     anything would happen in Dhahran.''\n       Air Force officials also said Schwalier took several steps \n     to protect the housing complex, from increasing the number of \n     guard posts to installing a double row of concrete highway \n     barriers around the fence-line.\n       Air Force officials acknowledged that those measures were \n     inadequate. ``There's no disagreement there,'' said the \n     senior Pentagon official who supports the Air Force decision. \n     ``The fact is, 19 people were killed. But then the issue \n     becomes, was there dereliction of duty?''\n       Record, who had the power to recommend Schwalier face \n     court-martial, concluded there was no such neglect of duty. \n     Widnall and Fogleman concurred.\n       ``People need to understand that accountability is a two-\n     edged sword,'' said the senior Pentagon official who supports \n     the Air Force decision. ``If you examine someone's actions \n     and you find them wanting, you hold them accountable. But if \n     you define that as court-martialing everyone, I can't live by \n     your definition.\n       ``At the same time, if you believe that person is not \n     culpable,'' the Pentagon official continued, ``then it's \n     every bit your obligation to stand up and defend that person. \n     If you don't do that, you'll erode the fighting spirit of \n     commanders. You'll have people looking over their shoulders. \n     They'll always know they'll be second-guessed by people in \n     Washington.''\n       The attack in Saudi Arabia continues to create thorny \n     problems for the Clinton administration. In response to FBI \n     complaints that Saudi officials had been uncooperative in \n     what was to have been a joint inquiry, Riyadh has recently \n     turned over information to support its contention that the \n     bombing plot was heavily supported by Iran.\n       The information included videotaped interviews with some of \n     the several dozens suspects arrested after the bombing. But \n     some law enforcement officials expressed skepticism over the \n     interviews, saying they lacked credibility because the \n     confessions may have been obtained under duress.\n\n[[Page S6904]]\n\n       The Air Force signaled months ago it did not believe \n     Schwalier was to blame. In an internal review that paralleled \n     Downing's inquiry, Air Force officials said Schwalier's \n     responsibility extended only to the fenced perimeter of the \n     base.\n       Beyond that, the responsibility for security belonged to \n     the Saudis. The truck bomb exploded in a parking lot just \n     outside the base's property.\n\n                               Exhibit 6\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                             Select Committee on Intelligence,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 12, 1996.\n     Hon. Sheila E. Widnall,\n     Secretary of the Air Force, The Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Widnall: Please reference my letters to you \n     of October 17, November 5, and December 5, 1996.\n       According to The New York Times today, selected portions of \n     the Air Force report on Dhahran have already been made \n     available to the news media by representatives of the Air \n     Force who are favorably disposed to the Air Force report.\n       I would like your prompt advice as to whether that news \n     report is accurate.\n       In any event, this is a formal demand that the report be \n     turned over to the Intelligence Committee forthwith.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n                               Exhibit 7\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 15, 1997]\n\n                         Secretary Cohen's Call\n\n       It will be interesting to see if Defense Secretary William \n     Cohen has the moxie to hold the Air Force accountable for \n     security failures in Saudi Arabia last year. So far the \n     Pentagon's handling of the terrorist bombing in Dhahran that \n     killed 19 American airmen and wounded 500 has followed a \n     dismally familiar script. The Air force high command has \n     sloughed off responsibility, betting that top civilians will \n     once again bow to the shopworn argument that punishing \n     individual commanders is unfair and would damage morale.\n       Mr. Cohen, who knew how to cut through thicker Pentagon \n     smokescreens as a Senator, can set an admirably exacting \n     standard for his stewardship as Defense Secretary by \n     overturning the Air Force decision. The principle of civilian \n     leadership of the military requires the application of \n     independent judgment in cases like this. Since Air Force \n     Secretary Sheila Widnall seems a willing captive of her \n     service, Mr. Cohen must show that accountability in the \n     American military is not governed by the protective instincts \n     of the officer corps.\n       The security breakdown at the Khobar Towers apartment \n     complex in Dhahran last June is beyond dispute. Though \n     safeguards were enforced to prevent a suicide truck bomber \n     from entering the compound, the towers were left exposed to \n     attack from a nearby parking area. When a large truck bomb \n     was detonated there last June, the explosion sheared off the \n     northern facade of two towers.\n       The perimeter security fence was barely 35 yards from the \n     buildings. Despite intelligence warnings about a possible \n     terrorist attack, Air Force commanders made only a feeble \n     effort to extend the perimeter. Even the most elementary and \n     inexpensive defense--covering windows with a plastic film to \n     prevent shattering--was not used. Many of the deaths and \n     injuries were caused by flying glass.\n       These and other lapses were made plain in a Pentagon \n     investigation conducted by a retired Army general, Wayne \n     Downing. The Downing report concluded that Brig. Gen. Terryl \n     Schwalier, the Air Force commander in Dhahran, ``did not \n     adequately protect his forces from a terrorist attack.'' \n     General Schwalier did not even bother to make security a \n     primary concern on his watch.\n       Now comes Gen. Ronald Fogleman, the Air Force Chief of \n     Staff, arguing that the case for accountability is nothing \n     more than a Washington scalp hunt. His view, in essence, is \n     that General Schwalier and his staff did everything they \n     reasonably could to secure the compound and that the method \n     and explosive power of the bombing exceeded any threat that \n     could have been anticipated.\n       Yet the destruction of the Alfred Murrah Federal Building \n     in Oklahoma City 14 months before the Dhahran attack showed \n     the power of a large truck bomb placed near but not inside a \n     high-rise building. It was lesson enough for the Secret \n     Service, which quickly closed a stretch of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue to expand the security perimeter around the White \n     House.\n       General Fogleman mistakes his own blind loyalty for \n     leadership. Morale is not served by dodging responsibility \n     and circling the wagons around a fellow officer. Perhaps \n     honor and duty are just quaint notions these days, but Mr. \n     Cohen might actually do wonders for the morale of Americans \n     in uniform if he rules that the Air Force cannot escape \n     responsibility for its failures in Dhahran.\n\n                               Exhibit 8\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 1997.\n     Hon. Sheila Widnall,\n     Secretary, Department of the Air Force, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Widnall: I have noted repeated press \n     accounts on an Air Force report on the responsibility, if \n     any, for the terrorist attack at Dhahran on June 25, 1996.\n       As you know, I have made repeated requests for copies of \n     all DoD, including Air Force, reports on this incident.\n       According to press reports, Secretary of Defense William \n     Cohen is personally reviewing this matter.\n       I would very much appreciate it if you would promptly \n     provide to me a copy of any report on assessing \n     responsibility for the Dhahran terrorist attack of June 25, \n     1996.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few minutes to \ndiscuss an amendment I am offering to this year's DOD authorization \nbill that will make a real difference in the lives of all members of \nthe naval service--and eventually all members of our Armed Forces. It \nwill eliminate many long lines and hours of frustration, it will \nsubstantially reduce recordkeeping errors and it will save the DOD and \nthe taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. And it represents the \nnext phase of the effective utilization of smart card technology--a \ntechnology I have been encouraging and working on for many years.\n  Mr. President, when a new recruit joins the service today, he or she \nfaces a long and tedious registration process. A typical new recruit \nfaces hours of waiting in line to fill out forms with his or her name, \ndate of birth, rank, military I.D. number, and so forth, only to be \nsent over to another line to fill out another form with much of the \nsame information again. Not only is this process aggravating for our \nnew recruits--it is a waste of the Armed Service's time and personnel. \nIt takes dozens of people countless hours to process in each new \nrecruit through this inefficient system, costing the service valuable \ntime and money, that it could be putting to better use elsewhere.\n  Once registered, a new recruit is issued a handful of ID's and cards \nto carry. A typical service member today might be required to carry a \ngeneral ID card, an immunization card, a meal card, an equipment card, \na weapons card, a military driver's license, a vehicle registration, a \ncard to pick up mail, a card to carry if staying as a guest at another \nbase, and if lucky enough to be stationed near some good fishing, a \nfishing permit. With so much clutter, it is not uncommon for a service \nmember to misplace one of their cards, which wastes even more of the \nmilitary's time and resources replacing them.\n  For years, I have been looking at ways that the military could \nstreamline the methods it uses for its registration and recordkeeping, \nlooking for a way to improve what I saw as an outdated and inefficient \nsystem of issuing multiple cards containing duplicate information.\n  The Government and the private sector have been using cards for years \nas a means of information storage. Many of the earliest cards had just \na name and number much like the Social Security card that is still in \nuse today. As the need for increased security and efficiency in the \ntransfer of information from a card grew however, we saw the \nintroduction of cards that relied on new information storage systems \nlike bar codes and magnetic stripes, much like the kind found on \ntoday's credit cards, ATM cards, telephone calling cards, and in dozens \nof other card-based applications. And as the technological capabilities \nof cards have increased, so has the number of cards that each of us \ncarries every time we leave our residence.\n  Mr. President, we now stand on the brink of a new explosion in card \ntechnology, one that promises to offer us even greater convenience and \nefficiency in everyday life, saving money and time while increasing our \ncontrol over the information we provide to others. After years of \nresearch and development, I am pleased to report that a new user-\nfriendly card technology will soon allow us to replace the handful of \ncards now used in the DOD with a single, multiapplication ``smart'' \ncard.\n  Mr. President, with the amendment that I am offering today, next \nyear,\n\n[[Page S6905]]\n\nunder a pilot program that I have been working closely with the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of the Navy to develop, a new \nrecruit will not face the long and wasteful lines, the duplication of \ninformation or the cumbersome bundles of cards that many of us \nremember. Instead, upon arriving at boot camp, each new sailor and \nmarine will be issued a single card: the MARC card. Short for \nMultitechnology Automated Reader Card this card will be used across the \nentire Navy and Marine Corps next year, and if it works as well as some \nof us believe it will, we will then extend it to all of the Armed \nForces.\n  The MARC card is a remarkable achievement. The MARC card can carry \nyour security clearance. The MARC card can carry your meal information. \nThe MARC card can hold your immunization records. The MARC card can \nserve as your room key.\n  Mr. President, the long-term savings that will result from this \nprogram will be substantial; the improvements in the increased speed \nand quality of services will be enormous. With the MARC card, we can \nreduce support infrastructure, thereby improving our tooth-to-tail \nratio while making our sailors' and marines' lives easier.\n  The MARC card is one of the first widespread applications of the most \nexciting new card technology on the market today: the smart card. Smart \ncards, like the MARC card, rely on an integrated circuit chip--a \nmicrochip--to store more information and data than was ever before \npossible on a single card. Within each card is a small microprocessor \nalong with a sizable memory capacity, which gives each smart card the \ncapabilities of a small microcomputer.\n  The capabilities of the smart card are so great that a single card \ncan perform all of the functions that this entire stack of cards that I \nam holding up right here used to perform of still perform today, for \nthat matter, and will perform dozens of new time-saving applications as \nwell. Unlike older cards, the smart card is easily updatable, and has \nthe capability to constantly take on new information.\n  Yet the real strength of smart cards, like the MARC card lies not in \nthe convenience of carrying so much information on a single card, but \nin the money that we can save as a result. By harnessing the strength \nand memory of a small computer inside of a portable plastic card, a \nmultitude of new applications can be offered that will increase the \nefficiency of Government, cutting down expensive and unnecessary \nadministrative costs while reducing waste, fraud, and abuse at all \nlevels of government.\n  Mr. President, I have seen this card in action, and the savings and \nincreased efficiency it can offer the members of our Armed Forces are \nreally impressive.\n  In the past, when our sailors would dock at a naval base upon their \nreturn from sea they faced a long and tedious process of waiting in \nline after line to check in to their shore station. Often taking up to \na week a sailor would need to fill out countless forms to register for \nquarters, for medical treatment, for security clearance, for his next \nassignment, for the mess hall et cetera.\n  But today at the Smart Base in Pascagoula, MS, the first naval base \nto automate its operations using the MARC card, a sailor who arrives \noff of the U.S.S. Yorktown faces a check-in time of just a few \nminutes. By simply walking up to a kiosk, he can insert his MARC card \ninto a reader not unlike an automatic teller machine, and within \nseconds be assigned his quarters and other necessary information, while \npersonal data needed by the command is simultaneously zipped \nelectronically around the rest of the base. His MARC card even serves \nas his room key.\n\n  Not only does this process save sailors a lot of wasted time, but it \nreduces the number of administrative staff needed to check in an entire \nship. To process every sailor from an arriving ship, a base need only \nhave a handful of staff on hand and a few kiosks that interact with the \nMARC card.\n  Mr. President, the MARC card can improve the efficiency of every \noperation across the military. Let me give you an example. Today, when \na sailor or marine heads to a mess hall to eat, he has to show his ID \ncard, as well as his meal card to one of the duty personnel, who \ntediously records the information from both cards by hand into a \nledger. After each meal another officer must spend hours reconciling \nwho ate what on that particular day, at a great expense both in the \ntime involved and the money it costs. On average, it takes a mess hall \n4 to 6 hours a day to account for all the meals that are eaten.\n  With the MARC card, however, sailors and marines will simply swipe \ntheir cards through a reader as they enter the mess hall and be \nautomatically accounted for by a computer. Anyone who tries to sneak an \nextra meal without paying is caught in the act, which helps the Navy \nreduce fraud. After each meal, the officer in charge of the mess hall \nwill only need to call up a file on their computer to account for the \nmeals served. The total time involved is reduced from several hours to \njust a few minutes.\n  Not only will this project save the Navy time and money--the food \nservice savings alone will save over $2 million in the first year, a \nsavings of 49 percent--it will also allow our Armed Forces to allocate \nmore resources to the duties they most need to focus on. From security \naccess to dining hall access, from checking out weapons to checking out \nlibrary books, the MARC card can save the Armed Forces thousands of \nhours a year in wasted administrative costs.\n  The $36 million I am asking for in this amendment does not authorize \nany new spending--it only redirects the use of $36 million within the \nNavy and Marines O account that has already been authorized by the \ncommittee. Because the MARC card program has been so effective in \nreducing the costs of general administration in the military, our \ninvestment of $36 million in an expansion of the MARC program will save \nthe Navy and Marines O account many millions more in fiscal year 1998 \nand beyond.\n  By investing $36 million, in the MARC program, the Navy's project \nmanager, estimates that the savings to O from using the three MARC \napplications, already in place across the Navy and Marines will top \n$134 million in FY 98.\n  Now that's just the savings from using the MARC card in three \napplications--Food Service, Security Access, and Clearance \nVerification.\n  As other applications are deployed, the savings may top $200 million \nin just FY 98, and well over $500 million over the next 5 years.\n  Mr. President, with the budget situation, that we face today we are \ncompelled to look to all areas of the government to eliminate needless \nadministrative services and streamline the many duties that our \ngovernment performs.\n  In this era of reinventing government, smart card technology has \npotential applications not just in the military but all across the \ngovernment.\n  By eliminating long waits in lines at government agencies, by \neliminating the manual entry of data all across government agencies, by \ndoing away with duplication of data across the government by \neliminating fraud, smart cards can slash the administrative costs of \ngovernment while improving the quality and speed with which many \ngovernment services are delivered.\n  Mr. President, the technology is here, in our hands, and the savings \nto be had are real, immediate, and substantial. I firmly believe that \nwe should move forward with applying smart card technology, not only in \nthe military, but all across the government.\n  Mr. President, I realize that smart cards are still a new technology \nright now, and that they're unfamiliar to many potential users.\n  I am aware that some people are uncomfortable with the idea of having \na single card for everything they need.\n  Placing so much information on a single card raises more than a few \neyebrows over privacy and security concerns.\n  And I know that a lot of people are concerned that by placing so much \npersonal information on a single card an employer might have access to \nmedical records, or a librarian might be able to find out what you ate \nfor lunch that day.\n  Let me say that I share these concerns.\n  But in fact, Mr. President, while all this information may be carried \non a\n\n[[Page S6906]]\n\nsingle card, powerful encryption technology ensures that personal \ninformation is seen only by those who the individual wants to see it.\n  The technology available today allows us to select what information \nis carried on our smart card and guarantees that we are the only ones \nwho can grant access to that information.\n  Even though we can store our financial and medical records on the \nsame smart card the card's microchip is divided into separate \ncompartments that make it impossible for our bank to see our medical \nrecords and our doctor to see our last bank deposit.\n  And if we should lose our card, anybody who finds it will discover \nthat it's useless to them.\n  Because without the proper authorization code that only the \nindividual knows--and with more sensitive applications, without \nbiometric authentication like hand geometry scanners--the card won't \nwork in the hands of anybody but its owner.\n  Just as our ATM card is useless to a thief without the proper PIN \nnumber, a thief will find that, without authentication by its owner, a \nstolen smart card is a worthless piece of plastic.\n  In an era where our personal information is becoming increasingly \neasier for others to access, where our very personal and private \nactivities can be electronically tracked, smart cards are a way to \nreturn control over this information where it belongs: in the hands of \nthe individual.\n  And with modern-day encryption and other security measures built into \nthe chip on a smart card, the information on this card is more secure \nfrom theft or fraud than any credit card or ATM card in use today.\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt of the need for increased \nefficiency, security, and portability of information across all sectors \nof our Government.\n  We have the technology, literally, in our hands to make it happen.\n  Already, several other Government agencies have begun to implement \nthis technology in a variety of applications across Government.\n  Today, for example, smart cards are used as identification and \nsecurity badges in Government buildings.\n  In States like Wyoming, pilot programs are underway to use smart \ncards to electronically disburse WIC and food stamp benefits.\n  In several western States, a smart card called the health passport is \nbeing used to increase the portability and accessibility of an \nindividual's medical records while safeguarding their confidentiality.\n  At colleges like the University of Michigan, a single smart card can \ncall up a student's financial aid records, buy her books, and open the \ndoor of her dorm.\n  On our subways, and our military bases, in our hospitals, and our \nschools, across the public and private sector, smart cards can cut down \nthe time we spend on burdensome administrative work and save us \nvaluable time and resources.\n  But the reason I'm so enthusiastic about this new technology, Mr. \nPresident, is not just because smart cards can eliminate waste.\n  I'm not here speaking today simply because smart cards can save us \ntime and money.\n  I'm strongly supportive of this new technology because smart cards \ncan make our lives better and easier.\n  Whether it's reducing the time we wait in line at a government office \nor providing a doctor the information needed to save a life smart cards \ncan make our entire infrastructure more user-friendly and efficient; \nsmart cards make technology work better for us.\n  I am confident that pilot smart card programs, like the MARC program, \nwill demonstrate the effectiveness of smart cards and the need for this \ntechnology across government, and will lead to increased use of this \ntechnology in our future.\n  That's why I'm so excited about it, and that's why I'm so pleased the \nmanagers seem willing to include this provision in their manager's \namendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I just want to commend the Senator from \nVirginia on his amendment. It is a very thoughtful amendment, the \nproduct of months, and, indeed, years of work by Senator Robb. I hope \nthat in the next day or two we will be able to work with the majority \nto see this amendment is adopted.\n  I want to commend the Senator on his constant attack on waste and his \nconstant effort to achieve efficiency, not just in the military, but \nall branches of Government.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan. I did not \ndisplay my own MARC card here, but it is my hope that in the not-too-\ndistant future not only will all members of the Armed Services, but all \nmembers who interact or interface with our Federal Government will have \none of these and be able to use them in the same efficient way that the \nMARC card is being used today, and is being used in this particular \nexperiment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I want to say to the able Senator from Virginia, \nSenator Robb, that you made a very interesting discourse here. What the \nSenator is recommending appears to deserve serious consideration. That \nconsideration, I am sure, will be given by the committee.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee and the \nsenior Senator from South Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/07/senate-section/article/S6877-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

MELVILLE BROUGHTON, JR\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, North Carolina lost a very special, very \nvaluable and very distinguished leader this past April. He was known \naffectionately and respectfully across our State, and far beyond in \nevery direction, simply as Mel Broughton. His full name was J. Melville \nBroughton, Jr., but you seldom heard all of that name.\n  Mel Broughton, by all measurements, was one of those nature's \nnoblemen who comes along only once in a while. Though his family was \none of North Carolina's most distinguished, Mel Broughton was one of \nthe least pretentious men I have ever known.\n  His grandfather was North Carolina's Governor during the World War II \nyears, 1941 to 1944. And in November 1948, former Governor Broughton \nwas elected to the U.S. Senate. But fate was to allow Senator Broughton \nto serve in the U.S. Senate only a few months, because he had been \nsworn in as a Senator shortly after his having been elected in November \n1948 but he died of a heart attack the following March.\n  Incidentally, Mr. President, misfortune hovered over North Carolina \nthroughout the 10-year period between the late 1940's and the following \n10 years. Our State had a succession of 10 U.S. Senators during that \ndecade. Five of them died in office; three were defeated in their \nreelection bids; and the two surviving Senators of that decade were Sam \nJ. Ervin, Jr. and B. Everett Jordan. Senator Ervin served 20 years; \nSenator Jordan served 17.\n\n  But let me return, Mr. President, to Mel Broughton, Jr., who was \nhonored by North Carolina's general assembly on June 26 of this year \nwhen both Houses of our State legislature adopted ``A joint resolution \nhonoring the life and memory of J. Melville Broughton, Jr.''\n  As that resolution states, Mel Broughton was devoted to North \nCarolina and to the people of our State. And he served in countless \nways. Only once did he venture into Federal service, and that was when \nPresident Ford nominated him to serve on the board of directors of the \nU.S. Legal Services Corporation. And during those years, one of his \ncolleagues on the Legal Services Corporation board was a young lady who \ntoday is the First Lady of America, Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n  Mr. President, needless to say, Dot Helms and I have long been \ndevoted to the Mel Broughton family. As a matter of fact, Mel's \nparents, Governor and Mrs. Broughton, were very dear to us and \nthoughtful to us in so many ways.\n  And last, but certainly not least, I am privileged that Mel \nBroughton's son--one of them--whom all of us call Jimmy, is \nadministrative assistant and\n\n[[Page S6907]]\n\nthereby leader of the Helms Senate family. I do not have a staff. The \nfine, dedicated people in our offices are truly a family.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the June 26, 1997, \nresolution adopted by the North Carolina General Assembly honoring Mel \nBroughton be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Joint Resolution by the General Assembly of North Carolina June 26, \n 1997 Honoring the Life and Memory of J. Melville Broughton, Jr.--June \n                                26, 1997\n\n       Whereas, J. Melville Broughton, Jr., a lifelong resident of \n     the City of Raleigh was born on March 24, 1922, and attended \n     Wake Forest University, Duke University, and graduated from \n     the University of North Carolina School of Law; and\n       Whereas, J. Melville Broughton, Jr., proudly served his \n     country in World War II as a First Lieutenant in the United \n     States Marine Corps; and\n       Whereas, following his admission to the North Carolina \n     State Bar, J. Melville Broughton, Jr., served for four years \n     as a prosecutor in Raleigh Municipal Court and then entered \n     the general practice of law with the firm founded by his \n     father (now known as Broughton, Wilkins, Webb and Sugg) where \n     he remained for 45 years; and\n       Whereas, from 1957 to 1961, J. Melville Broughton, Jr., \n     served as Chairman of the North Carolina Highway Commission, \n     and later under Governor Dan K. Moore served as the Chairman \n     of the North Carolina Democratic Party; and finally in 1968, \n     ran for the Democratic nomination for Governor against then \n     Lieutenant Governor Robert Scott and Reginald Hawkins, \n     finishing second in the primary; and\n       Whereas, J. Melville Broughton, Jr., was devoted to his \n     State above all else and counted among his friends and those \n     he supported at the polls both Democrats and Republicans; \n     and, indeed, his bipartisanship was such that in 1975, \n     President Gerald Ford nominated him to the National Legal \n     Services Board, which was dedicated to providing legal \n     representation to indigent persons; and\n       Whereas, J. Melville Broughton, Jr., was an active and \n     lifelong member of Christ Episcopal Church in Raleigh and was \n     involved in the Laubach Literacy national movement; and\n       Whereas, J. Melville Broughton, Jr., was a beloved figure \n     in this General Assembly and in our entire State, warming us \n     with his easy laugh and ready smile; his tall, rumpled \n     figure, with his coat pocket full of pencil stubs, moving \n     gregariously among all sorts and conditions of men, \n     encouraging, listening, advising, and at all times embodying \n     the very essence of a true Christian gentleman; and\n       Whereas, J. Melville Broughton, Jr., passed away on April \n     17, 1997, and is survived by his wife, Mary Ann Cooper \n     Broughton; his daughter, Harriet B.

Thus, I reserve the right to support or \noppose the provisions of, as well as any amendment to, this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, together with the transmittal letter and the \nenclosed section-by-section analysis of the draft legislation which \naccompanied it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 986\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Subsection (a) provides that the draft bill may be \n     cited as the ``Veterans' Housing Loan Improvements Act of \n     1997.''\n       Subsection (b) provides that, unless otherwise specified, \n     whenever in the Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in \n     terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other \n     provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a \n     section or other provision of title 38, United States Code.\n       Sec. 2. Subsection (a) of section 2 would replace the \n     existing section 3729, which imposes fees on most persons \n     obtaining or assuming a loan guaranteed or made by VA, with \n     new, simplified language. The new section 3729 would contain \n     an easy to read chart showing the appropriate fee depending \n     on the type of loan and category of borrower.\n       The revised section would make permanent the increases in \n     the fees enacted by section 12007 of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 93). That enactment \n     increased the fees for most VA guaranteed housing loans by 75 \n     basis points, or 0.75 percent of the loan amount, and imposed \n     a fee of 3 percent of the loan on most veterans who had \n     previously obtained a VA housing loan. These provisions are \n     now set to expire on September 30, 1998.\n       In addition, the revised section 3729 increases the fee \n     from 1.00 to 2.25 percent on loans made by VA in connection \n     with the sale of VA-owned properties (vendee loans). Vendee \n     loans are available to members of the public and are not a \n     veterans benefit. This new fee would be set at the maximum \n     initial mortgage insurance premium that the Federal Housing \n     Administration (FHA) is permitted to charge for most single \n     family mortgages. FHA also charges annual premiums that would \n     not be authorized for VA. This section would also give VA \n     discretion to issue regulations changing the fee charged for \n     vendee loans if VA finds that a different amount is necessary \n     so that this fee is consistent with the fees charged by other \n     departments for similar loans, or if the Secretary determines \n     that considerations of the market for properties sold by VA \n     necessitate a different fee.\n       Except as noted above, the fee structure remains unchanged. \n     The exemption from the fee in the current law given to \n     certain disabled veterans and surviving spouses remains \n     unchanged.\n       Subsection (b) would make the increased fee for vendee \n     loans apply to all loans closed on or after October 1, 1997.\n       Sec. 3. Section 3 would repeal paragraph (11) of section \n     3732(c). This would make the no-bid formula permanent. As \n     amended by section 12006 of OBRA 93, the no-bid formula \n     requires VA to consider, in addition to other costs, VA's \n     loss on the resale of the property. The no-bid formula \n     currently applies to all loans closed before October 1, 1998, \n     regardless of the date the loan is terminated. This amendment \n     would repeal the sunset.\n       Sec. 4. Section 4 would make permanent VA's authority, \n     contained in 38 U.S.C. Sec. 3720(h), to guarantee the \n     certificates sold to investors when VA vendee loans are \n     securitized. Since June 1988, vendee loans have been sold to \n     a trust, which issues securities based on the pooled loans. \n     Prior to the enactment of Public Law 102-291 in 1992, VA \n     provided a full faith and credit guaranty on the vendee loans \n     sold to the trust. VA could not, however, directly guarantee \n     the certificates issued by the trust. Guaranteeing the \n     certificates rather than the loans significantly increases \n     the VA's net proceeds from such sales, but does not \n     significantly change VA's exposure to loss. VA's authority to \n     guarantee the certificates currently has a sunset of December \n     31, 1997.\n       Sec. 5. Section 5 would repeal section 3726. Section 3726 \n     currently prohibits VA, in most cases, from offsetting \n     against Federal payments, other than VA benefits, debts owed \n     to the Government resulting from the foreclosure of VA \n     guaranteed or direct housing loans. This provision would \n     permit VA to collect these debts by offsetting Federal \n     salaries and income tax refunds as permitted by other Federal \n     debt collection laws. The right of veterans to challenge the \n     existence and amount of the debt through VA's normal \n     administrative process, including review by the Court of \n     Veterans Appeals, and to seek waiver of the debt under \n     current law would not be altered.\n       Sec. 6. Section 6 would consolidate the funding sources for \n     the VA housing loan programs (except the pilot program for \n     direct loans to native American Veterans) into a new fund in \n     the Treasury.\n       Subsection (a) would repeal sections 3723, 3724, and 3725 \n     which provide for the Direct Loan Revolving Fund (DLRF), the \n     Loan Guaranty Revolving Fund (LGRF), and the Guaranty and \n     Indemnity Fund (GIF), respectively. Those three funds \n     currently provide the source of moneys for the VA housing \n     loan programs (except the pilot program for direct loans to \n     Native American veterans).\n       Subsection (b) would add a new section 3722 which would \n     establish in the Treasury a new fund to be known as the \n     ``Veterans Housing Benefit Program Fund.'' This new fund, \n     consistent with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, would \n     be available, without fiscal year limitation, for all VA \n     housing loan operations (except the pilot program for direct \n     loans to Native American veterans).\n       The total available balances of the DLRF, LGRF, and GIF as \n     of September 30, 1997, would be deposited into this new fund. \n     Beginning October 1, 1997, all appropriations to the VA \n     housing loan program would go into this new fund. In \n     addition, beginning on that date, the new Veterans Housing \n     Benefit Program Fund would receive all income from the loan \n     program including, but not limited to, loan repayments, \n     income from the sale, rental, or other use of acquired \n     foreclosed properties, income from the sale of loans, and \n     loan user fees.\n       Subsection (c) would make this section effective October 1, \n     1997.\n       Sec. 7. Section 7 would extend for two years; i.e., until \n     September 30, 1999, the sunset for VA's pilot program \n     (sections 3761-3764) to make direct loans to Native American \n     veterans living on trust land.\n       Sec. 8. Section 8 would make conforming amendments to \n     various sections of title 38 and other statutes.\n       Subsection (a) would make a conforming amendment to section \n     2106(e).\n       Subsection (b) would make a conforming amendment to section \n     3703(e)(1).\n       Subsection (c) would make a conforming amendment to section \n     3711(k).\n       Subsection (d) would repeal the obsolete subsection (e) of \n     section 3720. That subsection authorized VA to sell \n     participation certificates in connection with the Federal \n     National Mortgage Association. Such certificates have not \n     been sold since the 1960s and all outstanding certificates \n     have been redeemed.\n       Subsection (e) would make a conforming amendment to section \n     3727(c).\n       Subsection (f) would make conforming amendments to section \n     3733(a)(6).\n       Subsection (g) would also remove the obsolete section \n     3733(e). That provision, pertaining to the crediting of the \n     proceeds from the sale of loans by VA, was repealed by \n     implication by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.\n       Subsection (h) would make conforming amendments to section \n     3734. It would also strike out the requirement for VA to \n     report to the Congress regarding Government credits and \n     investment income to the GIF, which were repealed by \n     implication by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.\n       Subsection (i) would make a conforming amendment to section \n     3735(a)(3)(A)(i).\n       Subsection (j) would make a technical correction to the \n     catchline for section 3763.\n       Subsection (k) would make conforming amendments to the \n     table of sections for subchapter III of chapter 37.\n       Subsection (l) would make a conforming amendment to the \n     table of sections for subchapter V of chapter 37.\n       Subsection (m) would make a conforming amendment to section \n     7(h)(2)(B) of Public Law 102-54, as amended, (38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1718 note).\n\n[[Page S6910]]\n\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                            The Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: There is transmitted herewith a draft \n     bill ``[t]o amend title 38, United States Code, to make \n     certain improvements in the housing loan programs for \n     veterans and eligible persons, and for other purposes.'' I \n     request that this bill be referred to the appropriate \n     committee for prompt consideration and enactment.\n       This measure, entitled the ``Veterans' Housing Loan \n     Improvements Act of 1997,'' would make amendments to the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs' housing loan programs that \n     would save costs, provide management efficiencies, and extend \n     the sunset on two expiring authorities.\n       The draft bill would permanently extend several cost-saving \n     measures originally enacted by the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993, increase the funding fee \n     for ``vendee'' loans available to the general public, \n     consolidate the funding for the housing loan program into one \n     new account, and permit VA to collect housing loan debts \n     through offset against other Federal payments in the same \n     manner as all other Federal debts are now being collected. \n     The bill would also make permanent VA's enhanced vendee loan \n     sales authority, and extend for 2 years the pilot program for \n     direct loans to Native American veterans.\n       A detailed section-by-section analysis of the draft bill is \n     enclosed.\n       VA estimates that enactment of the draft bill would produce \n     first year loan subsidy savings of approximately $156 million \n     in FY 1998 and $3.283 billion over five years. Extending the \n     OBRA 93 provisions, increasing the fee on vendee loans, and \n     allowing VA to collect housing loan debts by setoff will \n     produce subsidy savings. There is no additional subsidy \n     appropriation required to extend the pilot program for direct \n     loans to Native American veterans since the program has not \n     fully expended the subsidy initially appropriated by Public \n     Law 102-389.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this draft bill to the \n     Congress, and that it's enactment would be in accord with the \n     Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jesse Brown.\n       Enclosures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (by request):\n  S. 987. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize a \ncost-of-living adjustment in the rates of disability compensation for \nveterans with service-connected disabilities and dependency and \nindemnity compensation for survivors of such veterans and to revise and \nimprove certain veterans compensation, pension, and memorial affairs \nprograms; and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n\n\n   the veterans' compensation cost-of-living adjustment and benefits \n                    program improvement act of 1997\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, I have today introduced, at the request of the Secretary of \nVeterans' Affairs, S. 987, the proposed Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-\nLiving Adjustment and Benefits Program Improvement Act of 1997. The \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs submitted this legislation to the \nPresident of the Senate by letter dated May 9, 1997.\n  My introduction of this measure is in keeping with the policy which I \nhave adopted of generally introducing--so that there will be specific \nbills to which my colleagues and others may direct their attention and \ncomments--all administration-proposed draft legislation referred to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs. Thus, I reserve the right to support or \noppose the provisions of, as well as any amendment to, this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, together with the transmittal letter which \naccompanied it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 987\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

INCREASE IN COMPENSATION RATES AND LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--(1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     shall, as provided in paragraph (2), increase, effective \n     December 1, 1997, the rates of and limitations on Department \n     of Veterans Affairs disability compensation and dependency \n     and indemnity compensations.\n       (2) The Secretary shall increase each of the rates and \n     limitations in sections 1114, 1115(1), 1162, 1311, 1313, and \n     1314 of title 38, United States Code, that were increased by \n     the amendments made by the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-\n     Living Adjustment Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-263; 110 Stat. \n     3212). This increase shall be made in such rates and \n     limitations as in effect on November 30, 1997, and shall be \n     by the same percentage that benefit amounts payable under \n     title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) \n     are increased effective December 1, 1997, as a result of a \n     determination under section 215(i) of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     415(i)).\n       (b) Special Rule.--The Secretary may adjust \n     administratively, consistent with the increases made under \n     subsection (a)(2), the rates of disability compensation \n     payable to persons within the purview of section 10 of Public \n     Law 85-857 (72 Stat. 1263) who are not in receipt of \n     compensation payable pursuant to chapter 11 of title 38, \n     United States Code.\n       (c) Publication Requirement.--At the same time as the \n     matters specified in section 215(i)(2)(D) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)(2)(D)) are required to be \n     published by reason of a determination made under section \n     215(i) of such Act during fiscal year 1998, the Secretary \n     shall publish in the Federal Register the rates and \n     limitations referred to in subsection (a)(2) as increased \n     under this section.\n\n     SEC. 102. ROUNDING DOWN OF COMPENSATION-RATE INCREASES\n\n       In computing rates and limitations pursuant to legislation \n     enacted for fiscal years 1998 and thereafter which increases \n     by a specified percentage, or which directs the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs to adjust administratively, the rates and \n     limitations in sections 1114, 1115(1), 1162, 1311, 1313, and \n     1314 of title 38, United States Code, the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs shall round down to the next lower whole-\n     dollar amount any amount which as so computed is not an even \n     multiple of $1.\n\n     SEC. 103. EXTENSION OF INCOME-VERIFICATION AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) Section 5317 is amended by striking out subsection (g).\n       (b) Subparagraph (D) of section 6103(1)(7) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to disclosure of return \n     information to Federal, State, and local agencies \n     administering certain programs) is amended by striking \n     ``Clause (viii) shall not apply after September 30, 1998.''.\n\n     SEC. 104.

Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Transmitted herewith is a draft bill, \n     the ``Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment and \n     Benefit programs Improvement Act of 1997,'' to authorize a \n     cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for fiscal year (FY) 1998 in \n     the rates of disability compensation and dependency and \n     indemnity compensation (DIC), and to revise and improve \n     certain veterans compensation, pension, and memorial affairs \n     programs, and for other purposes. I request that this draft \n     bill be referred to the appropriate committee for prompt \n     consideration and enactment.\n       Section 101 of the draft bill would direct the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs to increase administratively the rates of \n     compensation for service-disabled veterans and of DIC for the \n     survivors of veterans whose deaths are service related, \n     effective December 1, 1997. The rate of increase would be the \n     same as the COLA that will be provided under current law to \n     veterans' pension and Social Security recipients, which is \n     currently estimated to be 2.7 percent. We believe this \n     proposed COLA is necessary and appropriate in order to \n     protect the benefits of these most deserving recipients from \n     the eroding effects of inflation. We estimate that enactment \n     of this section, in conjunction with section 102 of this \n     draft bill, would result in benefit costs of $330.7 million \n     during FY 1998 and $1.94 billion over the five-year period \n     beginning in FY 1998. The costs associated with the \n     compensation COLA are considered to be part of the \n     compensation baseline and not subject to the pay-as-you-go \n     provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.\n       Section 102 would require the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs, in computing new rates of (or limitations affecting) \n     disability compensation and DIC pursuant to the enactment of \n     any legislation requiring the Secretary to increase such \n     rates to provide a COLA for fiscal year 1998 and thereafter, \n     to round down to the next lower whole dollar any rate that is \n     not evenly divisible by one dollar. This proposal is \n     consistent with the congressionally-mandated calculation \n     methods applied to COLA's for fiscal years 1994, 1995, and \n     1996. We estimate this proposal would reduce FY 1998 benefit \n     cost associated with the COLA proposed in section 101 of this \n     draft bill by $17 million and reduce the five-year benefit \n     cost for FY 1998 through FY 2002 by $287 million, as \n     compared to the cost of the COLA and future COLAs based on \n     rounding odd dollar amounts to the nearest whole dollar. \n     The savings are subject to the pay-as-you-go provisions of \n     the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.\n       Section 103 would amend titles 26 and 38 of the United \n     States Code to make permanent the authority of the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs (VA) to access unearned income \n     information from the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) and \n     wage, self-employment, and retirement income information from \n     the Social Security Administration (SSA) for purposes of \n     income verification in determining eligibility for VA means-\n     tested benefits such as pension and medical care for certain \n     non-service-related illnesses or conditions.\n       Experience has shown that authority to match unearned \n     income information from IRS and wage, self-employment, and \n     retirement income information from SSA with VA data for \n     purposes of income verification in determining eligibility \n     for or the proper amount of VA means-tested benefits has been \n     an effective savings measure and has had a significant \n     program-abuse deterrent effect. We estimate that enactment of \n     this proposal would result in savings in monetary benefits of \n     $10 million in FY 1999 and $120 million during the four-year \n     period beginning in FY 1999. These savings are subject to the \n     pay-as-you-go provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation \n     Act of 1990.\n       Section 104 should amend section 5503(f) of title 38, \n     United States Code, to make permanent the $90 limitation on \n     monthly VA pension payments that may be made to \n     beneficiaries, without dependents, who are receiving \n     Medicaid-covered nursing-home care. The current payment \n     limitation, which is due to expire at the end of fiscal year \n     1998, works to the advantage of these nursing-home residents \n     because it permits them to keep the $90 to apply toward \n     personal expenses rather than have it ``pass through'' to the \n     Medicaid program. This section would simply remove the \n     existing September 30, 1998, expiration date for section \n     5503(f). We estimate this proposal would result in \n     government-wide savings because a beneficiary's nursing-home \n     care costs, previously paid for with VA pension benefits, \n     would be paid for by the Medicaid program, which shares a \n     portion of the costs with the States. Government-wide savings \n     are estimated to be $206 million in FY 1999 and a total of \n     $893 million during the four-year period beginning in FY \n     1999.\n       Under current law, direct service connection of a \n     disability or death may be established if the evidence \n     establishes that injury or disease resulted from tobacco use \n     in line of duty in the active military, naval, or air \n     service, notwithstanding that the disability or death did \n     not occur until after service and expiration of any \n     applicable presumptive period. Section 105 would amend \n     tile 38, United States Code, by adding a new section that \n     would have the effect of prohibiting service connection of \n     a death or disability on the basis that it resulted from \n     injury or disease attributable, in whole or in part, to \n     the use of tobacco products by the veteran during the \n     veteran's service. This amendment is consistent with the \n     1990 budget reconciliation act, in which Congress \n     prohibited compensation for disabilities which are the \n     result of veterans' abuse of alcohol and drugs. This was \n     fiscally responsible action which enhanced the integrity \n     of our compensation program, and our proposal regarding \n     tobacco use is offered in that same spirit. In addition, \n     claims based upon tobacco-related disorders present \n     medical and legal issues which could impede ongoing \n     efforts to speed claim processing by placing significant \n     additional demands on the adjudicative system. This \n     provision would not preclude establishment of service \n     connection for disability or death from a disease or \n     injury which became manifest or was aggravated during \n     active service or became manifest to the requisite degree \n     of disability during any applicable presumptive period \n     specified in section 1112 or 1116 of title 38, United \n     States Code. This amendment would apply to claims filed \n     after the date of its enactment.\n       This provision would result in some level of benefit cost \n     avoidance and avoid potential delays in claim processing \n     resulting from increased workload.\n       Section 106 would authorize the Veterans Benefits \n     Administration (VBA) to reimburse, from the general operating \n     expenses account, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) \n     for the cost of medical examinations conducted with respect \n     to veterans' claims for compensation or pension. Currently, \n     such examinations are paid for out of VA's medical-care fund.\n       In order to assure the funding for compensation and pension \n     medical examinations is available throughout FY 1998, \n     appropriate language would need to be included in both the \n     ``Medical care'' and ``General operating expenses'' \n     appropriations. It is contemplated that VBA will enter into a \n     memorandum of understanding with VHA to provide that, should \n     funds budgeted under general operating expenses for the \n     purpose of ``purchasing'' compensation and pension medical \n     examinations prove insufficient, alternate funding under \n     ``Medical care'' would be available to permit VHA to continue \n     to provide these examinations. Medical care funds would be \n     used for this purpose only in the event of a shortfall in \n     general operating expenses. There are no costs or savings \n     associated with this proposal.\n       Section 201(a) would amend section 2408(b) of title 38, \n     United States Code, to make state cemetery grants more \n     attractive to States. Section 2408 authorizes the Secretary \n     of Veterans Affairs to make grants to States to assist them \n     in establishing, expanding, or improving State veterans' \n     cemeteries. Currently, the amount of a State cemetery grant \n     is limited to 50 percent of the total of the value of the \n     land to be acquired or dedicated for a cemetery and the cost \n     of improvement to be made on the land. The remaining amount \n     must be contributed by the State receiving the grant. \n     Pursuant to the amendments proposed in this section, the \n     amount of a State cemetery grant could not exceed, in the \n     case of the establishment of a new cemetery, the total of the \n     cost of improvements to be made on land to be converted into \n     a cemetery and the initial cost of equipment necessary to \n     operate the cemetery. In the case of the expansion or \n     improvement of an existing cemetery, the amount of the grant \n     could not exceed the total of the cost of improvements to be \n     made on any land to be added to the cemetery combined with \n     the cost of improvements to be made to the existing cemetery. \n     If the amount of a grant should, for any reason, be less than \n     the amount of those costs, the State receiving the grant \n     would be required\n\n[[Page S6912]]\n\n     to contribute the remaining amount, in addition to providing \n     any land necessary for the cemetery project.\n       Also, under current law, if at the time of a grant the \n     State receiving the grant dedicates for the cemetery land \n     which it already owns, the value of the land may constitute \n     up to 50 percent of the State's contribution. Once that land \n     value is so used, it may not constitute part of the State's \n     contribution for any subsequent grant under section 2408. \n     Under the amendments proposed in section 201(a) of this draft \n     bill, a State would be responsible for providing any land \n     required for a cemetery project, since the grant amount would \n     not longer be based partly on the value of land to be \n     acquired or dedicated for a cemetery.\n       We believe that excluding the value of land to be acquired \n     for a cemetery from the basis of a grant would encourage \n     states to be active partners in the cemetery grants program. \n     In our experience, no State has acquired land for a cemetery \n     in connection with a grant under section 2408. In every case, \n     the State has dedicated land that was donated or transferred \n     for that purpose, or land that it already owned. Further, any \n     reduction of the basis from which a grant is calculated may \n     be offset by an increase from 50 percent to up to 100 percent \n     in the proportion of the amount of a project's cost that \n     could be assumed by the Federal Government. Moreover, since, \n     under the proposal, a grant may cover the entire cost of \n     improvements (and initial cost of equipment in certain \n     cases), a State may not have to contribute cash toward the \n     initial cost of a project.\n       Another feature that would make grants more attractive to \n     States is the inclusion in the basis of a grant of the \n     initial cost of equipment necessary to operate the cemetery. \n     Providing funds to acquire the equipment necessary to operate \n     a cemetery will, we believe, be a critical financial \n     incentive to encourage States to establish new cemeteries. \n     Such equipment is as essential to the establishment of an \n     operational cemetery as are the land and the improvements \n     made on it. However, because our proposed amendment includes \n     only the initial cost of equipment for the establishment of a \n     cemetery, the State would retain the responsibility for long-\n     term maintenance and operation of the cemetery, including \n     costs associated with the acquisition of replacement \n     equipment. Each Federal grant would assist in the \n     establishment and activation of new veterans' cemeteries, or \n     in the expansion or improvement of existing cemeteries, but \n     the States would bear the costs of continuing operation and \n     long-term maintenance.\n       Section 201(b) of the draft bill would authorize ``no-\n     year'' appropriations for the State cemetery grants program. \n     Under current 38 U.S.C. Sec. 2408(d), funds appropriated for \n     State cemetery grants remain available only until the end of \n     the second fiscal year following the fiscal year for which \n     they are appropriated. However, in Public Law No. 104-204, \n     110 Stat. 2874 (1996), Congress appropriated funds for State \n     cemetery grants, ``to remain available until expended.'' \n     Section 201(b) would amend section 2408(d) to reflect this \n     no-year-funding policy.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this draft bill to the \n     Congress, and that its enactment would be in accord with the \n     Administration's program.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                      Jesse Brown.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (by request):\n  S. 988.

The \n     explanation that follows each section in this title sets \n     forth the comparable provisions that form the basis for the \n     provision in the Proposal.

Snook \n     & Jennifer A.

Expand the period to elect participation while in office \n     (38 U.S.C. Sec. 7297(b)) to permit a retired judge who \n     marries to elect participation within 6 months after \n     marriage, as provided for by JSAS.\\8\\\n       b.

Sec. 7297(c)) to 2.2 percent of salary and retired \n     pay, respectively, the JSAS levels.\\9\\\n       c. Exclude from the 3-percent per annum interest payment \n     requirement (38 U.S.C. Sec. 7297(d)) any period during which \n     a judge was separated from certain previous service (as a \n     judge, a judicial official under section 376(a)(1) of title \n     28, a Member of Congress, or a congressional employee) and \n     was not receiving a retirement annuity based on service as a \n     judge or judicial official, since such interest payment is \n     not required by JSAS.\\10\\\n       d. Reduce the minimum period of civilian service needed for \n     purposes of eligibility for a survivor annuity from 5 years \n     (38 U.S.C. Sec. 7297(f)(1), (h)(1)) to 18 months,\\11\\ and \n     provide for an exemption from the 18-month requirement where \n     the judge has been assassinated,\\12\\ both as provided for in \n     JSAS.\n       e. Eliminate the requirement that the surviving spouse be \n     at least 50 years of age in order to receive a survivor \n     annuity (38 U.S.C. Sec. 7297(f)(1)A)) since no minimum age is \n     provided for in JSAS.\\13\\\n       f. Substitute the same COLA as provided under JSAS for the \n     COLA presently in place (38 U.S.C. Sec. 7297(o) provides for \n     a fractional COLA only when the cost of living rises by 5 \n     percent or more in any 1 year).\\14\\\n       Explanation: These changes would bring the supervisors' \n     annuity program for this Court into line with that for \n     Article III, Claims, and B Judges, all of whom are covered \n     by JSAS.\n     Section 105: Gramm-Rudman exemption\n       Summary: Section 105 would exempt this Court's Retirement \n     Fund from possible Gramm-Rudman sequestration.\n       Explanation: This proposal would bring this Court's \n     judicial retirement program into line with the retirement \n     programs for Article III, Claims, Tax, COMA, and B \n     Judges.\\15\\\n     Seciton 106: Limitation on activities or retired judges\n       Summary: Section 106 would provide that a Judge retired \n     from this Court would forfeit that judge's retirement \n     annuity, upon practicing law involving representation of any \n     client in a federal claim for veterans' benefits, during the \n     period in which the judge engages in the proscribed activity \n     and for one year immediately following the cessation of such \n     activity.\n       Explanation: Claims, Tax, and B Judges who have retired \n     from active service are subject to statutory provisions that \n     significantly restrict such judges from the practice of law \n     in the representation of clients in the subject areas that \n     came before their respective courts.\\16\\ In addition to the \n     proposed section 106, this Court's judges in active service \n     are presently subject to the Code of Conduct for United \n     States Judges \\17\\ and, upon enactment of section 202, also \n     will be subject to that Code under certain circumstances \n     during retirement, including when in recall status. The Code \n     of Conduct imposes prohibitions and restrictions on the \n     activities of judges subject to that Code beyond those \n     imposed by statute.\n\n\n               title ii--staggered retirement and recall\n\n       Title II contains a provision to address the looming \n     problem of having as many as four simultaneous associate \n     judgeship vacancies on the Court in 2005 by creating a \n     staggered retirement option designed to encourage the \n     sequencing of associate judge retirements starting in 1999. \n     It also contains a provision to provide for recall of retired \n     judges in the event of judicial vacancies or increased \n     workload.\n     Section 201: Staggered retirement\n       Summary: Section 201 would provide a mechanism, in a \n     transitional provision, to permit the early retirement of one \n     associate judge per year starting in the year 1999 and ending \n     in the year 2003. In order to be eligible, each retiring \n     judge would need at least ten years of service on this Court; \n     be a participant in this Court's retirement system; have at \n     least 20 years of federal service allowable under 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7297(l); be at least 55 years of age; have years of age, \n     years of service creditable under 38 U.S.C. Sec. 7296, and \n     years of service allowable under 38 U.S.C. Sec. 7297(l) not \n     creditable under section 7296, that total at least 80; and \n     have the greatest seniority as a judge of this Court among \n     this Court's judges who provide notification of intent to \n     seek early retirement in the fiscal year in question. (The \n     combination of 10 years of service on this Court and the \n     ending year of 2003 would restrict this provision's \n     availability to the Court's original associate judges.) \n     Written notification will be provided to the President and \n     Chief Judge not later than April 1 of years 1999 through \n     2003, specifying a retirement date not earlier than 90 \n     days thereafter nor later than the end (September 30) of \n     the fiscal year in which notification is provided. \n     Notification shall be irrevocable once provided. Retired \n     pay of an\n\n[[Page S6915]]\n\n     early retiring judge will be based upon a modified rule of \n     80 in which the rate described in 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7296(c)(1) is reduced proportionally in accordance \n     with the extent to which the retiring judge's combined \n     years of service as a CVA judge and age do not reach 80.\n       Section 201 would further provide that 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7298(e)(2), which can presently be used with respect to \n     funding actuarily determined present value of all benefits \n     payable from the Court's Retirement Fund, be amended to \n     permit the Court to use that provision also with respect to \n     benefits that may be paid from the Retirement Fund within the \n     contemplation of existing law.\n       Explanation: Section 201 would provide a mechanism to deal \n     with a serious problem of judge turnover, the magnitude of \n     which the Court has not previously appreciated. The Court was \n     created in 1988 without any antecedent structure and with no \n     judges in place (Veterans' Judicial Review Act, Pub. L. 100-\n     687, Div. A., 102 Stat. 4105 (Nov. 18, 1988)). All 6 of the \n     Court's original associate judges assumed office within a \n     period of approximately 1 year of each other. The 15-year \n     terms of the court's remaining 5 original associate judges \n     will expire within a period of approximately 1 year of each \n     other. Even assuming the application of the Rule of 80 under \n     38 U.S.C. Sec. 7296(b)(1) (and assuming no reappointments \n     under 38 U.S.C. Sec. 7296(2)), 4 of 5 of the court's original \n     associate judges will retire within 11 months of each other, \n     beginning in September 2004 (two in September 2004, one in \n     January 2005, and one in August 2005; the fifth associate \n     judge would be eligible for retirement under the Rule of 80 \n     in November 2002).\n       Given the length of time likely to be involved in the \n     nomination and confirmation process, especially considering \n     the election of a President in November 2004, 3 of the \n     Court's judgeships are very likely to be simultaneously \n     vacant during a substantial part of 2005, and it is quite \n     possible that a majority of the judgeships could be \n     simultaneously vacant during part of that year and possibly \n     thereafter. Then, even after the judgeships are filled, there \n     could well be considerable lack of experience among the \n     majority of the Court's judges. This situation would almost \n     certainly dramatically increase the Court's backlog--\n     initially during the vacancies and continuing during the \n     startup period for the replacement judges. As well, during \n     the vacancy period the Court could be in a situation where \n     two or three judges might be able to overrule prior Court \n     precedent.\n       In order to preclude such problems, section 201 creates a \n     staggered-retirement option designed to encourage the \n     sequencing of associate judge retirements starting in 1999. \n     It is important to bear in mind when considering the \n     staggered-retirement provision that the formula for an early-\n     retirement annuity must provide sufficient financial \n     incentive for an associate judge to elect to forego the full \n     retirement benefit that would be available upon completion of \n     the 15-year term or satisfaction of the Rule of 80. There is \n     no sense whatsoever in legislating a formula that will not \n     produce the early retirements that are essential to avoid the \n     serious adverse consequences that would result for the Court \n     from having 3-4 simultaneous judicial vacancies in 2005 and \n     possibly beyond.\n       Implementation of section 201 may be achievable without \n     seeking additional appropriations for this purpose. In this \n     regard, subsection (d)(2) of the proposed section 201 would \n     add a subparagraph (C) to permit the Court to utilize 38 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 7298(2)(A) in anticipation of a payment that may \n     have to be made from the Court's Retirement Fund. It should \n     be noted that, even absent staggered retirement, the proposed \n     subparagraph (C) would allow the Court to provide for much \n     better management of a judge's anticipated entry, under 38 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 7296(d)(1)(A), into the Court's retirement \n     system.\n       Precedent exists in 3 other Article I courts for fractional \n     retirement based on completion of less than a full statutory \n     term of service. In 2 of these 3 courts, as described below, \n     the fractional retirement annuity may be enhanced by either a \n     CSRS/Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) annuity or by \n     an additional component of court retirement calculated under \n     CSRS, respectively.\n       When COMA was enlarged in 1989 from 3 to 5 active judges, \n     one of the new judgeships was for a term of 13 years and the \n     other for a term of 7 years.\\18\\ The COMA Judges appointed to \n     7- and 13-year terms are eligible, upon completion of those \n     terms, for immediate special annuities calculated by \n     multiplying the last salary prior to retirement by a fraction \n     based on a numerator of years of service and a denominator of \n     15.\\19\\\n       B & M Judges who have served at least 8 years are each \n     entitled to a Judicial Retirement System (JRS) annuity, upon \n     reaching age 65, calculated by multiplying the last salary \n     prior to retirement by a fraction based on a numerator of \n     years of service and a denominator of 14 (the number of years \n     of a full term). This annuity is reduced by 2 percent for \n     each year the annuitant was under age 65 at the time the \n     annuitant left office not to exceed a 20-percent \n     reduction.\\20\\ The reduction is not applicable if a B & M \n     Judge fails to be reappointed after serving a full term.\\21\\ \n     An alternative hybrid JRS annuity is available, in a \n     transitional provision, to each full-time B & M Judge who was \n     in office on November 15, 1988, regardless of the number of \n     years of judicial service, calculated in the same manner as a \n     regular IRS annuity for those years of judicial service \n     designated by such judge for the period on or after October \n     1, 1979, plus a CSRS or FERS annuity for federal service \n     prior to the designation.\\22\\\n       District of Columbia courts (D.C.) Judges are eligible for \n     retirement upon completion of 10 years of judicial service, \n     with retirement salary beginning at age 50, if they have 20 \n     or more years of judicial service, or at age 60 if they have \n     less than 20 years of such service, or at a reduced salary if \n     they are between ages 55 and 60.\\23\\ The retirement salary is \n     the amount determined by multiplying the last judicial salary \n     by that fraction where the numerator is total years of \n     judicial service and the denominator is 30.\\24\\ Provision is \n     also made for an add-on to retirement salary, based on \n     qualifying federal civilian and military service, generally \n     computed on the basis of CSRS law. Two unique features of the \n     add-on are that the deposit by the retiring judge in the D.C. \n     Judges' Retirement Fund \\25\\ is 3.5 percent of the salary \n     earned for civilian service plus interest and that average \n     pay for purposes of CSRS service is the last pre-retirement \n     salary of the judge.\\26\\ The total retirement salary, upon \n     retirement, may not exceed 80 percent of the last judicial \n     salary.\\27\\ A judge who retires between ages 55 and 60 who \n     has less than 20 years of judicial service and elects a \n     reduced retirement salary shall have that salary reduced by \n     1/12th of 1 percent for each month the judge is under the age \n     of 60 at the time of retirement.\\28\\ In the case of a judge \n     described in the preceding sentence whose calculation of \n     retirement salary benefits, based on both fractional judicial \n     service and CSRS law, results in an amount exceeding the 80% \n     cap, the reduction based on age will be made to such \n     calculation to the extent of the difference between such \n     calculation and such cap.\n       In addition to the fractional retirement provisions noted \n     above with respect to COMA, B & M, and D.C. Judges, there are \n     a number of other provisions that permit full retirement \n     where less than a full judicial term has been completed. A \n     disabled Article III Judge, Claims Judge, or Tax Judge, with \n     10 years of judicial service on such judge's court, is \n     entitled to the salary of an active judge.\\29\\ A disabled \n     Judge on this Court with 10 years of judicial service is \n     entitled to the retired pay that he or she would have \n     received had he or she completed his or her term.\\30\\ In \n     certain cases involving misconduct or disability, length-of-\n     service requirements can be waived for Article III, Claims, \n     and this Court's Judges.\\31\\\n       Finally, three other provisions should be noted. Claims and \n     B & M Judges may retire under CSRS at age 60 with 10 years of \n     judicial service. COMA Judges may retire under CSRS at any \n     time without regard to age-and-service requirements, with a \n     reduction in the annuity of a judge retiring under age 60. \n     Retired Article III Judges are permitted separate annuities, \n     without offset, one for judicial service, and one for \n     nonjudicial service that qualifies for a CSRS/FERS \n     annuity.\\32\\\n     Section 202: Recall of retired judges\n       Summary: Section 202 would provide that a retired judge of \n     the Court would be eligible for recall, by providing the \n     chief judge with written notification to that effect. Recall \n     of such a judge, in the event of judicial vacancy or \n     otherwise to meet case workload, would occur when the chief \n     judge certifies that substantial service is expected to be \n     performed by such retired judge, for such period as the chief \n     judge determines to be necessary, and such retired judge \n     agrees to such certification. During the period of recall \n     service, the retired judge would receive, in addition to the \n     judge's retired pay, the difference between that pay and pay \n     of an active judge of the Court.\n       Explanation: All Article III and Article I Judges, except B \n     & M and this Court's Judges, have specific provision for both \n     senior status and post retirement judicial service.\\33\\ B & M \n     Judges have specific provision for postretirement judicial \n     service.\\34\\ Only this Court's Judges have no specific \n     provision for either.\n       Article III, Claims, Tax, and COMA Judges automatically \n     receive senior status upon retirement, and D.C. Judges may be \n     appointed to such status subsequent to retirement and upon \n     favorable recommendation of the District of Columbia \n     Commission on Judicial Disabilities and Tenure.\\35\\ Retired \n     Article III Judges who perform the equivalent of the average \n     2-month workload of an active judge, and retired Claims and \n     Tax Judges who make themselves available for work not to \n     exceed 90 days per year receive pay of the office.\\36\\ Those \n     retired Article III Judges who perform service only upon \n     their consent, and all retired COMA and B & M Judges, who may \n     be recalled only upon their consent, receive their respective \n     retirement annuities plus a cost-of-living adjustment \n     (COLA).\\37\\\n       Retired senior D.C. Judges may be recalled only upon their \n     consent.\\38\\ Both retired senior and nonsenior D.C. Judges \n     receive their annuities plus COLA.\\39\\ Recalled COMA Judges \n     receive pay of the office in lieu of retirement \n     annuities.\\40\\ Recalled B & M Judges and D.C. Judges receive, \n     in addition to retirement annuities, an amount equal to the \n     difference between annuity and pay of the office.\\41\\\n       As is the case with B & M Judges, section 202 would provide \n     only for recall service, but would not provide for senior \n     status. The latter generally involves substantially higher \n     costs for judicial pay, space for chambers, and support \n     staff.\n\n[[Page S6916]]\n\n                     title iii--renaming provision\n\n     Section 301: Renaming of the Court of Veterans Appeals\n       Summary: Section 301 renames the United States Court of \n     Veterans Appeals as the United States Court of Appeals for \n     Veterans Claims.\n       Explanation: Section 301 is virtually identical to section \n     201 of H.R. 1092, 105th Cong., 1st Sess., which was passed by \n     the House on April 16, 1997, and provides for the renaming of \n     the Court. House Report No. 105-97, which accompanied the \n     House-passed bill, states on page 3:\n       The bill would amend section 7251 of title 38, United \n     States Code, to rename the United States Court of Veterans \n     Appeals (``the Court'') as the United States Court of Appeals \n     for Veterans Claims. According to Chief Judge Frank Q. \n     Nebeker, many veterans and attorneys believe that the Court \n     is an administrative tribunal of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs rather than an independent judicial entity.\n       Moreover, the Court's common acronym ``CVA'' is not readily \n     distinguishable from ``BVA'', and acronym for the Board of \n     Veterans' Appeals which is an administrative tribunal of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs. Adoption of the name ``United \n     States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims'' would also be \n     consistent with recent name changes in other courts \n     established by Congress under Article I of the United States \n     Constitution. In 1994, the United States Court of Military \n     Appeals was renamed the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Armed Forces. In 1992, the United States Court of Claims \n     was renamed the United States Court of Federal Claims.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ See 28 U.S.C.

Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, 412 Senate Russell \n         Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to submit to you a \n     legislative proposal that replaces the one I sent you in June \n     1996. As I indicated in my letter of February 4, 1997, the \n     Court had experienced a substantial change in case filings \n     for the prior 10 months. With a monthly average of new case \n     filings of over 160 during the past year, I am convinced that \n     the downsizing proposal transmitted last June is no longer \n     advisable.\n       For the reasons stated in my February 4, 1997, letter, and \n     as set forth in my budget testimony in the last several \n     months, the Court now anticipates that case filings in fiscal \n     year 1997 will be over 1900--a figure that could increase \n     further if the Board of Veterans' Appeals continues to \n     increase its output of final, appealable decisions. Moreover, \n     the workload in each of the judge's chambers will increase if \n     the long delays in case processing, due to numerous filing \n     extensions granted to the Secretary, occasioned by the \n     staffing difficulties in Group VII of the Department's \n     General Counsel's office, are reduced; this matter has \n     recently received considerable attention by the Court and the \n     General Counsel herself. In that regard, I am enclosing an \n     April 8, 1997, letter (with attachment) to me from the \n     General Counsel that addresses this problem.\n       Against this background of a substantial caseload increase, \n     I am submitting a new, single legislative proposal that \n     incorporates as Title I the provisions of Title II from last \n     year's proposal. These provisions are designed to provide \n     comparability in a number of respects between the retirement/\n     survivor annuity programs available for this Court's judges \n     and those applicable to judges of other Article I Courts. \n     Enactment of section 104 will be of particular benefit to the \n     widow of Judge Hart Mankin, who died last year, because \n     section 104 would rectify the disparity between her survivor \n     annuity and the annuities of survivors of deceased Article I \n     Judges under the Joint Survivors' Annuity System.\n       The Court's new legislative proposal adds a new Title II to \n     deal with a serious problem of judge turnover, the magnitude \n     of which the Court had not previously appreciated. As I \n     indicated in my February 4, 1997, letter, the Court was \n     created in 1988 without any antecedent structure and with no \n     judges in place (Veterans' Judicial Review Act, Pub. L. No. \n     100-687, Div. A., 102 Stat. 4105 (Nov. 18, 1988)). All 6 of \n     the Court's original associate judges assumed office within a \n     period of approximately 1 year of each other. The 15-year \n     terms of the Court's remaining 5 original associate judges \n     will expire within a period of approximately 1 year of each. \n     Even assuming the application of the Rule of 80 under 38 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 7296(b)(1) (and assuming no reappointments under \n     38 U.S.C. Sec. 7296(2)), 4 of 5 of the court's original \n     associate judges will retire within 11 months of each other, \n     beginning in September 2004.\n       Given the length of time likely to be involved in the \n     nomination and confirmation process, especially considering \n     the election of a President in November 2004, 3 of the \n     Court's judgeships are very likely to be simultaneously \n     vacant during a substantial part of 2005, and it is quite \n     possible that a majority of the judgeships could be \n     simultaneously vacant during part of that year and possibly \n     thereafter. Then, even after the judgeships are filled, there \n     could well be considerable lack of experience among the \n     majority of the Court's judges. This situation would almost \n     certainly dramatically increase the Court's backlog--\n     initially during\n\n[[Page S6917]]\n\n     the vacancies and continuing during the startup period for \n     the replacement judges. As well, during the vacancy period \n     the Court could be in a situation where two or three judges \n     might be able to overrule prior Court precedent. In order to \n     preclude such problems, the enclosed legislative proposal \n     includes, as section 201, a provision to create a staggered-\n     retirement option designed to encourage the sequencing of \n     associate judge retirements starting in 1999. It is important \n     to bear in mind, when considering the staggered-retirement \n     provision, that the formula for an early retirement annuity \n     must provide sufficient financial incentive for an associate \n     judge to elect to forego the full retirement benefit that \n     would be available upon completion of the 15-year term or \n     satisfaction of the Rule of 80. There is no sense whatsoever \n     in legislating a formula that will not produce the early \n     retirements that are essential to avoid the serious adverse \n     consequences that would result for the Court from having 3-4 \n     simultaneous judicial vacancies for an extended period of \n     time.\n       Moreover, as I also indicated in my February 4, 1997, \n     letter, implementation of this proposed Title II may be \n     achievable without seeking additional appropriations for this \n     purpose. In this regard, subsection (d) of the proposed \n     section 201 would permit the Court to utilize 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 7298(e)(2)(A) in anticipation of a payment that may have \n     to be made from the Court's retirement fund. It should be \n     noted that, even absent staggered retirement, the proposed \n     subsection (d) would allow the Court to provide for much \n     better management of a judge's anticipated entry, under 38 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 7296(d)(1)(A), into the Court's retirement \n     system.\n       In addition, in order to provide for recall of retired \n     judges in the event of judicial vacancies or increased \n     workload, included in the legislative proposal as section 202 \n     is the same basic provision that was included in last year's \n     proposal as section 102. In order to help with the \n     simultaneous vacancy problem described above, the provision \n     has been revised to make specific reference to a voluntary \n     recall in the event of a vacancy in an associate judge \n     position. However, this recall provision could not itself \n     prevent the simultaneous vacancies that section 201 is \n     designed to forestall.\n       Finally, for completeness sake, the proposal includes, as \n     Title III, a provision to change the Court's name to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, which I \n     proposed in my February 4, 1997, letter and which passed the \n     House on April 16, 1997, in section 201 of H.R. 1092. Title \n     III differs from section 201 only so as to accommodate the \n     former to the style of the rest of the proposal.\n       Enclosed, for your information, is an overview, a cost \n     estimate, a draft bill, and a detailed section-by-section \n     summary and explanation.\n       Thank you for your assistance. I urge that you and the \n     Committee give favorable consideration to the enclosed \n     legislative proposal to reform the Court's judicial \n     retirement provisions and provide for a staggered-retirement \n     option designed to avoid the impact of simultaneous judicial \n     vacancies. I am sending the same letter and enclosures to \n     Chairman Stump, and Ranking Minority Members Rockefeller and \n     Evans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Frank Q. Nebeker,\n                                                      Chief Judge.\n\n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n\n  S. 989. A bill entitled the ``Safer Schools Act of 1997''; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                     The Safer Schools Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to introduce a piece of \nlegislation today that I will describe briefly.\n  In the Senate a couple of years ago, I authored, with Senator \nFeinstein from California, and several others, a piece of legislation \nthat says we ought to have zero tolerance in this country for guns in \nschools, zero tolerance for guns in schools. We said in the legislation \nthat school districts in this country should have in place a policy \nthat says if a student is caught bringing a gun to school, the student \nwill be expelled for a year. Mr. President, over 6,000 students have \nnow suffered expulsion as a result of bringing weapons to school.\n  Weapons in school are serious. You cannot learn unless a school is a \nsafe place for learning. Yet, even today we see the news stories. On \nFebruary 17, this year, a 16-year-old Miami Edison Senior High School \nstudent shot a 9th grade girl at school. In Memphis, TN, on March 28, \nthis year, a 16-year-old student was shot on the campus of Chicksaw \nJunior High by a 15-year-old student. On February 11, two students were \nshot and wounded in Bronx high schools. On March 29, Detroit, MI, a 16-\nyear-old student was shot seven times while standing in the back \nhallways of a high school. On February 18 this year, a 13-year-old \nmiddle school student was charged with attempting to murder his \nteacher.\n  I was at a school not too many blocks from this building a couple of \nyears ago. You go through metal detectors; there are security guards \nseated at the front of the school. The school is a lock-down school. \nWhen the students get in, they lock the door. You have to go through \nmetal detectors to get in. About a month after I was there, a student \nbumped another one at the water fountain and the other student pulled a \ngun and shot him four times. That is a school within blocks of this \nU.S. Capitol building.\n  We passed a piece of legislation that says there shall be zero \ntolerance for guns in schools, and students bringing guns to school \nshall be expelled from school for a year. That has worked in the sense \nthat it has taken those who brought guns to school out of school to \nmake sure other students are safe. But something has happened in the \nmeantime. After we passed that legislation and it became law, a court \nin New York issued a ruling that was about as goofy a court ruling as \nany I have ever heard. In New York, in a school, a young boy came in \none day wearing a leather jacket and went through the front door of the \nschool and began walking down a hallway. The security guard noticed a \nbulge under the leather jacket near the waistline, so he apprehended \nthe student and reached under this jacket and took from the student a \nloaded pistol--a loaded pistol was in the possession of this 16-year-\nold boy walking down the hallway. The 16-year-old boy was obviously \ntaken from school that day and put in a disciplinary proceeding and \nexpelled, and a number of things happened. The boy appealed it, and a \ncourt in New York decided that the evidence of a gun on a 16-year-old \nboy in school had to be discarded because the security guard did not \nhave probable cause to search the student in the hallway of the school.\n  Now, when I saw the decision by the New York court, it occurred to me \nto be so nonsensical as to require nothing from any of us. Then I \ndecided that if we do nothing, it means that somehow someone believes \nthat court was thinking straight. Well, it was not, and I introduced in \nthe last session, and will reintroduce today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Feinstein, a piece of legislation that makes it clear that \nevidence of a gun seized in school cannot be dismissed as evidence. \nEvidence of a gun can be used in a school disciplinary proceeding.\n  There is no right to carry a gun in school. If that 16-year-old boy \nhad gone to National Airport to try to board a plane, they would have \nforced him to go through a metal detector and they would have said you \ncannot get on a commercial airplane if you are carrying a pistol. But \nthe judge's decision seems to say somehow that the security guard was \nat fault. The security guard noticed a gun on this young student, or at \nleast a bulge in the leather jacket, and took a loaded pistol from this \nboy in a public school, and the security guard is at fault for \nobtaining evidence inappropriately? I do not think so. That is not the \nway this country should work. If we say you cannot take a loaded gun on \nan airplane, we ought to be able to say a 16-year-old boy cannot take a \nloaded pistol into a school. If we do not have the opportunity and \nability to say that and make it stick, there is precious little hope \nfor education in this country.\n\n  This legislation will make sure that no judge ever again is able to \nsay that a security guard erred in taking away a loaded pistol from a \n16-year-old boy walking in the hallways of our public schools. When we \npassed the Gun Free Schools Act and said that there shall be expulsion \nall across this country for kids bringing guns to schools, we wanted to \nsend a national message to every student in this country, ``Don't even \nthink about bringing a gun to school, because there will be certain and \nimmediate results. The results will be you will be expelled, no ifs, \nands, or buts.''\n  It has been successful. Have we prevented every act of violence in \nschool? No, but thousands of children who brought guns to school are \nnow not in the classroom threatening other students. They are expelled \nfrom those classrooms, many of them probably in some alternative \nsetting, but they are not in the classroom terrorizing other students.\n  I am so appalled by the decision of the court in New York that I want \na Federal law to complete the Gun Free Schools Act with the legislation \nwe introduce today called the Safer Schools\n\n[[Page S6918]]\n\nAct. Any young person who brings a gun to school should expect that a \nsecurity guard at the front door can remove that gun from them and that \nit will later be used as evidence in a school disciplinary proceeding.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from South \nCarolina. I know that the piece of legislation that he brings to the \nfloor of the Senate, called the defense authorization bill, is one of \nthe largest pieces of legislation that we deal with at any time during \nthe year here in Congress. It contains important matters dealing with \nAmerica's preparedness. I am anxious to debate parts of that bill and I \nwanted to compliment the Senator from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, \nfor his leadership and Senator Levin from Michigan for his leadership. \nI hope we can make significant progress this week on the legislation. I \nhope my speaking in morning business has not impeded that in any way. I \nappreciate the Senator's courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 989\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \nthe National Institute of Biomedical Imaging; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n       national institute of biomedical imaging establishment act\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am today introducing the National \nInstitute of Biomedical Imaging Establishment Act.\n  This legislation would consolidate imaging research activities that \nare currently dispersed throughout the National Institutes of Health \nunder a single administrative structure. This consolidation is needed \nto ensure that the American taxpayer receives the maximum possible \nreturn on our investment in critical new medical technologies. My \nlegislation does not authorize any new spending; instead, it \nrestructures existing programs in order to increase efficiency, provide \ngreater accountability, and improve the process of setting priorities \nand allocating valuable resources for research. It also establishes a \nmechanism to coordinate the imaging research that is currently funded--\nwithout an overall plan--by federal agencies outside NIH.\n  The NIH is a national treasure, but it is organized to support \nresearch into specific diseases and organ systems. Its structure is \nless well suited to a technology that cuts across these lines and is \napplicable to virtually all diseases and organs. This legislation will \ncreate a research infrastructure at NIH to develop the imaging \ntechnologies of the 21st century. Based on the remarkable record of \nimaging innovations in the past 25 years, breakthroughs in the coming \nyears will allow physicians to detect, diagnose, and treat disease more \neffectively, less invasively, and less expensively. Nearly every \nAmerican who needs health care services will benefit from this \nproposal.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in this effort to meet the scientific \nand budgetary challenges we face in medical research.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/07/senate-section/article/S6907-7", "month": "07",

ADVICE TO THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS REGARDING THE \n                   SAFETY, SECURITY, AND RELIABILITY OF UNITED \n                   STATES NUCLEAR WEAPONS STOCKPILE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons on \n     earth. The United States and its allies continue to rely on \n     nuclear weapons to deter potential adversaries from using \n     weapons of mass destruction. The safety and reliability of \n     the nuclear stockpile are essential to ensure its credibility \n     as a deterrent.\n       (2) On September 24, 1996, President Clinton signed the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n       (3) Effective as of September 30, 1996, the United States \n     is prohibited by relevant provisions of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-377) \n     from conducting underground nuclear tests ``unless a foreign \n     state conducts a nuclear test after this date, at which time \n     the prohibition on United States nuclear testing is lifted''.\n       (4) Section 1436(b) of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act, Fiscal Year 1989 (Public Law 100-456; 42 U.S.C. 2121 \n     note) requires the Secretary of Energy to ``establish and \n     support a program to assure that the United States is in a \n     position to maintain the reliability, safety, and continued \n     deterrent effect of its stockpile of existing nuclear weapons \n     designs in the event that a low-threshold or comprehensive \n     test ban on nuclear explosive testing is negotiated and \n     ratified.''.\n       (5) Section 3138(d) of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 1994 requires the President to submit an \n     annual report to Congress which sets forth ``any concerns \n     with respect to the safety, security, effectiveness, or \n     reliability of existing United States nuclear weapons raised \n     by the Stockpile Stewardship Program of the Department of \n     Energy''.\n       (6) President Clinton declared in July 1993 that ``to \n     assure that our nuclear deterrent remains unquestioned under \n     a test ban, we will explore other means of maintaining our \n     confidence in the safety, reliability, and the performance of \n     our weapons''. This decision was codified in a Presidential \n     Directive.\n       (7) Section 3138 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1994 also requires that the Secretary of \n     Energy establish a ``stewardship program to ensure the \n     preservation of the core intellectual and technical \n     competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons''.\n       (8) The plan of the Department of Energy to maintain the \n     safety and reliability of the United States nuclear stockpile \n     is known as the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program. \n     This approach is yet unproven. The ability of the United \n     States to maintain warheads without testing will require \n     development of new and sophisticated diagnostic technologies, \n     methods, and procedures. Current diagnostic technologies and \n     laboratory testing techniques are insufficient to certify the \n     future safety and reliability of the United States nuclear \n     stockpile. In the past these laboratory and diagnostic tools \n     were used in conjunction with nuclear testing.\n       (9) On August 11, 1995, President Clinton directed ``the \n     establishment of a new annual reporting and certification \n     requirement [to] ensure that our nuclear weapons remain safe \n     and reliable under a comprehensive test ban''.\n       (10) On the same day, the President noted that the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy have the \n     responsibility, after being ``advised by the Nuclear Weapons \n     Council, the Directors of DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories, \n     and the Commander of United States Strategic Command'', to \n     provide the President with the information to make the \n     certification referred to in paragraph (9).\n       (11) The Joint Nuclear Weapons Council established by \n     section 179 of title 10, United States Code, is responsible \n     for providing advice to the Secretary of Energy and Secretary \n     of Defense regarding nuclear weapons issues, including \n     ``considering safety, security, and control issues for \n     existing weapons''.

Mr. President, section 1040 of the fiscal year 1998 DOD \nauthorization bill (S. 936) amends title 31 of the United States Code \nto effectively prevent the General Accounting Office [GAO] from \nconducting self-initiated audits--work performed under GAO's inherent \nauthority without a formal Member request--unless all congressional \nrequests then-pending have been completed.\n  Since 1921, the Comptroller General has had broad authority to \nevaluate programs and investigate--on his own initiative--``all matters \nrelating to the receipt, disbursement, and use of public money.'' Self-\ninitiated authority has provided GAO the flexibility to pursue critical \nissues that auditors and investigators uncover in the course of their \nwork. It is essential to the maintenance of generally accepted \nstandards of independence and impartiality.\n  Title 31 is under the purview of the Governmental Affairs Committee \n[GAC], which has jurisdiction over GAO's organization, management, and \nauthority. It represents a major policy shift in the role and operation \nof GAO, adopted without benefit of any hearings, legislative record, or \nprior consultation with GAC.\n  At GAC's June 17, 1997, reconciliation markup, Senators Levin, Glenn, \nThompson, and Domenici discussed this provision and indicated their \nstrong reservations. Following that markup, Chairman Thompson and \nSenator Glenn sent a letter to the chairman and ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee [SASC] requesting a sequential referral of the \nbill for the purpose of reviewing this provision as contained in title \nX. We were unable to get the consent needed for such a referral.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     GLENN AMENDMENTS NOS. 619-623\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. GLENN submitted five amendments intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 936, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 619\n\n       On page 400, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       (e) Limitation on Conveyance Authority.--(1) The Secretary \n     may not make the conveyance authorized by subsection (a) \n     unless the Administrator of General Services determines that \n     the property to be conveyed is surplus to the United States.\n       (2) The Administrator shall make the determination based on \n     a screening of the property.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) According to the General Accounting Office, one-third \n     of all elementary and secondary schools in the United States, \n     serving 14,000,000 students, need extensive repair or \n     renovation.\n       (2) School infrastructure problems exist across the \n     country, but are most severe in central cities and in schools \n     with high proportions of poor and minority children.\n       (3) Many States and school districts will need to build new \n     schools in order to accommodate increasing student \n     enrollments; the Department of Education has predicted that \n     the Nation will need 6,000 more schools by the year 2006.\n       (4) Many schools do not have the physical infrastructure to \n     take advantage of computers and other technology needed to \n     meet the challenges of the next century.\n       (5) While school construction and maintenance are primarily \n     a State and local concern, States and communities have not, \n     on their own, met the increasing burden of providing \n     acceptable school facilities for all students, and the \n     poorest communities have had the greatest difficulty meeting \n     this need.\n       (6) The Federal Government, by providing interest subsidies \n     and similar types of support, can lower the costs of State \n     and local school infrastructure investment, creating an \n     incentive for States and localities to increase their own \n     infrastructure improvement efforts and helping ensure that \n     all students are able to attend schools that are equipped for \n     the 21st century.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide \n     Federal interest subsidies, or similar assistance, to States \n     and localities to help them bring all public school \n     facilities up to an acceptable standard and build the \n     additional public schools needed to educate the additional \n     numbers of students who will enroll in the next decade.\n\n     SEC. 12004.

The savings assumed in the \n     budget request were not realized.\n       (6) The fiscal year 1998 budget request for the Department \n     assumes a savings of $5,000,000,000 as a result of the \n     closure or realignment of such installations, which savings \n     are to be dedicated to modernization of the Armed Forces.\n       (b) Report on Prior Costs and Savings.--The Secretary of \n     Defense shall submit to Congress in 1998, together with the \n     President's budget for fiscal year 1999 under section 1105(a) \n     of title 31, United States Code, a report containing a \n     complete accounting of the costs attributable to and the \n     savings realized as a result of the closure and realignment \n     of military installations under the base closure laws through \n     fiscal year 1997.\n       (c) Reports on Future Costs and Savings.--The Secretary \n     shall submit to Congress in 1999 and each year thereafter, \n     together with the President's budget for the succeeding \n     fiscal year under that section, a report containing a \n     complete accounting of the costs attributable to and the \n     savings realized as a result of the closure and realignment \n     of installations under the base closure laws during the \n     preceding fiscal year.\n\n[[Page S6941]]\n\n       (d) Additional Report Requirements.--(1) Each report under \n     subsections (b) and (c) shall contain, in addition to the \n     matters required under such subsections, a statement of the \n     estimated costs to be attributed to and savings to be \n     realized as a result of the closure and realignment of \n     installations under the base closure laws during the six-year \n     period beginning on the date of the report.\n       (2) Each report shall set forth costs and savings, using \n     data consistent with budget data, by Armed Force, type of \n     installation, and fiscal year.\n       (3) The Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, \n     ensure that the military departments utilize a common \n     methodology in determining costs attributable to and savings \n     realized as a result of the closure and realignment of \n     installations under the base closure laws.\n       (e) Purpose of Reports.--The purpose of the reports under \n     this section is to provide Congress with an full and accurate \n     accounting of the costs attributable to and the savings \n     realized as a result of the base closure process.\n       (f) Sense of Senate on Use of Savings.--It is the sense of \n     the Senate that the savings reported under this section be \n     made available to the Department solely for purposes of \n     modernization of new weapon systems (including research, \n     development, test, and evaluation relating to such \n     modernization) and be used by the Department solely for such \n     purposes.\n       (g) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Base closure laws.--The term ``base closure laws'' \n     means the following:\n       (A) Title II of the Defense Authorization Amendments and \n     Base Closure and Realignment Act (Public Law 100-526; 10 \n     U.S.C. 2687 note).\n       (B) The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 \n     (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 \n     note).\n       (C) Any Act enacted after the date of enactment of this Act \n     the provisions of which authorize or require the closure or \n     realignment of a military installation.\n       (2) Savings realized.--The term ``savings realized'', with \n     respect to military installations closed or realigned under \n     the base closure laws, means the costs the Department would \n     otherwise have incurred with respect to such installations if \n     not for the closure or realignment of such installations \n     under such laws.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       JEFFORDS AMENDMENT NO. 687\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 936, supra: as follows:\n\n       On page 84, after line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 340.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Defend America Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 222. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Although the United States possesses the technological \n     means to develop and deploy defensive systems that would be \n     highly effective in countering limited ballistic missile \n     threats to its territory, the United States has not deployed \n     such systems and currently has no policy to do so.\n       (2) The threat that is posed to the national security of \n     the United States by the proliferation of ballistic missiles \n     is significant and growing, both quantitatively and \n     qualitatively.\n       (3) The trend in ballistic missile proliferation is toward \n     longer range and increasingly sophisticated missiles.\n       (4) Several countries that are hostile to the United States \n     (including North Korea, Iran, Libya, and Iraq) have \n     demonstrated an interest in acquiring ballistic missiles \n     capable of reaching the United States.\n       (5) The Intelligence Community of the United States has \n     confirmed that North Korea is developing an intercontinental \n     ballistic missile that will be capable of reaching Alaska or \n     beyond once deployed.\n       (6) There are ways for determined countries to acquire \n     missiles capable of threatening the United States with little \n     warning by means other than indigenous development.\n       (7) Because of the dire consequences to the United States \n     of not being prepared to defend itself against a rogue \n     missile attack and the long-lead time associated with \n     preparing an effective defense, it is prudent to commence a \n     national missile defense deployment effort before new \n     ballistic missile threats to the United States are \n     unambiguously confirmed.\n       (8) The timely deployment by the United States of an \n     effective national missile defense system will reduce the \n     incentives for countries to develop or otherwise acquire \n     intercontinental ballistic missiles, thereby inhibiting as \n     well as countering the proliferation of missiles and weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n       (9) Deployment by the United States of a national missile \n     defense system will reduce concerns about the threat of an \n     accidental or unauthorized ballistic missile attack on the \n     United States.\n       (10) The offense-only approach to strategic deterrence \n     presently followed by the United States and Russia is \n     fundamentally adversarial and is not a suitable basis for \n     stability in a world in which the United States and the \n     states of the former Soviet Union are seeking to normalize \n     relations and eliminate Cold War attitudes and arrangements.\n       (11) Pursuing a transition to a form of strategic \n     deterrence based increasingly on defensive capabilities and \n     strategies is in the interest of all countries seeking to \n     preserve and enhance strategic stability.\n       (12) The deployment of a national missile defense system \n     capable of defending the United States against limited \n     ballistic missile attacks would (A) strengthen deterrence at \n     the levels of forces agreed to by the United States and \n     Russia under the START I Treaty, and (B) further strengthen \n     deterrence if reductions below START I levels are implemented \n     in the future.\n       (13) Article XIII of the ABM Treaty envisions ``possible \n     changes in the strategic situation which have a bearing on \n     the provisions of this treaty''.\n       (14) Articles XIII and XIV of the treaty establish means \n     for the parties to amend the treaty, and the parties have in \n     the past used those means to amend the treaty.\n       (15) Article XV of the treaty establishes the means for a \n     party to withdraw from the treaty, upon six months notice \n     ``if it decides that extraordinary events related to the \n     subject matter of this treaty have jeopardized its supreme \n     interests''.\n       (16) Previous discussions between the United States and \n     Russia, based on Russian President Yeltsin's proposal for a \n     Global Protection System, envisioned an agreement to amend \n     the ABM Treaty to allow (among other measures) deployment of \n     as many as four ground-based interceptor sites in addition to \n     the one site permitted under the ABM Treaty and unrestricted \n     exploitation of sensors based within the atmosphere and in \n     space.\n\n     SEC. 223. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY.\n\n       (a) It is the policy of the United States to deploy by the \n     end of 2003 a National Missile Defense system that--\n       (1) is capable of providing a highly-effective defense of \n     the territory of the United States against limited, \n     unauthorized, or accidental ballistic missile attacks; and\n       (2) will be augmented over time to provide a layered \n     defense against larger and more sophisticated ballistic \n     missile threats as they emerge.\n       (b) It is the policy of the United States to seek a \n     cooperative transition to a regime that does not feature an \n     offense-only form of deterrence as the basis for strategic \n     stability.\n\n     SEC. 224. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Development of System.--To implement \n     the policy established in section 223(a), the Secretary of \n     Defense shall develop for deployment an affordable and \n     operationally effective National Missile Defense (NMD) system \n     which shall achieve an initial operational capability (IOC) \n     by the end of 2003.\n       (b) Elements of the NMD System.--The system to be developed \n     for deployment shall include the following elements:\n       (1) An interceptor system that optimizes defensive coverage \n     of the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii against \n     limited, accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile \n     attacks and includes one or a combination of the following:\n       (A) Ground-based interceptors.\n       (B) Sea-based interceptors.\n       (C) Space-based kinetic energy interceptors.\n       (D) Space-based directed energy systems.\n       (2) Fixed ground-based radars.\n       (3) Space-based sensors, including the Space and Missile \n     Tracking System.\n       (4) Battle management, command, control, and communications \n     (BM/C3).\n\n     SEC. 225. IMPLEMENTATION OF NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM.\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall--\n       (1) upon the enactment of this Act, promptly initiate \n     required preparatory and planning actions that are necessary \n     so as to be capable of meeting the initial operational \n     capability (IOC) date specified in section 224(a);\n       (2) plan to conduct by the end of 1998 an integrated \n     systems test which uses elements (including BM/C3 \n     elements) that are representative of, and traceable to, the \n     national missile defense system architecture specified in \n     section 224(b);\n       (3) prescribe and use streamlined acquisition policies and \n     procedures to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of \n     developing the system specified in section 224(a); and\n       (4) develop an affordable national missile defense follow-\n     on program that--\n       (A) leverages off of the national missile defense system \n     specified in section 224(a), and\n       (B) augments that system, as the threat changes, to provide \n     for a layered defense.\n\n[[Page S6943]]\n\n     SEC. 226. REPORT ON PLAN FOR NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM \n                   DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT.\n\n       Not later than March 15, 1998, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to Congress a report on the Secretary's plan for \n     development and deployment of a national missile defense \n     system pursuant to this subtitle. The report shall include \n     the following matters:\n       (1) The Secretary's plan for carrying out this subtitle, \n     including--\n       (A) a detailed description of the system architecture \n     selected for development under section 224(b); and\n       (B) a discussion of the justification for the selection of \n     that particular architecture.\n       (2) The Secretary's estimate of the amount of \n     appropriations required for research, development, test, \n     evaluation, and for procurement, for each of fiscal years \n     1998 through 2003 in order to achieve the initial operational \n     capability date specified in section 224(a).\n       (3) A cost and operational effectiveness analysis of \n     follow-on options to improve the effectiveness of such \n     system.\n       (4) A determination of the point at which any activity that \n     is required to be carried out under this subtitle would \n     conflict with the terms of the ABM Treaty, together with a \n     description of any such activity, the legal basis for the \n     Secretary's determination, and an estimate of the time at \n     which such point would be reached in order to meet the \n     initial operational capability date specified in section \n     224(a).\n\n     SEC. 227. POLICY REGARDING THE ABM TREATY.\n\n       (a) ABM Treaty Negotiations.--In light of the findings in \n     section 222 and the policy established in section 223, \n     Congress urges the President to pursue high-level discussions \n     with the Russian Federation to achieve an agreement to amend \n     the ABM Treaty to allow deployment of the national missile \n     defense system being developed for deployment under section \n     224.\n       (b) Requirement for Senate Advice and Consent.--If an \n     agreement described in subsection (a) is achieved in \n     discussions described in that subsection, the President shall \n     present that agreement to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent. No funds appropriated or otherwise available for any \n     fiscal year may be obligated or expended to implement such an \n     amendment to the ABM Treaty unless the amendment is made in \n     the same manner as the manner by which a treaty is made.\n       (c) Action Upon Failure To Achieve Negotiated Changes \n     Within One Year.--If an agreement described in subsection (a) \n     is not achieved in discussions described in that subsection \n     within one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     the President and Congress, in consultation with each other, \n     shall consider exercising the option of withdrawing the \n     United States from the ABM Treaty in accordance with the \n     provisions of Article XV of that treaty.\n\n     SEC. 228. FUNDING FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998.\n\n       Of the funds authorized to be appropriated under section \n     201(4), $1,840,606,000 shall be available for the national \n     missile defense program.\n\n     SEC. 229. ABM TREATY DEFINED.\n\n       For purposes of this subtitle, the term ``ABM Treaty'' \n     means the Treaty Between the United States of America and the \n     Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation of \n     Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems, and signed at Moscow on May \n     26, 1972, and includes the Protocols to that Treaty, signed \n     at Moscow on July 3, 1974.\n\n     SEC. 230.

CONTINUATION OF SUPPORT TO SENIOR MILITARY COLLEGES.\n\n       (a) Definition of Senior Military Colleges.--For purposed \n     of this section, the term ``senior military colleges'' means \n     the following:\n       (1) Texas A University.\n       (2) Norwich University.\n       (3) The Virginia Military Institute.\n       (4) The Citadel.\n       (5) Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.\n       (6) North Georgia College and State University.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The senior military colleges consistently have provided \n     substantial numbers of highly qualified, long-serving leaders \n     to the Armed Forces.\n       (2) The quality of the military leaders produced by the \n     senior military colleges is, in part, the result of the \n     rigorous military environment imposed on students attending \n     the senior military colleges by the colleges, as well as the \n     result of the long-standing close support relationship \n     between the Corps of Cadets at each college and the Reserve \n     Officer Training Corps personnel at the colleges who serve a \n     effective leadership role models and mentors.\n       (3) In recognition of the quality of the young leaders \n     produced by the senior military colleges, the Department of \n     Defense and the military service have traditionally \n     maintained special relationships with the colleges, including \n     the policy to grant active duty service in the Army to \n     graduates of the colleges who desire such service and who are \n     recommended for such service by their ROTC professors of \n     military science.\n       (4) Each of the senior military colleges has demonstrated \n     an ability to adapt its systems and operations to changing \n     conditions in, and requirements of, the Armed Forces without \n     compromising the quality of leaders produced and without \n     interruption of the close relationship between the colleges \n     and the Department of Defense.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings in \n     subsection (b), it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the proposed initiative of the Secretary of the Army to \n     end the commitment to active duty service for all graduates \n     of senior military colleges who desire such service and who \n     are recommended for such service by their ROTC professors of \n     military science is short-sighted and contrary to the long-\n     term interests of the Army;\n       (2) as they have in the past, the senior military colleges \n     can and will continue to accommodate to changing military \n     requirements to ensure that future graduates entering \n     military service continue to be officers of superb quality \n     who are quickly assimilated by the Armed Forces and fully \n     prepared to make significant contributions to the Armed \n     Forces through extended military careers; and\n       (3) decisions of the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary \n     of a military department that fundamentally and unilaterally \n     change the long-standing relationship of the Armed Forces \n     with the senior military colleges are not in the best \n     interests of the Department of Defense or the Armed Forces \n     and are patently unfair to students who made decisions to \n     enroll in the senior military colleges on the basis of \n     existing Department and Armed Forces policy.\n       (d) Continuation of Support for Senior Military Colleges.--\n     Section 2111a of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (g); and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (c) the following new \n     subsections:\n       ``(d) Additional Support.--(1) The Secretaries of the \n     military departments shall ensure that each unit of the \n     Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps at a senior military \n     college provides support to the Corps of Cadets at the \n     college over and above the level of support associated with \n     the conduct of the formal Senior Reserve Officers' Training \n     Corps course of instruction.\n       ``(2) This additional support shall include the following:\n       ``(A) Mentoring, teaching, coaching, counseling and \n     advising cadets and cadet leaders in the areas of leadership, \n     military, and academic performance.\n       ``(B) Involvement in cadet leadership training, \n     development, and evaluation, as well as drill, ceremonies, \n     parades, and inspections.\n       ``(3) This additional support may include the following:\n       ``(A) Advising cadet teams, clubs, and organizations.\n       ``(B) Involvement in matters of discipline and \n     administration of the Corps of Cadets so long as such \n     involvement does not interfere with the conduct of the formal \n     Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps course of instruction \n     or the support required by paragraph (2).\n       ``(e) Termination or Reduction of Program Prohibited.--The \n     Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the military \n     departments may not take or authorize any action to terminate \n     or reduce a unit of the Senior Reserve Officers' Training \n     Corps at a senior military college unless the termination or \n     reduction is specifically requested by the college.\n       ``(f) Assignment to Active Duty.--(1) The Secretary of the \n     Army shall ensure that a graduate of a senior military \n     college who desires to serve as a commissioned officer on \n     active duty upon graduation from the college, who is \n     medically and physically qualified for active duty, and who \n     is recommended for such duty by the professor of military \n     science at the college, shall be assigned to active duty. \n     This paragraph shall apply to a member of the program at a \n     senior military college who graduates from the college after \n     March 31, 1997.\n       ``(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to \n     prohibit the Secretary of the Army from requiring a member of \n     the program who graduates from a senior military college to \n     serve on active duty.''.\n       (e) Technical Corrections.--Subsection (g) of such section, \n     as redesignated by subsection (d)(1), is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2), by striking out ``College'' and \n     inserting in lieu thereof ``University'';
