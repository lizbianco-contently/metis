Mr. President, I come to the floor and I think that \nother Senators will certainly be on the floor today, tomorrow, and as \nlong as it takes, to speak about the disaster in my State and in the \nDakotas and other States as well. I really come to the floor today to \nspeak about a disaster, really a disaster on top of a disaster, because \nthe disaster supplemental, which the Congress completed action on \nThursday has still not been sent to the White House. There has been a \ndisaster in our States and peoples lives have been devastated and they \nare waiting for additional Federal assistance.\n  Mr. President, there is the disaster that people are faced with in \nMinnesota and the Dakotas of having been\n\n[[Page S5388]]\n\nflooded out of their homes. I heard the Chaplain's prayer, that we \nresolve our impasse this week, and I thank him for his prayer. He is \nalways very sincere and I hope all of us will listen to him because \nthere has to be a way that we can get help to people who really are \ntrying to rebuild their lives.\n  I heard the mayor from Grand Forks, ND, this morning on one of the \nnational network shows. She was saying that people are doing well at \nthe community level because they really are helping each other out and \ntrying to get back to their regular normal routines. But the one thing \nthat is just continuing to really discourage and demoralize people is \nthey still do not know whether or not there will be any additional \nFederal assistance. They are waiting week after week after week.\n  Mr. President, I feel that the disaster, the other disaster, is the \ndisaster here in the Congress. I spoke for a long time about this last \nweek, and then said at the end of the week--and I am not really, by the \nway, looking forward to this--I said that I was prepared to come to the \nfloor and speak for a long time again this week on the need for this \nemergency supplemental assistance. I do not know what the business of \nthe Senate will be, but I am prepared to make sure that there is no \nbusiness as usual in the Senate until we pass a clean supplemental that \nthe President can sign. This has to be resolved.\n  The particular disaster I want to speak to this afternoon, Mr. \nPresident, is the fact that some very controversial riders have been \nadded to the supplemental. I think the people in Minnesota and the \nDakotas are confused about this issue as well. They do not understand \nwhy some Members of the House and the Senate have insisted on adding \nthese controversial riders. The purpose of this emergency disaster \nsupplemental is to get much needed assistance out to these people who \nhave been flooded out of their homes, not as a vehicle for unrelated \nissues like the continuing resolution and a provision relating to how \nthe 2000 census will be done. By the way, the vast majority of people \nin Minnesota do not agree with that.\n  So you have an effort to attach on what is called a continuing \nresolution, and then you have another amendment dealing with the way we \ntake our census. Unrelated issues that the President said he would veto \nthe bill over. By the way, when the President came out to visit North \nDakota and South Dakota and Minnesota he said way back then when he \nlooked at the devastation, ``I just hope that people will keep this a \nclean bill. Please get the help to people. Do not put on other \nmeasures.'' He always said he would veto it.\n  Now, here is my question. Why hasn't the bill been sent to the White \nHouse yet? Here it is 12:10, today, Monday. To my knowledge, after this \npiece of legislation was to be sent to the President on Thursday of \nlast week, it was not. First we have the House of Representatives going \non vacation, Memorial Day recess, not even finishing the bill, not even \nfinishing the bill. Then we finally got this passed on Thursday and now \nwe find out that, now it is 12:10 Monday, they still have not sent the \nbill over to the President. This is unconscionable on top of \nunconscionable. They did not send the bill over to the President on \nFriday. They know he will veto it. What is the majority party doing? I \nwould be quite prepared to debate anybody who wants to debate me on \nthis.\n  I do not agree, most of the people in Minnesota do not agree, with \nattaching unrelated issues to the supplemental. Keep the bill clean and \nget the help to people.\n  Why hasn't the bill, that you know the President is going to veto, \nbeen sent to the President? You did not send it on Friday, you have not \nsent it on the weekend, and you have not even sent it come Monday. Some \npeople can be incredibly generous with the suffering of others. Can \nanybody on the floor of the U.S. Senate who agrees with this decision \nnot to even send the bill to the President--you know he will veto it, \nthen it comes back here, then maybe we can have an agreement--can \nanybody justify that? Not for me, as a Senator from Minnesota, but for \nthe people in East Grand Forks or Grand Forks or Warren or Ada, and a \nwhole lot of other communities.\n  Now, here is what I see, and this is just transparent:\n\n       GOP sources alternately said they declined to send the \n     disaster relief bill to the White House last week because \n     either they wanted to give the President a chance to change \n     his mind--which they were hoping to do through a weekend \n     grassroots effort--or they were afraid Clinton would be able \n     to monopolize the Sunday talk shows with his explanation of \n     the expected veto.\n\n  This is unbelievable. So here is what we have. Talk about talking out \nof two sides of your mouth. On the one hand people are saying, no, we \ndo not want to send the bill to them because we really think that we \nwill have a chance to change his mind. On the other hand, they say, no, \nwe do not want to send a bill to him because we know he will veto it \nand we do not want him to be on Sunday shows talking about why he has \nvetoed it.\n  Mr. President, can I suggest a third point to you, and that is, to \npeople who are waiting for help, they do not understand these games. So \nI suggest to my colleagues on the majority side that it is time to send \nthe bill to the President. You should not have delayed it on Friday. \nYou should not be delaying it today. You know full well he will veto \nthe bill. You are playing politics with people's lives. Get the bill \nback here, let us get to work and get the help to people. This has \nbecome really callous and really insensitive.\n  Now here we have another explanation:\n\n       House Majority leader Dick Armey, Texas, on Friday said \n     Congress would not send Clinton the bill until today, even \n     though the enrolling clerk had already finished work on it. \n     ``We think it's important that the President have a weekend \n     to think this thing through,'' he said.\n       But Republicans also needed some time to think about what \n     their plan will be if the measure is vetoed.\n       GOP leaders were in ``some turmoil'' over what their game \n     plan should be, as a GOP aide said.\n\n  I put the emphasis on game. Stop playing games. I do not care whether \nit is Republicans or Democrats. I only care right now about the people \nin East Grand Forks, MN, and the people in the Dakotas and other \ncommunities in Minnesota. I do not care about these games. They know \nthe President was going to veto it. This was just an effort to \nembarrass the President and it still has not been sent to him. You know \nwhat, colleagues? I do not know whether you have embarrassed the \nPresident or not, I do not think you have, but the point is you have \nembarrassed yourselves. You have embarrassed yourselves because \neverybody can see through this. If you want to provide disaster relief \nto people in an emergency supplemental, then we should understand it is \nan emergency supplemental bill. It is a disaster. People are waiting to \nrebuild their homes. People are waiting to rebuild their businesses. \nPeople are trying to find out whether or not they are going to be moved \nbecause they live in a floodplain or whether they will not be moved, \nand they cannot find out anything because of this unbelievable charade \nthat is taking place here.\n\n  I really do not understand it. I said last week that you have seen in \nthe Dakotas and Minnesota a real sense of community. I see no sense of \ncommunity here. I see no sense of community here. By the way, the vast \nmajority of people would agree.\n  I voted for the bill because I know how important it is to get help \nto people, but most people understand, and I can understand, what the \nPresident is doing. That as President, we have one President, he can \nsay, look, give me a disaster relief bill, give me something that \nprovides assistance to people. Do not mix up agendas. Do not impose \nyour own agendas about how you want the census taken, do not impose \nyour own agenda on whether you want money spent on education or not, do \nnot impose your own agenda about public parks on a disaster relief bill \nfor people.\n  Now, if anybody wants to debate me, come on out. I am willing to stay \nhere all afternoon. I would be willing to stay here all afternoon. If \npeople don't come out, then I assume there is no debate for right now. \nI want to make it clear, Mr. President--very clear--and I would rather \nnot do it and I am sure there will be help--but this week, until this \ndisaster relief bill gets done, insofar as I am able to as the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, I will make sure that nothing else gets done here. To \nthe extent that I can use every bit of knowledge\n\n[[Page S5389]]\n\nthat I have and leverage as a Senator to fight for people in Minnesota.\n  I am going to make sure that the Senate is a deliberative body. If my \ncolleagues think this process is geared to grind slowly, I am going to \nmake sure that it is practically at a halt.\n  This is outrageous, I say to the Chair, and he can't comment, and he \nmay be in complete agreement with me on the substance. But, frankly, he \nwould do the same thing, I think, probably if it was his own State. I \nmean, enough is enough. We are not going to do business as usual until \nthis disaster relief bill is passed and we get assistance to people. I \ncannot, for a moment, understand why--and I doubt whether anybody from \nthe majority party is going to come out and debate me--even though I \ndon't agree with adding on other provisions, what I really have trouble \nunderstanding is why did they not send it to the President Friday? Why \nis it 12:20 on Monday and this still hasn't been sent to the President? \nMaybe delay is fine here, this is all abstract; but these are people's \nlives. I bet you that you ask the American people whether or not they \nthink there is any defense for not sending the bill to the President, \nwhich you know is going to be vetoed, so you can then get down to work \nand finally pass a bill to get help to people who have been flooded out \nof their homes, I bet you 99 percent of the people in the country would \nsay they don't understand this at all. And they should not understand \nit because there is simply nothing to defend.\n  Mr. President, the Washington Post had an editorial on Sunday that \nstarts out, ``The President is right and Republicans are wrong about \nthe disaster relief bill.'' I will amend that. Frankly, at this point \nin time I agree, but I want to make it crystal clear that it should not \nbe a partisan issue. Let's just get the help to people, just get a \ndisaster relief bill with provisions in the bill that have to do with \nproviding disaster relief, and pass it. That is what we should do.\n  The Post editorial goes on to say: ``Once again''--this is the \nlanguage that is important--``in trying to use an appropriations bill \nas a forcing device, they have overreached. The amendments raise \nimportant issues that deserve to be debated on the merits and under the \nregular rules.'' And then the conclusion--``An emergency bill to \nprovide flood relief in the upper Midwest, and to pay some of the cost \nof the Bosnia peacekeeping mission, and to plug a few unexpected holes \nin the budget, is the wrong place to thrash out these other issues.'' \nThey were talking about right-of-way across Federal lands like this. \nThey ought to back off.\n  Here is an article written in the Pioneer Press by columnist Bill \nSalisbury. ``Political Ping-Pong is a Pathetic Game.'' That is quite a \ntitle. It starts out:\n\n       The folks from Grand Forks and East Grand Forks were \n     perplexed. They came here Wednesday to make yet another plea \n     for Federal aid to help them recover from the spring flooding \n     that wrecked their town.\n       The group of 11 city officials and business leaders got \n     patted on the head, assured that the national leaders feel \n     their pain, and once again were promised that the money will \n     soon be on its way.\n       But if our Federal leaders had been completely honest with \n     the group, they would have said something like: ``You're \n     going to get your flood relief sooner or later, but first \n     we're going to play a little political ping-pong game, and \n     we're going to use you folks as the ball.''\n  I don't think anybody could have said it better. That is what is \ngoing on here, a political ping-pong game using people in our \ncommunities, in the Dakotas and in Minnesota, as the ball. It is a \npolitical ping-pong game using people in our communities as the ball. \nWell, I have news for you, colleagues. If that is your plan, don't plan \non conducting any other business on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \nbecause there are going to be some of us out here and we are going to \nreally fight hard this week. This has just become outrageous.\n  Now, Mr. President, I could focus on all of the conditions and the \nlives of people in our communities, and I will do that as we move \nforward this week because I want to reserve my voice and my strength \nfor when the majority party is trying to conduct its business so I can \ncome out here and make sure that doesn't happen. But let me, one more \ntime at least, bring this to the attention of the people in Minnesota \nand in the Dakotas and elsewhere in the country.\n  What is going on here? You have a disaster, and the disaster is right \nhere in the Congress. The disaster right here is the leader--the \ndisaster right here is the failure of the majority party to move this \nbill forward. I am sorry, I don't know any other way to say it. There \nare three issues. You have people in pain and they need help. They have \nbeen waiting week after week after week, and they are being used as the \nball in a political ping-pong game.\n  Second issue. You have people here who decided on an oh-so-clever \nstrategy and that strategy was to say, OK, here is a disaster relief \nbill. Everybody is going to be for providing help to people. So now we \nhave these other agendas. Why don't we take our other political agendas \nhaving to do with the Census Bureau and their work, and public parks \nand roads, having to do with fights over budget priorities, and why \ndon't we just put these provisions in this bill? That is a disaster. \nBut now we have another disaster. The disaster I am talking about today \nis the disaster of the majority party and after loading on these \nprovisions and knowing the President is going to veto the bill on \nFriday, not sending the bill over, and with the bogus argument made \nabout how ``we didn't want to because we thought maybe the President \nwould change his mind,'' or ``actually, we didn't want to because, if \nwe did, the President could get on the Sunday talk shows and make us \nlook bad.''\n  I don't really care whether those I work with look bad. I am worried \nabout the people in my State. And now it is Monday and I have a \nquestion for the majority party: When are you going to send this bill \nto the President? What are you waiting for? How much more suffering \ndoes there have to be? How many more people do you want to demoralize? \nHow much longer do you want people waiting? Where is your humanity? \nSend the bill over to the President, and then the President will veto \nthe bill--he is going to veto the bill. Let's get to work and let's \nhave some agreement. Let's have some compromise. Let's work things out, \nlet's pass this bill, and let's pass this bill this week--tomorrow.\n  But, Mr. President, we can't do anything until the majority party \nsends the bill over. I extend an invitation to any of my colleagues: \nAnytime you would like to come out on the U.S. Senate floor today and \ndebate this question, please do, because it is a question that people \nin Minnesota and in the Dakotas have. If you would like to explain to \nthe people in Minnesota and in the Dakotas on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate why you have not sent this bill to the President and why you are \nengaging in further delay, I would be very pleased for you to do so. I \nwould be pleased. Actually, I think really you owe people that \nexplanation. But I don't really think there is any argument that you \ncan make.\n  I will conclude this way this afternoon. I want my colleagues to know \nthat I think it is indefensible and I don't blame you for not being out \nhere because you can't defend it. I also want colleagues to know--those \nin support of this effort--that if we don't get to work on this and we \ndon't pass this disaster relief bill, then I am prepared--and I am sure \nI will be joined by other colleagues as well because I heard Senator \nDaschle express a tremendous amount of indignation, along with both \nSenators from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad and Mr. Dorgan, and Senator \nJohnson from South Dakota, and we are prepared to fight very hard.\n\n  So to my colleagues, whoever you are on the other side, whoever you \nare who made this decision not to even send this bill to the President, \ncausing yet further delay and postponing the time when people will \nfinally get help back in Minnesota, for some reason, I gather you think \nthis is a clever strategy. I want you to know that people see through \nit and, in any case, I want you to know that until we get the work done \nhere and we get the help to people, as a Senator from Minnesota, I am \ngoing to make sure that there will be no business as usual on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate. I may not always be able to get the floor, and it \nmay not be all that easy, but I am quite convinced that this is what I \nshould do, and I think other Senators will do the same thing. There \ncomes a point in time when the only thing you can do, if you are trying \nto fight for people you represent, is come to the floor of the U.S.\n\n[[Page S5390]]\n\nSenate and use your leverage. It looks like this is one of those times.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude on a more positive note. I hope that \nmy colleagues in the majority party will send this bill to the \nPresident today. I hope that it will come back to us right away, and I \n``hope and pray,'' in the words of the Chaplain, that we will reach \nagreement and pass a disaster relief bill and that we will get help to \npeople in Minnesota and in the Dakotas.\n  Mr. President, these are good people, really good people. They have \nreally been through a lot and they deserve our help. They don't deserve \nwhat we are doing to them right now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, while it has been called to my \nattention that, in speaking quickly, I might have also called the \nleadership a disaster. That was not my intention.\n  I will make sure that my remarks do not reflect that. I think it is a \ndisaster here, what is going on. But I want to make it clear that \nnothing I said was intended in that way.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business. The Senator may \nproceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5387-7", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know there is some misunderstanding over \nwhat is happening right now in terms of this emergency supplemental, \nand I believe maybe some clarification would be in order.\n  The very distinguished Senator from Minnesota spent 30 minutes \nexpressing his anxiety over the passage of this emergency supplemental \nlegislation. Let me assure you, Mr. President, if you were listening to \nthat, that there are not any people in North Dakota or in Minnesota \nright now who are going without the emergency provisions that are \nauthorized. And, as a matter of fact, there are some things that won't \nreally be done, such as the outright replacing of infrastructure and \nsome of those things.\n  So it is not as if those people are being ignored. It is not as if we \nwent off and took a vacation during the time that was happening.\n  But I think it is important to mention a couple of other things that \nare in this emergency supplemental. I am hoping that the President \nwon't veto it. It is not at all unusual that the bill is not sent to \nthe President. If it were sent to the President after it was only \npassed on Thursday night, by Monday morning, then, that would probably \nset some new kind of a record around here. Things don't move that fast. \nThere is nothing unusual about the fact that this bill has not been \nsent to the President. But this presupposition that the President is \ngoing to veto it, I think, is really wrong. I think the President will \nhave to look very closely at whether or not he wants to veto this \nemergency legislation.\n  For one thing, it is the President that got us into the situation \nthat we are in in Bosnia right now. But we should never have sent \ntroops over to Bosnia when you have a military budget that is suffering \nand while we have great threats that are out there to send troops on \nhumanitarian missions and peacekeeping missions all around the world \nwhere we don't have strategic interests at stake.\n  I can remember 18 months ago standing on this floor when the \nPresident of the United States said that the cost in Bosnia would be \nsomewhere between $1.5 and $2 billion. At that time I said, ``I bet it \nwill be $8 billion before it is over.'' Guess what? It is already \npassing through $6.5 billion. And some of the money that is in this \nemergency supplemental is going to be going to support the effort in \nBosnia. It has already been paid.\n  But this is replenishing, the same as it is up in North Dakota and \nfor some of the flood victims. They have been addressed. Problems have \nbeen addressed. Of course, we do need to replenish that emergency fund, \nwhich we intend to do.\n  But I think the main thing is the idea that the President is going to \nautomatically veto this. I think you know that the automatic continuing \nresolution is on this, which I think is very, very good. It wasn't too \nlong ago that the President shut down the Government and blamed the \nmajority party for it, and if we had this continuing resolution in \nplace, that couldn't happen again. All we want to do is to be sure that \nwe are going to be able to carry on Government and let Government \noperate in the event there is an impasse between Congress and the \nPresident of the United States on some appropriations bills. That is \nexactly what this is all about. So, if we had the continuing resolution \nthat is passed, which is a part of this emergency supplemental \nlegislation, then the continuing resolution will provide that \nGovernment won't shut down, that it will continue to operate at last \nyear's funding level, which I think is very reasonable. We don't want \nto shut down Government. That way, we can ensure it won't happen. That \nis all in this emergency supplemental.\n\n  So I am hoping, of course, that the President doesn't use the \nautomatic continuing resolution as an excuse to veto this bill, because \nif he does, what he is saying is, I want Government to be able to be \nshut down. It is as simple as that.\n  Lastly, I say that I have the utmost respect for the Senator from \nMinnesota. Quite often you see different philosophies expressed on this \nfloor. Of course, his is quite different than mine. I think the basic \ndifference is that when we look at money that Government spends, we \nlook at it as coming from the taxpayers rather than just some big pot \nof money that is owned by Government. So we have conservatives and we \nhave liberals. And the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, Senator \nWellstone, is very liberal, and we are very conservative.\n  So this is a forum where those things can be heard. I think, in good \ntime, the President will get this emergency supplemental, and I am \ncertainly hopeful that the President will not veto the supplemental.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS.

I appreciate very much the Senator from West Virginia \nyielding to give me the opportunity to do this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5390-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5390-S5392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FREEDOM FROM GOVERNMENT COMPETITION ACT\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about a \nproblem that I think we have in this country in terms of the \norganization of Government, in terms of the future role of Government, \nin terms of where we want to be with respect to Government and the \nprivate sector, and specifically Government's competition with the \nprivate sector. This competition, of course, takes many forms, but the \nbasic premise is that the Federal Government provides commercial goods \nand services in-house instead of going to the private sector and \ncontracting out for these needs. This is called insourcing, and it \nleads to larger\n\n[[Page S5391]]\n\nand larger Government. It is my view that given limited Federal \nresources we ought to set priorities as to where we spend money and \nfind ways to meet these commercial needs more reasonably, more \nefficiently by contracting.\n\n  Insourcing, of course, tends to stifle job creation in the private \nsector. It weakens economic growth. It erodes the tax base, of course. \nIt hurts small businesses and costs taxpayers money.\n  There is a great deal of talk that goes on in this country about \ndownsizing, about reinventing Government, but the fact is very little \nof that actually goes on. The Clinton administration has talked some \nabout how there are fewer employees in the Federal Government than \nthere used to be, but almost all of that is a result of base closures \nin the Department of Defense and RTC when it finished its work with \nregard to the savings and loan scandal. The fact is that Government \nexpenditures and Government continue to grow and will, indeed, continue \nto grow under the budget that was approved recently.\n  But more specifically, I want to talk just a moment about legislation \nthat I have introduced called the Freedom From Government Competition \nAct that would address this problem. Congressman Duncan from Tennessee \nhas an identical bill in the House. I use an example that just happened \nthat I think we ought to reevaluate, one that we ought to look at, one \nwhere we ought to say wait a minute, what is going on here? This is an \nexample of unfair competition in the private sector, and in fact it was \non the front page of the Washington Post on May 22, 1997. I ask \nunanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 22, 1997]\n\n                When the Government Hires the Government\n\n                       (By Rajiv Chandresekaran)\n\n       When the Federal Aviation Administration announced last \n     fall that it was looking for someone new to operate its \n     computer systems for payroll, personnel and flight safety, \n     several of industry's biggest players came knocking.\n       Computer powerhouses International Business Machines Corp., \n     Unisys Corp., Computer Science Corp., and Lockheed Martin \n     Corp. all bid for the juicy contract, worth as much as $250 \n     million over eight years.\n       The winner, announced Friday, turned out to be an \n     organization well known in Washington, though not for its \n     computer experience; the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n       In a surprising decision being lauded by the Clinton \n     administration but derided by the computer services industry \n     and some members of Congress, the FAA's number-crunching will \n     be handled by a USDA computer center in Kansas City, MO.\n       The contract, which many observers predict could alter the \n     landscape of competition between the public and private \n     sectors, is one of the largest ever awarded to a government \n     agency in a head-to-head contest with industry.\n       The center is one of several federal facilities that have \n     been allowed, and even encouraged, to compete for business \n     from other agencies in recent years as part of the \n     administration's effort to ``reinvent'' government. The USDA \n     center's bid was nearly 15 percent lower than those from the \n     private sector, said Dennis DeGaetano, the FAA's deputy \n     associate administrator for acquisitions.\n       ``This shows that there are some organizations that are \n     both efficient and effective within the federal government,'' \n     said Anne F. Thompson Reed, a USDA spokeswoman. ``We're \n     giving the taxpayer a good value.''\n       The administration, particularly Vice President Gore's \n     National Performance Review project to streamline the way \n     federal agencies operate, views such competition between \n     government and industry as a cost-effective way for some \n     facilities to bring in new work--and money--to offset the \n     effects of budget cuts.\n       But federal contractors, many of which have their \n     headquarters in the Washington region, contend that the new \n     competitors will reduce the dollar amount of computer \n     services the government buys from the private sector, \n     estimated at more than $21.3 billion this fiscal year, \n     industry executives argue that federal agencies, which don't \n     have to pay taxes and which account for overhead expenses \n     such as electricity differently, receive an unfair \n     competitive advantage.\n       They also question whether the government's technical \n     expertise matches up to industry's. The government is ``not \n     as tech-savvy, not as agile, not as aggressive'' as the \n     private sector, said Bert M. Concklin, president of the \n     Professional Services Council, a Vienna-based association \n     of federal contractors.\n       The FAA decision already has come under fire from some \n     congressional Republicans, who argue that many other USDA \n     computer systems are grossly mismanaged.\n       The General Accounting Office's director of information \n     resources management, Joel C. Willemssen, told a \n     congressional subcommittee last week, ``USDA's inadequate \n     management of information technology investments resulted in \n     millions of taxpayer dollars being wasted.''\n       In response to previous congressional inquiries, the \n     department in November put on hold all computer purchases \n     exceeding $250,000 until it revamps its information \n     technology management structure.\n       ``The bottom line is: `Can they do it better than the \n     private sector?' The evidence we've seen suggests that there \n     are a lot of reasons to question that assumption,'' Rep. \n     Robert W. Goodlatte (R-Va.), chairman of the House \n     Agriculture Committee's subcommittee on department \n     operations, nutrition and foreign agriculture, said \n     yesterday. ``This could be a case of the blind leading the \n     blind.''\n       Concklin and other industry leaders also contend that the \n     FAA contract was improperly awarded because it skirted a set \n     of rules established by the Office of Management and Budget \n     for public-private competition. They also allege that the \n     USDA's bid was not scrutinized as much as those from private \n     firms.\n       ``We seriously doubt that the USDA proposal was visited \n     with the same precision and critical eye that was visited on \n     the private-sector proposals,'' Concklin said.\n       The FAA's DeGaetano denied that a double standard was used, \n     but he said yesterday that the agency's chief acquisitions \n     executive, George Donohue, decided to temporarily suspend \n     work on the contract while the agency investigates whether \n     OMB rules were followed. DeGaetano also said the agency wants \n     to respond to industry concerns ``over the fairness of \n     contracting with another government agency'' before allowing \n     the USDA to begin work.\n       But DeGaetano emphasized that ``this doesn't mean we're \n     rescinding the award.'' He said the Agriculture Department \n     won the award based on its low bid and its track record of \n     handling work for other agencies.\n       The Kansas City center, called the National Information \n     Technology Center, operates most of the USDA's big computer \n     projects, as well as obscure programs, including a timber-\n     management system for the Forest Service and a database of \n     plants for the Natural Resource Conservation Service. The \n     center has handled computer services for other government \n     agencies for the past decade, but not as the result of a \n     contract competition with the private sector, Reed said.\n       The center, known in Beltway parlance as a ``revolving-fund \n     agency,'' functions as a quasi-private entity within the \n     Agriculture Department. It operates by charging its \n     ``customers''--various arms of the USDA and other agencies--\n     for the services it provides, money that is used to pay the \n     center's salaries and operating costs.\n       But because the center by law can't make a profit--nor can \n     it seek commercial work--administration officials say its \n     services can be as much as 20 percent less expensive than \n     those of private contractors. ``The point of these operations \n     is to bring down the costs for government,'' said John A. \n     Koskinen, OMB deputy director for management.\n       Private contractors, however, contend that such government \n     operations, even if they have separate budgets, do not have \n     to pay for overhead costs and taxes in the same way.\n       ``The cost structures are totally different,'' said Olga \n     Grkavac, a vice president at the Information Technology \n     Association of America, an industry group based in Arlington. \n     ``It's not a level playing field. How can you have a fair \n     competition?''\n       Industry executives say they didn't pay much attention to \n     legislation that set up such competition, namely the 1994 \n     Government Reform Act, which established six pilot revolving-\n     fund projects. ``We never thought it would happen,'' said Pat \n     Ways, a group vice president at Computer Sciences, ``A \n     government data center that's more qualified than a \n     commercial one?''\n       At the same time, federal contractors don't have a spotless \n     reputation. Almost every large company that performs work for \n     the government has been accused, at one time or another, of \n     cost overruns and delivering faulty systems.\n       USDA officials maintain the agency's computer center will \n     be able to handle the FAA's work, which includes maintaining \n     personnel and payroll records, financial information, and a \n     large aviation safety database. The center will largely use \n     existing mainframe equipment but may need to hire additional \n     staff, officials said.\n       ``We're definitely qualified to do this job,'' Reed said.\n       Particularly worrisome to the information technology \n     industry, however, is the fact that the FAA contract had been \n     handled by a private firm, Electronic Data Systems Corp.\n       Ways said government competition for contracts could put \n     his company in the ``awkward position'' of competing with its \n     customers for new business. Computer Sciences, for instance, \n     performs work for the USDA, he said.\n       The contract is expected to renew a long-standing \n     Washington debate about the rules of competition between \n     government and industry, say several observers. On one hand, \n     several Republican legislators and industry executives \n     believe that the government shouldn't perform functions that \n     can be handled by the private sector. A bill introduced by \n     Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) would bar federal agencies from \n     bidding for work that could be handled by outside \n     contractors.\n       Administration officials acknowledge that private contracts \n     could suffer in the new\n\n[[Page S5392]]\n\n     competitive landscape, but they contend that might not be \n     such a bad thing.\n       ``Ultimately, the government is not always going to win and \n     the private sector isn't either,'' said Michael D. Serlin, a \n     former National Performance Review official who now works as \n     a consultant on federal contracting issues. ``If the result \n     is genuine competition, however, it's the taxpayer who's the \n     winner.''\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. The FAA recently announced it was awarding a contract of \nabout $150 million for data processing and information technology to \nthe Department of Agriculture. The problem is that there are plenty of \nprivate-sector groups that are more efficient or more capable of doing \nthat job.\n  When you think of technology, do you think of the Department of \nAgriculture? I do not think so. When you talk about doing payrolls and \nmanaging the FAA's technology, do you think of the Department of \nAgriculture? I do not think so. That is because information technology \nis not part of the Department of Agriculture's core mission.\n  The folks down at OMB and the Clinton administration will tell you it \nis a great thing; it is encouraging entrepreneurial Government. But I \nthink we ought to be encouraging private business and entrepreneurial \nenterprise, not Government. By recruiting contracts from other agencies \nto offset budget cuts, we are maintaining big Government at the expense \nof businesses in the private sector, especially small businesses. We \nare also cheating the taxpayer. Studies have shown that outsourcing can \nsave the Government up to 30 percent. Congressman Duncan and I wrote to \nthe President the day this article appeared to protest his plans on \nreinventing Government.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 1997.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to express our strong \n     concerns regarding a recent decision by the Federal Aviation \n     Administration (FAA) to award a large information technology \n     (IT) contract to the Department of Agriculture. We are \n     concerned that American taxpayers may be shortchanged by this \n     proposed contract. We seriously question whether your plans \n     for ``reinventing'' government should include federal \n     agencies unfairly competing with the private sector to \n     provide commercial goods and services to other government \n     agencies.\n       The current process for evaluating whether or not the \n     federal government should perform commercial functions is \n     woefully inadequate. Federal agencies have an unfair \n     advantage in these competitions because the government's true \n     costs are generally understated due to the absence of an \n     activity-based accounting system. The federal government \n     doesn't pay taxes and it accounts for overhead expenses \n     differently than private sector firms. Most alarming, it is \n     our understanding that the A-76 process was possibly \n     circumvented entirely, so that no rigorous competitive \n     analysis was performed at all.\n       In addition, the FAA appears to have decided to ignore the \n     past performance of the Department of Agriculture in the IT \n     area. Just last week, the Department was criticized by the \n     General Accounting Office (GAO) for ``inadequate management \n     of information technology investments that resulted in \n     millions of taxpayer dollars being wasted.'' In addition, in \n     response to previous congressional inquiries, the Department \n     of Agriculture recently put on hold all computer purchases \n     exceeding $250,000 until it revamps its information \n     technology management structure.\n       As you know, we recently introduced legislation in the U.S. \n     Senate and House of Representatives, S. 314 and H.R. 716, \n     that would eliminate unfair government competition with the \n     private sector. Our legislation corrects the problems with \n     the A-76 process and stops ``entrepreneurial'' government by \n     creating a ``best value comparision'' in which many factors, \n     such as qualifications, past performance and a fair cost \n     accounting system, are used to determine which entity will \n     provide the best value to the American taxpayer.\n       We encourage you to reevaluate the decision to award this \n     contract to the Department of Agriculture based on the \n     criteria laid out in S. 314 and H.R. 716. We look forward to \n     your prompt replay.\n           Sincerely,\n     Craig Thomas,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     John Duncan,\n       U.S. Representative.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Unfortunately, this reinventing Government is not \nachieving its purpose. It is recreating big Government. The current A-\n76 process, which is the system that is supposed to be used to decide \nif a function can be done more cost effectively and more efficiently in \nthe private sector, may not even have been used by the FAA before \nawarding the contract to the Department of Agriculture. And when A-76 \nis used, it does not provide a level playing field for comparing \nGovernment and the private sector. Finally, the GAO has strongly \ncriticized the Department of Agriculture's management of its current \ninformation technology. We shouldn't be giving them more work when they \ncan't handle their current assignments.\n  So my legislation would address these issues. The legislation would \nstop entrepreneurial Government dead in its tracks, create a best value \ncomparison between Government and private enterprise based on fair \naccounting systems, based on qualifications, based on past performance.\n  There are certainly activities within the Government that are \ninherently Government functions and should be done by the Government, \nbut there are many others that are commercial in nature. They are as \ncommercial as anything in the private sector could be. So this \nlegislation will lead to more efficient Government, will inject fair \ncompetition into Government monopolies and continue to reserve a \nGovernment role for inherently governmental functions. It also will \nencourage more and more contracting with the private sector for more \nefficiency and giving American taxpayers more bang for their buck.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this good \nGovernment, common sense of reform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5390-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5392-S5393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         WEST VIRGINIA POULTRY FARMERS COMMITTED TO STEWARDSHIP\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Sunday, June 1, 1997, edition of the \nWashington Post featured a front-page article on pollution in the \nPotomac River from poultry production. The story was prompted by a \nranking by American Rivers, which is a national environmental \norganization, of the Potomac River on the group's annual list of the 10 \nMost Endangered Rivers in North America, and inspired by American \nRivers' interpretation of a 1996 U.S. Department of Agriculture study \nthat detected nutrient and bacterial contamination in the waters of the \nSouth Branch of the Potomac.\n  American Rivers' annual promotion of its top 10 list is an effort to \nadvance public awareness about the fragility of the Nation's water \nresources, a laudable goal, and newsworthy, as well.\n  Regrettably, however, the media missed the real story of worth, \nnamely, the exemplary efforts by a nonpartisan coalition of public \nofficials and West Virginia family farmers to balance economic \ninterests with environmental goals. And, more importantly, the media \nmissed the spirit of cooperation needed to accomplish these goals \nthrough the voluntary implementation of farm management practices \nidentified in USDA's 1996 study as improving the efficient use of \nfarmland and reducing threats to the Potomac River.\n  I might add that, contrary to the negative impression left by the \nWashington Post writer, the heart of this industry is situated in the \ncharming town of Moorefield. This is an area which was settled in the \nearly 1700's and contains a federally designated historic district. \nMoorefield's antebellum homesteads and streets are enriched by the \npresence of hard-working family farmers, who not only earn a real day's \nwage, but also represent the backbone of our Nation's economy and \nspirit of community.\n  The poultry industry has dramatically expanded in the Potomac \nHeadwaters, from production at approximately 46.6 million birds in 1992 \nto 90 million birds in 1996. Recognizing the potential growth of the \nindustry, as early as 1990, a cooperative program between Federal and \nState agencies was launched to design and implement the best soil and \nwater conservation management practices. Rapid growth of any industry \nusually is not achieved\n\n[[Page S5393]]\n\nwithout problems. However, these problems have been identified and \nefforts are underway to ameliorate these consequences of expansion.\n  To date, 80 percent of the eligible farmers in the Potomac \nHeadwaters, which I understand is a higher than average percentage for \nsimilar USDA programs, have electively enrolled in the Potomac \nHeadwaters Land Treatment Watershed Project, the recommended action \nplan to protect the Potomac from possible agricultural pollution. I am \nproud that I have been able to secure funds to support the Federal \nshare of this project.\n  By enrolling in this project, West Virginia farmers have voluntarily \nagreed to develop nutrient management plans and install animal waste \nstructures and dead bird composters, and to improve livestock \nconfinement areas and vegetative buffer zones. Implementing these \nmeasures will cost the average farmer in the program $12,000 over 5 \nyears. The average farmer in the Potomac Headwaters has a net annual \nincome of $15,000 from poultry production.\n  I believe that most Americans would commend the farmer who \nvoluntarily spends 16 percent of his income over 5 years to protect the \nwaters of the Potomac River. Nevertheless, that is exactly what is \nhappening in West Virginia.\n  Thanks to the West Virginia farmer, the Potomac Headwaters Land \nTreatment Watershed Project will achieve benefits for a broad base of \ninterests, extending from my beautiful state to the Chesapeake Bay. It \nwould seem that this is the kind of effort that newspapers and \norganizations like American Rivers should be recognizing and \nencouraging.\n  Mr. President, how many minutes do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, over the past decade, I have been \ncontinually puzzled by our Nation's failure to produce better students \ndespite public concern and despite the billions of Federal dollars \nwhich annually are appropriated for various programs intended to aid \nand improve education. Not long ago, I asked a high ranking \nadministration official during an Appropriations Committee hearing why, \nin his opinion, we were not doing a better job of educating our \nNation's youth in light of the billions of dollars we have been \nspending over these past several years. The answer I got was not very \nilluminating.\n  Mr. President, our children still rank behind those of many other \nnations of the world with which we will have to compete for the jobs of \nthe future. Particularly in mathematics, where our kids will have to be \nespecially skilled, the United States ranks 28th in average mathematics \nperformance according to a study of 8th graders published in 1996. \nJapan ranked third.\n  A closer look at the current approach to mathematics in our schools \nreveals something called the ``new-new math.'' Apparently the concept \nbehind this new-new approach to mathematics is to get kids to enjoy \nmathematics and hope that that ``enjoyment'' will lead to a better \nunderstanding of basic math concepts. Nice thought, but nice thoughts \ndo not always get the job done.\n  Recently Marianne Jennings, a professor at Arizona State University \nfound that her teenage daughter could not solve a mathematical \nequation. This was all the more puzzling because her daughter was \ngetting an A in algebra. Curious about the disparity, Jennings took a \nlook at her daughter's Algebra textbook, euphemistically titled, \n``Secondary Math: An Integrated Approach: Focus on Algebra.'' Here it \nis--quite a handsome cover on the book. After reviewing it, Jennings \ndubbed it ``Rain Forest Algebra.''\n  I have recently obtained a copy of the same strange textbook--this is \nit, as I have already indicated--and I have to go a step further and \ncall it whacko algebra.\n  This textbook written by a conglomerate of authors lists 5 so-called \n``algebra authors,'' but it boasts 20 ``other series authors'' and 4 \n``multicultural reviewers.'' We are talking about algebra now. Why we \nneed multicultural review of an algebra textbook is a question which I \nwould like to hear someone answer, and the fact that there are 4 times \nas many ``other series authors'' as ``algebra authors'' in this book \nmade me suspect that this really was not an algebra textbook at all.\n  A quick look at the page entitled, ``Getting Started'' with the sub \nheading, ``What Do You Think,'' quickly confirmed my suspicions about \nthe quirky fuzziness of this new-new approach to mathematics.\n  Let me quote from that opening page.\n\n       In the twenty-first century, computers will do a lot of the \n     work that people used to do. Even in today's workplace, there \n     is little need for someone to add up daily invoices or \n     compute sales tax. Engineers and scientists already use \n     computer programs to do calculations and solve equations.\n\n  What kind of a message is sent by that brilliant opening salvo?\n  It hardly impresses upon the student the importance of mastering the \nbasics of mathematics or encourages them to dig in and prepare for the \ndifficult work it takes to be a first-rate student in math. Rather it \nseems to say, ``Don't worry about all of this math stuff too much. \nComputers will do all that work for us in a few years anyway.'' Can you \nimagine such a goofy passage in a Japanese math textbook? I ask what \nhappens if the computer breaks down or if we forget and leave the \npocket calculator at home? It appears that we may be on the verge of \nproducing a generation of students who cannot do a simple mathematical \nequation in their heads, or with a pencil, or even balance a checkbook.\n  The ``Getting Started'' portion of the text goes on to extol the \nvirtues of teamwork, to explain how to get to know other students and \nto ask how teamwork plays a role in conserving natural resources. What, \nI ask--what in heaven's name does this have to do with algebra? I took \nalgebra instead of Latin when I was in high school. I never had this \nrazzle-dazzle confusing stuff.\n  Page 5 of this same wondrous tome begins with a heading written in \nSpanish, English, and Portuguese, a map of South America and an \nindication of which language is spoken where. Pythagorus would have \nbeen scratching his head by this time, and I confess, so was I.\n  This odd amalgam of math, geography and language masquerading as an \nalgebra textbook goes on to intersperse each chapter with helpful \ncomments and photos of children named Taktuk, Esteban, and Minh. \nAlthough I don't know what happened to Dick and Jane, I do understand \nnow why there are four multicultural reviewers for this book. However, \nI still don't quite grasp the necessity for political correctness in an \nalgebra textbook. Nor do I understand the inclusion of the United \nNations Universal Declaration of Human Rights in three languages, a \nsection on the language of Algebra which defines such mathematically \nsignificant phrases as, ``the lion's share,'' the ``boondocks,'' and \n``not worth his salt.''\n  By the time we get around to defining an algebraic expression we are \non page 107. But it isn't long before we are off that boring topic to \nan illuminating testimony by Dave Sanfilippo, a driver with the United \nParcel Service. Sanfilippo tells us that he ``didn't do well in high \nschool mathematics * * *'' but that he is doing well at his job now \nbecause he enters ``* * * information on a pocket computer * * *''--\nhardly inspirational stuff for a kid struggling with algebra.\n  From there we hurry on to lectures on endangered species, a \ndiscussion of air pollution, facts about the Dogon people of \nWest Africa, chili recipes and a discussion of varieties of hot \npeppers--no wonder our pages are having difficulty containing \nthemselves. They are almost in stitches--what role zoos should play in \ntoday's society, and the dubious art of making shape images of animals \non a bedroom wall, only reaching a discussion of the Pythagorean \nTheorem on page 502. By this time I was thoroughly dazed and unsure of \nwhether I was looking at a science book, a language book, a sociology \nbook or a geography book. In fact, of\n\n[[Page S5394]]\n\ncourse, that is the crux of the problem. I was looking at all of the \nabove.\n\n  This textbook tries to be all things to all students in all subjects \nand the result is a mush of multiculturalism, environmental and \npolitical correctness, and various disjointed discussions on a \nmultitude of topics which certainly is bound to confuse the students \ntrying to learn and the teachers trying to teach from such unfocused \nnonsense. It is not just nonsense, it is unfocused nonsense, which is \neven worse.\n  Mathematics is about rules, memorized procedures and methodical \nthinking. We do memorize the multiplication tables, don't we? Else how \nwill one know that nine 8s are 72 and that eight 9s are 72. This new-\nnew mush-mush math will never produce quality engineers or \nmathematicians who can compete for jobs in the global market place. In \nPalo Alto, CA, public school math students plummeted from the 86th \npercentile to the 56th in the first year of new-new math teaching. This \nawful textbook obviously fails to do in 812 pages what comparable \nJapanese textbooks do so well in 200. The average standardized math \nscore in Japan is 80. In the United States it is 52.\n  When my staff contacted Marianne Jennings to obtain a copy of this \ntextbook, I did learn one good thing about it. She told my staff that \nbecause of public outcry the public schools in her area have \ndiscontinued its use and have gone back to traditional math textbooks. \nAnother useful purpose has been served by my personal perusal of this \ntextbook. I now have a partial answer to my question about why we don't \nproduce better students despite all the money that Federal taxpayers \nshell out.\n  The lesson here is for parents to follow Marianne Jennings' lead and \ntake a close look at their children's textbooks to be sure that the \nnew-new math and other similar nonsense has not crept into the local \nschool system.\n  All the Federal dollars we can channel for education cannot \ncounteract the disastrous effect of textbooks like this one. They will \nproduce dumb-dumb students and parents need to get heavily involved to \nreverse that trend now!\n  Mr. President, I ask that an article from the May 26 edition of U.S. \nNews and World Report on the same subject be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  The title of the article is, ``That so-called Pythagoras.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the U.S. News & World Report, May 26, 1997]\n\n                       That So-Called Pythagoras\n\n                             (By John Leo)\n\n       ``Deep Thoughts'' started as Jack Handy's running joke on \n     TV's Saturday Night Live--a series of mock-inspirational \n     messages about life that make no sense at all. Now ``Deep \n     Thoughts'' are available on greeting cards, including one \n     that pokes fun at the fuzzy new math in the schools. The card \n     says: ``Instead of having `answers' on a math test, they \n     should just call them `impressions,' and if you got a \n     different `impression,' so what, can't we all be brothers?''\n       Pretty funny. But it's hard for satire to stay ahead of \n     actual events these days, particularly in education. The \n     ``New-New Math,'' as it is sometimes called, has a high-\n     minded goal: Get beyond traditional math drills by helping \n     students understand and enjoy mathematical concepts. But in \n     practice, alas, the New-New Math is yet another educational \n     ``Deep Thought.''\n       Basic skills are pushed to the margin by theory and the \n     idea that students should not be passive receivers of rules \n     but self-discoverers, gently guided by teachers, who are co-\n     learners, not authority figures with lessons to impart. \n     Correct answers aren't terribly important. Detractors call it \n     ``whole math,'' because students frequently end up guessing \n     at answers, just as children exposed to the ``whole \n     language'' fad in English classes end up guessing at words \n     they can't pronounce. ``Although the Wicked Whole-Language \n     Witch is dying, the Whole-Math Witch isn't even ill,'' said \n     Wayne Bishop, professor of mathematics at California State \n     University-Los Angeles.\n       Mathematically Correct, a San Diego-based group which \n     strongly opposes whole math, recently posted a list of \n     commandments on its Web site, including ``Honor the correct \n     answer more than the guess,'' ``Give good grades only for \n     good work,'' and ``Avoid vague objectives.''\n       Bologna sandwich? Those vague objectives include meandering \n     exercises that have little to do with math, such as \n     illustrating data collection by having second-graders draw \n     pictures of their lunch, then cut the pictures out and put \n     them in paper bags. Worse, the New-New Math comes with the \n     usual stew of ed-school obsessions about feelings, self-\n     esteem, dumbing down, and an all-around politically correct \n     agenda.\n       Marianne Jennings, a professor at Arizona State University, \n     found that her teenage daughter was getting an A in algebra \n     but had no idea how to solve an equation. So Jennings \n     acquired a copy of her daughter's textbook. The real title is \n     Secondary Math: an ``Integrated Approach: Focus on Algebra,'' \n     but Jennings calls it ``Rain Forest Algebra.''\n       It includes Maya Angelou's poetry, pictures of \n     President Clinton and Mali wood carvings, lectures on what \n     environmental sinners we all are and photos of students \n     with names such as Tatuk and Esteban ``who offer my \n     daughter thoughts on life.'' It also contains praise for \n     the wife of Pythagoras, father of the Pythagorean theorem, \n     and asks students such mathematical brain teasers as \n     ``What role should zoos play in our society?'' However, \n     equations don't show up until Page 165, and the first \n     solution of a linear equation, which comes on Page 218, is \n     reached by guessing and checking.\n       Jennings points out that Focus on Algebra is 812 pages \n     long, compared with 200 for the average math textbook in \n     Japan. ``This would explain why the average standardized \n     score is 80 in Japan and 52 here,'' she says. Marks do seem \n     to head south when New-New Math appears. In well-off Palo \n     Alto, Calif., public-school math students dropped from the \n     86th percentile nationally to the 58th in the first year of \n     New-New teaching, then went back up the next year to the 77th \n     percentile when the schools moderated their approach.\n       The New-New Math has become a carrier for the aggressive \n     multiculturalism spreading inexorably through the schools. \n     Literature from the National Council of Teachers of \n     Mathematics, which is promoting whole math, is filled with \n     suggestions on how to push multiculturalism in arithmetic and \n     math classes.\n       New-New Math is also vaguely allied with an alleged new \n     field of study called ethnomathematics. Most of us may think \n     that math is an abstract and universal discipline that has \n     little to do with ethnicity. But a lot of \n     ethnomathematicians, who are busy holding conferences and \n     writing books, say that all peoples have a natural \n     culturebound mathematics. Western math, in this view, isn't \n     universal but an expression of white male culture imposed on \n     nonwhites. Much of this is the usual ranting about \n     ``Eurocentrism.'' Ethnomathematics, a book of collected \n     essays, starts by reminding us that ``Geographically, Europe \n     does not exist, since it is only a peninsula on the vast \n     Eurasian continent. . . .'' Before long, there is a reference \n     to ``the so-called Pythagorean theorem.'' Much of the \n     literature claims that nonliterate peoples indicated their \n     grasp of math in many ways, from quilt patterns to an ancient \n     African bone cut with marks that may have been used for \n     counting.\n       It's all rather stunning nonsense, but this is where \n     multiculturalism is right now. Unless you are headed for an \n     engineering school working with Yoruba calculators, or unless \n     you wish to balance your checkbook the ancient Navajo way, \n     it's probably safe to ignore the whole thing.\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the 1997 \nStanley Cup Champion Detroit Red Wings. Following Saturday night's 2 to \n1 victory in game four of the NHL finals, completing the Wings series \nsweep of the Philadelphia Flyers, the sports world has taken notice of \nwhat those of us from Michigan have known for years, that Detroit is \nthe home of the best hockey team, and the greatest hockey fans, on the \nplanet. After a long 42-year absence, the Stanley Cup has returned home \nto Hockeytown USA.\n  Sometimes in sports certain teams capture fans' imaginations in a way \nthat embodies the spirit of an entire city. The 1984 Tigers were so \ngood they dominated the game of baseball from the first pitch of \nopening day through the last out of the World Series. The 1989 Pistons, \nwith their gritty, tough style of defensive play were the ultimate blue \ncollar champions. So it is also the case of this year.\n  The 1997 Red Wings have inspired Detroit in a similar manner. These \nplayers have experienced recent disappointment. They came so close to \nthe title the previous two seasons, eliminated in the finals by New \nJersey in 1995 and in the semifinals by Colorado in 1996, only to be \ndenied. However, where lesser teams would have crumbled under the\n\n[[Page S5395]]\n\nweight of such adversity, this team learned from its losses, and came \nback with even greater determination and focus.\n  While I salute the entire Detroit Red Wings' organization for their \nachievement, there are a few individuals in particular who deserve \nspecial recognition. Capt. Steve Yzerman has brought so many highlights \nto Detroit Red Wings fans over the years, his name clearly deserves \nmention in the same breath as past greats such as Gordie Howe, Ted \nLindsay, Sid Abel, and Alex Delvecchio. No one has played harder \nthrough more pain or is more responsible for this Stanley Cup than \nSteve Yzerman. With his unassuming manner off the ice and fierce \ncompetitiveness on, for 14 years this exceptional man has been a credit \nto the Red Wings and the city of Detroit, and for this, he deserves our \nthanks.\n  With this championship, Coach Scotty Bowman has now won seven Stanley \nCups, more than any other coach in NHL history. Goalie Mike Vernon, \nnamed MVP of the playoffs, was simply masterful in the net throughout \nthe series. Then there are the five Russian immigrant players--Sergei \nFedorov, Igor Larionov, Slava Kozlov, Slava Fetisov, and Vladmir \nKonstantinov--each of whom played a vital role in the success of this \nteam. The Red Wings had so many leaders, such as Brendan Shanahan, Kirk \nMaltby, Darren McCarty, and others, that I am afraid I can't mention \nthem all here. Mr. President, virtually everybody's contribution on the \nteam should be highlighted today.\n  Most important, one final tribute needs to be reserved for team owner \nMike Illitch. Mr. Illitch's commitment to making the Red Wings the best \nhockey team in the NHL mirrors his dedication to making the city of \nDetroit the finest city in America. His efforts with the Red Wings are \nreally just an extension of his care and concern for Detroit. Whatever \nthis city has sought, whether it be economic development or the return \nof the Stanley Cup, Mike Illitch has tried to be part of the solution.\n  In fact, this championship is only one small indicator of the rebirth \nof Detroit. It has been many years since others have looked to this \ncity for inspired examples of urban renewal. Without question, however, \ncurrent developments in Detroit are quickly rendering such negativism a \nthing of the past. Detroit is truly a city whose best days are yet to \ncome, and great credit is due to the leadership of individuals like \nMike Illitch and Mayor Dennis Archer for making this goal a reality.\n  For today, as we celebrate the Red Wings we also celebrate the city \nof Detroit. The only thing missing from Saturday night's victory was \nthe violence and mischief that so often mars such achievements, a fact \nwhich should not be overlooked. The eyes of the sporting world were on \nthe Detroit Red Wings and their fans this weekend, and what they saw \nwas nothing less than positive. The Stanley Cup Champion Red Wings are \none of brightest lights in a city that has a great deal of which to be \nproud.\n  Mr. President, prior game 1 of the finals, I made a friendly wager \nwith our colleague Senator Rick Santorum from Pennsylvania, on the \noutcome of the series. Senator Santorum unwisely bet Philadelphia \nTastykakes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to display them here at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, these Tastykakes were the bet of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania to our Little Caesars pizzas from Detroit. I \nmight add that Red Wings' owner Mike Illitch is also the owner of \nLittle Caesars. While I now have some bragging rights on the floor of \nthe Senate, the real winners will be the students at Warren G. Harding \nElementary School in Detroit. The kids will soon taste the sweetness of \nthe Red Wings success as Senator Santorum ships 300 boxes of these \nTastykake cupcakes for a victory party at the school in the next week \nor two. And to make it extra special, in a show of true sportsmanship, \nLittle Caesars will provide pizzas to the students at Harding as well.\n  We look forward to celebrating our victory of the Stanley Cup with \nthe students of Harding Elementary School in the weeks ahead.\n  I thank you, yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, my understanding is that we are in morning \nbusiness with up to 5 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has up to 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5394-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5395-S5396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon because I would like \nto talk a little bit about the relationship of the citizens of this \ncountry to their Government, in this particular case, to the Internal \nRevenue Service. There is a real burden on most enforcement agencies. \nWhen they accuse somebody of a crime, they have the burden of showing \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the crime was actually committed by that \nparticular individual. That type of burden doesn't exist with the \nInternal Revenue Service; for whatever reason, your name may come up \nfor an audit, maybe because of some type of a filing that you did in \nyour income tax form that sets off the computer alarms, whatever system \nthat they have.\n  That is one of the reasons why I am pushing legislation for a home \noffice exemption. Many times, an audit by the Internal Revenue Service \nis an indication that you are using part of your home for business, and \nbecause of that, you are going to claim a deduction for part of the \ncosts of your home because you are running your business out of that \nhome.\n  The Internal Revenue Service frequently approaches taxpayers and \nsays, ``Look, we think there is a violation.'' The burden is upon that \nindividual to prove they are innocent. So, obviously, the individuals \nhave a great responsibility to keep good records and account for all \ntheir expenditures, and whatnot, so that they can justify whatever it \nis they are doing in the way of business which may allow them a tax \ndeduction, for example.\n  On the other hand, I think the agents for the Internal Revenue \nService have a particularly awesome responsibility because of the added \npowers that we grant to them. I just share with this body that I have \nheld more than 56 town meetings since the first of the year and have \nbeen very busy in talking to the people of Colorado--I represent the \nState of Colorado--and hearing about their concerns. It is not \nsurprising that the most frequent issue that came up in the town \nmeetings was related to taxes. People wanted capital gains reduction; \nthey wanted inheritance tax reduction.\n  But along with all this concern, they talked about their relationship \nwith the Internal Revenue Service. A lot of them felt there was abuse \nof power by the Internal Revenue Service.\n  There was a decision made last week by U.S. District Judge William \nDownes which I think highlights another case of taxpayer abuse by the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n  Carole Ward was awarded $250,000 in punitive damages by the Federal \nGovernment from the Internal Revenue Service for wrongfully publicizing \ninformation about her. After auditing Ward's children's clothing \nstores--these were young adults, children who decided to go into \nbusiness for themselves--after auditing the Ward's children's clothing \nstores, the Internal Revenue Service seized the stores and demanded \n$325,000 in back taxes. The Internal Revenue Service agents told \npassersby that Ward was involved in drug dealing.\n  Judge Downes was very harsh on the Internal Revenue Service, saying, \n``This court gives notice to the Internal Revenue Service that \nreprehensible abuse of authority by one of its employees cannot and \nwill not be tolerated.''\n  He went on to describe the behavior of some Internal Revenue Service \nagents as grossly negligent and they acted with reckless disregard for \na law meant to assure Americans that their tax matters are handled with \nconfidentiality.\n  While the vast majority of Internal Revenue Service agents and \nemployees are dedicated public servants who work\n\n[[Page S5396]]\n\nhard to serve the public, it only takes one incident such as this to \ncontinue the undermining of public confidence with the Internal Revenue \nService.\n  Now, Carole Ward had the courage to go into the public arena and \nfight the Internal Revenue Service, but many American taxpayers are \nintimidated from responding when the IRS abuses take place.\n  I am hopeful that last week's Federal court decision will prompt the \nInternal Revenue Service to recommit itself to serving the public \nresponsibly and to weed out those agents and employees who abuse their \npower. I hope they think about their relationship with the taxpayers, \nnot one to make criminals out of taxpayer citizens in this country, but \nto assist them in filling out their forms and meeting the requirements \nof the law.\n  Again, I encourage all employees of the Internal Revenue Service to \nlook at their added responsibilities and their added responsibility in \nrelation to dealing with the taxpayers and make sure that everybody \npays their fair share of taxes and nothing more.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5395-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5396-S5398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHISTORIC ADDRESS BY TAIWAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO THE EUROPEAN \n                               PARLIAMENT\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, we live in a time when so many United \nStates leaders, both in and out of Government, are apprehensive lest \nthe so-called People's Republic of China be offended at the slightest \nsuggestion that the basic principles of justice, human rights, and \nfreedom should be applicable to the actions of the Communist leaders in \nBeijing as well as to all the rest of us.\n  Mr. President, are the American people supposed to live in fear and \nnervous anticipation when even the barest questions about Communist \nChina's conduct are raised? Are we supposed to pretend that the gross \nviolations of trade by Communist China are not happening every day? Are \nwe supposed to cringe in fear when the leaders in Beijing threaten the \ndestruction of San Francisco?\n  Surely the greatness of America is not to be diminished by the \nbullying threats flowing from mainland China.\n  Mr. President, these thoughts came to my mind over the weekend when I \nreceived from a prominent and respected American the text of an address \ndelivered on May 22, less than 3 weeks ago, before the European \nParliament in Brussels, Belgium.\n  Who delivered it? It was delivered by an honorable and distinguished \ngentleman, John Chang, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \nChina on Taiwan. My purpose in being here this afternoon is to express \nmy hope that every Senator will read the text of Mr. Chang's remarks, \nand, while doing so, compare his rhetoric with that flowing constantly \nfrom mainland China.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof Mr. Chang's address be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                TEXT OF JOHN CHANG'S ADDRESS IN BRUSSELS\n\n       Mr. Chairman Spencer, distinguished members of the \n     Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defense Policy, \n     Ladies and Gentlemen:\n       Thank you all so much for inviting me to speak to you at \n     this very very prestigious forum today. It is truly a great \n     honor not only for my humble self, but also for my \n     government, the Republic of China which is now located on an \n     island called Taiwan. Allow me first of all to convey to each \n     and every one of you the warmest greetings and gratitude from \n     21.3 million people living in Taiwan. We deeply appreciated \n     this opportunity that our story can finally be directly told \n     and better understood to our respectable members of the \n     European Parliament.\n       I was told that over the past years, the Dalai Lama of \n     Tibet, Mr. Arafat of PLO and Mr. Mandela of ANC etc., all had \n     been invited to this forum to exchange views with you over \n     their issues. The situation that the Republic of China on \n     Taiwan faces today is totally different from theirs, but \n     there is one thing in common, it is that we all need the fair \n     attention of the world and we all have to appeal to \n     international justice.\n       It took me about 20 hours to fly over from Taipei to \n     Brussels, the day before yesterday, yet it has taken my \n     government, the Republic of China, more than twenty-five \n     years to be finally given an important international platform \n     like this today to have our voice heard, to have our humble \n     views shared, and to have our story faithfully told.\n       It is sad to point out that our freedom of speech as a \n     sovereign state, has long been deprived of from almost all \n     international organizations since 1971, the year when we were \n     forced out of the UN, simply because of mainland China's \n     untrue position that there is but one China on earth, which \n     is the People's Republic of China, and the Republic of China \n     on Taiwan is one of their provinces. The sheer existence of \n     one able, prosperous, vigorous and democratic government \n     called the Republic of China, has been for nearly a quarter-\n     century, veiled in thick political fog of world politics. The \n     truth about my country, the truth about my people have all \n     been flagrantly distorted and badly twisted. And the rights \n     of my government as a sovereign state have subsequently been \n     brutally neglected, ignored and even totally denied in the \n     world affairs arena for decades.\n       The Republic of China was established in 1912 by a \n     successful revolution led by Dr. Sun Yet-sen, which overthrew \n     the Ching Dynasty. Dr. Sun Yet-sen was educated in the United \n     States, and he had widely toured the European continent and \n     did his research at the British Empire Library in London for \n     a number of years before he returned to China to lead \n     the revolution. Europe has evidently very much to do with \n     the birth of a modern China. Actually the link between \n     Europe and China, I mean the ancient China, was forged \n     centuries ago.\n       When any scholar talks about the early contacts between \n     Europe and Cathay, he can never afford to forget to mention \n     two prominent European figures, one is, of course, Marco \n     Polo, the other, Matteo Ricci. Both of them are Italians, the \n     former a legendary merchant, the latter a Jesuit missionary, \n     and they were 300 years apart. Marco Polo traveled with his \n     father and uncle from Venice to China in 1271, when \n     Mongolians were ruling China. He had spent 24 years in China. \n     Matteo Ricci came to China under Ming Dynasty in 1583, he \n     lived in China for thirty years and died there. The great \n     differences between the two great Italians lie in the fact \n     that the trader Marco Polo succeeded in introducing the old \n     Cathay to Europe, yet the missionary Matteo Ricci did things \n     another way around, he introduced Europe to China, not only \n     her culture, science, but the religion of Christianity. The \n     most important contribution that Marco Polo ever rendered was \n     his bringing back to Europe such Chinese inventions as the \n     compass, paper-making, paper money and printing. Many \n     historians believe that Marco Polo's book entitled \n     ``Description of the World'' may have influenced many \n     explorers, including Christopher Columbus. By citing this \n     portion of history, I intend simply to stress that how close \n     once we were together in the past, and we certainly would be \n     even closer in the future.\n       A few minutes ago I pointed out that the Republic of China \n     was established in 1912 after a revolution strongly motivated \n     by a new tide of political thought of Europe. It was the \n     first Republic in entire Asia. The ensuing thirty years for \n     the new Republic were all turbulent and chaotic. Only after \n     the end of World War II, the new Republic got a very short \n     breathing period. But it was already too late, the entire \n     nation became fully exhausted by the eight-year Sino-Japanese \n     war from 1937 to 1945. The Chinese Communists seized the \n     opportunity to engage a civil war against the nationalist \n     government of KMT led by late Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. \n     The Communists won the war in 1949, consequently, the \n     government of the Republic of China was then moved from the \n     Chinese mainland to the island of Taiwan with her \n     Constitution which was promulgated in 1947.\n       In 1949 when the government of the Republic of China was \n     relocated on Taiwan, she remained to be the legitimate \n     government of whole China with a majority of nations in the \n     UN supporting this claim diplomatically, the number was 47 \n     out of 59. As the membership of the UN grew up to exactly 100 \n     in 1960, the number of nations which maintained diplomatic \n     ties with the Republic of China on Taiwan was 53, still a \n     majority support in the world organization. Her diplomatic \n     relations reached a peak ten years later in 1970 with 67 \n     nations formally recognizing her, and the membership of the \n     UN was 126, yet the following year in 1971, a drastic down-\n     turn took place, because of the change of attitude of the US \n     vis-a-vis her relationship with the PRC. The seat of a \n     founding member of the UN, the Republic of China was \n     unprecedently replaced by a relatively young regime, the \n     People's Republic of China which was created in 1949, 38 \n     years junior to the ROC. What was truly in question as an \n     issue at the UN in 1971 was not the Republic of China's \n     legitimacy as a sovereign state which was so challenged \n     and defeated, but it was her representation right which \n     she insisted, should cover the entire China, including the \n     Chinese mainland over which she was not exercising \n     jurisdiction. It was her ``representation right'' that she \n     lost, not her sovereignty as a state. Around the end of \n     1971, after the UN fiasco, the number of states which \n     recognized Republic of China on Taiwan dropped from 67 to \n     54. It was an admitted failure for the Republic of China \n     in her battle with the People's Republic of China over the \n     so-called\n\n[[Page S5397]]\n\n     ``Chinese representation right'' issued in the UN. Yet \n     this does not mean at all as the PRC has ever so alleged \n     that the Republic of China has lost in the battle at UN \n     together with her statehood. This allegation is absolutely \n     groundless, untrue and absurd in accordance with \n     international law.\n       There is no denial that after our forced departure from the \n     United Nations, the Republic of China on Taiwan has become \n     more and more isolated internationally. Yet the frustration \n     on the international front has never hampered the iron will \n     and firm determination of the people and government of the \n     Republic of China to move on forward to effectively develop \n     our economy and to enhance our democracy.\n       Twenty years ago, in 1976, our total trade volume was $15.6 \n     billion US dollars; last year, 1996, our export import trade \n     volume reached $217.2 billion US dollars, with a surplus \n     $14.7 billion US dollars. The Republic of China has been \n     fortunate and had a 6% annual growth for the past ten years, \n     bringing our per capita gross national product to $12,000. \n     Exports have made our economy. Today the Republic of China is \n     a leading producer of electronics, computers and other \n     industrial products. Today we are selling the world disk \n     drives, monitors, notebooks and modems. To give you an \n     example: last year, we had $11.6 billion in computer-hardware \n     production. We are the largest computer manufacturer in the \n     world after the United States, Japan and Germany.\n       Our trade with the European Union has grown rapidly in a \n     very encouraging way in the past three years. The volume grew \n     from $23 billion in 1994 to $29.5 billion in 1995 and $31.3 \n     billion in 1996.\n       Of our European trading partners, Germany enjoys the \n     highest volume of $8.6 billion, followed by the Netherlands \n     with $5.2 billion, UK $4.6 billion, France $4.2 billion and \n     Italy $2.6 billion. And Belgium is our 7th trading partner \n     with a volume of $1.32 billion, after Switzerland of $1.75 \n     billion, ahead of Sweden of $1.13 billion. My government has \n     attached great importance to our trade with the European \n     Union as a whole in the past; we will continue to do the same \n     in the future.\n       Our focus on high technology and electronic exports has \n     been a success. In less than 50 years, Taiwan ranks as the \n     world's 20th largest economy with a gross national product of \n     $275 billion. We are the 13th largest trading nation in \n     the world and have accumulated world's third largest \n     reserves of foreign exchange. Yet we are not a member of \n     the UN.\n       We have come a long way in terms of political achievements. \n     It was not very long ago that ``Martial Law'' was still in \n     effect and minimal contacts were allowed between us and our \n     compatriots on the Chinese Mainland. In 1987, just 10 years \n     ago, the late president Chiang Ching-kuo lifted the marshal \n     law and allowed the major opposition party--Democratic \n     Progressive Party--to form. President Chiang also eliminated \n     the restrictions and bans on newspapers, public assembly and \n     demonstrations.\n       President Chiang's decision to lift martial law laid the \n     foundation of a series of additional political reforms \n     beginning in the early 1990s. President Chiang passed away in \n     1988, and was immediately succeeded by President Lee Teng-\n     Huei in accordance with our Constitution. It was President \n     Lee who charted all those extremely important reforms in the \n     90's. The National Assembly amended our Constitution to allow \n     the government to hold all-Taiwan elections to replace \n     Assembly members and lawmakers who had not faced their \n     electorate for more than 40 years. In 1991, the first all-\n     Taiwan National Assembly was elected, seating 325 members. \n     The Assembly further amended the Constitution in 1992 and \n     1994 to shorten the terms of office of the president and \n     Assembly members from six years to four. Most importantly, \n     the amended Constitution allowed our President to be elected \n     by all voting age citizens in the ROC's jurisdiction in 1996. \n     On March 23, 1996, Dr. Lee Teng-Huei defeated three other \n     presidential rivals and became the first popularly-elected \n     President of the Republic of China. In the five thousand \n     years of Chinese history, this was the first time that the \n     Chinese people were able to elect their head of state \n     directly. The legitimacy of the government of the Republic of \n     China on Taiwan was rightfully strengthened. The fact that \n     the government of the Republic of China is fully exercising \n     her sovereignty and jurisdiction over the area of Taiwan \n     island has become absolutely indisputable in whatever de jure \n     sense.\n       President Lee Teng-Huei has rapidly transformed Taiwan's \n     old single-party government into a working democracy. He has \n     successfully orchestrated a quiet revolution, bringing new \n     freedoms to his people. This transformation was achieved in \n     quiet manner. There have been no class confrontations, no \n     military coup and no political suppression in Taiwan. The \n     process of reform in Taiwan was unique and unprecedented.\n       Taiwan now has a multi-party system and has realized the \n     ideal of popularly-elected government. We have a total \n     respect for individual freedom and this is clearly the most \n     free and liberal era in Chinese history. Free speech is fully \n     protected; all types of government controls over society have \n     been relaxed or eliminated. We are now an open, pluralistic \n     and free society. Our government has taken upon itself to \n     defend and protect the fundamental human rights of every \n     citizen. But unfortunately, many countries in the world still \n     indulge themselves in the lie brazenly told by the PRC that \n     the government of the Republic of China does not exist.\n       Despite our economic strength and political liberalization, \n     we have formal diplomatic ties with only 30 nations in the \n     world, even though we enjoy substantive relations with all \n     major countries. We feel hurt and neglected, because we have \n     not been accorded proper recognition by the world community. \n     Since the late 80's we have been pragmatic in our foreign \n     relations. We try to hold on to our friend and seek new \n     friends and new ``connections'' whenever possible. So far \n     this new pragmatism has served us well. I have to emphasize \n     here that this new approach on our foreign relations has \n     nothing to do with the so-called ``Independence of Taiwan''. \n     Taiwan is the name of an area or the name of a province where \n     the government of the Republic of China is situated. Taiwan \n     is not a name of a nation, nor the name of my government. \n     It's simply a geographical term. Since on the island of \n     Taiwan or in the area of Taiwan, there has long been a \n     sovereign government called the Republic of China, there is \n     absolutely no sense for us to try to create another state on \n     Taiwan. What we have been seeking for in the international \n     community is a better recognition of the government of the \n     Republic of China which she deserves to have.\n       It is true that the People's Republic of China maintains \n     that there is one China, and so do we. Yet we have different \n     interpretation of the ``One China''. Our position is rather \n     simple that the One China was divided in 1949, which remains \n     divided now. The international community should recognize the \n     fact of a divided China and treat the ROC government as a \n     sovereignty with effective jurisdiction over Taiwan and the \n     offshore islands under its control. The spirit of our \n     diplomacy of pragmatism is based on the acceptance of the \n     fact that PRC is the political entity which has firm and \n     effective control of the Chinese mainland area, and at the \n     same time Taiwan area is under the tight control and legal \n     jurisdiction of my government. We will not compete with the \n     PRC on the ``representation right'' issue. On international \n     relations, they may well represent the mainland, and we \n     represent Taiwan area. Hence, one China with two separate \n     political entities is a reality no one can deny and a fact \n     that the world must deal with realistically.\n       Just as East and West Germany enjoyed simultaneously \n     membership in the United Nations before their reunification, \n     Republic of China should be allowed to participate in the \n     world organizations with the PRC. A membership for Taiwan \n     would definitely bring about more peaceful contacts between \n     Taiwan and the mainland and further help pave the way for the \n     reunification of a ``One China''. In short, like Korea, PRC \n     and ROC on Taiwan deserve recognition. While developing our \n     relations abroad, we hold no hostility with PRC at all, any \n     move in expanding our breathing space in the world community \n     is not aiming at mainland China at all. We simply want to be \n     treated as what we are. We want to be treated no more than \n     what we deserve to have.\n       Mr. Chairman, as the Republic of China's foreign minister, \n     I would like to stress and also clarify a few points, \n     which might be of interest to you and to your colleagues:\n       1. Both the Republic of China on Taiwan and the People's \n     Republic of China on mainland believe in One China. The \n     government of the Republic of China, and the political party \n     in power, KMT, repudiates Taiwan independence.\n       2. One China does not mean the People's Republic of China. \n     Beijing argues that ``there is only one China and only the \n     PRC has sovereignty rule over China; therefore Taiwan is part \n     of PRC.'' We believe that PRC leaders represent a political \n     authority, not single China. Communist China does not equate \n     to the China. China is still now divided and governed by two \n     separate governments; the PRC and the ROC, each having its \n     own jurisdiction and sovereignty over its own areas.\n       3. Beijing should openly renounce the use of force against \n     Taiwan and resume talks and dialogues with us. Beijing must \n     give peace a chance. All issues can be discussed. President \n     Lee has indicated his willingness to travel to Beijing or \n     anywhere else to hold talks with Communist leaders.\n       4. Both Chinese societies can benefit from more direct \n     economic, social and cultural exchanges. In fact our \n     investments in the mainland in the last ten years have \n     amounted to more than $25 billion. Our investments have \n     enabled the mainland to build foreign exchange reserves and \n     created jobs. Influx of our capital has improved living \n     standards and relieved poverty and backwardness among the \n     mainland Chinese population.\n       5. Beijing should accept us as an equal partner. We seek to \n     have better relations with the mainland. We do not want to \n     see Chinese fighting Chinese, not in Taiwan Strait, nor on \n     international arena, but rather Chinese helping Chinese. Our \n     compatriots on the mainland and we share a common ethnic \n     bond.\n       6. In Taiwan there is no support for a reckless or \n     precipitate reunification with the mainland at the moment, \n     certainly not under the terms of formula set forth by the \n     PRC, such as the so-called ``One State, Two Systems'' \n     Formula, which definitely is inapplicable and unacceptable to \n     ROC on Taiwan.\n       7. We will continue our ``pragmatic diplomacy'' which means \n     that we will seek friends and allies everywhere and want the \n     world to know that we exist. We will seek to expand\n\n[[Page S5398]]\n\n     our trade and cultural offices in over 150 countries and \n     regions, in addition to the 30 nations that have formal ties \n     with us. We will also seek to join international \n     organizations, including the UN, and her peripheral \n     organizations, because we have so much to contribute to the \n     world;\n       8. Our ultimate goal is for the world to recognize us as a \n     full member of the international community. We are well aware \n     how important and difficult the process of reintegration into \n     the international community will be for Taiwan. However, we \n     have the resources and commitment that will allow us to \n     make our positive contribution to peace, prosperity and \n     good will in the world.\n       9. We will take full responsibility for our own destiny, \n     but we believe that as an economically prosperous and \n     democratically free nation seeking its proper place in the \n     world, we can expect the nations of the world, particularly \n     the European nations to assist us in this task.\n       10. We are prepared, too, to shoulder our share of \n     responsibility for helping and assisting other nations, \n     including mainland China, not in the spirit of paternalism or \n     dominance but mutual cooperation and respect.\n       Looking forward towards the 21st century, I foresee a \n     vibrant Republic of China actively promoting economic and \n     trade cooperation with all regions around the world, but with \n     emphasis on two areas--members of the Association of \n     Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) and the mainland China. This \n     type of economic and trade cooperation will strengthen the \n     regional economic infrastructure and will stimulate the flow \n     of resources throughout the region, leading to further \n     economic growth as we seek to become an Asia-Pacific regional \n     operation center by the year 2000.\n       While pursuing economic growth and strength, the perfection \n     of our democratic system remains to be our most cherished and \n     most urged goal in our national policy. We firmly believe \n     that no country could ever become a truly great country until \n     it becomes fully democratic.\n       Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, with your \n     understanding, sympathy and genuine support, as a democratic \n     and sovereign state, in the midst of challenges, unfair, \n     unequal treatments and tests of all kind, we, the Republic of \n     China on Taiwan, shall rise up again.\n       I thank you all so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5396-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I was privileged to meet earlier this \nweek with Richard and Janet Cone, owners of Cone Ag-Service, Inc., in \nPierre, South Dakota. They were recently designated the South Dakota \nSmall Business Owners of the Year by the Small Business Administration.\n  This award is a testament to the Cones' drive and business acumen \nover the last 30 years, during which they have provided high quality, \nliquid fertilizer to South Dakota farmers. Like many small businesses, \nthey began at the kitchen table and have grown into a business that \nemploys eight full-time and six part-time employees.\n  The Cones' success story also includes timely and appropriate \nassistance from a Federal agency, the Small Business Administration. \nThis agency joined with a local lender to help finance the Cone Ag-\nService at a crucial point in its growth, proving that even the best \nbusiness idea may need financial backing to come to fruition.\n  But, the most important measure of Cone Ag-Service's success is its \ncustomers, who loyally return year after year. The Cones can rely upon \nthe word-of-mouth communication by their customers to generate new \nbusiness. This type of advertising can't be bought with money; rather, \nit takes a good product and responsive customer service.\n  Nearly 200 years ago, the expedition of Lewis and Clark set in motion \na great westward expansion of settlers across America. As many of these \npioneers made their way up the Missouri River, one can only imagine \nwhat entered their minds as they climbed atop the river bluffs and \ngazed out over the limitless plains of Dakota Territory. Surely, there \nwas very little to remind them of the comforts they had left behind or \nof the riches they dreamed lay ahead. But there were opportunities to \nbe found, hidden amidst the prairie grass, and a few adventurous souls \ndared to settle here and make South Dakota their home.\n  That frontier spirit still runs through the veins of South Dakotans \ntoday, but the horizons that await us are no longer hidden. Small \nbusinesses like Cone Ag-Service are being created to take advantage of \nthe commercial opportunities our State holds. They are the pioneers of \ntoday and I salute them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5398-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR STROM THURMOND\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to join with many of my \ncolleagues in saluting a great friend, patriot, and statesman--the \nsenior Senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond. Listening to the \ndebate recently, I realized that many were speaking of their personal \nexperiences while serving with Senator Thurmond. I, however, would like \nto share with my colleagues the greatest story I know about Senator \nThurmond--the true story of his life. To me it illustrates one key \nthing: that the hallmark of Strom Thurmond's life has been his \ndedication to serving others.\n  Senator Thurmond was born in 1902 and raised in Edgefield, SC. \nFollowing his graduation in 1923 from Clemson University, young Strom \nThurmond began his career, first as a teacher and coach, then, at the \nage of 21, as an officer in the U.S. Army Reserve. Eventually, Senator \nThurmond went on to become the county superintendent of education, city \nattorney, county attorney, State Senator and circuit judge of South \nCarolina. From 1942 to 1946, Senator Thurmond, along with millions of \nother brave young men, served in World War II. For his service in the \nAmerican, European, and Pacific theaters, Senator Thurmond earned 5 \nbattle stars and 18 decorations and medals, including the Legion of \nMerit with oak leaf cluster, the Purple Heart, and the Bronze Star for \nvalor. Upon his return to South Carolina, Strom Thurmond was elected to \nserve as Governor of South Carolina. During his tenure as Governor, \nSenator Thurmond was a candidate for President of the United States. \nFive years later, in 1954, Strom Thurmond was elected as a write-in \ncandidate for U.S. Senator and has served with distinction in this body \nas chairman of two prestigious committees, as well as serving as the \nPresident pro tempore.\n  The many personal sacrifices that Senator Thurmond has made over the \npast nine decades demonstrate his respect for our institution of \ngovernment and our Nation's history. He knows all too well that when \none fails to stand for his principles, those principles will perish. \nAnd Strom Thurmond, as a young paratrooper, as a Presidential \ncandidate, and now, as a U.S. Senator, stands--sometimes all alone--for \nthe greatest principles on which America was founded.\n  Strom even had to switch parties--not once, but effectively, twice, \nto keep advancing his strongly held principles and ideals. In a sense, \nthough Senator Thurmond has been a Dixiecrat, a Democrat and a \nRepublican, he has always been, most of all, a proud American.\n  Strom Thurmond has witnessed incredible growth and change in our \nNation and our world, and his knowledge of our past and vision for our \nfuture is crucial to our present. The Senator's strong leadership, \npatriotism, dependability, and devotion to duty is inspiring--and his \nstamina is legendary. The people of South Carolina are fortunate to \nhave such an able gentleman represent them; we here in the U.S. Senate \nare lucky to stand with him; and all Americans should be grateful for \nSenator Thurmond's 41 years of service in the Senate and proud of his \n94 years of service to this country.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5398-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5399]]\n        HONORING THE SORENSENS ON THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. \nThe data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to \nthe society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today \nwill see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both \ninstructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment \nof ``till death us do part'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the \ntimeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics \nmake our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor John and Rosalie \nSorensen of Des Plaines, IL, formerly of Howard's Ridge, MO, who on \nJuly 12, 1997, will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, \nJanet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar \nmilestone. The Sorensens' commitment to the principles and values of \ntheir marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5399-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KATHRYN HOOK\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, in my almost 42 years of service to the \nU.S. Senate, I have probably had more than one thousand individuals \nwork for me as members of my personal and committee staffs. Among these \nlegions, I have been fortunate to have had a number of particularly \ncapable, dedicated, and selfless men and women who truly went above and \nbeyond the call of duty in assisting me and in carrying out their \nduties as staffers. Today, I rise to pay tribute to Miss Kathryn Hook, \na person who has been with me for just short of 30 years, whose work \nand efforts have been invaluable, and to many South Carolinians, is as \nmuch a part of my office as I am. Sadly, today marks Kathryn's last day \non the job.\n  A woman with a warm and outgoing personality, Kathryn first arrived \nin my office in 1967 and immediately began to make friends not only \namong my staff, but with our neighbors in other Senate offices. I \nrecall that at that time the late Bobby Kennedy was one of my \ncolleagues, and he had an office adjacent to mine. As he would walk \ndown the halls with his dogs, he would almost inevitably stop into my \nreception room to say ``hello'' to Kathryn. It is my understanding that \nlater, when Senator Kennedy ran for President, he asked Kathryn if she \nwas interested in working on his South Carolina campaign activities, \nand as tempting and flattering an offer as that most certainly must \nhave been, commendably, Kathryn chose to stay in my employ. It is a \ndecision that I am grateful she made.\n  For almost three decades, Kathryn has been such a fixture on my \nstaff, she has earned the title of ``Dean of Women,'' and she has made \ncountless contributions to the operations of this office in many \ndifferent ways. Working at the back of the reception room of 217 \nRussell, dubbed the ``Dogwood Alcove'' because of the personal touches \nshe has made to her workspace, Kathryn has pleasantly, politely, and \nwarmly greeted probably tens of thousands of visitors to my office, \nranging from constituents who have come by to say ``hello,'' to senior \nAmerican and foreign government officials who are making official calls \non matters of policy. In each case, she has demonstrated the famed \nhospitality of South Carolinians, making anyone who enters my suite \nfeel as though they are a long lost friend, and making sure that they \nknow that they are welcome in my office.\n  Perhaps more importantly, though, is the influence she has had on \nyoung staffers who have worked under her. Kathryn is a woman of high \nand uncompromising standards, and a strong work ethic. In the course of \nher career, she has passed these commendable qualities and \ncharacteristics on to those who have been her direct subordinates, as \nwell as to many other staffers who have worked with her through the \nyears. There is no question that Kathryn has left her mark on an untold \nnumber of Strom Thurmond staffers, and that her influence has \nbenefitted these individuals both while they worked for me, and in \nsubsequent jobs. I have no doubt that there are hundreds of people, \nparticularly women, who owe their success in life to the lessons they \nlearned from Kathryn Hook.\n  Of course, Kathryn's contributions go far beyond that of her duties \nin the reception room and as the personal assistant to my chief of \nstaff. She is the point of contact for any number of South Carolinians, \nparticularly those from her hometown of Florence, who know Kathryn and \nfeel comfortable contacting her on a multitude of issues that range \nfrom correcting problems with a relative's Social Security check, to \nlegislative issues. Kathryn's intimate knowledge of office policy, \nprocedures, and history has made her a useful resource for staff \nmembers who need advice and guidance on issues or have a question that \ncan only be answered by her institutional memory.\n  Mr. President, Kathryn Hook is a unique and special woman in many \ndifferent ways, and it is impossible to cite all of the highlights of \nher career or to adequately summarize the impact she has had in my \noffice. Suffice it to say, her efforts over the years have helped me do \nmy job as a legislator and in assisting the people of South Carolina. \nKathryn's long tenure of invaluable service to our State was recently \nrecognized and honored by the Governor of South Carolina who presented \nher with our State's highest award, ``The Order of the Palmetto,'' in a \nceremony held in the Strom Thurmond Room of the U.S. Capitol. \nRegrettably, I do not have an equivalent commendation with which I can \npresent her, but I hope she knows that I have valued her faithful \nservice, will certainly miss her sense of humor and energetic \npersonality, and that I am pleased to count her among my friends. It is \na bittersweet day on which I say goodbye to Kathryn Hook, as not only \nis it her last day on my staff, but it is her birthday as well. I wish \nher many more years of health and happiness, and I thank her for her \nmany years of devoted and selfless service.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COLLINS). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime of the leader's designee in morning business. The Democratic \nleader is allotted 60 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5399-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5399-S5403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DISASTER RELIEF\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I come to the floor today again to speak \nof the disaster relief bill, the so-called supplemental appropriations \nbill. This bill provides substantial amounts of money for disaster \nrelief, especially for people of the region of North Dakota, South \nDakota, and Minnesota, the region where victims of blizzards, fires and \nfloods now await action by the U.S. Congress on a disaster \nappropriations bill.\n  On Saturday, in the Bismarck Tribune, an associated press writer, \nJohn McDonald, was in Grand Forks, ND. The headline says, ``Patience \nShort with Congress.'' Here is what the story says:\n\n       Ranee Steffan had strong words for Members of Congress who \n     think flood victims can wait while the bickering continues in \n     Washington over a disaster relief bill.\n       ``You are playing with our lives,'' Mrs. Steffen warned \n     Friday from the sweltering travel trailer that she and her \n     family now call home. ``This isn't some game. You should come \n     here and walk in my shoes for a day.''\n       Homeless for over a month, out of work and bounced from one \n     temporary shelter to another, the wife and mother of two is \n     fed up with lawmakers who seem to think that Grand Forks \n     residents are ``getting along just fine.''\n       All she wants, she says, is to move back into a real home \n     and to start working again.\n       But that isn't likely to happen until Congress and \n     President Clinton work out differences in the emergency \n     spending bill that has $5.6 million of disaster relief for \n     disaster victims.\n\n  I noticed this weekend in the Washington Times, Saturday, June 7, \nSpeaker Gingrich, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, ``vows \nnot to yield on disaster aid,'' according to the headline. He says that \nafter a veto, the GOP\n\n[[Page S5400]]\n\nwill send the bill back with the same riders. And then it says, ``Mr. \nGingrich predicted voters will not remember this standoff over the \nsupplemental appropriations bill at the ballot boxes next year,'' \nsuggesting, I suppose, that, well, it is just that region up there, \nNorth Dakota, Minnesota, South Dakota. They will not remember this.\n  In this morning's Washington Post, we read that in a ``contentious \nmeeting of Republican leaders after adjournment Thursday, Majority \nLeader Lott of the Senate argued that this time--unlike 2 years ago--\nthe GOP would win the PR battle. He claimed Americans did not care much \nabout the supplemental appropriations bill providing help for the \nvictims of Red River flooding in the Dakotas and Minnesota.''\n  I do not know if that is an accurate quote. It is in Robert Novak's \ncolumn in today's paper. But I worry about what all of this says. It \nsays somehow that this is a game, it is politics, it is trying to claim \na political advantage in the fighting over a disaster bill.\n  It is interesting that if you take a look at other disaster bills in \nthe Congress and what has happened in those disaster bills, the time \nline is really quite interesting. We had, as many Americans will \nrecall, a terrible hurricane called Hurricane Andrew. When Hurricane \nAndrew hit the Florida coast, it decimated and devastated miles and \nmiles of homes, and people were living in camps and trying to figure \nout what to do next. That was 1992. That hurricane hit August 24, 1992, \nkilling 40 people and destroying more than 25,000 homes. Again, this \nwas August 24, 1992 that the hurricane hit. On September 8, just 2 \nweeks later, President Bush called for a $7.7 billion relief package. \nThat took place on September 8. On September 23, President Bush signed \nit into law. It took 1 month from the hurricane to signing the bill \ninto law.\n\n  What a difference compared to our experience this year.\n  Madam President, on March 19 of this year, the President sent his \nfirst request to Congress for a disaster bill to provide supplemental \nappropriations for a range of disasters that had occurred in our \ncountry. March 19, April 19 went by, May 19, and we are headed toward \nJune 19--nearly 3 full months--and the disaster bill is not yet law.\n  Now, Congress passed a disaster bill, but some in Congress decided \nthey wanted to make a political sideshow out of it and they put very \ncontroversial provisions in it, provisions they knew the President \nwould be forced to veto, provisions that had no relationship to this \nbill at all, extraneous provisions having no business in this bill. The \nPresident told them long ago to pass a clean bill. If they put \nprovisions that were controversial in this bill thinking he would sign \nit, they were wrong.\n  So the Congress, attempting to provoke a fight, because some \npolitical leaders here decided it was in their advantage to do so, \nstuck a couple of very controversial items in this bill and sent it \ndown to the President, knowing it would face a certain veto. They took \na couple of weeks' vacation first, and broke for the Memorial Day \nrecess. Now it is going to be nearly 3 weeks later than it should have \nbeen before a bill would get passed that the President might have an \nopportunity to sign. But, in any event, they finally did send a bill \ndown to the President this morning containing provisions they knew the \nPresident would not sign. The President vetoed the bill, and it now has \nreturned to the House of Representatives, just within the past several \nhours.\n  At the end of my remarks, Madam President, I will introduce a bill \nthat is a clean disaster supplemental bill. It strips the two \nextraneous provisions that are highly controversial out of the \nlegislation. I will send it to the desk and ask it be considered by \nunanimous consent. If it is considered by unanimous consent, this will \ngo to the House of Representatives. After all, the House passed this \nbill plus the two controversial provisions. The House could consider \nit, they could send it to the President, he could sign it, and tomorrow \nthe disaster relief would be available to the people who are victims of \nthis disaster. I have alerted the majority that I intend to do so, and \nat the end of my remarks I will ask this piece of legislation be \nconsidered.\n  Now, Madam President, before I go further, I will go through once \nagain what has happened to our region and why this is urgent and why \nsome of us have had a bellyful of the politics around here on this \nbill.\n  Let me describe, first of all, the blizzards in our part of the \ncountry, 3 years' worth of snow in 3 months, 10 feet of snow dropped on \nour region of the country. The last blizzard was the worst blizzard of \n50 years, and the worst blizzard of 50 years dumped nearly 2 feet of \nsnow on much of North Dakota, some of South Dakota, and some of \nMinnesota. Traffic was stalled, as it was many times this winter, with \nthe nine blizzards that we had. All the roads were shut down. Power \npoles snapped like toothpicks.\n  Here is the result of howling winds of 20 and 40 miles an hour and \n80-below windchill temperatures and 2 feet of snow in the worst \nblizzard of 50 years. This is a snowbank on flat land and a farmer \nstanding in front of it to show the size of the snowbank. The snowbank \nis nearly three times as tall as he is.\n  The blizzard that hit had this impact: 80,000 people in our region \nout of power, power poles snapped like toothpicks, lying on the ground \nall across our region. Some people were out of power for a week and \nmore, while power crews struggled 24 hours a day to try to get the \npoles up and the lines up and restore power to these communities.\n  I was in Grafton, ND, when they were out of power for 5 days, and met \na woman who was 89-years-old at a shelter. Yes, they went to shelters \nbecause they could not cook, did not have electricity, did not have \nheat in their homes, and it was bitterly cold. Madam President, this \nwoman was 89 years of age, and she said, ``I am getting along just \nfine. We sure appreciate all the folks here at the shelter.'' What a \ngreat spirit and a great attitude.\n  But all of those folks went through this kind of dilemma of blizzard \nafter blizzard after blizzard, with shutdowns of virtually all the \nroads in the State, cattle freezing on their feet because the snow was \nsuffocating them, and then power outages affecting tens of thousands of \npeople. My colleague Senator Conrad showed this picture the other day. \nI had shown it previously, a picture similar to it, dead cattle lying \non the range, cattle whose hooves were frozen, dairy cows whose udders \nwere frozen. A fellow was in town a while back and he said someone \nasked a rancher, ``What are you doing this afternoon?'' He answered, \n``Going home to shoot some more calves.'' These calves simply would not \nmake it. Their hooves were frozen and they would not be able to walk \nany longer. Hundreds of thousands of head of livestock died in those \nwinter blizzards.\n\n  Then what happened is the Sun came out and it began to warm up in our \npart of the country. What was a farm--and this is a farm--now looks \nlike an ocean. The Red River Valley became a flood that was 140 miles \nlong by 20 to 30 miles wide. This is a farm in this photograph. But, of \ncourse, this year, it was a flood; 1.7 million acres of farm land were \nunder water when this picture was taken.\n  This picture shows what that flood looks like from the air. It looks \nlike a huge lake that extends for the entire Red River Valley, with \npatches of ground in places where you could see some dikes that have \nbeen erected to try to protect some areas of the country. That flood \ninundated Watertown, SD. It was an enormous flood--in Watertown, MN, \nand Breckenridge and Fargo, ND. That flood water was channeled through \nFargo, and for 24 hours a day they wondered whether the dikes would \nhold, and they did hold in Fargo. Some homes got wet and they had some \nflooding damage, but it could have been much worse. Then that Red River \nflooding came to Grand Forks, ND, as they tried to channel that through \nthe city. The flood crest was predicted to be 49 feet, the highest \nflood crest in history. But it wasn't 49 feet, it was 54 feet. As the \nwater rushed over the dikes down the streets of Grand Forks, people \nleft their homes, running to their cars, running to National Guard \ntrucks, to evacuate their city, in most cases with nothing but the \nclothes on their backs.\n  In this photograph is Grand Forks, ND, and East Grand Forks, MN. It \nlooks like a lake with buildings sticking out of the lake, a city \ncompletely inundated by a flood. A city of 50,000\n\n[[Page S5401]]\n\npeople was on this side of the river, with 90 percent evacuated; 9,000 \npeople were on this side of the river, 100 percent evacuated. I might \nsay that this whole area in Grand Forks, ND, will never again be \ninhabitable. All of these business places are ruined and will be \ndestroyed.\n  More than that, during the flood when the waters broke the dike, the \ncity of Grand Forks also suffered a major fire, as depicted in this \nphotograph. In the middle of flooding, you can see the firefighters of \nGrand Forks, ND, standing in the ice-cold water up to their wastes, \nfighting a fire, a fire that destroyed 11 of the larger downtown \nbusiness buildings in Grand Forks, ND, and then spread to three blocks. \nThey had to bring this firefighting material in with huge airplanes, \ndropping flame retardant on these buildings because they couldn't fight \nthe fire from here. The firefighters didn't have the equipment to fight \na fire in a flood. These firefighters, suffering from hypothermia, were \nusing fire extinguishers to fight a fire in downtown Grand Forks, ND. \nOf course, they finally put the fire out.\n  I was on a Coast Guard boat in Grand Forks, and as we went up and \ndown the streets of Grand Forks, ND, here is what you saw, streets that \nlooked like rivers and lakes, as shown in this photograph. \nOccasionally, you would see a car top sticking up. The boat I was on \nran into a car. We could not see it, but we knew we ran into a car \nbecause we saw about two inches of a radio antenna sticking above the \nwater. When I told the pilot of the boat, ``I think you ran into a \ncar,'' he said, ``I guess so, but, you know, it wasn't there \nyesterday.'' What happened is that river was running so fast that it \nwas taking cars underneath, and you could not see them moving all \naround that town, as the river destroyed the central core of that city. \nWhen the fire was finally put out in downtown Grand Forks, ND, here is \npart of what it looked like. It skipped over three different blocks, \nbut you could see what it did to downtown Grand Forks, ND.\n  Some say, well, that is quite a tragedy, but it happens other places \nin the country. I don't know of any other place in the country where \nthey have suffered a circumstance where a major city was almost totally \nand completely evacuated and a major part of the city permanently and \ntotally destroyed. In the middle of all of this, I went to North \nDakota, and I was in North Dakota on almost all weekends. I went there \nwith President Clinton on Air Force One during the middle of a week, on \na Tuesday. He flew into Grand Forks, ND. While this city was evacuated, \nthousands of them were sent to Grand Forks AFB. They were put in giant \nairplane hangars where thousands of cots were set up, and that is where \nmany of them slept overnight until they could find some other shelter \nto move to or some other family to take them in or to get \ntransportation to a relative who lived in another city. ``Red Cross \ntops 1 million meals,'' the Grand Forks Herald says. ``How bad was our \ndisaster? Let us count the meals.''\n\n  People who one day had a home, had warmth, had shelter, had a stove \nand a refrigerator, a place for kids to come home to from school and a \nplace to come to at the end of the work day, now had nothing. They were \nliving on cots in an Air Force hangar and eating from the Red Cross \nshelter. And then, finally, the river went back into its bank. Here is \nwhat Grand Forks residents have come home to find: 600 homes totally \ndestroyed that will never again be lived in. Another 600 to 800 homes \nwere severely damaged.\n  I don't know if many people know what a home looks like when it has \nbeen totally submerged in a flood. I was in a boat that was floating on \ntop of the water at the rooftop level of most of these homes. These \nhomes are totally destroyed and will never again be repaired. I have \nsome more photographs here. Here is what a basement looks like.\n  This is what happens out in the yard. They strip all the wallboard \nout of a home and all of the things that used to be their possessions \nand put them on the boulevard out in front. What used to be a nice \nstreet, where cars would drive up and down, is now on both sides of the \nstreet filled with trash, filled with the remnants of a home. You can \nonly drive there one way, up and down. The garbage trucks come all day \nlong, back and forth, trying to keep up to haul out this garbage.\n  This home was totally submerged in water. When it came back to rest, \nit rested on top of an old Ford car. This picture shows a home sitting \non top of a car. That is what floods do.\n  This home was in the same neighborhood, and it just collapsed. It was \nbrought up from its foundation and then collapsed.\n  The Grand Forks Herald, in the midst of all of this, says, ``Here is \nwhy the Federal Government needs to pass disaster relief now.'' I have \nshown you the result of all of this. There is more. There is a problem \nthat farmers and ranchers have--some are flat on their backs having \nlost their entire herds in the blizzard. But most urgent is the need to \ngive the people who are trying to run these cities the resources so \nthey can tell the people who are out of their homes, here is what your \nfuture is going to be. Regarding the 600 homes that are going to have \nto be bought out, the city needs to be able to say to those 600 \nfamilies, ``We are going to buy you out and create a new flood way.'' \nUnder any definition, all of those 600 homes are in the flood way.\n  So those 600 families are on hold now. One is living in a tent, by \nthe way, in their yard--a tent--a mother, a father, and children, \nbecause they need to know what their future is going to be. They don't \nhave any money, or a home, and they don't have a job. In this disaster \nbill are the resources that allow the city to say to those people, ``We \nare going to buy your home and establish a new flood plain and, with \nthat commitment, you can now go and get another home.'' Until that \nhappens and this bill is passed, those families' lives are on hold--600 \nfamilies just in that area, and the 800 homes that were severely \ndamaged. Many of them will face a similar circumstance. All of their \nlives are on hold.\n  We hear people around here say this, and I heard them last week and \nthe week before saying that time doesn't matter, nothing is urgent, \nnothing can be done that isn't being done, there is money in the \npipeline. You know, I have heard people like that before. They say, \n``My belt buckle was won in a rodeo,'' and they say, ``There is money \nin the pipeline.'' What a bunch of nonsense. The fact is that the money \nin this bill is critical. It deals with housing. This funding is what \nis necessary to give these people hope and to give the city the \nresources to allow them to move back into either their homes or a \ndifferent home and get on with their lives.\n\n  Until this bill is signed, until the bill is done, all of these \npeople's lives are on hold. ``There is money in the pipeline,'' we are \ntold. Yes, FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has some \nmoney, but that is short-term emergency money. It is not the kind of \nmoney that will finally unlock the housing questions and jobs questions \nthat are in front of all of these families. Until this bill gets passed \nand signed, none of these families will know what their future can be \nor is going to be. So those who stand here and say that there is money \nin the pipeline and there is nothing that can be done that isn't now \nbeing done, I say to them, you are wrong and you know it. If you don't \nknow it, buy a plane ticket and fly to Grand Forks and talk to the \nflood victims that you are holding hostage. If you don't have the \ndecency to do that, then stop talking about it, because you don't know \nwhat you are talking about.\n  There is not money in the pipeline to deal with the emergency needs \nof these people. Every one in this Chamber has a responsibility to \nunderstand that. If they don't understand it, they will not talk about \nit. If Congress doesn't decide this week--and there is some indication \nit won't--to pass a disaster bill without continuing to play politics, \nthen all of these people's lives will continue to be on hold for \nanother week and another week and another week. In the midst of all of \nthis, we will have, I suppose, the prospect of front page stories like, \n``Gingrich Vows Not to Yield on Disaster Bill.'' This says, ``After \nveto, GOP will send back same riders.''\n  We have people who, a couple of years ago, waltzed around this town \nand boasted--and I can get you the quotes and the names and the days, \nbut I will not do that at the moment--that\n\n[[Page S5402]]\n\nif they didn't get their way in this Congress or in the last Congress, \nthey intended to shut down the Government. They boasted repeatedly, \n``Either we get our way or we will shut down the Government.'' They \nsaid, ``Frankly, nobody cares if we shut down the Government.'' Well, \nthey boasted about it and they kept their word; they shut down the \nGovernment and they paid an enormous price for it.\n  Now, some of those same people are trying to portray themselves as \nbeing opposed to shutting down the Government, so they want to attach \nan amendment to this disaster bill saying, we want to tell people that \nwe are opposed to shutting down the Government. The amendment has \nnothing to do with this bill--totally extraneous and unrelated. But \nthey want to use this bill to say we are opposed to shutting down the \nGovernment. The amendment by which they do that is controversial, and I \nam not going to get into the merits of that. Frankly, I care less about \nthe merits of that than do some other people. But as was demonstrated \nby my comments about the disaster relief when Hurricane Andrew hit \nFlorida, a disaster bill that was passed in less than a month--in fact, \nin about 2 weeks after President Bush sent it up. As was shown by that, \nit is unusual for people around here to believe it is appropriate to \nplay politics on a disaster bill.\n  In most cases when you are talking about disaster aid, you are \ntalking about victims. When you are talking about victims, in most \ncases, politics takes a back seat. Members of the House and the \nSenate--Republicans, Democrats, Conservatives, Liberals--don't think \nmuch about politics in those cases. They say we have had people who \nwere victims and had tough times through an act of nature, who have \nbeen dealt a bad blow, who are homeless, hopeless, helpless, and whose \nfamilies are jobless and who need us to say, ``You are not alone, let \nus help you.'' And in almost all cases, the Congress has reached out a \nhelping hand and said, ``Here is a disaster bill we are going to pass \nand we are going to do it on a timely basis to try to give hope to \nthose people who are victims.''\n  In every case that I have recalled since I have been here, whether it \nwas the earthquake victims of California, or the hurricanes in Florida, \nor tornadoes, or blizzards, or floods, I have felt that the taxpayers \nof North Dakota want us to say: Let us help.\n  Let's reach out and provide the helping hand; extend the hand of \nfriendship and the hand of help to say that the rest of the country \nwants to join you in helping you get back on your feet.\n  For years we have had disaster bills move through the Congress \nwithout someone saying, ``I have a new idea. Why don't I try to jam up \nthe disaster bill with a very controversial issue and shove it down the \nPresident's throat? Why don't we try to do that? So what if the victims \nare hurt by that? So what? They are just from North Dakota.'' Or, as \nthis paper says, people will forget by the next election. ``So what?''\n  What a hard-headed, cold-hearted attitude for people to take on a \ndisaster bill. I can't remember when I have been as disappointed in the \nbehavior of Congress as on this bill.\n  Last evening, after the basketball game, the Chicago Bulls and the \nUtah Jazz promoted during the second half of that game a new television \nsitcom, I guess--I don't know. I have never seen it, probably never \nwill, certainly don't intend to. If I do, it will be by accident. But \nthe title was ``Men Behaving Badly.'' ``Men Behaving Badly.'' I \nthought, that could describe what I am going to face tomorrow in the \nSenate again. And someone said, ``Well, but the Senate is more than \njust men.'' That is true, and it is a better place because of it. But I \ndon't see anyone other than some prominent leaders out here leading in \na direction that is counterproductive, and it is behaving badly.\n  There is an easy way for us to solve this problem. Today, Monday, \nthousands of people in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks woke up not in \ntheir homes--some in camper trailers, some in tents, some in motels, \nsome in shelters, some in neighboring towns, some in acquaintances' \nhomes, some in relatives' homes. They woke up not in their own homes \nand not in their own beds because they do not have a home. Most of them \ndon't have a job. What they have is a wait on their hands waiting for \nthe Congress and for their city to make a decision about their future.\n  Why is it up to us to make a decision? Because we have in this bill \nthe resources that will allow those two cities to describe a new \nfloodplain and buy out some of these homes and give people an \nopportunity to create a new future. But today, on Monday, they woke up \nprobably feeling as anxious and as angry about this as I did, \nwondering: What on Earth are people thinking about trying to create a \nmajor political issue over a disaster bill?\n  Madam President, this weekend in the middle of this debate the \nRepublican National Committee was on the radio in North Dakota with \npaid radio ads on this issue. Why would the Republican National \nCommittee be doing paid radio ads about this issue? Because this is \nnow, and has always been, according to leadership and the Republican \nNational Committee, a political issue. From their point of view, the \npoint seems to be to add extraneous and unrelated issues to this bill, \nand then try and shove it down the President's throat.\n  You know. The shoe is going to be on the other foot someday. Someday \nsomebody else is going to have a disaster. Somebody else is going to do \nto them what is now being done to the people of this region. And then \nthey are going to complain about it, and say, ``How can you do that?'' \nI am not going to do it to them because I have not done that since I \ncame to Congress, and I will not do it in the future. I will not play \npolitics with the lives of people who have been victimized by national \ndisasters. But someone will again in the future because the precedent \nis now established that it is just fine to do. It is OK. Get a disaster \nbill, and then get the national political committee of whichever party \ninvolved and start doing radio ads creating an advantage, and have the \nSpeaker go to the Editorial Board and say, ``We are not going to yield \non this issue.'' Besides, it is just a bunch of folks up there in that \nterritory; and says, ``Voters will not remember this standoff over the \nsupplemental appropriations at the ballot box.''\n  Well, I am appalled by what we are facing here. And I don't know what \nwe expect this week.\n  And I am not the only one who is appalled. I have here an article \nfrom the Sioux Falls, SD, paper. The headline reads, about the Governor \nof South Dakota, Governor Janklow, who is a Republican: ``Janklow Slams \nGOP on disaster-aid bill.'' The article goes on to say, ``Misguided \nRepublican strategy will make Congress look bad.''\n\n  Governor Janklow has it right.\n  This is not, and should not be, a bill on which the two parties play \na game of political Ping-Pong. This ought to be a disaster bill that \nprovides relief to victims.\n  So, Madam President, in the remaining days of this week I urge \nMembers of the leadership here in the Congress to give us an \nopportunity to pass a disaster bill that does not contain extraneous or \nunrelated issues that are controversial. Give us an opportunity to pass \na piece of legislation like that, have the President sign it, and have \nthose people who are now wondering about their future who suffered \nthrough significant disasters, blizzards, floods, and fires to be able \nto understand disaster aid is on the way with the President's \nsignature, that aid begins to move, decisions will be able to be made, \nand people's lives will be able to begin to move on as if normal again. \nBut that can only happen if Members of the House and the Senate decide \nthat they will forgo the opportunity to play politics with the disaster \nbill.\n  Madam President, the Fargo Forum, which is a newspaper in North \nDakota, wrote an editorial. This is North Dakota's largest paper. ``Act \nnow on flood relief bill. More than 6 weeks ago the flood-ravaged Red \nRiver Valley just wanted to be left high and dry * * * [In] an ironic \nperversion of the wish, Congress acted or failed to act.'' The ``Red \nRiver Valley just wanted to be left high and dry.'' Well, it is high \nand dry all right.\n  The point of their editorial is that Congress needs to act now. This \nis not a case where a week from now, or a month from now it is just \nfine. This is\n\n[[Page S5403]]\n\nurgent. This is an urgent need, and Congress needs to act now.\n  The Grand Forks Herald is the newspaper of a city of 50,000 people. \nEvery day since Congress took the Memorial Day recess at the front of \ntheir masthead they say, ``10 Days Since Congress Let Us Down.'' I \nsuppose it is now 18 days since the House adjourned without passing the \ndisaster bill. The editorial makes the point, and every citizen in \nGrand Forks makes the point, that Congress ought to move on this \ndisaster bill and move now.\n  On March 19 the President sent his request to Congress. When the \nflood occurred and the President went to Grand Forks, ND, and spoke to \nseveral thousand people in an airplane hangar at the Grand Forks Air \nForce Base, he made the point that he was seeking a significant \ndisaster relief bill and that he hoped that Congress would not add \nextraneous or unrelated amendments to the bill. What he hoped would not \nhappen has happened. The result has now been substantial delay--at \nleast 3 weeks' delay, and probably more.\n  Madam President, my desire would be that everyone call a political \ntruce, that we simply recognize that the disaster bill is to respond to \ndisasters, and that the way to provide hope and help to the victims of \nthe disasters is to pass a bill without the major areas of controversy \nthat have now been sent to the President.\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Madam President, for all these reasons, I now send to the desk a \nclean supplemental appropriations bill for myself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \nWellstone, and Mr. Johnson.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 18, H.R. 581; that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken, and that the text of the clean \nsupplemental appropriations bill that I just sent to the desk be \ninserted in lieu thereof, that the bill be passed, and that the motion \nto reconsider be laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me describe what it is I was just \nproposing. The major items of controversy that now exist in the \nlegislation the President vetoed are the so-called anti-Government \nshutdown provision--the so-called continuing resolution provision--and \nthe census issue.\n\n  I know the President in his veto message was going to object to more \nthan those two. The bill that I sent to the desk and asked unanimous \nconsent be considered was the conference report that was agreed to in \nboth the House and the Senate, with the anti-Government shutdown \nprovision and the census provision removed.\n  The shutdown provision has substantial amounts of controversy \nattached to it. I have no objection at all for that to be considered at \nany time. I just do not think it ought to be considered on a disaster \nbill.\n  My bill removes the census portion of the disaster bill. I do not \nobject that the Senate consider the census provision at some point. But \nthere are plenty of other opportunities to consider it. As soon as the \nPresident signs the bill and disaster aid begins to flow, we will have \nother bills come to the floor of the Senate. My understanding is that \nthere was a proposal to be brought to the floor of the Senate tomorrow. \nBoth of these issues could be offered as amendments to that bill. I \nhave no objection to that. If somebody wants to offer that, let's offer \nthat and have a debate. I have no objection nor concern about that.\n  I just do not want these provisions to be provisions that \ninterminably delay a disaster bill which should have passed, now it is \n3 weeks ago.\n  If the newspaper reports are correct, it looks like this issue will \nnot be resolved this week, nor probably next week.\n  How long do victims of a disaster have to wait? When will Congress \nunderstand its obligation, and the historical approach of dealing with \ndisaster bills, of not adding highly controversial issues to a bill \nthat deals with disasters?\n  It seems to me that this should be a time for cooler heads to \nprevail; a time for both sides to back away a bit and decide to pass \nthe disaster bill without these provisions.\n  I have taken the time again today simply to attempt to describe what \nour region of the country is faced with, to describe why we are upset \nand angry about what has happened to this piece of legislation. And I \nwill no doubt be on the floor additional times today and during this \nweek.\n  I hope that in the coming couple of hours Members of Congress will \ndecide this is not a strategy that does anything other than hurt \nvictims of a disaster.\n  Does it help the political party? I don't think so. I mean, I guess \nthat is why a political party would run ads over this weekend in my \nState, because they think they are being helped by it. I don't think \nanybody is being helped by it. I think the net result is that victims \nof a disaster get hurt.\n  I mean, if there are some who do not care who gets hurt as you march \ntoward a political victory, that is one thing. But I don't think this \nis marching toward anything but chaos in any event, and I think it is \nclear who is getting hurt. Victims of the disaster are getting hurt.\n  I started today with a description of Ranee Steffan, who is living in \na camper trailer, has been for some while, perhaps will be for some \nwhile, with her kids. She does not want much. She, her family, and her \nchildren want a job because she doesn't have a job, because most of the \nbusinesses in this area have been closed--wants a job and a home. She \nwants decisions to be made that will allow that to happen in her city, \nand in her community. And until this piece of legislation passes that \ncannot happen.\n  On behalf of Ranee Steffan, and so many other thousands of families \nwhose lives are on hold, I hope very much that both sides of the aisle \nwill decide to pass a disaster bill free from contentious unrelated \npolitical matters. We need to get aid to those who need it as quickly \nas is possible.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5399-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5403-S5404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   URGENT SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, first, I objected to the unanimous-\nconsent consideration. My friend and colleague from North Dakota \nexpected it. He knew I would do so. He basically tried to pass the bill \nas designed by one Senator. That is not the way the legislative body \nworks. The way the legislative body works is that there are procedures. \nIt goes through committees. Senators add amendments trying to influence \nthe behavior of Congress, trying to influence the behavior of \nGovernment, trying to set policy. That is what happened in this bill.\n  I might tell my colleague from North Dakota I did not vote for the \nbill anyway. I think this bill was not just a disaster bill. This bill \ngrew, and it grew too much. The President submitted a bill in, I think, \nearly May, for approximately $4 billion. This bill grew to over $9 \nbillion. I voted against it.\n  Now, the President vetoed the bill, and he vetoed it supposedly \nbecause Congress put in a provision that says if, for whatever reason, \nwe do not get an appropriation bill passed by the end of September, we \nwill continue operating at this year's level of funding. I happen to \nthink that is a perfectly responsible thing to do. The President does \nnot like it. Maybe some Democrats do not like it, I guess because they \nwant to spend a lot more money than this year's level. I think it was a \nresponsible thing to do so we would avoid a shutdown, so Government \nemployees, Government agencies, everyone would know that if in the \nevent we did not pass an appropriation bill, we could continue \noperating at this year's level. I think that is proper. They did not. \nThe President vetoed the bill. I wish he had not vetoed it for that \nreason. If I was President, I would have vetoed it because it spent too \nmuch money. That is one of the reasons why we have divisions of power. \nWe happen to be equal branches. We do not just write an appropriation \nbill just designed by the President. If so, we would not have a \nCongress. We would just let the President write the bill.\n  But that is not the way the system works. We have equal branches of \nGovernment. So the President can submit his proposal, and then we will \nact on it.\n\n[[Page S5404]]\n\n He vetoed it, and we have a couple of options. We can vote to override \nthe veto--in all likelihood, we do not have the votes to override the \nveto, and so then we will work with colleagues to see if we can come up \nwith a proposal that will pass and get his signature. And that is the \nproper way to do it. It is not the proper way to do it to try to pass \nit by unanimous consent, a bill designed by one Senator. I, for one, \nwould object because I think it spends too much money not even related \nto the two objections that my colleague from North Dakota had outlined.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield just for a point?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield at this point.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator's statement. The bill that I \nasked unanimous consent to have considered was not a bill written by \nme. It was the exact conference report just reported out by Congress, \nminus the two contentious provisions. So I do not want people to think \nit was a bill written by me. It was exactly what the conference did, \nleaving out the two very controversial provisions.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I understand my colleague did not like \ntwo provisions. Maybe the President did not like two provisions. It may \nwell be the President will look at the rest of the bill and he will not \nlike other provisions. My point being, we have two branches of \nGovernment, both equal, and the President can make a request and \nCongress disposes of it and he has the right to veto it. Evidently he \nhas done that. I understand the majority leader of the Senate is trying \nto get in contact with him today and maybe some discussions will ensue.\n  I also just happened to be looking at this report. The initial \nrequest was $4.5 billion in discretionary outlays. The committee \nreport, the committee report as it came out of the Senate was $7.6 \nbillion, so, in other words, $3 billion more than originally requested. \nThe conference report, after it went to conference, was $8.6 billion. \nAnd if you add budget authority with the mandatory it was over $9.5 \nbillion.\n\n  So this, like a lot of urgent supplementals, grew, and many times \nthey grow at the request of the administration. They did not make it in \ntheir initial request, but they asked for more money, and somebody else \nsaid, well, I think we should fund this and everyone was in agreement, \nboth Democrats and Republicans, so we go ahead and fund it. What we \nwind up doing is we fund things in an urgent supplemental that, \nfrankly, should be funded in the normal appropriations process. We \nshould be in the process of passing normal appropriations bills now for \nnext year so they do not have to be in the supplemental; we do not have \nto prefund them. We should fund it through the process. And I, for one, \nsince evidently the President's vetoed this bill, hope we come in with \na very streamlined, strictly urgent supplemental bill.\n  And I, for one, have serious questions whether or not we should be \nfunding Bosnia assistance in this. How can the Bosnia assistance be \nurgent? We have had the troops over there. We have known about it. You \ncannot say that is not expected. We have known the troops are over \nthere. I know that they are raiding operation and maintenance accounts; \nthey are drawing down those funds. We have underfunded defense in the \npast. But we have known we have had a significant peacekeeping force in \nBosnia and we do not fund it. And so then we start saying, well, we \nneed to fund it all of a sudden because we did not put enough money in \nfor defense last time.\n  We have known those troops are over there and should be funded. But \nthe costs have risen significantly. We should get control of those \ncosts. I have some reservations about whether or not we should have had \nthose troops in the international peacekeeping force in the first \nplace. The President puts them over there, underfunds them and asks us \nto bail him out with an urgent supplemental. I have some reservations \nabout it.\n  Mr. President, there is only two issues of dispute. One is on the \ncensus language, one is on whether or not we would have a continuing \nresolution to keep the Government open should we reach an impasse on \nappropriations.\n  Just a couple of final comments. We have reached an impasse in \nappropriations the last 2 years, in 1995 and in 1996, prior to the last \nelection. The way that was solved in 1996, prior to the election, was \nthe President basically said I am going to shut Government down unless \nyou give me a lot more money. Unfortunately, in my opinion, we \nsuccumbed to that temptation; we gave the President about $8.5 billion \nso we could get out of town. I hope we do not repeat that failure.\n  Who was the real loser in that? Maybe Congressmen and Senators \nweren't, but I think the taxpayers lost. We wrote big checks. \nDiscretionary spending really went up. It went up in some cases, Madam \nPresident, even more than the President requested so we could get out \nof town. I hope we do not replay that.\n  So the essence of this continuing resolution was, if for whatever \nreason we have an impasse, let us at least continue operations at this \nyear's level so we will avoid that disaster, so we will not have the \ncurtailment, so we will not have the shutdown, and I still think it is \ngood policy. I regret the President vetoing it for that reason. I think \nthat was a mistake. He has that right to do it.\n  I think it is important we follow constitutional procedures and keep \nin mind constitutional prerogatives. The President is President. He \ndoes not have the right to dictate every detail in an appropriation \nbill. He can veto every appropriation bill he does not like. I want to \npreserve that right. But likewise, we are an equal branch of Government \nand we have a right to put on language that a majority of Senators are \nsupportive of.\n  So I will work with my colleagues from North Dakota. I see another \ncolleague, Senator Conrad, is here and wishes to speak on the issue, \nand I will not detain him. I know he has very strong feelings, as \nSenator Dorgan does, as well. And so I will work with my colleagues. \nHopefully, we will be able to come up with another bill, one that will \nnot cost taxpayers as much as the previous bill, and hopefully we will \nbe able to break the impasse and provide needed relief in a timely \nmanner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, reserving the right to object, what was \nthe request?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I was asking for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an order already standing for Senator \nCoverdell to be recognized at 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right, then I will withdraw my request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5403-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5404-S5405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DISASTER RELIEF\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the President of the United States has \nnow vetoed the disaster relief bill. He has done so because there were \nunrelated provisions put in that legislation.\n  Madam President, the time for political games is over. This is a \nheadline from the largest newspaper in our State over the weekend. The \nheadline is: ``You Are Playing with Our Lives.'' The woman quoted is a \nRenee Steffan. The article said, ``She has strong words for Members of \nCongress who think flood victims can wait while bickering continues in \nWashington over a disaster relief bill.''\n  She goes on to say, ``You are playing with our lives.''\n\n       She issued that warning from the sweltering travel trailer \n     that she and her family now call home. She says, ``This isn't \n     some game. You should come here and walk in my shoes for a \n     day.'' Homeless for a month, out of work, and bounced from \n     one temporary shelter to another, the wife of two is fed up \n     with lawmakers who think Grand Forks residents are getting \n     along just fine.\n\n  Madam President, Grand Forks residents are not getting along just \nfine. Not only are Grand Forks residents not getting along just fine, \nnor are the residents of East Grand Forks. In these two communities, \n50,000 in Grand Forks, 9,000 in East Grand Forks, nearly every single \nsoul was evacuated 6 weeks ago. Thousands of them are still homeless. \nTheir homes are destroyed. Their jobs are destroyed. And their lives \nare on hold waiting for us to act.\n  The President vetoed this bill. He said clearly these unrelated \nprovisions ought not to be in a disaster relief bill.\n\n[[Page S5405]]\n\n That is the plea and the request of the people from Grand Forks and \nEast Grand Forks. Send a clean bill to the President, one he can sign \nso that the relief can start to flow.\n  Now, the Washington Post this morning, in the Novak column, he \nreported, and I quote:\n\n       At a contentious meeting of Republican leaders after \n     adjournment Thursday, Lott argued that this time, unlike 2 \n     years ago, the GOP would win `the PR battle.' He claimed \n     Americans did not care much about the supplemental \n     appropriations bill providing help for victims of Red River \n     flooding in the Dakotas and Minnesota.\n\n  I do not know if that is really the position of the majority leader. \nI hope it is not. But if it is, let me just say that he is wrong. \nPeople do care. The outpouring from across the United States has been \nunprecedented.\n  People of the United States care a lot about helping people hit by a \ndisaster. They have proven it time after time after time. The fact is, \nif the majority leader really believes that the American people do not \ncare, he is wrong. The American people are better than that.\n  And for those who do not think it makes any difference, let me just \nquote from the Republican Governor from South Dakota. The Republican \nGovernor says, ``If you've got a disaster bill, you ought to deal with \nthe disaster.''\n\n       For those who say that delay does not matter, Janklow--\n\n  Again, the Republican Governor of South Dakota--\n\n     said the delay in the legislation is blocking reconstruction \n     of sewage facilities, highways and a State-owned rail line in \n     South Dakota.\n\n  It is not just the Republican Governor of South Dakota who \nunderstands that delay matters, but there is a Republican Congressman \nfrom Minnesota, Jim Ramstad, a former North Dakotan, by the way, a \nmember of the Ways and Means Committee, who said over the weekend: \n``Those who argue that there is money in the pipeline are being \ndisingenuous at best.''\n  This is a Republican Congressman from Minnesota. He said, ``There's \nno money for housing, no money for livestock, no money for sewage \nsystems, no money for water supply, no money for housing buyouts. There \nis no money in the pipeline for those things. They can't really rebuild \nwithout the funds that are tied up in the disaster relief bill.''\n  And he concluded by saying, ``Let's end the Washington games.''\n  Madam President, the people of North Dakota and Minnesota and South \nDakota and the 30 other States that are affected by this disaster make \none request. Send a disaster relief bill that is clean, that does not \nhave these unrelated provisions, send it quickly so the relief can \nbegin to flow. The people in our areas need it. As that woman said from \na sweltering trailer, the time for these political games is over. \nPeople have been hurt and they need help. Now is the time to respond.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Parliamentary inquiry. It is my understanding that the \nhour from 4 to 5 has been designated under my control, or any person \nthat I shall delegate time to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in light of the presentation we have \njust heard and the recent veto of the emergency aid by the President, I \nam going to yield 10 minutes of my time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas, and then I will return to the original content of the \npurpose of the hour from 4 to 5 after she has responded.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia, because I do want to respond and make sure that \neveryone is singing from the same page.\n  I appreciate very much what the distinguished Senators from North \nDakota are feeling right now, and what they must feel every time they \ngo home. I, too, have visited disaster areas in my home State in the \nlast week, and it is a devastating situation.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear that all of us are going to \nmake sure that the victims of disasters in all the 35 States that are \ncovered will have all of the help they need, and they will have it in \nthe absolute minimum time it takes to get that to them. In fact, the \ndisaster victims in North Dakota and Minnesota and South Dakota are \ngetting help right now. They are getting the SBA loans, they are \ngetting the agriculture help, they are getting the assistance that they \nneed, and it is there now, and we have $2 billion in the pipeline \nwaiting to come in to them, not waiting for us to act. That is in the \npipeline now. So the money is there, make no mistake about it.\n  But it is very important that everyone know that this is a \nsupplemental appropriations bill. It is the first appropriations bill \nthat has gone through this year. There are many items that must be \ncovered. We are covering the replenishment of FEMA funds, the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency funds, because they are being depleted \nright now as we speak, going to the victims of North Dakota, South \nDakota, Minnesota, California and other States. We are giving that \nmoney to them, and we are going to replenish it with this supplemental \nbill.\n  But there are many other things covered in this bill. It is not as if \nthis is just a disaster relief bill for those areas. It is also a $1.9 \nbillion expenditure for overseas peacekeeping, to replenish the funds \nthat have gone into the protection of Bosnia. There is $928 million for \nveterans compensation and pensions, $29.9 million for plane crash \ninvestigations, $6.4 million to the FBI to reimburse New York State and \nlocal jurisdictions for assisting in the investigation of Flight 800, \n$197 million for the National Park Service, $103 million for the Fish \nand Wildlife Service, $67 million for the Forest Service, $20 million \nfor the Bureau of Indian Affairs, $585 million for the Army Corps of \nEngineers, $510 million for the U.S. mission in Southwest Asia, $58 \nmillion for the Women, Infants, and Children Program. Mr. President, it \ngoes on.\n  This is a supplemental appropriations bill. These are funds that are \nto replenish funds that have already been spent. In addition to that, \nwe are setting the process by which we do appropriations this year. \nThat is why we have the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. That is why \nwe are saying if we do not come to agreement on October 1 for all of \nthe appropriations bills, that Government will continue to function, \nthat people will not have to worry about their paychecks, that veterans \nwill not have to worry about their pensions, that people going on \nvacation will not have to worry about it. We are saying right now, here \nis how we are going to proceed.\n  I think it has been portrayed that Congress is playing games. \nCongress has passed a bill. It is not absolving the President of all \nresponsibility to veto anything he wants to veto, and then say, well, I \ndidn't like it and it's your responsibility.\n  He has a responsibility. The President can sign this bill. I would \nlike for the President to explain why he wants the ability to shut down \nGovernment. I would like the President to explain what is unreasonable \nabout providing for the ongoing Government expenditures at today's \nlevels while Congress and the President might continue to negotiate on \nan appropriations bill that has not been passed by September 30.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Is it not the Senator's understanding that the \nemergency appropriations Congress passed and sent to the President last \nweek was voted for by the Senate majority leader?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think that is correct, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It was voted for by the Senate minority leader?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Absolutely.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Voted for by a majority of the Republican Senators?\n\n[[Page S5406]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. In fact, the majority of the Republican Senators and \ntwo-thirds of the whole U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. And a majority of the other side of the aisle?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. My point is, how much more bipartisan? We don't see \nthat happening here very often. So the emergency relief and all of its \nprovisions, the guarantee you talk about to keep the Government from \nshutting down, was voted for by the leadership, Republican, Democrat, \nby the majority of both sides of the aisle, and the President says the \nCongress is playing games with emergency relief? It seems a little \nincongruous to me.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I can certainly understand why the Senator from \nGeorgia would be a little confused, when Republicans produced a bill \nthat gave the President everything he asked for the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, for Bosnia, and for all these other programs that \nare being replenished for the administration. I can understand why he \nwould be confused that the President would veto the bill and accuse \nRepublicans of playing political games. That is confusing.\n  In fact, I have to say I think the President needs to step up to the \nline and say what is unreasonable about providing for the orderly \nprocess of Government, the orderly appropriations process, telling \npeople what to expect if there is not an agreement on September 30 \nbetween the President and Congress. There are no hammers, there is no \nfear on the part of Government employees or veterans or people who are \ncounting on paychecks coming on time. What is wrong with providing for \nthat? We are not cutting back on what people are getting now. We are \njust saying, let's provide a level playing field here. Let's negotiate \nin good faith. And if the President does not want to do that, if the \nPresident wants to shut down Government or wants to have a hammer over \nCongress' head, wants to have some artificial shutdown of Government at \nhis disposal, I would like for the President to explain to the American \npeople why. Why? Because if we do not pass this now, then people will \nnot know what to expect. Government employees will not know what to \nexpect, veterans will not know what to expect. We may not pass an \nappropriations bill on which this could be put, as a matter of process, \nfor months to come.\n  I think this is the responsible approach to take so everyone \nunderstands. If the President disagrees, tell us why. Tell us why you \nwant to shut down Government, Mr. President, or you want people to be \nin fear of shutting down Government, or you want a hammer over \nCongress' head in order to have some sort of advantage. I mean, what is \nit? What is it that would cause you to veto a bill that you say is so \nimportant to you, for disaster relief and other supplemental \nappropriations, when, in fact, all you have to do is sign the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think the responsibility lies in the \nWhite House. The Congress has done its job. I would appreciate the \nPresident stepping up to the line and saying what is so bad about \nhaving a process which everyone knows, right now, and can plan for, an \norderly, responsible transfer between fiscal years. I would just like \nthe President to step up and say what's wrong with that. We ask him to \ndo that today.\n  We want him to provide the relief he has asked for. And, Mr. \nPresident, Congress has done its job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I think \nshe is absolutely on point. Getting the emergency relief where it needs \nto go, protecting its ability to do its work, is in the President's \nhands now because Congress--particularly here in the Senate, but the \nHouse as well--has sent a broadly based, broadly agreed-to document to \nthe President. So, if it doesn't move on to the people who need it, the \nPresident will have to accept that responsibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5405-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5406-S5412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE FAMILY FRIENDLY WORKPLACE ACT\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, for the next 15 minutes or so, since we \nare talking about vetoes, I would like to talk about the Family \nFriendly Workplace Act, S. 4. This is a piece of legislation that has \nbeen authored by the good Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, \nmyself, and others. It is designed to make the workplace a friendlier \nplace, a more flexible place. Lo and behold, in the middle of the \ndebate, the President has announced to the country he would have to \nveto this bill, which is as puzzling as his veto of this emergency \nrelief. He has said he would have to veto the act. We have had a \nfilibuster underway on this Family Friendly Workplace Act. We have \ntried to break the filibuster twice and have failed to do so because of \nthe supporters of the President on the other side of the aisle.\n  If you want to know what the American public thinks about this kind \nof legislation, you just need to go talk to them. In a survey for Money \nmagazine in May of this year, 64 percent of the public and 68 percent \nof women would prefer time off to overtime pay if they had the choice, \nwhich they do not. The Federal workers, since 1978, have had this \nchoice, but not these hourly laborers. If they had the choice, they \nwould prefer time off to overtime pay. That is what the Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act is about. It is about giving employees and their \nemployers the voluntary--underscore voluntary--option to design \nprograms to meet this desire.\n  A Penn & Schoen survey found that 75 percent support the choice of \ntime off in lieu of overtime pay. President Clinton's own Labor \nDepartment has reported that help in balancing the needs of work and \nfamily is the No. 1 need among working American women. You would think, \ngiven what we have seen and the stress that is being pounded upon the \naverage American family, we would be stepping forward with legislation \nsuch as S. 4, and trying to create a system in the workplace that \nallows these working families to meet their special needs and to adjust \nthe time they need to juggle between family and the workplace.\n  Mr. President, I see we have been joined by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wyoming, who has been an advocate of the Family Friendly Workplace \nAct. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming, to share his \nthoughts on this legislation with us.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank my colleague \nfor arranging this special order.\n  It seems to me that this is something that is very important. I have \nwatched this discussion with great interest, having had some experience \nin small business, and, I must confess, I have been very surprised by \nit. It seems to me that over the years, particularly the last 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, we have spent in this body a great deal of time talking about \nmaking things more family friendly. We have talked about how we could \nprovide more time for families to share in the schooling of their \nyoungsters, to share in their communities, to share in the things that \nmake communities strong, and to work that in to our professional lives.\n  Then comes a proposal to do that which allows for flextime, which \nallows for comptime, and we find suddenly a great deal of opposition. \nThat is a puzzle to me. As I mentioned, I have been in a small business \nwhere you don't have many employees, and I recognize from the employer \nside that there has to be some communication, because you may not be \nable to spare someone for a certain length of time. On the other side, \nI think it is equally or perhaps even more important that the employee \nis not forced by the employer to take the time differently than they \nwould like to. But it is my understanding and my belief that in this \nbill those things are protected, that it is a cooperative agreement \nbetween the employer and the employee, to come to these conclusions.\n  So I was very disappointed. Even though I haven't spoken a great deal \non it, I was very disappointed last week when we didn't get enough \nvotes to vote cloture. There certainly are enough votes to pass the \nbill. I am disappointed that the White House has apparently indicated \nthe President will not sign the bill, largely as a result of the labor \nunions to which the White House is so sensitive. This Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act would help working Americans do the things--the\n\n[[Page S5407]]\n\nvery things--that the President has been talking about and made an \nissue of in the last election and since. And then we find there is \nopposition to it.\n  Most Americans, I believe--the Americans that I have talked to--do, \nin fact, want flexibility in the workplace, would like to have the \nopportunity to be able to make some adjustments. We have a business in \nour town of Cheyenne. It is called Unicover. They are the ones who put \nout first-day stamps, first-day covers. The owner testified before the \nSenate Labor Committee a few months ago. His employees came to him and \nasked for comptime/flextime so there could be some arrangements. He \nwants to offer that to his employees but cannot, of course, until S. 4 \nis passed. I suppose this has been said--in fact, when you are \ndiscussing an issue like this, everything has been said --but the May \n1997 survey from Money magazine found 68 percent of working women would \nprefer comptime to overtime pay. The Labor Department has indicated \nthat it would help in balancing work and attention to the family, which \nis the No. 1 issue for working American women.\n  So I am truly puzzled by the opposition to it, and I can only imagine \nthat it is simply a political opposition brought on by the opposition \nof the labor unions to it, which surprises me as well, because \ncertainly union leaders and union members want to do something with \ntheir families as well.\n  Americans need the flexibility in the workplace if we are to \naccomplish the things that we want to, if we are to accommodate the \nfact that more and more women, more and more mothers are in the \nworkplace and, therefore, since both family members often are working \nthat there does need to be flexibility.\n  Our current laws go back to 1938. Most jobs were in manufacturing; \nvery strict. One-payroll families were the norm. That has obviously \nchanged to where now two-payroll families are, indeed, the norm. In \n1938, 16 percent of the women with children worked outside the home; in \n1997, more than 70 percent work outside the home.\n  This Family Friendly Workplace Act creates new choices for employees \nand employers. By mutual agreement, they can agree to substitute some \nalternatives for overtime, some alternatives to the 40-hour operation. \nThey can take time off to do the things that they need to do or bank \nsome hours with comptime. Federal workers, I understand, have enjoyed \nthis flexibility scheduling now for nearly 20 years, and they can do \nthat. Why not the rest of the working community? S. 4 protects workers' \nrights, and that is important, very important. Penalties for direct or \nindirect employer coercion are doubled from current law. Accumulated \ncomptime may be paid in cash by year's end.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we intend to continue to push, \ncontinue to address S. 4 in this Congress and, hopefully, get the bill \npassed. It meets the realities of the modern-day workplace, it meets \nthe needs of modern-day families, and is something that I think is very \nfavored among people in this country.\n  It is a little frustrating sometimes to find this kind of dilemma \nthat we are caught up in this week, quite frankly, a situation where if \na bill doesn't suit the President, it has to bring us to a standstill. \nAfter all, the President is not a king; the President doesn't run the \ncountry. He has to give as well as the Congress. That is what this is \nabout. Here we find another that is very similar.\n\n  I hope that we find some areas of agreement that will allow us to put \ninto place S. 4 and protect the rights of workers, protect the \nopportunity for options, protect the opportunity for families to have a \nfriendly workplace. I hope we do it very soon.\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend for this time and for his work and \nthat of the Senator from Missouri on this bill. It has been exemplary. \nThank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a moment.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Sure.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It is sort of ironic that this Monday afternoon we are \nbeset with Presidential vetoes or threats to veto. He has indicated \nthat he will veto the Family Friendly Workplace Act if it includes \nflextime, which is what I think most of us feel is among the more \nimportant features, to allow working families to adjust their time.\n  The Senator from Wyoming has talked about compromise, but I just want \nto reiterate and try to get your impression. Don't you find it unusual \nthat the only thing we have been met with here is a filibuster, and \nthat if you are really interested in creating a family workplace work \nenvironment, wouldn't you think we would be getting suggested new \nlanguage or something that might compromise, instead of sort of a \nstraight-arm and voting down attempts to end the filibuster?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I say to the Senator, I think that is curious. If you \nhave an issue where you are on different sides of the issue and opposed \nto one another, then you get this kind of thing. But here is one where, \nif you went around and talked about opportunities to have some choices \nin the workplace, if you talked about a way to allow people to have \nsome flextime with their families, everybody would agree, nobody would \ndisagree with that.\n  So it is strange that having that as the premise, having that as the \nbasis that we find instead of searching for a way to make it work, as \nyou say, it becomes an absolute stoppage of anything happening. It is \ncurious, and I am surprised. I guess that is why I am here expressing \nsome surprise in the way this has turned.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Wyoming. As usual, he has \ncontributed substantially to the discussion.\n  Mr. President, in my opening remarks, I spoke of the percentage of \nworking women who would prefer time off to overtime pay if they had a \nchoice, which they don't. That is what we are trying to create here.\n  I read this very interesting article from the Radcliffe Public Policy \nInstitute, ``Work and Family Integration.'' It is very interesting. It \nsays:\n\n       Economic changes have direct consequences on work and \n     family life.\n\n  That says it all. I have been arguing for the better part of 2 years \nnow that when we talk about American culture and what is happening in \nthe American family, we tend to point fingers to who is causing the \ntrouble, and Hollywood gets a pretty good dose of it. But I don't think \nHollywood holds a candle to Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam has put so much \neconomic pressure on the working families that it has dramatically \nchanged the nature of the way these families function.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       It is increasingly common for all adult family members to \n     spend a greater number of hours at work in order to make up \n     for declining median family incomes to fulfill personal \n     career goals or to cater to growing workplace demands.\n\n  Again, I would argue, that while the median family income has \ndeclined, the biggest culprit in absorbing those median income salaries \nis the Government. In fact, by our analysis in Georgia, an average \nfamily today forfeits 55 percent of their income after they pay direct \ntaxes, almost 40 percent, cost of Government regulations, $7,000 per \nfamily, and their share of higher interest payments because of the \nnational debt that has been put on their backs.\n  That pressure needs relief in many ways. No. 1, which we are talking \nabout here, we need to lower the economic pressure, we need to lower \nthe taxes on those average families; No. 2, there should be no \nimpediment in the workplace that blocks working families and the \ncompanies for whom they work from finding ways to suit and balance the \nneeds of these work careers and the needs at home.\n  This article says:\n\n       Married women with children have entered the labor force in \n     record numbers. They, therefore, have less time for \n     caregiving in the home.\n\n  They have less time. We have seen the SAT scores aren't as good, \nteenage violence is worse, teenage suicide has quadrupled, and you have \nto say to yourself, ``Well, if there is not as much opportunity or \nattention to govern the home, you are going to have problems like this \nthat will begin to emerge.''\n\n       Many parents, both mothers and fathers, feel conflicted and \n     torn between spending time with their families and meeting \n     workplace demands.\n\n  This is the point I was making a moment ago: A massive amount of \npressure in both places and we are operating under a workplace that is \ngoverned\n\n[[Page S5408]]\n\nby laws that are a half a century old, almost 60 years old. You think \nback 60 years to 1930, the 1930 workplace. First of all, it was mostly \nrural. Now it is only 2 percent that is rural. Just reflect for a \nminute on the kinds of massive change that have occurred between 1930 \nand 1997 and you can understand that the governance in the workplace \nprobably, like everything else, requires some modernization.\n\n  It says work and family life should not be in opposition but should \nenrich each other. Work and family life should not be in opposition but \nshould enrich each other. That is what this legislation is trying to \ndo. It is trying to allow the workplace to adjust to the different \nneeds that the different workers have with regard to maintaining and \ngoverning their families.\n  Here is a quote:\n\n       It's like you are caught between a rock and a hard place \n     because if you want to have a family, you want to have a \n     couple of children, you can't do that unless you have lots of \n     money to support them. Well, you can, but you'd have to be \n     able to take care of them, at least provide the basics, and \n     in order to do that you either have to have your husband gone \n     all the time working so hard or working toward getting his \n     degree or else both of you have to be working, but the more \n     you're working, the less time you have with your kids, so \n     it's like you can't win.\n  That is from a young woman in her twenties in Salt Lake City.\n\n       But the more you're working, the less time you have with \n     your kids, so it's like you can't win.\n  You know, we wonder why, even with the economy doing reasonably well, \nwhy you get so much anxiety coming out of the workplace. Well, that is \nit, right there, ``But the more you're working, the less time you have \nwith your kids, so it's like you can't win.\n\n  So here comes S. 4 and it says you and your employer voluntarily can \nmake decisions and create options about what happens in the workplace \nso that hopefully it can help make it possible for you both to be \nworking and still win. I am absolutely baffled by the threat from the \nother end of Pennsylvania Avenue, ``I would have to veto this if \nflextime is left in the legislation.'' That sure does not square with \nanything we are seeing or reading.\n  I was looking at the average hours per week parents devote to \nundivided child care--in other words, full blown. If the woman is \nemployed, it is 6.6 hours per week. If she is unemployed, it is just \nunder double, 12.9 hours a week, of undivided attention. It doubles.\n  Now, you cannot unemploy these people to get this added time. That \nwill not work, given what has been happening here in Washington for the \nlast 30 years and given the economic pressure on them, but you can \nbegin to modify the rules in the workplace so that there is an offset, \nan opportunity to adjust.\n  Mr. President, we have just been joined by the senior Senator from \nNew Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee and a Senator most \nknowledgeable and concerned about a friendly workplace.\n  I yield up to 10 minutes if that is sufficient, to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank you for those kind words, and, yes, that is \nsufficient.\n  First of all, I am very proud to be a cosponsor of the Family \nFriendly Workplace Act. The way I see it, this bill is long overdue for \nAmerican workers in the private sector. Federal employees have had \nflextime and comptime for nearly 20 years and it is about time the \nmillions of American men and women who do not work for the Government \nreceive the same benefits.\n  I vigorously support this bill for the following three reasons. One, \nit is fair. Federal employees currently have comptime and flextime. It \nis voluntary. And it protects employees.\n  Times have changed since we adopted the rigid 40-hour work week. \nUnder current law, you cannot arrange a schedule to work 44 hours one \nweek and save those 4 hours to take time off in the next week to be \nwith your children or to do something very important to help your sick \nmother or your grandmother. Current law says you cannot do that even if \nyou want to and your boss agree.\n\n  Federal employees have had flextime for many, many years. What we \nhave now found out is that Federal employees who have been \nparticipating in flextime are highly satisfied. That should not \nsurprise anyone. It is a very rational and reasonable thing.\n  Eight out of ten workers support continuation of the program; 72 \npercent say they have more flexibility to spend more time with their \nfamilies and on personal needs; 74 percent said the flexible schedule \nhas improved their morale and made them feel better about their work \nand about their employers. If comptime flextime is good enough for \nFederal employees, then why not for the 80 million people that work in \nthe private sector of America?\n  For example, FBI employees have comptime and flextime. Isn't what is \ngood enough for them also good enough for restaurant workers, hospital \nemployees, hotel chain workers, telecommunication employees, and, yes, \nfiremen, policemen, and others who might be burdened by the 40-hour-a-\nweek rigid nonflexible time?\n  Federal workers can currently use their flextime schedules to attend \nsuch things as a school play, baseball games, PTA meetings, dance \nrecitals, Boy Scout or Girl Scout meetings and activities, doctors \nvisits, school field trips, and dental appointments for children. As a \nmatter of fact, I say to my good friend, Senator Coverdell, we got \nthose examples from people who said this is exactly what they would \nlike to do and we got it from Federal employees who say this is exactly \nwhat they are doing.\n  This bill, as I understand it, and I would not be supporting it \nwithout this, is good because it is voluntary or optional. It \nencourages employers and employees to work together to arrange \nschedules which fit the individual needs of employees and yet provide \nthe management with enough opportunities to get the work done that they \nneed done. Nothing in this bill requires employees to adjust their work \nschedules if they do not want to.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. You are right now on the core dispute. You have argued \nfor the need in the new modern workplace for the flexible time and what \nit does to morale and conflicting schedules, and you said you would not \nbe for this if it was not voluntary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That would be the same for me.\n  As you know, if I could comment about it, not only is it voluntary, \nbut the legislation has strict procedures to guarantee that it is \nvoluntary, and there would be ramifications of severe proportions if an \nemployer were to do anything other than make it voluntary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No question. In fact, I was going to get to that in a \nmoment.\n  It is so voluntary that employees under this law can withdraw from a \ncomptime and flextime arrangement at any time. Employees can cash out \naccrued hours of comptime and flextime at any time. These provisions \nare going to be enforced just as rigidly as the current provisions of \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  This bill protects employees from employer misconduct because it \ncontains anti-coercion provisions. I would not support it if it did not \nhave this protection because this is what assures that it would really \nbe voluntary. There are always people who would like to deny employees \ncertain rights and some employees would like to not work as hard as \nthey should for their employers. We cannot correct all of that.\n  But obviously this law says that an employer cannot claim \ninconvenience as a reason for not allowing an employee to take \ncomptime. Once the employer and employee have agreed to a schedule, the \nemployer cannot then change his mind and say it would be inconvenient \nto do it that way.\n  As an example, an employer cannot force an employee to accept time \noff rather than monetary overtime pay by promising to promote an \nemployee. This is investigated in the same way that the Fair Labor \nStandards Act rules and regulations of today are handled on behalf of \nthe American workingman and in fairness to the management and \nownership.\n\n  Now I do not understand why the Democrats and labor unions are \nstanding in the way of bringing choice and flexibility to the American \nworkplace. If Democrats really cared about the\n\n[[Page S5409]]\n\nbest interests of American workers they would stop misleading the \npeople about this bill and pass it.\n  The Baucus-Kennedy substitute amendment does not help the American \nworker because it only provides comptime and does not contain the \nflextime biweekly work schedule of flexible credit hours. Flextime is \nvery important. It is important to everyone in the workplace but most \nimportant to women and non-overtime workers.\n  The combination, Mr. President, of comptime and flextime will benefit \n67 percent of all working women in the private sector. Whereas \ncomptime, by itself, will only benefit 4.5 percent of all working women \nin the private sector.\n  The Baucus-Kennedy bill wipes out flextime. Now, what could be more \nunfair than to penalize all but 4.5 percent of the working women in \nAmerica by restructuring a bill so narrowly that only 4.5 percent are \nbenefited? Under the broader bill with both flextime and comptime, 67 \npercent of those same working women would have an option to better \ntheir work schedule to help them with their daily lives and with their \nfamilies.\n  The Baucus-Kennedy substitute amendment limits accrued comptime to 80 \nhours a year, versus this bill's 240 hours. Doing the math, one can say \nthat the Republican bill is three times as flexible for the American \nworking people than the substitute being offered.\n  The Democrats, and for some reason the labor unions, falsely claim \nthat this bill will end the 40-hour workweek. This bill will allow \nemployees who want a variation of the 40-hour week to have one--\nvoluntarily and with no coercion. For those workers who want to keep \nthe standard schedule, they can. It is their option and their employers \noption. They do not have to change one bit. If they like the rigidity \nof 8-to-5 work with an hour off for lunch, then so be it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield 2 additional minutes to the Senator.\n  For those who want to keep the standard 40-hour workweek from the \nDepression, they can keep it that way. For those of us who are yearning \nto make the workplace more hospitable to our working people, for those \nof us who are concerned about family life and would like to have \nworkers have a little more family time, we urge the labor unions to \nchange sides on this.\n  I saw a couple of my friends from the labor unions outside in the \nhall and my first remark to them when I walked out was, ``Why are you \nagainst the working women?'' Of course, we had a lot of fun after that. \nBut actually that is the issue.\n  This bill will help women more than anything else, to provide them \nwith flexibility and no loss of pay. This flexibility can be used to \nmake their lives better in the event they need family time off to take \ncare of things other than work.\n  I believe the other side of the aisle needs to listen to what the \nAmerican worker wants: flexibility. Ninety-one percent of working \nmothers support flexible work schedules.\n  Now, frankly, there are many other reasons we could discuss here on \nthe floor. Until the public gets excited and worked up, and until women \nstart writing the labor unions and asking them: What are you doing to \nus? Why don't you keep yourselves out of this issue? and, Why are you \nagainst this? things won't change. Until there is enough foment in \nsociety for more flexibility in the workplace, then reform will not \noccur.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \na really precise and very focused presentation on the nature of the \nvolunteer provisions of this legislation and the safeguards that are \nbuilt into the legislation to assure that it is indeed a voluntary \nopportunity for workers and their employers.\n  Just a moment ago, before the Senator from New Mexico arrived, I read \nthis quote from Radcliffe Public Policy Institute, where this woman in \nher twenties says, ``But the more you are working, the less time you \nhave with your kids, so it's like you can't win.'' He makes a point \nthat we are going to need a public furor out there because this is \ngood, common sense. We are trying to make it so that this 20-year-old \nwoman, whoever she is, can be in the workplace and can win, and can \nmeet the needs and issues of her family. This article goes on to say \nthat XYZ company--they don't name the company--is trying to figure out \nhow to deal with this fact. You have this 30-year-old with two kids at \nhome, who is not going to give you 16 hours a day, as they did when \nthey were in their twenties. Yet, we still want to be globally \ncompetitive. I actually don't think we have a good answer. These \npeople, the ones who have opted to have kids and work less, are getting \nhurt in their reviews.\n  See, the current work rules just don't meet the current requirements, \nand you can't make it so that one shoe fits everybody. It just doesn't. \nThere are different pressures on the working mothers and fathers. That \nis why I have been so complimentary of the Senator from Missouri for \ncoming forward with the family friendly workplace.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I am glad to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I asked the Senator to yield for a question, which is, \nsome who are opposed to this have indicated that this is a pay cut. Is \nit your understanding that when a person takes time and a half off with \npay later instead of overtime pay, that that represents a pay cut? Or \nis that a way to have some time off the next week without taking a pay \ncut?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. As the Senator knows, there is nothing about this \nlegislation that represents, in any way, a detriment to the worker, as \nin a pay cut or any other function of their work. The only thing that \nhappens with the passage of this is that workers have more options and \nopportunities, and under no condition would it lead to a pay cut--none.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I wonder if the Senator from Georgia had the \nopportunity to see the USA Today lead editorial, which says, ``Harried \nWorkers Need Comp Time's Flexibility.'' I was kind of interested in the \nway they closed the editorial:\n\n       A choice between time off and overtime is an option that \n     can benefit employees and employers alike.\n\n  Their last words:\n\n       Those who stand in the way deserve a permanent vacation.\n\n  I recommend this editorial to the Senator.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I have not had a chance to read the editorial. But I \nsay to the Senator from Missouri that in many discussions with \nindividuals with whom I have not necessarily been philosophically \ntogether in the past, they think your legislation is correct--people of \nall persuasions. It is the kind of thing we ought to get into the \nworkplace. If the Senator will yield, you and I are, at the moment, \nfunctioning on the time that the good Senator from Ohio has come to \nuse. So if we might, I would like to yield up to 7 minutes to the \nSenator from Ohio, and then we might ask unanimous consent to get \nanother minute or two.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will be pleased to yield. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the USA Today editorial entitled ``Harried Workers Need Comp \nTime's Flexibility'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Harried Workers Need Comptime's Flexibility\n\n     Our View: But unions are blocking flexible work rules favored \n         by employees and employers alike\n       What works better for you? Pay for overtime or compensatory \n     time off instead?\n       Three quarters of workers say they want a choice. And they \n     should have it.\n       With workers spending an hour more on the job each week \n     than they did 15 years ago and 60% of women working, many \n     workers are stretched to their limits in meeting family \n     needs. A survey by the independent Families and Work \n     Institute found 40% of workers saying they don't have enough \n     time for family chores; another third lack time for personal \n     needs.\n       The problem has some businesses scrambling for answers. \n     Seven in 10 offer workers flexible starting and ending hours. \n     Many have added a personal day off. Some are experimenting \n     with ``free days'' that combine vacation, holiday and sick \n     leave.\n       And many say they would like to offer time off for \n     overtime. But they can't, at least not to the 60 million \n     full-time hourly employees who make up the bulk of the \n     private workforce.\n       Federal law bars the practice.\n\n[[Page S5410]]\n\n       The Fair Labor Standards Act mandates private hourly \n     workers be paid 1.5 times their hourly wage for each hour \n     over 40 worked in any seven-day period. No time off instead, \n     even if the employee wants it.\n       It's a ridiculous situation, made more ludicrous by \n     fumbling over the issue in Congress. Both parties claim they \n     want comptime, but labor union resistance is causing the \n     Democrats to stall.\n       Last week, the Senate couldn't agree even to allow a vote \n     on a comptime measure. The bill, similar to one already \n     passed by the House, would allow, but not require, employers \n     to offer employees 1.5 hours of paid time off for every hour \n     worked over 40 hours instead of paying overtime. Employees \n     could bank up to 240 comptime hours a year. They could use \n     them when they wanted as long as they provided reasonable \n     notice and doing so wouldn't cause undue disruption to the \n     business. Unused hours would be cashed at the end of the \n     year. Employees also could negotiate agreements with \n     employers for 80-hour, two-week schedules--45 hours one week, \n     35 the next, for example--without overtime.\n       Any finding that employers coerced employees would lead to \n     double pay, heavy fines and potential jail time.\n       Democrats say that's not good enough. They argue employers \n     will still coerce workers. But the real source of their \n     opposition lies elsewhere. Labor unions don't want comptime \n     except through negotiations with unions. And unions \n     contributed $30 million to Democratic campaigns last year.\n       Without labor opposition, most differences over comptime \n     could be solved.\n       A choice between time off and overtime is an option that \n     can benefit employees and employers alike. Those who stand in \n     the way deserve a permanent vacation.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia for his \neloquent statement and comments about the need for S. 4. I also thank \nmy friend and colleague from Missouri for the great work he has been \ndoing to bring not only to the attention of the Senate but to the \nAmerican people exactly what is at stake in regard to this bill.\n  Mr. President, I am proud, again, to be on the floor to speak in \nfavor of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. This bill is a truly \nnecessary and forward-looking response to the major changes that have \nalready taken place in the U.S. work force in the last few years.\n  Mr. President, today's working men and working women feel battered \nbetween the conflicting demands of work and family. They feel there has \nto be a better way. I think they are right.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are here to talk about on the floor today \nrepresents that better way--a better way for workers to balance the \nneeds of family and the needs of the workplace. This bill gives working \npeople the flexibility that they know would make a huge difference for \nthe better in their lives.\n  Mr. President, according to a survey conducted by the U.S. Department \nof Labor Women's Bureau, the top concern of working women is flexible \nscheduling in the workplace--flexible scheduling, which will allow them \nto balance their responsibilities at work with the needs of their \nchildren and the needs of their spouses. A stunning 66 percent of \nworking women with children reported that their primary concern was the \ndifficulty that they were having in balancing work and family.\n  According to another recent poll conducted, 88 percent of all workers \nwant more flexibility, either through scheduling flexibility or choice \nof compensatory time in lieu of traditional overtime pay. In that same \npoll, Mr. President, 75 percent--three-fourths--favored a change in the \nlaw that would permit hourly workers such a choice.\n  These poll results tally with what most of us know intuitively, what \nwe know from talking to our own constituents. As both the economy and \nAmerican family life grow more and more complex, the men and women in \nAmerica's work force want greater flexibility to be able to cope with \nall of these changes.\n  The legislation known as S. 4 would do that. It does not propose \ndoing something untried, something unheard of, something never used \nbefore. On the contrary, this is not revolutionary. We have a history \nof its use in the public sector, and we have a history of its use among \nemployers who are not hourly but are salaried employees. All this bill \ndoes is give workers and their employers in the private sector the same \nkind of workplace flexibility that their counterparts have had for \nyears in the public sector.\n  Mr. President, I don't think it is outrageous to say that workers in \nthe private sector should have the benefit of the same kind of \nflexibility Government workers have today. In fact, all it is is a fair \nshake. It is only equity and equality; it is only fairness.\n  Mr. President, American society has changed a great deal over the \nlast few decades. The stereotypical role of management and labor, male \nand female workers, simply does not exist anymore today. In 1938, when \nthe original underlying legislation was passed, less than 16 percent of \nmarried women worked outside of the home. Today, more than 60 percent \nof married women work outside of the home. And 75 percent of mothers \nwith school age children work outside the home today.\n  The world has gone around many times in those years and the world has \nchanged. The American society has changed. The squeeze on these \nworkers, between family and job, is so great that workers themselves \nbelieve that action is absolutely imperative. That is why we are trying \nto change the outdated Fair Labor Standards Act. Mr. President, this \nwould be a real, positive and necessary change for real American \nworking families.\n  A few weeks ago, I was on the floor and I talked about the Morris \nfamily, an Ohio family. Clayton Morris, a father and a husband, is a \npublic employee. That means he has the option of choosing compensatory \ntime over traditional monetary overtime pay. He is free to spend \nimportant extra time, because of this, with his 2\\1/2\\-year-old son, \nDomenic.\n  However, Clayton's wife Ann is a sales assistant for a Cleveland area \nbusiness form company. That means she can't take time off to be with \nDomenic in lieu of overtime pay. The Federal Government today prohibits \nher from doing that. Ann has said, ``He''--referring to husband \nClayton--``has the ability, if he works overtime, to store those hours. \nHe can use the stored comptime to be at home where he is needed. \nHowever, when I need to be able to leave work, I end up having to take \nsick time or vacation time to do the very same thing. It would be \nreally nice if I had a flexible schedule.''\n  Mr. President, American workers and their employers want and are \ndemanding this flexibility. Seemingly, countless studies and surveys \nhave pointed out, time and time again, Americans' overwhelming need, \ndesire, and support of a more flexible workplace schedule and the \nchanges the Family Friendly Workplace Act would provide.\n  Mr. President, if you look at a family like the Morrises, you can see \none major reason for the broad public support for this bill. People in \nthe private sector see their friends and family members who are in the \npublic sector; they see how much this type of flexibility helps them \nand helps their families. They see it and know it works.\n  Mr. President, I regret that thus far in the U.S. Senate, some \nMembers of the Senate have chosen to stand in the way of the perfectly \nlegitimate desire on the part of American workers and employers for a \ntruly flexible, family-friendly workplace.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nunder our control be extended by 10 minutes. We checked with the other \nside, and I believe they are in concurrence. This is so that the \nSenator might finish his remarks and appropriately not have to rush. \nThen we may be rejoined by the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. In conclusion, Mr. President, let me stress that it is \nnot too late for this Senate to work toward an intelligent bipartisan \nresolution of this issue.\n  I say to my friends: Let's put politics aside. Let's try to see how \nfar we can move toward giving America's workers what they want, what \nthey need, and what they deserve. This is one case where thus far the \nAmerican people are far ahead of this Congress--far ahead of this \nCongress in the very real sense that they know this law needs to be \nchanged. They know that we need to have this flexibility. They not only \nwant it. They are demanding it.\n  I am confident that in the days ahead and weeks ahead we will be able \nto bring about this change that the American workers--people who work \nby the hour, who are out there every day trying to make a difference, \nevery day who are trying to balance their family\n\n[[Page S5411]]\n\nobligations with their obligations in the workplace--need. They need \nthis type flexibility that S. 4 will give them.\n  I again commend my colleague from Georgia for the great work that he \nhas done on this bill, and my colleague from Missouri for bringing this \nmatter to the floor.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio. I hope \nthat the family that he alluded to in the term of his career will find \nthe relief we are so avidly pursuing here.\n  I have been reading--the Senator wasn't present through all of it--\nfrom the Radcliffe Public Policy Institute, the great article that \ntalks about the rigors and stress in the workplace. And it says, \n``Effects of Economic Changes on Families and Children.'' It is a short \narticle. I hope everybody gets a chance to read it.\n  It says that because mothers assume more of the caretaking \nresponsibilities for children, the elderly, and frail, the problems of \nintegrating work and family responsibilities can disproportionately \nimpact women, both professionally and personally, the very point that \nS. 4 is trying to correct, or at least help correct.\n  It says a major consequence of changes in the economy is that \ndependents do not spend as much time with the family members who are \nresponsible for their welfare.\n  I mentioned earlier. You can see it in all the data about family and \nchildren: school scores, the violence, the drugs, and a host of related \nproblems.\n\n       Relationships among all family members suffer, and in some \n     cases affect both family stability and workplace performance. \n     The total time parents spend with their children has \n     diminished by about one-third in the last 30 years.\n\n  In the face of that, the rules that govern the workplace have stayed \nvirtually static. Here we have a situation where children receive a \nthird less attention. Of course, SAT scores have plummeted, teenage \nviolence has soared, and the Congress has not stepped forward to \nmodernize that workplace.\n  I thank the Senator from Ohio. We have just been joined by the \nprimary author and sponsor of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. He has \ndone a remarkable job in explaining the necessity of this to America.\n  I am going to yield the remainder of my time, which is about 5 \nminutes, to the bill's primary sponsor, Senator Ashcroft of Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me take this moment to express my appreciation and give my thanks \nto the Senator from Georgia, the Senator from Ohio, the Senator from \nNew Mexico, the Senator from Wyoming, and others who have spoken \neloquently in behalf of American workers.\n  It is easy to say, Well, we are talking about a bill here, a bill \nbefore the U.S. Senate. But the truth of the matter is that we are \ntalking about people. We are taking about people and families. We are \ntalking about the fact that people in single-parent homes--obviously \n100 percent of the parents--have to be at work. And in multiple-parent \nhomes, two-parent families, the cost of doing business and taxes have \nreally literally driven the second parent into the workplace, and they \nneed to have time. People feel the financial stress, and they feel the \nfamily stress.\n  All that we really have offered by the administration is that we \nwould give people family and medical leave, which is a way to say that \nyou can have time off without pay if you need to spend time with your \nfamily. If you give people time off without pay, that increases the \nfinancial stress that they went to work to resolve.\n  I have found in my own family that every time I had to take a kid to \nthe doctor that was not when I needed less pay. That was when I needed \nmy full paycheck, because when you had those emergencies there is all \nof the little dollar costs of those emergencies.\n  So I really believe that this opportunity we present to let people \nsort of develop a bank of time off so that they can take time off with \npay later on is very important.\n  The comptime part of this bill--which is to say that, if you are \nasked to work overtime, you can say instead of having time-and-a-half-\ntime overtime pay I would like to have an hour and a half with pay off \nlater on for each hour that I work in overtime. Time off with pay \ninstead of just taking pay as time for the overtime is a way for people \nto meet these needs.\n  It only though goes to people who normally get overtime. What you \nreally find out is that of about close to 60 million workers who work \nby the hour in America only about a third of them ever get any overtime \nat all. Most companies say, ``Well, we just can't afford to be paying \n150 percent of our labor costs. So we don't provide for any overtime.''\n  So, if all we did was to address the comptime parts of the labor \nforce, which is the way you can get time and a half off for working an \nhour of overtime, time and a half off with pay, we would find ourselves \nlimited from a quarter to a third of the work force that we were \nhelping.\n  The last time I checked, whether or not your company does overtime, \nor whether or not you normally get overtime, your kid still gets sick, \nyour kids still get awards, your kids still go to soccer games, and \nthey still need their parents. But, if we just deal with the narrow \nquadrant of the culture that gets overtime, we are going to ignore two-\nthirds to three-quarters of the culture, and we really need to do more \nthan that.\n  It is important for us to then have what we provided for every \nFederal employee, and that is the option for flextime. Flextime is the \nway to schedule work in advance, to work an extra hour in one period so \nyou can take an hour off with pay in another period, or the most \npopular program for Federal workers. This started in the 1970's.\n  So there is not a big problem to work 45 hours 1 week in return for \nonly having worked 35 hours in the next week, and that really results \nin people taking every other Friday off. Since Friday is a working day, \nyou can do the motor vehicle license stuff, or you can go to the \ndoctors. It is the ability for people to spend time with their \nfamilies.\n  One other point needs to be mentioned, especially in light of the \nremarks of the Senator from New Mexico about serving working women. \nOvertime work in this country is concentrated among men. Hourly workers \nare just about split evenly between women and men. But overtime work is \n2-to-1 in favor of men. So for every woman that gets an overtime hour \nmen get two overtime hours.\n  So, if we are really going to try to relieve pressure on working \nwomen, we do less for women in this bill if we just do the comptime, \nand if we do not get to the flextime part of the bill.\n  I think it couldn't be said more clearly than in USA Today, the lead \neditorial, ``Harried workers need comptime flexibility but unions \nblocking flexible work rules are favored by employees and employers \nalike.''\n  That is the black letterhead line sort of stuff.\n  I already submitted this for the Record. It says those who stand in \nthe way deserve a permanent vacation. I don't know that we want to put \nthem on vacation but send them home.\n  The point is we really need to find ways to help workers. This is the \nway to help people have more time with their families without taking a \npay cut and to help people plan. The more pressing the responsibilities \nare the more valuable planning is.\n  It is against the law right now to plan with your employer to work an \nextra hour this week and take that hour off with pay next week. We \nshouldn't make it against the law for people to do reasonable things \nlike that. It is against the law right now for your employer to say, \n``Instead of paying you time and a half time off, I am giving you time \nand a half off with pay down the road.'' It is against the law.\n  The Government shouldn't be about the business of making reasonable \nagreements like that against the law.\n  The editors of USA Today have made it clear that they agree that this \nis something that needs to happen, and that labor unions and their \nlobbyists here in Washington shouldn't stand between the American \npeople in this capacity to serve their families.\n  It is with that in mind that we should continue to work toward the \nenactment of the Family Friendly Workplace Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5412]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This legislative \nproposal would prohibit any attempt to create a human being using \nsomatic cell nuclear transfer technology, the method that was used to \ncreate Dolly the sheep. This proposal will also provide for further \nreview of the ethical and scientific issues associated with the use of \nsomatic cell nuclear transfer in human beings.\n  Following the February report that a sheep had been successfully \ncloned using a new technique, I requested my National Bioethics \nAdvisory Commission to examine the ethical and legal implications of \napplying the same cloning technology to human beings. The Commission \nconcluded that at this time ``it is morally unacceptable for anyone in \nthe public or private sector, whether in a research or clinical \nsetting, to attempt to create a child using somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer cloning'' and recommended that Federal legislation be enacted \nto prohibit such activities. I agree with the Commission's conclusion \nand am transmitting this legislative proposal to implement its \nrecommendation.\n  Various forms of cloning technology have been used for decades \nresulting in important biomedical and agricultural advances. Genes, \ncells, tissues, and even whole plants and animals have been cloned to \ndevelop new therapies for treating such disorders as cancer, diabetes, \nand cystic fibrosis. Cloning technology also holds promise for \nproducing replacement skin, cartilage, or bone tissue for burn or \naccident victims, and nerve tissue to treat spinal cord injury. \nTherefore, nothing in the ``Cloning Prohibition Act of 1997'' restricts \nactivities in other areas of biomedical and agricultural research that \ninvolve: (1) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer or other cloning \ntechnologies to clone molecules, DNA, cells, and tissues; or (2) the \nuse of somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques to create animals.\n  The Commission recommended that such legislation provide for further \nreview of the state of somatic cell nuclear transfer technology and the \nethical and social issues attendant to its potential use to create \nhuman beings. My legislative proposal would implement this \nrecommendation and assign responsibility for the review, to be \ncompleted in the fifth year after passage of the legislation, to the \nNational Bioethics Advisory Commission.\n  I urge the Congress to give this legislation prompt and favorable \nconsideration.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe unified estate and gift tax credit to exempt farms and small \nbusinesses from estate taxes, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n     the American Farm Heritage and Small Business Preservation Act\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the American Farm \nHeritage and Small Business Preservation Act, and I am joined by the \nsenior Senator from North Carolina. The act excludes the first $1.5 \nmillion of estate and gift assets from taxation, and it carries an \neffective date of January 1, 1998.\n  The act will relieve the tax burden that befalls farmers and small \nbusinessmen upon the death of the proprietor. There is truth in the old \naxiom that farmers ``live like paupers and die like kings,'' and, in \nfact, the IRS reports that farmers face estate taxes six times more \noften than other Americans.\n  There are numerous estate and gift tax relief bills in the \ncongressional hopper. However, I favor a straightforward approach, and, \nrather than require some form of participation in the business \noperation for a fixed period of time--and thus permit the IRS to \nestablish nebulous and complicated regulations--the American Farm \nHeritage and Small Business Preservation Act proposes a simple $1.5 \nmillion exclusion for all estates.\n  The estate tax encourages the demise of the family farm and forces \nheirs to mortgage their agricultural heritage to the IRS. The estate \ntax is not a threat to just large farmers: some 20 percent of farms \nthat report annual sales over $50,000 will trigger inheritance taxes. \nIndeed, the nature of a farm operation--75 percent of farm assets are \nnonliquid--complicates the difficulties inherent in the payment of \nestate taxes for farm families, and the financial structure of a farm \nthus further contributes to this erosion of our agricultural heritage. \nThe average annual return on farm assets is just 4 percent, and the \naddition of mortgage obligations reduces the return to a mere 0.5 \npercent, so it is almost impossible for the next generation to continue \nto farm the family land.\n  As metropolitan areas continue to grow and encroach upon the farms \nthat sit outside these areas, the value of the farms increases, and it \ndrives up the estate tax burden. This pattern forces heirs to sell the \nfarmland to developers rather than continue their agricultural \nheritage. Further, the Agriculture Department estimates that 500,000 \nfarmers will retire over the next two decades. The failure of the \nCongress to reduce the impact of estate taxes thus threatens the \ncontinued operation of almost one-quarter of the farms in the United \nStates.\n  I am thus committed to estate tax relief for American families. The \nIRS is a tax collection agency, not a board of directors, and \nWashington does not deserve a windfall from every funeral.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Reid, \n        and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 850. A bill to amend the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, to make \nit unlawful for any stockyard owner, market agency, or dealer to \ntransfer or market nonambulatory livestock, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                The Downed Animal Protection Act of 1997\n\n   Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Downed \nAnimal Protection Act, a bill to eliminate inhumane and improper \ntreatment of downed animals at stockyards. Senators Smith, Reid, and \nTorricelli have joined me in sponsoring this bill. The legislation \nprohibits the sale or transfer of downed animals unless they have been \nhumanely euthanized.\n  Downed animals are severely distressed recumbent animals that are so \nsick they cannot rise or move on their own. Once an animal becomes \nimmobile and cannot stand, it must lie where it falls, often without \nreceiving basic assistance. Downed animals that survive the stockyard \nare slaughtered for human consumption.\n  These animals are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to handle \nhumanely. They have very demanding needs, and must be fed and watered \nindividually. The suffering of downed animals is so severe that the \nonly humane solution is immediate euthanasia.\n  Mr. President, the bill I have introduced requires that these \nhopelessly sick and injured animals be euthanized by humane methods \nthat rapidly and\n\n[[Page S5414]]\n\neffectively render animals insensitive to pain. Humane euthanasia of \ndowned animals will limit animal suffering and will encourage the \nlivestock industry to concentrate on improved management and handling \npractices to avoid this problem in the first place.\n  Downed animals comprise a tiny fraction, less than one-tenth of 1 \npercent, of animals at stockyards. Banning their sale or transfer would \ncause no economic hardship. The Downed Animal Protection Act will \nprompt stockyards to refuse crippled and distressed animals and will \nmake the prevention of downed animals a priority for the livestock \nindustry. The bill will reinforce the industry's commitment to humane \nhandling of animals.\n  The downed animal problem has been addressed by major livestock \norganizations such as the United Stockyards Corp., the Minnesota \nLivestock Marketing Association, the National Pork Producers Council, \nthe Colorado Cattlemen's Association, and the Independent Cattlemen's \nAssociation of Texas. All these organizations have taken strong stands \nagainst improper treatment of animals by adopting ``no-downer'' \npolicies. I want to commend these and other organizations, as well as \nresponsible and conscientious livestock producers throughout the \ncountry, for their efforts to end an appalling problem that erodes \nconsumer confidence.\n  Despite a strong consensus within industry, the animal welfare \nmovement, consumers, and Government that downed animals should not be \nsent to stockyards, this sad problem continues, causing animal \nsuffering and an erosion of confidence in the industry.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will complement industry efforts to \naddress this problem by encouraging better care of animals at farms and \nranches. Animals with impaired mobility will receive better treatment \nin order to prevent them from becoming incapacitated. The bill will \nremove the incentive for sending downed animals to stockyards in the \nhope of receiving some salvage value for the animals and would \nencourage greater care during loading and transport. The bill will also \ndiscourage improper breeding practices that account for most downed \nanimals.\n  My legislation would set a uniform national standard, thereby \nremoving any unfair advantages that might result from differing \nstandards throughout the industry. Furthermore, no additional \nbureaucracy will be needed as a consequence of my bill because \ninspectors of the Packers and Stockyards Administration regularly visit \nstockyards to enforce existing regulations. Thus, the additional \nregulatory burden on the agency and stockyard operators will be \ninsignificant.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Downed Animal Protection \nAct be printed in the Record. I urge all of my colleagues to join in \nsupporting this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 850\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish nationally uniform requirements regarding \nthe titling and registration of salvage, nonrepairable, and rebuilt \nvehicles; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n NATIONAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY, ANTI-THEFT, TITLE REFORM, AND CONSUMER \n                         PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I am here to talk to my colleagues \nabout used cars. No, not to sell you one, but more importantly, to \nprotect Americans who buy used cars. I am joined by my friend and \ncolleague Senator Ford in introducing legislation which will require \nthat the title of a vehicle, at the time of resale, indicate that it \nhas been significantly damaged. This bill is about safety. This bill is \nabout consumer protection.\n  We believe America's policy must protect used car consumers from \nunknowingly purchasing automobiles which have been totaled and rebuilt, \nbut sold as undamaged vehicles. Often these vehicles have serious \nsafety problems. We want you to join us in helping to protect the \npublic. In the last Congress, I worked with Senator Exon to advance \nsimilar legislation. We need to complete the job this Congress.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Transportation's automobile \nauction figures, the practice of selling rebuilt salvage vehicles as \nundamaged used cars costs consumers and the auto industry nearly $4 \nbillion annually. In some States, as many as 70 percent of all totaled \nvehicles may return to the roads after being purchased by unsuspecting \nbuyers. This is dangerous to everyone on America's highways.\n  While most States require some type of disclosure on the title \nindicating a vehicle's history, the requirements vary from State to \nState. Some rebuilders take advantage of these inconsistencies in State \ntitling procedures to obtain clean titles that bear no indication of \nprevious vehicle damage. Not only does this type of fraud affect the \nconsumer's wallet, it also threatens the consumer's safety.\n  Several years ago, Congress established a Federal task force to study \nthis issue. This consumer friendly bill stems from the recommendations \nof that task force.\n  Our bill requires that any vehicle with damage exceeding 75 percent \nof its preaccident value be designated as a salvage vehicle. If the \nsalvage vehicle is rebuilt and placed back on the road, the title to \nthe vehicle must be branded as a rebuilt salvage vehicle and it must \nhave an inspection to assure that stolen parts were not used in the \nrepair. In addition, all rebuilt salvage vehicles must have a decal \npermanently affixed to the driver's side door jamb indicating that the \nvehicle has been rebuilt. It will also specify whether the vehicle has \npassed an approved safety inspection.\n  Mr. President, the number of victims in the rebuilt salvage vehicle \nindustry is growing, and it must be stopped. We need to establish \npolicies to stop these illegal practices and protect American drivers. \nAlong with Mr. Ford, I urge you to join us as a cosponsor of this \ncommon sense legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 852\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Cuomo.\n  I am a cosponsor of separate legislation to reform HUD's multifamily \nhousing inventory, the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and \nAffordability Act of 1997 (S. 513). While the Senate and the \nadministration bills share the same objectives, some policy differences \nexist. Specifically, each bill takes a significantly different approach \nto the following key issues: project-basing versus tenant-basing; tax \nimplications of debt restructuring; and use of third parties to \nadminister the restructuring program.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and \nSecretary Cuomo to resolve HUD's multifamily housing crisis as \nexpeditiously as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Ford, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Hagel):\n\n[[Page S5418]]\n\n  S. 854. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na reduction in the capital gains tax for assets held more than 2 years, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  The Long-Term Investment Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I introduce, with Senators Ford, Hagel, and \nGraham a sliding-scale capital gains proposal, the Long-Term Investment \nAct of 1997. Given the sobering demographics associated with the \nimpending aging of the baby-boom generation, it is more important than \never that laws enacted by Congress promote long-term capital investment \nand savings by all Americans.\n  Central to this objective is a reduction in the current capital gains \ntax rate on long-term investments. A capital gains reduction was agreed \nto in principle in the budget agreement. We have a proposal that we \nbelieve embodies a fundamental change in tax policy at less cost. Over \nthe next 10 years, S. 2 will cost $129 billion, while Gregg/Ford will \ncost $45 billion.\n  We have developed a plan that would encourage long-term investments \nthrough a sliding-scale capital gains rate reduction. The plan would \nencourage individuals to hold assets over a number of years, allowing \nno reduction in the current rate on assets held for less than 1 year, \nwith increasingly larger deductions to a maximum 50 percent reduction \nfor investments held more than 8 years.\n  This sliding-scale plan encourages investments that will benefit \nlong-term savings and capital--such as providing for a child's \neducation or retirement income. The bill also rewards the small \nbusiness owner and entrepreneurs as it will allow for a significant \nreduction in capital gains taxation that benefits those individuals who \ninvest in the economy through the creation of small businesses and \njobs. By rewarding long-term investment in businesses and job creation \nand discouraging the quick fix that so often is associated with \nspeculation on Wall Street, we will be placing our Tax Code and job \nbase on a more solid ground.\n  The Gregg/Ford sliding-scale reduction on capital gains taxation \nhinges on balancing two important goals--the promotion of savings and \nlong-term investment through a significant capital gains cut, while \nalso recognizing our current fiscal restraints.\n  The recent budget agreement reached between the President and \nCongress calls for a net tax cut of $85 billion and a gross tax cut of \n$135 billion over 5 years. The details of how this tax package should \nbe put together will be worked out by the appropriate committees in the \nHouse of Representatives and the Senate.\n  The Clinton administration has indicated that it is for a capital \ngains rate reduction, but not in favor of a rate that dips below 20 \npercent. I believe that this bill is a consensus building bill that \nboth sides can and will agree upon in the not-too-distant future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 854\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, we are all familiar with the parameters of \nthe upcoming tax debate. The budget deal provides for $85 billion in \nnet tax cuts over 5 years, and $250 billion in net tax cuts over 10 \nyears.\n  Within those dollar limits, there's a strong desire to provide tax \ncuts in four areas: first, capital gains relief, second, estate tax \nrelief, third, a $500-per-child tax credit, and fourth, education tax \ninitiatives. But if you add up all the current proposals in each of \nthese areas, you go way over the $250 billion mark set by the budget \ndeal. Cheaper alternatives must be found.\n  I have had an interest for several years in providing capital gains \nrelief for family farmers and small family businesses where the parents \nwish to pass along to their children the operation of the farm or the \nbusiness.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Gregg and I each introduced capital gains \ntax reduction legislation which was based on a similar objective: The \nlonger you have held an asset, the lower your capital gains rate will \nbe. We call this the sliding scale capital gains tax reduction. Since \nthen, we have gotten together, and produced a product which we believe \ncombines the vest features of both of our bills. And we're introducing \nthat legislation today.\n  The Ford-Gregg approach is a bipartisan compromise that will allow \nthe tax cut package to move forward consistent with the budget deal.\n  The Ford-Gregg bill achieves the following objectives shared by all \ncapital gains cut advocates:\n  First, it cuts the capital gains rate in half for individuals; \nsecond, it does not discriminate among types of assets; and third, it \nkeeps things relatively simple.\n  In addition, the Ford-Gregg bill meets the following additional \nobjectives:\n  First, it costs less than half as much as the major capital gains \nproposals; second, it rewards long-term investment over short-term \nspeculation; and third, it's bipartisan.\n  Remember, the budget agreement calls for $250 billion in net tax cuts \nover 10 years. According to the Joint Tax Committee, the major capital \ngains proposal pending in the Senate (S. 2) would cost $129 billion \nover 10 years--eating up more than one-half of the net tax cut amount. \nOn the other hand, the Joint Tax Committee estimates that the Ford-\nGregg sliding scale proposal would cost only $45.2 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  This is a better approach. It is a bipartisan approach. It's better \npublic policy because it rewards long-term investment. It costs less \nthan half as much. And it will make life a whole lot easier for the tax \nwriting committees in the weeks ahead. And that is the message we will \nbe delivering as the final tax package is being written.\n                                                                    ____\n\n      By Mr. FAIRCLOTH (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Shelby, and Mr. \n        Hutchinson):\n  S. 855. A bill to provide for greater responsiveness by Federal \nagencies in contracts with the public, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                     the Responsive Government Act\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Responsive \nGovernment Act, and I am joined by the junior Senator from Nebraska, \nthe senior Senator from Alabama, and the junior Senator from Arkansas.\n  The Responsive Government Act proposes six simple, but important, \nreforms to make the Federal work force more responsive to the American \npeople and their concerns.\n  First, the Responsive Government Act will require all Federal \nagencies to include the telephone number of the writer on all official \ncorrespondence.\n  Too often, people receive letters from Federal agencies that have a \nreturn address, but no telephone number. In today's busy world, not \neveryone has time to write a letter to respond to the reams of mail \nfrom Federal bureaucrats.\n  Mr. President, there are few businesses that would send out a letter \nwithout a telephone number, and the Government should not be \nunaccountable to its customers.\n\n[[Page S5420]]\n\n  The act also requires Federal offices to provide a person--not an \nautomated computer system--to answer the main telephone number at \nservice-oriented offices.\n  The Federal Government is here to serve the taxpayers. These Federal \nagencies should not greet taxpayers with a voice-mail system to screen \ntheir calls.\n  Mr. President, the taxpayers are entitled to a voice on the other end \nof the line to assist them, not a machine that tells them to leave a \nmessage.\n  The Responsive Government Act also requires Federal agencies to \nanswer the telephones until 5 p.m. Too often, Mr. President, I hear \nconstituents tell me that they just can't get Federal agencies to pick \nup the phone after 4. This just is not right. The Federal Government is \ntoo large, and, unfortunately, that means that citizens are forced into \nfrequent contacts with Federal agencies. It should not be impossible to \nget in touch with Federal employees.\n  It should be as easy to get in touch with them as with businesses. \nThe Act also requires Federal agencies to publish their principal \ntelephone numbers in the local directories.\n  Of course, the blue pages list many Federal agencies, but not all of \nthem. This is an important distinction. We need complete disclosure, \nMr. President, and all agencies need to publish their numbers for the \nbenefit of the public.\n  These agencies also need to attempt to locate service-oriented \noffices in areas with sufficient parking.\n  Too often, new agency offices are located in areas with limited \npublic parking. There is often room for employee parking, but not for \nthe public, and that cannot continue.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the Responsive Government Act requires all \nFederal agencies to remove computer games from all Federal Government \ncomputers.\n  These computers are for work, not fun, and the taxpayers are footing \nthe bill for fun on the job.\n  The Federal Government spent close to $20 billion last year on \ncomputer equipment and support services. These systems increase \nproductivity in most cases.\n  However, many of these computers are delivered already equipped with \ngame programs, which reduce workers' efficiency and productivity.\n  This legislation will prohibit the Federal Government from purchasing \ncomputers with preloaded game programs.\n  These games, of course, decrease the productivity of Federal \nemployees.\n  In fact, a private-sector survey found that workers spent an average \nof 5.1 hours per week playing games and other non-job-related tasks on \ntheir computers. This translates into an annual $10 billion loss in \nproductivity.\n  Clearly, then, these games do not go unused.\n  In fact, many of these games now come equipped with a boss key.\n  This device lets the worker strike a single keystroke and transform \nthe computer screen from the game to a false spreadsheet. The sole \npurpose of this device is to hide unproductive behavior from \nsupervisors.\n  Mr. President, there is no reason for the Federal Government to buy \ncomputers with programs designed to divert employees' attention from \ntheir jobs.\n  This is a commonsense reform.\n  Governor George Allen of Virginia and former Labor Secretary Robert \nReich ordered workers to delete these game programs. I commend them for \ntheir actions.\n  I ran for the Senate in 1992 because I wanted to bring some common \nsense--and private-sector experience--to Washington.\n  I want to see a Federal Government that is responsive to the \ncitizens. This bill addresses practices that would ruin private-sector \nbusinesses.\n  There is no reason that Government should be less accountable to its \ncustomers.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Responsive \nGovernment Act. I am proud to be the principal cosponsor of this \nlegislation, and I commend my colleague from North Carolina, Senator \nFaircloth, for his leadership in introducing this bill.\n  This bill would make Government agencies more responsive to the \npeople who use their services. It is a narrow and targeted approach \nthat addresses several of the most common complaints that Americans \nhave about the service they receive from Government agencies.\n  This bill would make the Federal Government more user-friendly by \nrequiring all Federal agencies to:\n  Include the telephone number of the author on all official \ncorrespondence so citizens know whom to contact and how to reach that \nperson if there are questions;\n  Provide a person, not an automated system, to answer the main \ntelephone number at service-oriented Federal agencies so citizens do \nnot have to talk to a machine;\n  Ensure that telephones are answered until 5 p.m. so citizens can get \nassistance by phone during normal business hours;\n  Publish principal telephone numbers in the local directories so \ncitizens can readily find how to reach the agency;\n  Attempt to locate service-oriented offices in areas with sufficient \nparking so citizens can come and go easily when doing business; and\n  Remove computer games from all Federal Government computers so \nFederal employees are not distracted from their jobs.\n  Mr. President, I ran for the U.S. Senate because I believe we need \nless Government. I also believe that we must make our Government better \nand more efficient. Federal agencies must always--always--be as user-\nfriendly as possible for our citizens. Government agencies must always \ntreat taxpayers with courtesy and respect.\n  This bill is a small but important step toward creating a service-\noriented climate in the Federal Government. Americans deserve no less.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB:\n  S. 856. A bill to provide for the adjudication and payment of certain \nclaims against the Government of Iraq; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n                      THE IRAQI CLAIMS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, nearly 7 years ago President Bush invoked \nemergency economic sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait. \nFreezing Iraqi financial assets made sense at the time because it \nprevented Saddam Hussein from funding his war campaign. Now, we need to \ntake steps to unwind the sanctions regime to permit payment to United \nStates businesses who sold products to Iraq but have never been paid.\n  Four years ago this month I introduced legislation--S. 1119, the \nSecured Payment Act of 1993--with 13 bipartisan cosponsors achieving \nthat purpose. The bill clarified that certain moneys on deposit in \nUnited States banks belong to United States companies, not Iraq, and \ntherefore should not be subject to the Iraqi assets freeze. Amendment \nlanguage similar to S. 1119 was appended to the last State Department \nAuthorization bill following a rollcall vote in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and approved by the full Senate. Unfortunately, the language \nwas dropped in conference, leaving this matter unresolved.\n  The legislation I am introducing today represents a compromise on \ncreating a settlement process for private preinvasion claims. The Iraq \nClaims Act of 1997 I believe takes a progressive step forward in \ndisseminating the $1.2 billion in frozen assets.\n  First, it vests currently blocked assets in the President. Second, an \nIraq Claims Fund will be created by the Treasury Department where those \nassets will be deposited. Third, within 2 years of enactment of the \nlegislation, payment on private claims--certified by the Foreign Claims \nSettlement Commission--will be made out of the fund. Fourth, after \npayment has been made in full on all private claims, any funds \nremaining shall be made available to satisfy claims of the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  Mr. President, although much of the debate over my previous \nlegislation concerned the minutiae of letter of credit law, \ninternational business transactions, and economic emergency powers, the \nIraq Claims Act of 1997 lays aside those issues and establishes an \nequitable procedure for considering claims on a prioritized basis. \nWhile I understand that the administration is working on a proposal for \nsimilar legislation on Iraq claims, I would encourage the State and \nTreasury Departments to reevaluate their concerns\n\n[[Page S5421]]\n\nabout the approach I am proposing. I would submit that this legislation \nis the most suitable, and politically viable, compromise available to \ncome to closure on this issue.\n  Mr. President, these frozen assets were blocked to prevent Iraq from \nusing the funds to support its aggression against Kuwait and its \nallies. That freeze--designed to hurt Iraq--is now hurting American \ncompanies. Some of those firms were a mere electronic transfer, a \nkeystroke on a computer, away from receiving their payments when the \nemergency freeze was imposed. After 7 years, it is time to act \nexpeditiously in their favor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n  S. 858.

A bill to repeal the increase in tax on Social Security \nbenefits; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               THE SENIOR CITIZENS INCOME TAX RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am pleased to have my colleague, Senator \nPhil Gramm, join me as an original cosponsor of the Senior Citizens \nIncome Tax Relief Act. This legislation would give seniors relief from \nthe Clinton Social Security tax increase of 1993.\n  The recently passed Federal budget deal provides target levels for \nnew spending and for modest tax relief. As Congress begins to write the \nbills to implement this budget blueprint, attention turns to the \ndetails. One of them is whether there will be sufficient room for tax \nrelief for senior citizens.\n  Millions of America's senior citizens depend on Social Security as a \ncritical part of their retirement income. Having paid into the program \nthroughout their working lives, retirees count on the Government to \nmeet its obligations under the Social Security contract. For many, the \nsecurity provided by this supplemental pension plan is the difference \nbetween a happy and healthy retirement and one marked by uncertainty \nand apprehension, particularly for the vast majority of seniors on \nfixed incomes.\n  As part of his massive 1993 tax hike, President Clinton imposed a tax \nincrease on senior citizens, subjecting to taxation up to 85 percent of \nthe Social Security received by seniors with annual incomes of over \n$34,000 and couples with over $44,000 in annual income.\n  This represents a 70-percent increase in the marginal tax rate for \nthese seniors. Factor in the Government's Social Security earnings \nlimitation, and a senior's marginal tax rate can reach 88 percent--\ntwice the rate paid by millionaires.\n  An analysis of Government-provided figures on the 1993 Social \nSecurity tax increase finds that, by next year, America's seniors will \nhave paid an extra $25 billion because of this tax hike, including $380 \nmillion from senior citizens in Arizona alone.\n  Mr. President, I want to make an additional important point. Despite \nall the partisan demagoguery, the only attack on Social Security in \nrecent years has come from the administration and the other party in \nthe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Not one Republican \nsupported this tax increase on Social Security benefits.\n  At the Clinton administration's insistence, the amount of tax relief \nwe will be able to provide will be severely limited. It will be \ndifficult, then, to repeal the Social Security tax increase. This is \nwhy I offered an amendment to ensure that we are able to expand tax \nrelief in the future, and why the first tax relief proposal I am \nintroducing will repeal President Clinton's 1993 Social Security tax \nincrease.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 860. A bill to protect and improve rural health care, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n      the rural health care protection and improvement act of 1997\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural Health \nCare Protection and Improvement Act of 1997. This legislation is \ncritical to the survival of the fragile health care systems and \ninfrastructure in rural areas and small towns across America.\n  Rural Americans are more often poor, more often uninsured, and more \noften without access to health care than other Americans. The health \ncare system in many small towns in Iowa is on the critical list--we \nhave too few doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals and \nmany of our rural hospitals are barely making it.\n  Iowa ranks first in the percentage of citizens over age 85 and third \nnationally in the percentage of the population over age 65. Because of \nour demographics our health care providers in Iowa depend heavily on \nMedicare payments. And many of them are struggling. One reason they are \nstruggling is because of the gross inequities between rural and urban \nMedicare payment rates. In fact, the House Ways and Means Committee \nrecently published a report estimating that Iowa loses $0.7 billion a \nyear because of current Medicare payment policies. The higher cost of \nliving in areas such as New York City and Miami in no way justifies the \nhuge disparity in payment rates. The current system rewards waste and \ninefficiency and penalizes States like Iowa whose health care providers \npractice a conservative, cost-effective approach to health care.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would correct this wrong-\nheaded system. This bill would make Medicare payments to managed care \nplans fairer for rural areas by readjusting the AAPCC so that rates are \nmore equitable between rural and urban areas.\n  But even more importantly, this bill corrects the inequities in the \nregular fee-for-service Medicare Program. AAPCC rates are unfair \nbecause they are tied directly to Medicare fee-for-service payments, \nand fee-for-service payments are very low in rural areas.\n  Even with a correction in managed care payments, over two-thirds of \nIowa seniors will likely continue to receive care under the standard \nfee-for-service system. This bill corrects fee-for-service rates, so \nthat seniors in rural areas\n\n[[Page S5424]]\n\nwill at last be able to receive the quality and access to health care \nthey deserve.\n  Mr. President, my legislation would also reauthorize and extend the \nRural Health Transition Grant Program. This grant program helps small \nrural hospitals and their communities adapt to the changing health care \nmarketplace. Specifically, the grants help hospitals adjust to \nreductions in the need for inpatient services and increased demand for \noutpatient and emergency services and help rural hospitals meet the \nincreasingly difficult task of recruiting staff.\n  Rural hospitals use these funds for a variety of programs. For \nexample, Marengo Memorial Hospital, Mitchell County Hospital, Franklin \nGeneral in Hampton, and Kossuth County Hospital as well as other \nhospitals used funds to help develop rural health care networks. \nPochahontas Community Hospital and Community Memorial Hospital in \nSumner used funds to recruit health professionals and Holy Family \nHospital in Estherville used funds to improve emergency services.\n  These grants are provided over 3 years. They represent a small but \nvital source of revenue for hospitals struggling to adjust to a new \nhealth care environment. Unfortunately, these grants were not \nreauthorized last year, and there are many hospitals that were promised \ntransition grant funds but for whom the money is no longer available. \nThis legislation would help ensure that these few hospitals are able to \nfinish out their grants and meet the changing needs of their patients \nand communities.\n  Mr. President, the health care system is undergoing tremendous change \nand our rural hospitals must adjust to this new environment. The \nTransition Grant Program helps hospitals modify the type and extent of \nservices so they can better serve rural communities.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing will help improve \naccess and enhance the quality of health care in rural areas. And it \nwill help shore up the fragile health care infrastructure in our rural \ncommunities and small towns.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 861. A bill to amend the Federal Property and Administrative \nServices Act of 1949 to authorize donation of Federal law enforcement \ncanines that are no longer needed for official purposes to individuals \nwith experience handling canines in the performance of law enforcement \nduties; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n           donation of law enforcement dogs to their handlers\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \naddress the situation encountered when certain members of our Federal \nlaw enforcement community are no longer able to perform their assigned \nduties. These members of the Federal law enforcement community to which \nI refer are not people, but canines.\n  The purpose of this legislation is simple. The bill will streamline \nthe regulations that govern the adoption of Federal law enforcement \ncanines by their handlers. Currently, these animals are considered \nFederal property and when their tenure of service has ended, they are \nconsidered surplus Government property. Under current Federal \nregulations, Government agencies are forced to comply with procedures \nto ensure maximum return for the Government's investment in the animal \nat auction.\n  These animals have received special security training to best equip \nthem for the demands of their duties. Because of the hazards associated \nwith their duties, this specialized training often makes these animals \nunsuitable as pets for those not trained to handle these animals.\n  Because of the highly specialized training these animals receive, \nthey should not be simply auctioned to the highest bidder. Currently, \nif no trained handler comes forward and offers the highest bid for the \nanimal, the possibility exists that it will spend the rest of its life \ncaged, or even worse, destroyed.\n  Under this legislation, the eligible animals would be donated to \ntheir handlers, who would then assume all costs and responsibilities \nassociated to the care of that animal. This practice is commonplace for \nlocal law enforcement agencies nationwide.\n  This is not a drastic departure from previous Government procedure. \nIn 1993, the General Services Administration granted a waiver for \nBorder Patrol canine handlers to purchase their partners for a nominal \nfee. Unfortunately, this waiver has expired and has not been renewed.\n  Mr. President, this is a commonsense solution to a very simple \nproblem. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and ease the \nrestrictions concerning the adoption of Federal law enforcement \ncanines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

She was personally involved in educating \nchildren and helping people with disabilities help themselves. She \nbrought joy to the lives of everyone she touched during her two summers \nwhen she worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the park. The \nElm Brook Park was special to her, and she helped the many staff \nmembers make it much more accessible to persons with disabilities.\n  Nancy, a 1993 graduate from the University of New Hampshire, was \nmurdered by native tribesmen in Madagascar on April 9, 1996, after \nserving almost 2 years as a volunteer member working in a parks and \nwildlife program for the U.S. Peace Corps. She had lived in a mud hut \nteaching the 300 villagers how to grow vegetables, and building a \nschool, hospital, and roads in the island country off the east coast of \nAfrica.\n  More than 140,00 Americans have served in the Peace Crops since it \nwas founded in 1961. Tragically 15 have been killed, in all corners of \nthe world while promoting the spirt of voluntarism.\n  Mr. President, Nancy truly exemplified the spirt of voluntarism. I \njoin with her family and friends, in expressing hope that the \ndedication of a memorial to honor her will inspire that spirit in \nothers, and bring attention to the remarkable service of all public \nservice volunteers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5426-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORY OF NANCY JEAN COUTU\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today in memory of Nancy Jean \nCoutu, a Peace Corps volunteer who was murdered by native tribesmen on \nApril 9, 1996, while serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Madagascar.\n  Nancy was a young woman whose life was dedicated to helping others. \nShe was born and raised in New Hampshire and attended the University of \nNew Hampshire. She was full of joy and giving and her desire to help \nothers is what brought her to join the Peace Corps in 1994. She spent \nalmost 2 years living in the village of Baraketa where she helped the \nvillagers build a school and rebuild a small hospital. She also pursued \nher interest in the environment by studying the local ecology. Her \ntragic death was a shock to everyone who knew and loved her, including \nthe people of Madagascar whose government posthumously awarded her a \nknighthood for her work in their country.\n  Nancy's family and friends have chosen to honor her memory by \ncreating a memorial to her on a beautiful maple-shaded knoll in Elm \nBrook Park in West Hopkinton, NH. During the summers of 1992 and 1993, \nwhile a student at the University of New Hampshire, Nancy worked as a \npark ranger at Elm Brook. There she spent many hours working to expand \nher knowledge and interest in the environment and to share her love of \nnature with visitors to the park. On Sunday, June 15, 1997, the \nmemorial, with its large granite stone and plaque, and an oil painting \nof Nancy done by her mother, will be dedicated. In addition, because \nshe was particularly interested in helping the handicapped to enjoy the \nmany experiences offered by the outdoors, the park's wheelchair \naccessible elevated wildlife viewing observation deck, fishing \nplatform, and nature trail will also be dedicated to Nancy.\n  Nancy Coutu set a shining example of what can be accomplished through \npublic service and voluntarism and I would like to join with her \nfamily, friends, and all those whose lives she touched with her love, \nin commending her for her courage and willingness to give of herself in \norder to make life better for others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5426-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5426-S5427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ON ALAN EMORY'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY WITH THE WATERTOWN DAILY TIMES\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Watertown Daily Times' \nWashington Bureau Chief Alan Emory marked a most felicitous occasion on \nSaturday. Alan has served the Watertown Daily Times and the people of \nNew York State for a half a century. My colleague Senator D'Amato and I \ncall him ``the Dean'' of the New York correspondents in our Nation's \ncapital and, indeed, he is one of the Nation's most sagacious and \nindefatigable journalists.\n  His capacity for balanced reporting was grounded in his upbringing. \nHis father was a Democratic New York State Supreme Court judge, his \nmother a labor arbitrator for the Republican mayor of New York, \nFiorello LaGuardia. After Emory's childhood in New York City and Long \nIsland and a fine education at Exeter, Harvard, and the Columbia School \nof Journalism, the young man headed north to seek his fortune. He \nlanded a job at the Watertown Times in 1947 as its correspondent in \nMassena, a small city along the St. Lawrence Seaway. He steadily rose \nup the ranks to State editor, legislative correspondent, and editorial \nwriter.\n  In 1951, the newspaper opened a Washington bureau. He eagerly \naccepted the Johnson family's offer to become the bureau chief and has \nserved the people of New York State in Washington ever since--46 years, \na term almost twice as long as that of our State's longest serving \nSenator, Jacob Javits, who served for 24 years.\n  Mr. Emory is one of the most prolific daily journalists in \nWashington. He writes up to six stories per day and two columns per \nweek for the Sunday Commentary section. He also is the Washington \ncolumnist for the monthly magazine, The Empire State Report. He does \nall this with a standard of accuracy and insight that few can match. \nWhile the Washington Post in 1977 described Mr. Emory as being one of a \nvanishing breed of Washington correspondents for regional newspapers, \nhe remains an example of journalistic excellence to young reporters.\n  Mr. Emory has written more than just news stories. He also is one of \nthe most gelastic lyricists ever to grace the Gridiron Club's talent \npool. He has written music for Washington's most prestigious \njournalists' club ever since he joined it 21 years ago, and he produced \nmany of its most amusing skits. He has also served the Gridiron Club in\n\n[[Page S5427]]\n\nmore serious ways--as its vice president for 1994, president for 1995, \nand current treasurer.\n  Legislators and journalists are supposed to keep a healthy distance \nbetween them but I confess to a great personal affection for my old \nfriend, Alan Emory. I congratulate him and his beloved wife, Nancy, as \nhe celebrates 50 fine years with the Watertown Daily Times.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5426-5", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NEW MEXICO SMALL BUSINESS AWARD WINNERS\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to honor New Mexico's \nsmall business-owners and advocates which were recently selected by the \nU.S. Small Business Administration to receive recognition for their \nefforts to improve business opportunities in New Mexico.\n  I not only want to recognize these individuals for their fine work \nbut also to take a moment and highlight how important small businesses \nare to the State of New Mexico. Comprising over 96 percent of all \nbusinesses in my home State, small businesses are responsible for \nemploying over 115,000 people and creating billions of dollars in \nrevenue for our economy. Not only do small businesses serve as the \nbackbone to New Mexico's economy, but they also serve as the foundation \nto our local communities. Small businessowners not only create \nthousands of good paying jobs in my State but also serve as an \nexcellent example for young entrepreneurs who are chasing the American \ndream of owning their own business.\n  Mr. President, there could have been no better choice for the SBA's \ntop award than the family-owned business of Elite Laundry Co. in \nGallup, NM. Mary Jean and Andrew Christiansen have worked with their \nchildren to build their business for the past 30 years and I cannot \ntell you how proud I am they are being recognized as the SBA's New \nMexico Small Business Persons of the Year.\n  The Christiansens have been an asset to me as I work to better serve \nNew Mexico small businesses in the U.S. Senate. The Christiansens have \nbuilt up Elite Laundry Company to employ 70 employees in a region of \nNew Mexico which has one of this Nation's highest poverty rates. They \nhave actively participated in my Small Business Advocacy Council and \nhave testified on behalf of New Mexico businesses to the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee. The Christiansen family can be proud of their \nefforts in small business and I congratulate them for receiving this \naward.\n  Mr. President, small businessowners and entrepreneurs in New Mexico \ncan also count on receiving the most up-to-date and insightful business \ninformation from Michael G. Murphy, the assistant business editor for \nthe Albuquerque Journal. The SBA has chosen this former editor of the \nNew Mexico Business Times as this year's New Mexico and Region VI \nAdvocate of the Year. Mr. Murphy understands the importance of keeping \nsmall business-owners informed of the issues, and has worked tirelessly \nto provide the tools they need to survive. I know I speak on behalf of \nall of New Mexico's small businesses when I congratulate Mr. Murphy on \nreceiving this award.\n  The New Mexico Women in Business Advocate of the Year is Jennifer A. \nCraig, regional manager of the Women's Economic Self Sufficiency Team \nOffice in Las Cruces. I have worked very closely with WESST Corp. to \nbuild a better environment for New Mexico's women business-owners and \nentrepreneurs. I believe it is only fitting that the SBA highlights the \ntremendous success story being played out in Las Cruces. This city has \none of the highest unemployment rates in the State, yet over the last 2 \nyears, WESST Corp has provided technical and business assistance to \nover 250 women entrepreneurs and has helped create 50 new women-owned \nbusinesses. I congratulate not only Jennifer Craig for being recognized \nfor her hard work, but also WESST Corp. for attracting a person of her \ncaliber to manage the southern regional office.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to honor Teresa O. Molina, winner of \nthe 1997 Financial Services Advocate Award for New Mexico. Mrs. Molina \nis a New Mexico native who attended Deming High School and graduated \nfrom New Mexico State University. She has worked with small business \nfor over 14 years helping obtain loans at the First New Mexico Bank in \nDeming. Currently serving as the bank's vice president, Mrs. Molina has \nbeen involved with SBA lending programs since she issued the first ever \nSBA 504 loan in New Mexico's history. Mrs. Molina works hard to meet \nthe banking needs of her community and I congratulate her for her \nsuccess.\n  Mr. President, as you are aware, this Nation is a melting pot of \npeople with diverse ethic and social backgrounds. In New Mexico, we \nhave hundreds of small and large minority owned and operated \nbusinesses. One person that I have always turned to for advice not only \non minority business issues but general economic and business issues is \nAnna Muller, the proprietor of NEDA Business Consultants in \nAlbuquerque.\n  Anna is a member of my Minority Small Business Advocacy Council and \nhas gained the respect and admiration of her peers when it comes to \nminority business issues. She has been chosen as the SBA's Minority \nSmall Business Advocate for New Mexico, and I am hard pressed to think \nof anyone who better deserves recognition for her services to minority \nsmall businesses. Anna Muller is a true leader on minority business \nissues not only in the State of New Mexico, but the entire nation and I \ncongratulate her on this award.\n\n  I would also like to congratulate the SBA 1997 Prime Contractor of \nthe Year for Region VI, Armando De La Paz, president and CEO of Vista \nTechnologies, Inc., of Albuquerque. Mr. De La Paz founded his company \non the notion that hard work and determination are the foundation for \ndeveloping a successful business. Mr. De La Paz's company has provided \nhigh-technology solutions to the Federal Government for the last 8 \nyears and has been recognized as one of the fastest growing Hispanic \nbusiness firms in the Nation for the period of 1993 to 1996.\n  I would like to recognize Mr. Dennis A. Reasner, president of Darco \nProducts, Inc., for being selected as the SBA Region VI Subcontractor \nof the Year for 1997. I recently had the opportunity to meet Mr. and \nMrs. Reasner here in Washington and can tell you that they are truly \none of the best examples of American entrepreneurship in action. \nStarting out of their garage, Dennis and Enid Reasner have worked for \nthe past 25 years to develop a company worth millions of dollars which \ncurrently employs over 30 employees in Albuquerque, NM. Darco Products \nis a company we can all be proud of in New Mexico, for not only has a \nDarco product been used in the space shuttle, but the firm also \nproduced a component part for the first ever American space station.\n  Mr. President, New Mexico is witnessing an explosion in the growth of \nour exports and I believe it is important to recognize those who have \nhelped bring about this change. One woman active in this area for New \nMexico is Kimberly de Castro, owner of Wildflower International Ltd., a \nSanta Fe based export company. De Castro's business provides essential \nservices to foreign buyers by researching various foreign markets and \nproviding her clients with options they need to survive in a foreign \nmarketplace. Wildflower International Ltd. exports to China, Egypt, \nIsrael, and Italy, and is currently negotiating with sales in Taiwan \nand other Asian countries. Kimberly de Castro is clearly one of the \npeople responsible for New Mexico's phenomenal growth in foreign trade, \nand I congratulate her for receiving the 1997 Exporter of the Year \nAward from the SBA.\n  In closing, I would like to point out that these people deserve \npraise and recognition for striving to build a better New Mexico for \nour future generations. I personally extend my gratitude to these \nwinners, and to others involved with small businesses in New Mexico. I \nam proud to stand here and recognize these hard-working individuals for \ncreating new jobs and economic opportunities for the people of New \nMexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5427-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5427-S5428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO ANDREW R. RUDMAN ON BEING NAMED THE GRANITE STATE'S \n            REPRESENTATIVE AT YMCA YOUTH GOVERNOR CONFERENCE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate\n\n[[Page S5428]]\n\nAndrew R. Rudman, the New Hampshire Youth Governor for the 1997 \nNational YMCA Youth Governor's Conference. Andrew was elected by fellow \nhigh school students from across the Granite State's various youth and \ngovernment programs as the State's Youth Governor. Andrew will attend a \nconference in Washington, DC, on June 18, 1997.\n  Every year since 1964, Members of the Senate have hosted these \nremarkable student leaders. The youth governors who will be visiting \nour Nation's capitol collectively represent over 25,000 of their peers. \nThis select group of students will experience government service first-\nhand during the conference.\n  Andrew is from Londonderry, NH, and in addition to an excellent \nacademic record he finds time to participate in many different \nextracurricular activities. He is a member of the track and field team, \nloves music, and is teaching himself how to play the guitar. Andrew \nwill attend Columbia University in the fall of 1997.\n  As a former high school teacher myself, I commend Andrew for his hard \nwork and outstanding achievements, and wish him success in his academic \ncareer. Congratulations to Andrew on this distinguished honor. It is an \nhonor to represent this outstanding young leader in the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5427-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN HONOR OF ROGER G. KENNEDY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. I wish to pay tribute to Roger G. Kennedy upon \nhis retirement as director of the National Park Service and for a \ndistinguished public service career as director of the Smithsonian \nNational Museum of American History, vice president of the Ford \nFoundation, and special assistant, variously, to the U.S. Attorney \nGeneral, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the \nSecretary of Labor. Mr. Kennedy will be honored at a grand celebration \nin New York's historic Battery Park tonight and I deeply regret that \nthe press of Senate business prevents me from attending.\n  Roger Kennedy is a man of enlightenment tastes. He has been a lawyer, \na scholar, a writer, a public servant of the first rank, but his \navocation has always been architectural history. In Orders From France, \nhis masterpiece on architecture, Kennedy wrote brilliantly about the \ncareer of Joseph Jacques Ramee, the French architect who was trained at \nthe court of Louis XVI and designed buildings all over Europe, but \nhelped pave the way for American neoclassicism.\n  In 1815, Ramee designed the magnificent campus of Union College in \nSchenectady, N.Y., one of the Nation's first liberal-arts colleges west \nof the Hudson River. Ramee's campus plan embodied a vision of education \nthat entwined rationalism with the laws of nature--an ordered court \nopening to a romantically landscaped garden and the endless view to the \nwest. Kennedy wrote that Ramee ``placed his buildings in the context of \nnature, but nature tamed, organized, made orderly, like the energies of \nstudents.'' A decade later the Union College campus, the first in the \nNation to have a rotunda at its center, become the model for Thomas \nJefferson and Benjamin Latrobe to design the glorious University of \nVirginia in Charlottesville.\n  Given Roger Kennedy's interest in Ramee, a man with both an \narchitectural and educational vision, it is most fitting that we should \nhonor him at Battery Park, the site of the Castle Clinton National \nMonument, one of the National Park Service's most important historical, \ncultural, and educational sites. The park is visited by over 3 million \npeople a year who come to marvel at its spectacular views of New York's \nharbor, the Statue of Liberty, and Ellis Island, and drink of its rich \nhistory.\n  For Battery Park's history fascinates. Fort Amsterdam was built by \nthe Dutch on the site in 1626 and surrendered to the British in 1664, \nand subsequently renamed Fort George. In 1783, the British colors at \nFort George were hauled down, marking the beginning of American rule. \nFort George was subsequently demolished, its rubble added to the \nManhattan shoreline. By 1811, a sturdy red sandstone fort--later named \nCastle Clinton--was erected.\n  Castle Clinton served as everything but a military facility. It was \nfirst an entertainment center for concerts and theater. P.T. Barnum \nstaged the American debut of Jenny Lind--the ``Swedish Nightingale''--\nthere in 1850. It then served as an immigration processing center, \nwelcoming over 8 million immigrants from 1855 to 1889, prior to the \nopening of Ellis Island. In 1896, Castle Clinton reopened again as the \nfirst American aquarium, designed by the distinguished architectural \nfirm of McKim, Mead & White. Castle Clinton and its aquarium were then \npartially dismantled in the 1940's, costing New York one of its most \ntreasured venues for cultural and educational enrichment.\n  In 1946, Congress established the Castle Clinton National Monument to \nbe administered by the National Park Service. In 1991, I incorporated \ninto the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act an \nauthorization of $2 million for the reconstruction of the Battery's \nseawall and promenade. I hoped those funds would serve as a catalyst to \nbegin redeveloping Battery Park and implementing a master plan to \naddress the Battery's needs for the 21st century. With his commitment \nto history and ``teaching the public through place,'' Roger Kennedy has \nhelped spur that plan, working closely with the Conservancy for \nHistoric Battery Park and its energetic and dedicated president, Warrie \nPrice.\n  I know that through his books, documentaries, and dedication to \nprojects such as Battery Park, my friend Roger Kennedy shall continue \nto educate, inspire, and delight future students of American history, \nculture, and architecture. I wish him well at his gala tonight and for \nall the many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5428-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5428-S5429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO THE TOWN OF CHARLESTOWN, NH, AS THEY CELEBRATE THE 250TH \n              ANNIVERSARY OF THE 3-DAY SIEGE ON FORT NO. 4\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the town of Charlestown, NH, as they celebrate the 250th \nanniversary of the 3-day siege on the fort at township No. 4. The \nresidents of this Connecticut River community will begin celebrating \nthis historic occasion July 25 and continue with a number of \nfestivities including a battle reenactment, blueberry festival, parade, \nand several church suppers.\n  Two hundred fifty years ago, the Connecticut River Valley had only a \nfew settlers scattered along the banks of the river. Township No. 4 \nwould eventually become Charlestown, NH, the northwestern-most English-\nspeaking village in New England. The settlers of this agricultural \ncommunity were isolated, but still a vital link with towns to the south \nas they strove to build a strong community on the river banks. To the \nwest and north of the settlement lay only lush mountains and forests, \ninhabited by moose, bears, native Americans, and a few French trappers.\n  The people of Township No. 4 were trapped in a hostile environment \nwhen King George's war began. The pioneers decided to defend themselves \nby connecting the five existing houses together, and later added a \nsixth. The inhabitants of the fort at No. 4, which included a small \nmilitia of 30 volunteers, fought day and night to protect their homes \nand refused to surrender to an enemy force claiming to be 700 strong. \nDuring the 3-day siege their defenses were never breached.\n  Two hundred fifty years later, an authentic reconstruction of the \noriginal 1744 fortified settlement sits on the site of the Siege of \n'47. The fort at No. 4 is one of the only living history museums in New \nEngland dedicated to preserving the 1740's and 1750's. The museum \ncaptures the spirit of those pioneers who cleared the rough landscape \nand made way for homes and farms in northern New England. The residents \nof Charlestown have kept a piece of history for all of the children of \nNew Hampshire and the Nation to see, capturing the rich significance of \nthe settlements along the Connecticut River Valley.\n  Charlestown's residents today serve to better their community in the \ntrue New Hampshire spirit. They serve in professional, \nsemiprofessional, and service occupations and are still willing to \ndedicate their time and talents on behalf of their neighbors.\n  I congratulate all of the residents of Charlestown, NH, on this \nhistoric event as they continue in the tradition of\n\n[[Page S5429]]\n\ntheir ancestors to make the lives of their community a better place to \nlive. I am honored to represent all of them in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5428-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. DAVID ABSHIRE\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrecognize today a fellow Tennessean, Dr. David Abshire, who last month \nreceived the Distinguished Graduate Award before the Corps of 4,000 \nCadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.\n  Dr. Abshire has a long and distinguished record of service to \nAmerica. Not only has he served as an Army officer, an Assistant \nSecretary of State, our Ambassador to NATO, and as a special counselor \nto the President, but he also played an integral role in founding and \nbuilding the Center for Strategic and International Studies [CSIS].\n  Mr. President, in addition to recognizing Dr. Abshire's impressive \nlist of past accomplishments, I am particularly appreciative of the \nwork he and the staff at CSIS are doing. Recently, Dr. Abshire and the \nCSIS staff have developed an innovative approach to working with \nindividual States, counties, and cities in order to maximize the \nbenefits of job creation, investment, exports, and economic growth \nstemming from a more global economy. I am gratified that Dr. Abshire \nhas chosen Tennessee as the State in which to begin this effort. His \nwork with Governor Sundquist and my office is greatly appreciated.\n  I applaud Dr. Abshire for his dedicated service to America and \nTennessee, and on his recent recognition at West Point. I ask to have \nprinted in the Record the full West Point citation on this outstanding \nsoldier, scholar, diplomat, and institution builder.\n  The citation follows:\n\n\n                            david m. abshire\n\n       Throughout his forth-six years of national service, \n     institution building, and extraordinary scholarship. David M. \n     Abshire has exemplified outstanding devotion to the \n     principles expressed in the motto of the United States \n     Military Academy: Duty, Honor Country.\n       Dr. Abshire began a lifetime of public service upon his \n     graduation from West Point in 1951. After infantry branch \n     training, he was assigned to Korea, where serving in combat \n     as a front line infantry platoon leader and company \n     commander, he was cited for valor.\n       In 1955, he left the Army to enroll in the graduate program \n     at Georgetown University from which he received a Ph.D., with \n     honors, in History in 1959.\n       He then joined the staff of the House Minority Leader and \n     subsequently became Director for Special Projects at the \n     American Enterprise Institute in 1961. While there, he \n     conceived the idea and, together with Admiral Arleigh Burke, \n     organized the founding of the Center for Strategic and \n     International Studies. Since its inception, Dr. Abshire has \n     been the principal architect and institution builder of what \n     has become widely recognized as a world leading public policy \n     institution. Over the years, he was has recruited world \n     statesmen and strategists to the Center's ranks, and has \n     involved a wide range of Members of Congress and corporate \n     leaders, in working groups to solve national and \n     international problems.\n       Throughout his tenure as President, the Center produced \n     incisive studies that have been instrumental in formulating \n     national public policy. An early study was pivotal in the \n     drafting and passage of the Goldwater Nichols Act. In 1992, \n     the Center produced the report of the 58-person Nunn/Domenici \n     Commission on Strengthening of America. In March of 1997, the \n     Center published a definitive study of Professional Military \n     Education, providing much needed scholarly rationale \n     supporting the military educational system and, in \n     particular, validating the roles of West Point and the other \n     Service Academies as the linchpins of that system.\n       As a public policy practitioner, Dr. Abshire has held a \n     series of high-level Presidential appointments.\n       He served as Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional \n     Relations from 1970 to 1973 and played a pivotal role in \n     maintaining bipartisan Congressional coalitions that \n     sustained the U.S. military effort in Vietnam. He negotiated \n     the compromise to the Cooper-Church Amendment that otherwise \n     would have seriously restricted military operations in \n     Southeast Asia. He also developed the Congressional \n     compromise that insured the survival of Radio Liberty and \n     Radio-Free Europe under a public board, in the face of an \n     attempt to cut off CIA funding and let the Radios die. These \n     stations thus continued to play a key role in the Cold War \n     battle to open East European and Russian society\n       President Ford, in 1974, appointed him as the first \n     chairman of the U.S. Board for international Broadcasting. As \n     President Carter later wrote:\n       ``You have rendered a distinguished service in getting the \n     Board solidly established as sponsor of Radio Free Europe and \n     Radio Liberty and in representing these important \n     institutions to the Congress and the American public. . . .''\n       In 1974, President Gerald Ford also appointed Dr. Abshire \n     to the Congressional Commission on the Organization of the \n     Government for the Conduct of Foreign Policy.\n       In 1980, Dr. Abshire was asked by President-elect Ronald \n     Reagan to chair the transition of administrations in the CIA, \n     State and Defense Departments. Subsequently, he was asked to \n     serve on the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. \n     In 1983, he was appointed U.S. Ambassador to NATO. As \n     Ambassador, Dr. Abshire was the point man all NATO for \n     building allied support for the deployment of the U.S. \n     Pershing II missiles in Europe to counter the threat of \n     Soviet nuclear blackmail\n       In awarding Ambassador Abshire the Department of Defense \n     Medal for Distinguished Public Service, Secretary Weinberger \n     said:\n       ``Throughout a period of great flux in inter-allied and \n     East-West relations, he was the source of an astonishing flow \n     of imaginative and resourceful ideas geared to the resolution \n     of difficult alliance issues.\n       ``Ambassador Abshire's cogent and innovative proposals for \n     enhancing NATO arms cooperation have already transformed that \n     crucial area of alliance activities. Ever mindful of the \n     central importance of parliamentary and public opinion, he \n     worked tirelessly to build an effective and lasting \n     partnership with Congress. . . .''\n       In 1987, Dr. Abshire was personally asked by President \n     Reagan to serve as Special Counselor to the President with \n     Cabinet rank for the purpose of organizing White House and \n     departmental responses to the Iran Contra investigations to \n     insure that there was no cover up. After much previous \n     criticism, the integrity of his effort earned Dr. Abshire \n     bipartisan credit for restoring the credibility in the \n     Administration at a difficult time for the Presidency.\n       As a private citizen, he has served as a member of the \n     Board of Directors of Procter & Gamble and the Ogden \n     Corporation, and on the Advisory Board of BP America.\n       In the realm of scholarship, he has written five books and \n     edited three others on a wide range of domestic and \n     international issues. He has been a strong promoter in his \n     writings and at CSIS of the study of strategy and history.\n       Dr. Abshire is a Trustee of Baylor School (Chattanoga, \n     Tennessee). He is also co-founder of the Trinity National \n     Leadership Roundtable in Washington, a former Vice-Chairman \n     of Youth for Understanding, and a board member of the Army \n     War College Foundation.\n       He has been decorated by the chiefs of state of Belgium, \n     Italy, Finland, Korea, and the United States.\n       Soldier, institution builder, public servant, author, \n     scholar, diplomat and counselor to Presidents, Dr. Abshire \n     was rendered a lifetime of extraordinary service to his \n     country and to the international community of freedom loving \n     nations.\n       Accordingly, the Association of Graduates takes great pride \n     in presenting the 1997 Distinguished Graduate Award to David \n     M. Abshire, Class of 1951.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5429-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5429-S5430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE MANDATES INFORMATION ACT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord an editorial by C. Wayne Crews of the Competitive Enterprise \nInstitute. The editorial, which appeared in the Journal of Commerce, \nexplains how the Mandates Information Act will improve the quality of \nCongress's deliberation on proposed unfunded mandates on the private \nsector.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n              [From the Journal of Commerce, June 2, 1997]\n\n                        Passing the Budget Buck\n\n                      (By Clyde Wayne Crews, Jr.)\n\n       Weary of the federal government's habit of enacting popular \n     environmental and other reforms but imposing all their costs \n     on state and localities, governors and local officials \n     revolted in 1995.\n       They rightly charged that for every dollar spent on federal \n     priorities, they lost the ability to control and allocate \n     their own budgets. That outcry resulted in the 104th \n     Congress's Unfunded Mandates Act.\n       The legislation didn't halt unfunded public-sector mandates \n     but it did increase Congress's accountability by requiring \n     both disclosure of costs of significant mandates and explicit \n     votes on the intent to impose those costs.\n       There remains a gap in the quest for accountability and \n     disclosure. Congress is still free to ignore costs when \n     enacting legislation that will impose mandates on the private \n     sector.\n       Recognizing that government-imposed costs can have profound \n     economic consequences, Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., is \n     leading a new campaign to force Congress to disclose and \n     assume responsibility for private mandates through the same \n     procedure that exists for public ones.\n       In an era of budget balancing, Sen. Abraham's campaign \n     assumes new importance. Costs of off-budget mandates on the \n     public now exceed $600 billion a year. That's more than one-\n     third the size of the entire federal budget, greater than \n     personal income taxes, and several times the annual deficit.\n\n[[Page S5430]]\n\n       The danger is that, as the federal budget is cut to \n     eliminate the deficit by 2002, pressure to shift the costs of \n     favored government programs off-budget to the private sector \n     will mount.\n       For example, advocates of a new federal job training \n     program could propose funding it through a Department of \n     Labor appropriation, or alternatively, through a new mandate \n     that all Fortune 500 firms provide such training. The first \n     appears on the budget, the second does not.\n       With the ``Mandates Information Act of 1997,'' Sen. Abraham \n     and Rep. Gary Condit, D-Calif., hope to remedy today's \n     absence of disclosure and regulatory bias. They hope to \n     ensure that mandates imposing higher wages, increasing \n     unemployment, or increasing consumer prices shall no longer \n     slip through Congress unacknowledged.\n       Their proposal would work by extending certain provisions \n     of the 104th Congress' popular Unfunded Mandates Act to \n     remove the arbitrary distinction between public and private \n     sector mandates.\n       The Mandates Information Act would allow a single Senator \n     or House member to raise a point of order against any private \n     sector mandate costing over $100 million annually. The point \n     of order would halt further floor action until members vote \n     specifically to waive it.\n       Making Congress explicitly vote on its intent to impose a \n     burden in this fashion wouldn't necessarily stop any mandate. \n     But it would allow constituents to determine where their \n     representative stood on a particular mandate.\n       Cost estimates would be prepared by the Congressional \n     Budget Office prior to floor consideration for any bill \n     reported out of committee, and disclosed in a document, \n     called a ``Consumer Worker, and Small Business Impact \n     Statement.''\n       The statement would include mandate impact estimates on \n     consumer prices and actual supply of goods and service in \n     consumer markets; wages, benefits and employment \n     opportunities; the hiring practices, expansion, and \n     profitability of businesses with 100 or fewer employees.\n       Knowing such impacts is worthwhile. Sen. Abraham points out \n     that mandates not only result in workers losing jobs, they \n     can prevent job formation in the first place. Mandates mount \n     as a small firm grows; for example, at 15 employees, \n     mandatory compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     kicks in; at 25, the Health Maintenance Organization Act \n     does; at 50, the Family and Medical Leave Act applies.\n       Sen. Abraham cites the case of Hasselbring-Clark, an office \n     equipment supply firm in Lansing, Mich. Its treasurer Noelle \n     Clark says, given the additional mandates that would \n     otherwise apply, ``we have hired a few temps to stay under 49 \n     (employees).''\n       Since the Abraham-Condit bill merely calls for disclosure, \n     it should stand above criticism from advocates of government-\n     regulation; if the majority believes it worthwhile to pass a \n     mandate in the first place, enough votes to override the \n     simply majority point of order ought to be there as well.\n       The point of order enforcement mechanism for high-dollar \n     rules and the impact statement together could help make \n     Congress far more answerable for excessive mandates. That \n     could be the lasting innovation of the Mandates Information \n     Act.\n       While most regulatory reforms attempt merely to require \n     agencies to police themselves better through cost-benefit \n     analysis, Sen.

Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate Matthew Elmer Treamer, a teacher at Lancaster School in \nLancaster NH and Chris Demers, a teacher at Dr. H.O. Smith School in \nHudson NH, on receiving the 1996 Presidential Award in Mathematics and \nScience Training. Matthew and Chris will spend the week of June 10-14 \nin Washington, DC, for a series of events to commemorate their \ndistinguished selection.\n  As a former teacher myself, I commend their outstanding \naccomplishment and well-deserved honor.\n  The Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science \nTraining Program, administered by the National Science Foundation \n(NSF), is designed to recognize and reward outstanding teachers who \nserve as models for their colleagues. Matthew and Chris have been \nleaders in the areas of increased visibility and rewards. This award \nrecognizes their distinguished leadership, and encourages high quality \nteachers to enter and remain in the teaching field.\n  New Hampshire has always been fortunate to have many talented \nteachers, but Matthew and Chris are certainly role models among the \nteachers of the Granite State. I am proud of their dedication to the \neducation of New Hampshire children and congratulate them on this \nmagnificent achievement. It is an honor to represent them in the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/09/senate-section/article/S5430-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE READ FOR THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 1000\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.
