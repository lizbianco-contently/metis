The Senate will now resume consideration of \nthe Durbin amendment No. 1140 with 2 minutes of debate prior to the \nvote.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, thank you for recognition this morning and \nthe resumption of our consideration of this important bill.\n  Amendment No. 1140, which I have offered, is an amendment that I \nthink is absolutely essential if this bill is to be airtight. We are \ngiving to outside laboratories the authority to review and approve \nmedical devices, medical devices which literally could mean life or \ndeath for millions of Americans.\n  When these approvals are given, these companies stand to make \nsubstantial profits because of FDA approval. The Durbin amendment \ncorrects a serious error in this bill by making certain that there will \nbe no conflict of interest by the third-party reviewers. We say in \nspecific terms that those reviewing the medical devices cannot receive \ngifts from the company that is the owner of the medical device, they \ncannot receive or own stock of the company that they are reviewing, \nthey cannot have been offered a job or solicited a job from the company \nthat they are reviewing, and there must be a full financial disclosure.\n  If we are going to maintain the integrity of the process, protect \nAmerican consumers, and avoid this sort of conflict of interest, I urge \nmy colleagues to adopt the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Senator's amendment at best \nduplicates the third-party conflict-of-interest protections in the bill \nand at worst unnecessarily constrains the agency. The ranking minority \nmember, Senator Kennedy, and the FDA join me in opposing this \namendment.\n\n[[Page S9738]]\n\n  Section 204 of the bill provides a full statutory directive to the \nagency adopt measures within 180 days of enactment to prevent conflicts \nof interest that may be involved with both an individual reviewer and \nwith the reviewing organization. As with Senator Durbin, this was a \ncritical concern for members of the committee.\n  Section 204 provides full discretion to the agency to develop \nappropriate standards. The agency will not be limited in any way in \ndeveloping these guidelines. In fact, the agency has already developed \nextensive conflict-of-interest guidelines as part of its existing \nthird-party program, including protections from situations such as if \nthe third party or any of its personnel involved in 510(k) reviews has \nany ownership or other financial interest in any medical device, device \nmanufacturer, or distributor.\n  The Senator's concerns have caused us to reexamine the important \nissue of preventing conflicts of interest. We commend him for doing so, \nbut I urge a no vote.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friends and \ncolleagues, Mr. Durbin of Illinois and Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, in \ncosponsoring amendment No. 1140. This amendment will ensure that \nprivate, third-party reviewers of class I and II medical devices will \nbe subject to the same conflict-of-interest restrictions that federally \nemployed reviewers are.\n  Under current law, employees of the Food and Drug Administration who \nreview drugs and medical devices are subject to strict regulations \ngoverning their interaction with the companies whose products they are \nreviewing. They are not allowed to accept gifts from such companies. In \naddition, they cannot designate other persons to accept gifts on their \nbehalf. Another important restriction prohibits reviewers from having a \nfinancial interest in any company whose products they are reviewing.\n  Mr. President, these are commonsense measures which help to maintain \nthe public's confidence in the safety of our Nation's drugs and \ndevices. The pharmaceutical and medical device industries command \nbillions of dollars every year. We live in a world in which FDA \napproval can mean immediate and enormous profits for investors. In such \nan environment, it is absolutely critical that the Government be \nvigilant in its responsibility to ensure that applications are reviewed \nthoroughly and in an unbiased manner.\n  We all know people--family members and friends--whose health, and \neven lives, rely on important medication and devices. There are few \njobs more significant than assuring the safety and efficacy of these \nitems. In my mind, Mr. President, this is a role--protecting health and \nsafety--that is best served by Government, rather than by the private \nsector. However, the bill before us takes a different view, and \nestablishes a large-scale pilot project to allow private sector review \nof medical devices. If we are to take this step, it is absolutely \ncritical that we subject those private sector reviewers to the same \nconflict-of-interest restrictions that Government reviewers are subject \nto.\n  The amendment sponsored by the Senator from Illinois would do just \nthat. It would say to private sector reviewers, ``You cannot own stock \nin any company whose product you review. You cannot accept any gifts \nfrom a company whose product you review, and you cannot designate any \nother person to receive such a gift.'' That's it. Pretty simple and \nstraightforward. But very important.\n  As one of the lead sponsors of the Senate gift ban several years ago, \nI feel strongly that the public has a right to know that elected \nofficials are working in the best interests of their constituency, and \ncannot be bought or sold over lunch provided by high-paid lobbyists. \nJust as politicians should not be trading on their influence, neither \nshould private sector medical device reviewers be swayed in their \ndecision process by gifts from industry representatives or the promise \nof huge profits derived from a recommendation for FDA approval.\n  I hope my colleagues will do the right thing, and limit the potential \nfor corruption in this bill by voting for this important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, we will resume \nconsideration of amendment 1139 by the Senator from Illinois with 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is correct. The House \nis seldom in order and the Senate is not in order. The Senate will come \nto order.\n  We will not resume consideration of the amendment until the Senate \ncomes to order.\n  Will the Senators to my left please cease audible conversation?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would defer to the Senator from \nIllinois, and I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 1 \nminute in behalf of his amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you buy a car in America the \nmanufacturer keeps a record of your name and address, or if there is a \ndefect they can recall the car. This bill removes the requirement for \nmedical device manufacturers to keep a record of those people who \nreceive pacemakers and heart valves. Why is that important? Because, if \nthere is a defect in that lifesaving medical device, they can't find \nthe patients. What results?\n  Just a few years ago 300 Americans died. They had the Bjork-Shiley \nheart valve that was defective and they couldn't be found. Does it make \nsense for us to remove this responsibility of medical device \nmanufacturers?\n  Take a look on your desk at a letter from 27 different organizations \nrepresenting patients across America who say it is only sensible to \nmake certain that we track and keep track of those who are receiving \nthese medical devices.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It is not too great \na burden on a medical device manufacturer to keep a record of those \nreceiving pacemakers and heart valves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Illinois has \nexpired.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S9739]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized to \nspeak for 1 minute.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I disagree entirely with the statement \nmade by the Senator from Illinois. The Senator's amendment strikes the \nagreement reached on these provisions among the bill's sponsors, the \nFDA, and Senator Kennedy. The FDA should have the discretion to decide \nwhen it makes sense to require device tracking or surveillance for a \nproduct.\n  Current law requires tracking for certain product types and gives the \nFDA discretion to require tracking for other products. It is simply not \nnecessary for every current and future device in the mandatory category \nto be subject to the tracking requirement. This provision allows FDA \naffirmatively to indicate which products in the mandatory category \nshould be subject to tracking. FDA may use its discretion to add new \nproducts to the list of products which must be tracked, or put a \nproduct back on the list for tracking if evidence indicates the need.\n  The FDA is overburdened. We want to free them up to do the things \nthat need to be done.\n  The FDA has publicly stated that it is unnecessary for all devices in \nthe mandatory category--postmark and surveillance category--to be \nsubject to its postapproval evaluation.\n  I urge defeat of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nIllinois. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, amendment \nNo. 1177. I would like to call up my amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1177.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 30, line 16, insert before the first period the \n     following: ``if the proposed labeling is neither false nor \n     misleading''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent Senators Kennedy and Bingaman be \nadded as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today we are debating very important \nlegislation, important for the country in the reformation and \nreauthorization programs at the Food and Drug Administration. \nParticularly important in this legislation is the prescription drug \nuser fee program, which has proven to be a remarkable achievement that \nhas speeded the approval of drugs, getting these necessary medicines to \nthe American public.\n  S. 830 includes a number of provisions that will include and \nstreamline the regulation of prescription drugs, biological products \nand medical devices, and we have made great progress over the last \nseveral weeks and months in reaching this position today. This bill is \na result of ongoing renegotiations, both prior to and subsequent to the \nmarkup of the legislation. Through this process, a number of provisions \nthat could have threatened the public health and safety have been \ndropped or otherwise reformed in such a way that we have made, as I \nsaid, remarkable and very effective progress.\n  However, this legislation still contains provisions which could \njeopardize the public health. I rise today to address one of these \nareas and that is the elimination of an important consumer protection \nagainst unsafe or ineffective medical devices. The bill, as it is \nproposed today, as we deal with it today, would limit the FDA's \nauthority to ask device manufacturers for safety data. It prohibits the \nFDA from considering how a new device could be used, if the \nmanufacturer has not included that use in the proposed labeling.\n  As a general matter, the FDA does not typically consider uses that \nthe manufacturer has not included in its proposed labeling. However, \nthere are instances where the label does not tell the whole story. In \nthese instances, when the label may be false or misleading--it is in \nthese instances that my amendment would give the FDA the authority to \nlook behind the label. In fact, this is such a critical issue that the \nadministration has made it clear that this provision could put the \nwhole bill at risk, including, I might add, the reauthorization of the \nPDUFA, the prescription drug user fee amendment, because they have \nthreatened, if this provision does survive, to veto the legislation. \nAnd that would, I think, derail a great deal of very positive work that \nwe have done today.\n  A great deal of discussion has taken place on the medical device \nprovisions of this bill. I certainly want to compliment Senator \nJeffords and Senator Kennedy and all my other colleagues on the \ncommittee for resolving most of these issues and doing so in a very \nreasonable, very thoughtful, and very responsible manner. However, the \nprovision regarding device labeling still raises substantial concerns, \nas I have alluded to, and it could be corrected very simply by my \namendment without, I believe, undermining the attempt of this bill \nwhich is to provide for a streamlined, effective process so that new \nmedical devices, new pharmaceuticals can reach the market and be used \nby the American public for their health and well-being.\n  Let me preface discussion of my amendment by briefly describing the \nprocess of how the FDA regulates and clears medical devices for market. \nUnder current law, manufacturers of new class I and class II devices \ncan get their products onto the market quickly by showing that they are \nsubstantially equivalent to devices already on the market. For example, \nthe manufacturer of a new laser can get that laser onto the market if \nit can show the FDA that the laser is, again, ``substantially \nequivalent'' to a laser that is already on the market. Similarly, the \nmanufacturer of a new biopsy needle can get the biopsy needle onto the \nmarket by showing it is substantially equivalent to a biopsy needle \nalready on the market. And the manufacturer of new patient examination \ngloves can get the same expedited market clearance by claiming \nsubstantial equivalency.\n\n[[Page S9740]]\n\n  Under current law, manufacturers are required to demonstrate this \nsubstantial equivalency to the FDA by showing that the new product has \nthe same intended use as the already-marketed product; and that the new \nproduct has the same technological characteristics of that already-\nexisting product in the marketplace. If the new product has certain \ndifferent technological characteristics, these characteristics must not \nraise new types of safety and effectiveness questions in order for the \nproduct to still be substantially equivalent to the older product. The \nlogic of this process for moving medical devices onto the market is \nquite simple. If a product is very much like an existing product, it \ncan go to market quicker. But if it raises new safety or effectiveness \nquestions, those questions should be thoroughly answered before the \nproduct is made available to the public.\n  The process for getting new medical devices on the market is commonly \nknown as the section 510(k) process or the 510(k) process. It's \nconsidered to be the easiest route for FDA approval. In fact, 95 \npercent of all medical devices that come onto the market come through \nthis 510(k) process. In a sense, because of this, because of this ease, \nthis is the process that is most used by manufacturers. There is, in \nmany cases, an incentive to bring your new product through this 510(k) \nprocedure. It has the lowest thresholds for approval, if you will, and \nthis incentive requires, essentially, the manufacturers at times to \nlook about in the marketplace and say this is going to do just what \nthis item does currently, even though the new technology or the new \ninnovation or new design might be adaptable to other purposes. But \nthere is, I believe, a regulatory incentive to try to speed things \nthrough the FDA by saying: No, no, this is substantially equivalent, \nthat's all we are going to do, this is it. As a result, I think the FDA \nhas to seriously look at, not just the labeled use, but in certain \ncircumstances--not common circumstances but in certain circumstances--\nlook behind the label.\n  The bill as it is currently proposed would compromise the FDA's \nexisting ability to do that and this change could raise substantial \nrisks to the public health. My amendment addresses this bill that would \nprohibit the FDA from considering how a device would be used if the \nmanufacturer has not included the use in its proposed label. My \namendment would add 9 simple words to the bill. Let me first show you \nthe existing language that is under discussion, and that is:\n\n       The determination of the Secretary under this subsection \n     and section 513(F)(1) with respect to the intended use of a \n     device shall be based on the intended use included in the \n     proposed labeling of the device submitted in a report under \n     section 510(k).\n\n  Essentially, what this says is if a manufacturer says, ``This is what \nwe are going to do,'' on a label, this is all we can consider in our \napplication process, even if the FDA considers the possibility of other \nuses or even, some would argue--even if the FDA felt that the label was \nmisleading or, indeed, false.\n  My language would be added at the very end, and it would simply say, \n``if the proposed labeling is neither false nor misleading.'' In a \nsense, it would give the FDA the opportunity to look at a proposed use \non a proposed label and say, ``This is consistent with the device, \nconsistent with use, let's get this onto the market through the 510(k) \nprocess expeditiously.'' But if they thought there was another possible \nuse, another likely use, or that the intended use was really perhaps a \nsubterfuge for other uses, they could challenge the application at that \njuncture.\n\n  I believe this is something that the FDA should have the authority to \ndo. In fact, I would assume the American public believes that the FDA \nhas this authority, that they can look very closely, very carefully; \nthat they don't have to take as the final authority the \ncharacterization of the device by the manufacturer. And they can, by \nsimply examining the device, using their experience, conclude that \nthere might be other uses which should be evaluated before this device \ngets on the market.\n  As I indicated, my amendment would allow them to effectively look \nbehind the label, look behind the characterization that was proposed by \nthe company.\n  It is also important to note that this is not a particularly novel or \nstartling approach to legislation. Because if you turn to the other \nmajor approval process, that is for a class II product, a new product \nthat has to do extensive premarket review, in this case they do have \nthe explicit authority, under present law, to look beyond the label. \nBecause even if the manufacturer indicates one use on the label, they \ndo not have to accept that use if they determine that it is false or \nmisleading. So this is not a novel concept. In fact, I think it \nrepresents what should be the normal practice for the FDA, to be able \nto look behind the label.\n  My amendment would give the Food and Drug Administration this \nauthority. It would give them the authority, and does so for new \ninformation, additional information, additional data. This is not an \nattempt to frustrate progress, to slow up the process, to impede the \nrapid deployment of new technologies into the marketplace. This is, I \nhope, an attempt to protect the public health and safety, protect the \nconsumers of these devices; and, hopefully, to delineate the authority \nof the FDA which typically they would use only in rare circumstances so \nwe don't have a battle at the FDA about whether this device is \ntechnologically different. So I hope, by using this approach, this \nlanguage, we could conform the 510(k) process in this respect to the \nexisting process and we could move forward with good, sound public \npolicy regarding the Food and Drug Administration and medical devices.\n  Let me give just a few examples, because this is not just a legal, \nacademic issue. This is a very real issue. There has been one example \nthat has been discussed on the floor by my colleagues and that is the \nuse of biopsy needles. Biopsy needles are approved for one use, \nprincipally. That is, as the name implies, to take a biopsy to remove \ntissue from a breast lesion, for example. Typically, these needles will \nremove a very small bit of tissue, about the size of the tip of a \npencil. But a manufacturer could present a device that could remove 50 \ntimes that--not a typical pencil, but the width of a hot dog. And that \nwould obviously raise questions about how this new device is going to \nbe used.\n\n  But under the language in the legislation, there is a very strong \nargument that the FDA could not look to possible other uses because the \nmanufacturer said simply, ``We're going to use this for the traditional \nbiopsy of tissue, a small biopsy of tissue. That's all. We're not going \nto use it or suggest it be used for the removal of tumors, the removal \nof tissue, just the biopsy.'' Then they would be essentially prevented \nfrom looking at this other use which may in fact be the actual use of \nthe device in the marketplace.\n  So we have to be very careful about that. The FDA should be able in \nthis case to say, ``Well, this could be used for something beyond a \nsimple biopsy. If that's the case, show us some data about its success \nrate, show us some data about the effects if it's used in this way and \nnot the precise label use.''\n  This is something that I believe we should have. There are proponents \nof the existing language which say that the FDA can get at that simply \nby saying this is a new technology, it is not equivalent to the old \none. But the manufacturer could argue that there are no questions of \nsafety or effectiveness even if it was a new technology. Essentially \nthis new language designed to streamline the process could lead us \nright back to the contentious issues about whether or not this new \ntechnology endangers health and safety. It could lead us back, I think, \nin a way in which the FDA has the weaker hand in the argument.\n  I believe that the American public would like to see the FDA with the \nauthority and the ability to ensure that these devices are thoroughly \nreviewed before they get to the marketplace.\n  As we go forth, there are other examples. In fact, my colleague from \nMassachusetts, I think, will talk specifically about one example of a \nbiopsy needle which went on the market. Before this device went on the \nmarket, it was tested only on two cows and, I am told, 13 roast beef. \nNow we hear that the device marketed as a biopsy needle has in practice \nbeen used for other surgical procedures. Now, this is an example of\n\n[[Page S9741]]\n\nhow something, even if it was not deliberately designed by the \nmanufacturer, can be changed in its use in practice. And, again, I \nthink the FDA should be able to anticipate those rare circumstances \nwhere it might happen and take effective action to protect the public \nhealth.\n  There are other examples. Another good example is a surgical laser. \nLasers have been used for decades for the removal of tissue. Several \nyears ago a manufacturer added a side-firing mechanism to their laser \nto improve its use for prostate cancer. While the manufacturer did put \nthat specific use in the proposed label, it was very, very clear that \nthis new side-firing design was intended solely for this purpose of \ntreating prostate patients. As a result the FDA, using its current \nauthority, its ability to look beyond the actual labeling use, was able \nto require the manufacturer to submit data demonstrating the laser's \nsafety and effectiveness in treating prostate patients.\n  This is precisely how the approval process should work. In rare \ncircumstances, when the device obviously looks different than the label \nuse, the FDA should be able to say, this could be used in ways that you \nare not labeling. We have to look at all the likely, obvious ways \nbeyond the label. Let us do that. Let us get beyond the label. Under \nthe present language, without the Reed-Kennedy-Bingaman amendment, the \nFDA would have a difficult time looking behind the label, looking at \nactual uses and requiring the data and the analysis which should be \ndone beforehand, before the goods get on the market.\n  I do not think you have to do this simply because there are people \nout there who would have a maligned motive. This is a situation where, \nif we create through our legal structures opportunities to get products \nquicker to the marketplace, then companies, with their expert legal \ncounsel, will exploit those ways. It is our responsibility to ensure \nthat we have a process that protects the public health.\n  Whatever process we develop here today will be used by the companies \nin a way which, if we were executives of companies, we would use in the \nsame way. But we have to take into consideration not the benefits or \nthe position of the manufacturer, but the position, I think, of the \ngeneral public that would use the devices.\n  So, I believe we have to have standards that are sufficient to give \nthe Food and Drug Administration the authority they need to do the job. \nI believe that my amendment does this. I believe we have to have these \nprocedures in place before a device gets into the marketplace. There \nare those who would argue that the FDA has the power to recall an item, \nhas the power to intervene, but then of course it is too late because \nobviously the public has already suffered in some way.\n  Indeed, it is not as easy as it may appear for the FDA to step into \nthe marketplace and get goods off or an item off the market that has \nalready been approved. So I think the idea that this can be corrected \nafter the fact is not sufficient weight to preclude us from taking \neffective steps before a device gets in the marketplace.\n\n  What I would like to do in my amendment is simply give the FDA the \nauthority to look at a proposed use, a labeled use, make a \ndetermination that this device and this label is consistent and get it \nthrough the 510(k) process quicker. But in those rare circumstances \nwhere the device itself and the label do not appear to be consistent, \ncoherent, where there is the possibility of a false label or a \nmisleading label, or the possibility that the company may indeed in \nmost cases in very good faith be insisting this is how they want to \nmarket it, this is how they propose it be used, but the medical \nprofession itself would adapt this very quickly for other uses, in \nthose circumstances I believe the FDA should have the authority.\n  I hope that my colleagues will recognize this, will support this \namendment, support giving what the FDA has today: the authority to look \nbehind the label and to require that companies provide data for the \nlikely uses of the product they intend to market.\n  Before concluding, I ask, Mr. President, unanimous consent that \nSenator Durbin be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. My colleague from Rhode Island is a welcome addition to \nthe Labor Committee. He has been active and has made some good \nsuggestions for improving this legislation, but this is not one of \nthem.\n  This amendment sounds like simple good Government but in fact would \ngut the provision and 20 years of effective medical device regulation.\n  Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me begin by commending the chairman of the committee, Mr. \nPresident, for the work he has done on this bill and for others who \nhave been involved in it.\n  We are arriving at the point here where we have a 211-page bill put \ntogether in the past 2\\1/2\\ years, where we are, hopefully, down to its \nlast provision, which has been the subject of some discussion over the \nlast number of days.\n  I want to just at the outset commend those who have been involved in \nit, explaining what the purpose of the intent here is. We have passed \nthis bill out of our committee 14 to 4. There was some disagreement \nover a number of provisions, but I believe we produced a very fine \nproduct which is going to assist tremendously in making this even more \nsecure in the quality of products we are getting but also the \nefficiency with which those products become available to patients and \npeople in this country. I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for the \nexplanation.\n  This has become an arcane subject matter when we talk about \nparagraphs and titles and how the FDA process works. That is the reason \nthe committee has spent so much time going back over this material, to \ntry to sort out exactly what would work best and how it would apply.\n  Contrary to how it has been portrayed thus far, the provision in the \nbill which is the subject of this amendment--what it does, Mr. \nPresident, is it shrinks back to current law an authority that the FDA \nhas been stretching, in our view, past the bounds of fair practices.\n  So the effort here is to try to get back exactly to what the intent \nhas been. All we, the authors of the bill, are asking is that the FDA \nnot force manufacturers to supply information on other than the imputed \nuses for which the manufacturer is not seeking approval and could not \nmarket the product even if they wanted to.\n  You can see how the FDA in the current practice of second-guessing \nmanufacturers can certainly create uncertainty not only in terms of the \nmanufacturer but also in terms of consumers. A manufacturer, Mr. \nPresident, can spend years designing a product for a specific purpose \nonly to be told by the FDA that it should go back to the drawing board \nand test the product for uses other than those for which the product \nwas created in the first place. That creates tremendous uncertainty.\n  Let me, if I can, Mr. President, try to describe this process and \nwhat we are talking about. That is where it gets a bit arcane. The \nSenator from Rhode Island, I think properly, characterized some of the \ndifferentiations here, but I think he gets lost on some people. What we \nare talking about here are not high-risk devices but lower risk \ndevices.\n  Ninety-five percent of the products that come out of the FDA for \napproval in this area are lower risk devices. What is a lower risk \ndevice and what is the process that exists today that allows for the \napproval of these products to be marketed?\n  Well, the lower risk device goes through, as the Senator from Rhode \nIsland has described, a 510(k) process. That is the applicable \nprovisions at the FDA. Under that provision, if a manufacturer wants to \nbring out a lower risk medical device, they must prove that the new \ndevice is ``substantially equivalent''--I am quoting here--``to a \ndevice already on the market,'' the so-called predicate device. That is \nwhy it is called a lower risk device. There already then has been the \napproval of a\n\n[[Page S9742]]\n\nproduct that is substantially equivalent to a product that the \nmanufacturer wants to bring out.\n  So the decision was made, instead of having a manufacturer go through \na de novo process, which can take years, as it should, that we are \ngoing to expedite that process as long as there is a predicate out \nthere--there is a predicate out there--there has already been a product \nthat is ``substantially equivalent,'' to quote the FDA. If that exists, \nthen you can go, for the lower risk device, to the 510(k) process.\n  There are two tests--two tests--that you must meet if you are going \nto get FDA approval under that provision--the lower risk device, not \nthe higher risk device. No one is debating that. We are talking about \nthe lower risk device. The two tests are the following.\n  The first is that the device has the same intended use as the \npredicate device. That is a subjective test. Does it have the same \nintended use? Does the label say that? Does the marketing, does the \ninformation the company is putting out have the same intended use? That \nis a subjective test. And if a manufacturer puts on the label some \nother use, then they would fail that test--the intended use.\n  To say that a manufacturer must also now have some imputed use that \nyou could not imagine, that you did not design, that you did not think \nabout, that some doctor may decide they want to use it for, is not what \nthat paragraph is all about. That is the first test.\n  But the second test is far more important. This bill does nothing to \nthe second test at all. The second test is that the new device's \ntechnological differences do not raise new questions of safety and \nefficacy. That is an objective test, Mr. President. That is an \nobjective test. Nothing in this bill changes anything in that second \ntest.\n  What we are trying to do is to get back to that first test and say it \nis the intended use of that predicate device, the intended use of the \npredicate device. If the manufacturer does not meet both of these \ntests, then the FDA does not have to clear the device.\n  This provision does not change that in any way whatsoever. You have \nto meet both tests. All that we are asking in this bill, among other \nthings that we have tried to reform here, is that we be able to draw \nsome lines around the first and very subjective test of the intended \nuse while retaining FDA's full discretion on the much more objective \ntests of the technological differences. Now, in our view, with all due \nrespect, the FDA has been stretching its authority by trying to impute \nuses that the manufacturer has no intention of doing.\n  We have been given some examples over the past week of how the act \nwould only test the intended use on the label. In fact, as I said, \nthere are two tests under 510(k). In each of the examples that have \nbeen given, the FDA had the ability to stop the devices from going on \nthe market because they failed the second test. No reference has been \nmade to that. They failed the second test, not the intended purpose, \nbut the technological differences.\n  All the examples that have been given, of course, are tragic ones, \ndeaths and injuries resulting from the Dalkon shield, a woman who \ncontracted toxic-shock syndrome from superabsorbent tampons, \ndisfigurement caused by artificial jaw joints, and faulty plastic \neyelashes that led to blindness.\n  These are all tragic examples without question. But in every single \ncase it was not because they failed the first test, the intended use; \nit was because they failed the second test. They were technologically \nflawed. It was not somehow that the manufacturer produced a product \nthat was used for some different purpose than the intended use on the \nlabel, but that the product was faulty, technologically it was faulty.\n  So we cite these examples and then say the reason that people lost \ntheir lives or were disfigured was because the manufacturer used it for \nsome purpose or someone used for it for a purpose other than was \nlabeled. That is not the case. It just is not the case. So I urge my \ncolleagues when looking at this, as technical and as arcane as it may \nbe--and most Members do not follow FDA regulations, do not get involved \nin the details of it--but with lower risk devices there are two tests, \nall within this bill. This amendment we are dealing with is the first \ntest, the intended use.\n  In every example cited, the horror stories cited, the tragic losses \ncited, in every single case it was the failure of the second test, \nwhich is not the subject of the amendment offered by the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  I urge my colleagues to pay attention to those of us who worked on \nthis and understand what we are talking about. We are trying to see if \nwe cannot narrow down the problem on the intended use sections.\n  Mr. President, let me talk here a bit about what our purposes are \nhere. If we allow the FDA to have free rein in the sense of having to \nguess at what a lower risk product could conceivably be used for once \nit is in the hands of physicians, then there is no end, in my view, to \nthe studies that could be required of manufacturers to produce.\n  Some suggest perhaps we need a threshold to that guessing; maybe the \nFDA is ``kind of'' sure that the doctors would not use the device for \nanother purpose. That would be the right threshold. Maybe ``really'' \nbeing sure would be sufficient in some cases. Can you see how \nunworkable a concept like this would be? Anytime the FDA is told they \ncan look into their crystal ball and guess how a doctor might use a \nproduct, the result is going to be uncertainty.\n  Mr. President, let me step back a second. There is not a single \nMember of this body that in any way wants to be associated with or part \nof an effort that is going to endanger anyone's life at all. In fact, \nquite the contrary. We want to do everything we can to see to it that \npeople are getting safe products, efficient products, effective \nproducts that will serve their interests and protect their lives. That \nis our purpose and intent. We also want to see patients able to get \nproducts and have them reach the market. Certainly there are going to \nbe those who will be fraudulent, bad actors. No one is suggesting they \ndo not exist. Nothing we will do here will stop that, I suppose.\n  But to suggest somehow that because we are trying to in some way \ntighten up the intended use or purpose on the lower risk devices, that \nthose who support this idea are guilty of somehow jeopardizing people \nall across this country, I think is an unfair characterization. It is \nquite the contrary.\n  In fact, a major company in my State of Connecticut, U.S. Surgical, \nwith 9,000 employees, has come up with some of the most creative, \nimaginative, and effective devices to reduce the risks of injury and to \npreserve lives. It is a very reputable company. The company has brought \nto the American people revolutionary technology.\n  They were leaders in creating minimally invasive surgery using \nlaparoscopes. Patients used to be laid up for months, or weeks anyway, \nafter a gall bladder operation. As a result of laparoscopic surgery, \nnow a person can be back at work within days because of the technology \ndeveloped by U.S. Surgical.\n  The breast biopsy, which has been discussed here, was developed 2 \nyears ago by U.S. Surgical and has been received by surgeons with \noverwhelming support in this country. Women have benefited from its use \nin over 7,000 cases worldwide. It is a safe and reputable company. I \nthink it has been unfairly labeled as otherwise. In fact, regarding the \nbiopsy, in trying to approve technology that would improve the \ntechnology, they should have received plaudits for that. The FDA \napproved it. There were questions raised about whether or not this was \nactually being used as a surgery to remove tumors. Never did the \nmanufacturer ever suggest that was the case. Having listened to some of \nthe debate, that was the implication.\n  Mr. President, I think it is unfortunate that that becomes the manner \nin which we debate a question here about one provision we are trying to \nnarrow a bit in lower risk products.\n  Mr. President, there are a few examples of instances where the FDA \nhas attempted to second-guess the manufacturers of a device about the \ndevice's intended use. One was an endoscope, an example where a \nmanufacturer was asked to submit data on how the materials of a device \nwould hold up after multiple uses. The company, in fact, insisted the \nlabel clearly state the product should only be used once and then \ndiscarded. That is what the label said. That is what the company and \nthe\n\n[[Page S9743]]\n\nmanufacturer intended--one usage of this endoscope. In the second case, \na manufacturer designed a hearing aid to reduce background noise. The \nFDA decided that the real intended use was better hearing, and required \nthe manufacturer to submit clinical data to prove that the device \nhelped hearing overall. In a third case, Mr. President, a manufacturer \ndeveloped a catheter that was coated with a substance that enhances the \nintegrity of the device materials when the device is implanted in the \nbody. The FDA decided the coating was really intended to reduce \ninfection, and required clinical data to prove it.\n  Mr. President, in each of these cases the manufacturer was not \nseeking to promote or market the device for the imputed use at all and \nwould have been prohibited from doing so, and the FDA's authority in no \nway is eroded. If the FDA believes that the company is off on some \nimputed use they have the authority to deal with that problem. We don't \nchange that in this law at all.\n\n  I also point out, Mr. President, in each case a useful device was \ndelayed from reaching consumers in this country. That is what we are \ntalking about here.\n  I talked earlier about the biopsy, the testing device developed by \nU.S. Surgical. U.S. Surgical received approval from the FDA for a \nbreast biopsy needle to be used for diagnostic purposes only, \ndiagnostic purposes only. After the product was approved and on the \nmarket, the FDA asked for more information about the efficacy and the \nsafety of the device for taking adequate biopsy samples--an appropriate \nrequest. U.S. Surgical supplied the information, and the second \napproval for the product was given by the FDA. At no time was the \ndevice marketed for another purpose. At no time was the device marketed \nfor any other purpose than for diagnostic purposes.\n  I come back to the section, the 510(k), the lower risk medical \ndevices. Two tests--the subjective test of intended use based on the \nlabel; and the second test on the technological questions, which is an \nobjective test. Had the manufacturer said on its label or in its \ninformation or its marketing packages, ``By the way, this will be a \ngood diagnostic device and it may just work in terms of dealing with \nthe tumor,'' you have immediately violated the first test because your \nintended purpose is other than what you are seeking approval. But that \nis a subjective case. That is the way this works.\n  If you want to scrap 510(k) and put everything on the same footing, \nwhy don't we have an amendment that does that? I don't hear anyone \nsuggesting that. We are trying to get these devices out where there is \na predicate; that is, there has been a product already approved, which \nis substantially equivalent, substantially equivalent, to the device \nseeking approval. I urge my colleagues to remember that when you are \nconsidering how to vote on this. This is not high risk. This is low \nrisk. Two tests--subjective test, intended purpose; second test, is it \ntechnologically faulty, is it safe?\n  In the case of U.S. Surgical's diagnostic test for breast cancer, \nwhich has been overwhelmingly received, by the way--in fact, I think we \nwill hear later from a colleague of ours who is a beneficiary of this--\noverwhelmingly accepted. Had they thought to do something else with \nthat biopsy, then they would be in violation of this test. That was not \nthe case and to suggest otherwise is just not true.\n  If it had been, the FDA would have had full authority to request data \non the safety and efficacy of the device for the unapproved purpose. It \nwould still have that authority under this provision. At no time did \nthe FDA request any data for U.S. Surgical regarding the use of the \nbreast biopsy device for tumor removal. So when this case is cited now, \ntwice I heard it cited, I hope my colleagues would understand what the \nfacts are. This is a fine company and the suggestion somehow they are \nproducing devices out there for purposes other than what was intended, \nrisking consumers in this country, is unfair to that company and unfair \nto the people who work there.\n  Mr. President, I urge our colleagues when considering this \namendment--and again I respect entirely the motivations behind it; \ncertainly all of us want to see the safest possible devices on the \nmarket, but we also want to see a process that will allow the products \nto get to that marketplace and serve the people they are designed to \nserve. If we are talking about something new, the tests are different, \nand they should be. If it is substantially equivalent to a device \nalready out there, we have made the collective determination 20 years \nago that the test ought to be different. When you go beyond that, in \neffect, if you are trying to take a lower risk device and apply it to a \nstandard that exists to a higher risk device you are defeating the very \npurpose for which 510(k) exists.\n\n  With all due respect to my colleague from Rhode Island, I urge this \namendment be defeated. In my view, the responses here are not arguing \nthis provision on its merits. Instead, we are hearing language that I \ndon't think reflects exactly what the situation is, what the facts are. \nWhile appealing on the surface, because some horrible cases have been \ncited as I pointed out, in every single instance in those cases it was \nnot a debate about whether or not the manufacturer was producing a \nproduct for one purpose and used for another. In every single case \nthose devices failed the second test of 510(k), not the first test of \nthe intended purpose.\n  By definition, the process of determining substantial equivalence, a \nlabel is neither true nor false. It is the same as the predicate. If it \nis not the same as the predicate, then it does not pass the first test. \nIn effect, trying to squeeze false and misleading language into a place \nit doesn't fit means all devices would be undergoing the PMA process, a \nprocess that can take up to six times longer, six times longer. When \nthere are patients out there and families out there that want to see \nthis material get to them, we don't need to be complicating a process \non low risk devices, delaying that event occurring, causing more pain \nand suffering. There are people who suffer as a result of a regulatory \nprocess that is so overburdened and so complicated that people cannot \nget these materials when they need them.\n  Mr. President, again, with all due respect, I urge my colleagues \nreject this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield to the Senator from Indiana 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I want to commend the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, for his \nstatement. Much of what I was going to say he has articulated probably \nbetter than I could articulate, in terms of the purpose of the 510(k) \napproval process, the nature of the tests that are involved in \napproving the devices that are substantially equivalent, and the \ntechnicalities that are involved in this that I know not a lot of \nMembers have had the opportunity to focus on or really even the \nnecessity of focusing on.\n  The point the Senator makes about the fact that the work of the \ncommittee over 2\\1/2\\ years has been careful and thoroughly undertaken \nin a way that is designed to provide the very best of protection for \nthe consumer, the very best of safety and effectiveness so that the \ndrugs and devices that are approved by FDA are devices and drugs that \nwe can have confidence in.\n  No one on the committee is attempting to undermine the essential \nfunction and the essential purpose of the Food and Drug Administration. \nWe want a dynamic, vibrant, effective agency in this country that tests \nthe safety and effectiveness of devices and drugs before they are \nbrought to the market.\n  Now, no process is ever going to be perfect. There will be \nmistakes. But we want to ensure that this agency has the very best of \nwhat it needs to accomplish that essential purpose. What we don't want, \nand what we are attempting to do with this reform bill is to have a \nsituation continue where the approval process cannot even begin to meet \nthe requirements that the agency thinks are appropriate and that we \nhave dictated by law, by statute.\n\n  Numerous examples have been cited here on the floor, whether it is \nfor drugs, or devices, or even other products that the FDA reviews, of \nunconscionable delays, of unnecessary delays, of letters being lost, of \nmaterial that has been misplaced, of the inability of FDA to have the \npersonnel, the\n\n[[Page S9744]]\n\nmanpower, the computer power, the administrative procedures in place \nthat provides for effective, efficient approval. It is all of this that \nhas led to a number of suggested reforms of FDA. And one, which has \nbeen working very successfully is the PDUFA, Prescription Drug User Fee \nAct, where the drug companies themselves put money into a fund that \nallows the FDA to hire individuals and to purchase equipment and speed \nup the approval of life-saving and health-improving drugs to the \nmarket. That has worked. We want that to continue. We are up against a \ndeadline on that. Funding for that runs out on September 30, the end of \nthe fiscal year. We have been pressing hard now for several months--in \nfact, all year--to try to move this process forward so we don't run up \nagainst this deadline. Yet, we have encountered delay after delay after \ndelay because of disputes about very small portions of a 200-plus page \nbill, carefully undertaken by the committee over a 2\\1/2\\ year period.\n  This is not a partisan issue, as Members who have been engaged in \nthis understand. The Senator from Connecticut; the Senator from \nMinnesota, Senator Wellstone; the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin; \nthe Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, have joined with the \nmajority, Senator Jeffords and others on the committee, to produce a \nvery, very substantial majority in support of the original bill, a 14 \nto 4 margin. Since then, some of the concerns of those four have been \naddressed in ways that the vote margin and support for the bill has \neven increased. There were 30-some concessions, which I held up a list \nof on the floor last week--more than 30 such negotiations and \nconcessions with those who had continuing concerns about the bill.\n  So it is not a matter of saying: we won, 14 to 4, and this is the \nbill, take it or leave it. We are open to producing the very best bill \nthat we can, and we think we have. We have been open to negotiation. \nBut every time we have met an objection, something new pops up. It is \nironic that in the committee the amendment we have been talking about \nhere, the amendment that Senator Kennedy has been debating at length, \nthe reason for the filibuster that has gone on, is over language that \nwasn't even brought up in committee. If this was such an important, \negregious omission on the part of the committee, how come an amendment \nwasn't offered in the committee to debate it or to discuss it or to \nchange it?\n  The language that we are talking about here was proposed by Senator \nWellstone--hardly someone who is viewed as being anticonsumer or \nsomeone viewed as trying to open a loophole so that the health and \nsafety of Americans is jeopardized. In the negotiations and \ndiscussions, postcommittee markup, this wasn't on the list. I have in \nmy hand the memo from the Labor Committee, from David Nexon, suggesting \nitems that need to be covered and need to be discussed. This isn't even \non the list. We went over these amendments. All of a sudden, when at \none point, the only thing left, to our knowledge, was a resolution of \nthe cosmetic portion of the bill, which was resolved, all of a sudden \nthis then pops up. So you have to question what is going on here.\n  We have a bipartisan coalition, people from liberal, conservative, \nand in-between perspectives, politically--Democrats, Republicans, \npeople who worked on the committee, delved into the issues and worked \nto ensure that we have the very best bill possible. Yet, we meet delay \nafter delay after delay and obstruction after obstruction after \nobstruction. So I think it is important not just to look at the \nspecifics of the amendment, but to ask the question: What else is going \non? What is the true intent here? Is it to undo FDA reform? Is it to \nblock any reform? Here we are up against this deadline for PDUFA, and I \nthink it is important that Members keep all that in mind.\n  I was going to go through the technicalities of the 510(k) process, \nbut Senator Dodd did a marvelous job explaining it. As he said, it's \nthe lower risk devices. We are attempting to find a way in which we can \nefficiently expedite the approval of devices that are designed for the \nsame purpose, which, in the FDA language, are substantially equivalent, \nand give those devices the opportunity to come to market without having \nto go through the same lengthy, costly approval process that the \noriginal device--the device called the predicate device--is subject to. \nSometimes that takes months; often it takes years for that original \ndevice to accomplish a specific purpose to be approved. Once that is \napproved, there are others that can market and make devices that are \nroughly equivalent--not roughly, substantially equivalent to that. If \nthe FDA determines that it is substantially equivalent under their \nreview procedures, then that device can be approved.\n\n  As Senator Dodd has said, however, that is only one part of the test. \nThe other part of the test is that if there is a technological \ndifference that raises safety and effectiveness concerns, FDA can say, \n``not substantially equivalent.'' You have to go through the process. \nFDA retains that authority. Nothing in this bill changes that \nauthority. Nothing in this bill alters one iota of that authority. \nEvery example raised by the Senator from Massachusetts ignored totally \nand failed to acknowledge that the second part of the test gives FDA \nthe authority that they said FDA doesn't have.\n  So that's what is at issue here. It is an issue that doesn't have to \nbe here. It is an issue that we don't need to be talking about. No one \nraised it in committee. No one raised it in negotiations postcommittee. \nNo one indicated that this was a bill stopper. The last indication of a \nbill stopper was the cosmetic concern, which was negotiated and an \nacceptable compromise was reached. Then, all of a sudden, this \nprovision, 404(b), the language offered by the Senator from Minnesota, \nSenator Wellstone, and accepted by the committee as part of the bill, \nwithout objection, all of a sudden this now becomes the bill stopper, \nthe killer language, the language that is going to destroy the FDA and \nplace 260 million Americans in jeopardy of their life and their health.\n  I think Senator Dodd very effectively outlined why the examples used \nwere not relevant examples. They are tragic examples. We all regret \nthat they happened. But they have nothing to do with the language that \nwe are talking about. They have nothing to do with the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Rhode Island. And so let's keep that in \nmind as we move forward here in this torturous process of getting a \nbill passed through the Senate that has been substantially delayed \nbecause of procedural practices, which enjoy no support from this body. \nWe have had two votes. I think the opponents of the legislation got \nfive votes on the first try and four votes on the second try. The other \n95 of us, or 96, depending on how you count it, are still here \nattempting to move forward.\n  Now, we have the good fortune of having Dr. Frist--Dr./Senator \nFrist--on our committee. For those of us who don't have the medical \ntraining and expertise to fully understand all of this, we frequently--\nin fact, every opportunity we have on medical questions--turn to Dr. \nFrist for the expert's view. I think it is a phenomenal addition to the \nSenate that we have this capability available to us. He will be \ncommenting on this and, frankly, I put a great deal of reliance on his \njudgment. Some of us could be reading this the wrong way, could be not \nunderstanding certain aspects of the process. We represent companies \nthat make these devices. We hear their side of the story and it \ncertainly sounds reasonable, and we try to make sure there is a proper \nbalance between the need to bring products to market quickly and a need \nto make sure they are safe and effective. So we turn to people like Dr. \nFrist to give us the expert view in terms of what we are doing.\n  I know I have used my time here. I will have more to say about that, \nas I think we have considerable time left under the cloture procedures \nhere.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to address Senator Reed's \namendment to S. 830, the FDA reform bill. The proponents of the \namendment have failed to distinguish between devices that are \nsubstantially equivalent to devices the FDA has approved and devices \nfor which no predicate exists. That distinction is central to the \nregulatory scheme for device approval.\n  Most medical devices brought to the market represent a small \nincremental change. Around 95% of medical device approvals granted by \nthe FDA involve\n\n[[Page S9745]]\n\ndevices that are substantially equivalent to a device already approved \nby the agency.\n  Most devices are not breakthroughs. They are not devices with bold \nnew uses. They do not represent a sharp departure in medical science. \nThey are devices with a foundation of testing, experience in the field, \nand most important, devices with a foundation in previous FDA approval.\n  Policies and regulations that are appropriate for devices without a \npredicate are not appropriate where devices are substantially \nequivalent to a device that has already received the FDA stamp of \napproval. If each new device represented such a break with the past, it \nwould be sensible to fully reexamine safety and efficacy every time FDA \nwas asked to grant approval.\n  But in a world of small changes, this unwarranted bureaucratic \nimpediment would strangle progress, limit the benefits available to the \npublic from technological advances, and yield little if any public \nhealth benefit.\n  To capture the public health benefits of small incremental change, \nsuch devices are approved by the FDA under special procedures called \nthe 510(K) approval process. The critical test applied by the FDA in \napproving the device is demonstrating that the device is substantially \nequivalent to a device that has already been approved by the agency. \nThe test of substantial equivalence is a flexible definition that \nincludes both products that are identical to previously approved \ndevices, and those with a certain degree of technological change.\n  In contrast, where the new device represents a major advance and is \nused in supporting life or avoiding substantial impairment of health, \nthe FDA uses entirely different tests before approving the device. \nThese breakthrough devices undergo extensive safety and effectiveness \ntrials before marketing. They require extensive premarket review \nbecause the FDA has no assurance the new device is safe and effective \nbased on studies of a previous device, field experience, or FDA \napproval.\n  Approving substantially equivalent products expeditiously allows the \nFDA to concentrate its resources on those devices that involve new \ntechnologies or uses rather than waste time and staff conducting full-\nblown reviews of the equivalent device again and again and again.\n  In the example we have heard so much about over the last few days, \nU.S. Surgical Corp.--which is headquartered in my State--submitted an \napplication for approval of an advanced breast biopsy instrumentation \ndevice in October 5, 1995. The application was granted by the FDA on \nFebruary 1, 1996. The FDA based their approval on substantial \nequivalence in design, materials, methods of use, and intended use to \nbiopsy needles the FDA had previously approved. Since that date the \nABBI device has been used in over 7,000 cases worldwide.\n  In granting approval to U.S. Surgical, the FDA applied the two \nstatutory tests of substantial equivalence. First, the device was shown \nto have ``the same intended use as the predicate device'' and second, \n``the same technological characteristics as the predicate device''.\n  Some Members have mistakenly stated that U.S. Surgical has marketed \nthe device to remove breast cancer tumors, but the Members are in \nerror.\n  A degree of technological variation is permissible and specifically \nenvisioned in the statute. Where the device has different technological \ncharacteristics, it can still be approved under 510(K) if the \nmanufacturer submits\n\n       * * * information, including clinical data if deemed \n     necessary by the Secretary, that demonstrates that the device \n     is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device, and \n     does not raise different questions of safety and efficacy \n     than the predicate device.\n\n  ABBI uses a larger cannula than previously approved biopsy needles. \nThe wide cannula allows the physician to extract a broader sample of \nbreast tissue. The wide cross section allows more accurate diagnosis of \nbreast lesions that appear in the x-ray as clusters of tiny particles \nrather than discrete nodes.\n  U.S. Surgical's product insert states in boxed, large type ``The \nABBI* system is to be used ONLY for diagnostic breast biopsy; it is NOT \na therapeutic device.'' Its patient pamphlet on the device discusses \nbiopsy uses to the exclusion of any other potential use.\n  In the ABBI example, the FDA requested clinical data from U.S. \nSurgical about impact of the new technology, broader cannula. U.S. \nSurgical submitted the data on September 23, 1996 and the FDA updated \nthe 510(K).\n  The sponsors of the amendment state that manufacturers have an \nincentive to seek approval based on false and misleading statements of \nintended uses. Under the 510 (K) approval process, the device must have \nthe ``same intended use as the predicate device'' but the amendment \nsponsors state that manufacturers are able to undercut this test. The \namendment sponsors suggest that the FDA be allowed to establish a new \nintent test for 510(K) approvals that allows the FDA to impute new \nuses, demand new safety and efficacy tests, and ignore the \nmanufacturers intended uses.\n  First, I would point out that U.S. Surgical specifically responded to \nthe FDA's concerns by adding new labeling to its device clearly stating \nthat the device was to be used ``only for diagnostic breast biopsy''.\n  Second, the FDA already has ample power to confront potential \nproblems in labeling. For example, they sent a warning letter to the \nU.S. Surgical Corp., on June 3, 1996, regarding labeling and \nadvertising claims made for the ABBI. The warning letter lead to the \nmodifications in labeling and resubmission of the 510(K) application.\n  Finally, the FDA has a host of criminal and civil penalties to \nprevent the marketing of mislabeled products including administrative \ndetention and seizure, criminal and civil penalties, injunction, \nmandatory consumer and physician mandatory notifications, mandatory \nrecall, and adverse agency publicity.\n  For example, FDA can administratively detain devices that are \nmisbranded based on FDA's unilateral determination that a detention is \nappropriated, and can last up to 30 days to permit the agency an \nopportunity to either perfect a civil seizure through the courts or \nobtain injunctive relief.\n  Into the middle of this, the Reed amendment would throw a major \nchange. The amendment does not state grounds or procedures by which the \nFDA would determine that the proposed labeling was ``false'' or \n``misleading''. The evidentiary basis by which the FDA will impute the \nmanufacturers intent is unknown, as is the frequency of off-label uses \nthat spurs additional FDA requirements or the adequacy of additional \nclinical trials necessary to satisfy their concerns. If the amendment \npasses, manufacturers have to be prepared to conduct trials of safety \nand efficacy for uses they are not seeking. Furthermore, the additional \nrequirements only apply to the unapproved device--not to the predicate \ndevice previously approved by the FDA.\n  The 510(K) process is intended to provide an expedited basis for \nbringing new versions of previously approved products to the market. It \nemploys relatively simple and easy to apply tests of substantial \nequivalence. The tests are straight forward and predictable in their \napplication. We should continue to protect this path of technological \ninnovation. The FDA has ample power to prevent mislabeled products from \nendangering the public health. If the amendment passes, many innovative \ndevices will not be available to consumers and the public health will \nsuffer.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to just respond briefly to \nsome of the points that have been made and then to get into the \nsubstance of the argument. I want to reiterate the importance of this \nparticular provision. There are those who are trying to dismiss it as a \nrelatively unimportant part of this legislation, and saying that we \nreally didn't bring this issue to the attention of the committee until \nthe final hours, therefore, we could not have been serious about it. Of \ncourse, this is completely untrue.\n  I won't take the time to put in the Record the agenda for June 17 \nwhere this was listed in ``items under discussion'' on section 4 of the \nlabeling claims. This was exactly the matter that was brought up in the \nmarkup in June. It was identified by the Secretary of HHS in the June \n11 letter to the committee. It was repeated on September 5. Secretary \nShalala identified\n\n[[Page S9746]]\n\nthe very few items that she would recommend that the President veto \nthis legislation about. She listed the environmental issue, the \nelimination of the environmental impact statement. Another one was a \ntechnical amendment dealing with PDUFA. A third item was the cosmetic \nprovisions. But this is the provision that was identified by the \nprincipal protector of the American people's health as the most \nimportant provision in terms of adverse effects to public health, this \nprovision. Let's understand that right from the beginning.\n  I know that my colleagues say, well, there are only a couple of \nMembers of this body that are really concerned about this particular \nprovision. Well, it is interesting that, time in and time out, the No. \n1 person in the administration that has the principal responsibilities \nfor protecting the American health has said this is it, this is the \nprovision. With all due respect to those who say this is a low-risk \nissue that doesn't matter, that this is a technical question and we \nshould just get through this business and get on with the vote, these \narguments should be disregarded, because this is an enormously \nimportant issue. It was raised during the course of the markup back in \nJune, and identified by the Secretary of HHS during the course of the \nsummer. Many people were briefed by the Secretary indicating her \npriorities and this was right out there. It is in the papers submitted \nby her in September as being the primary technical concern in regard to \nsafety for the American people. That might not make a difference to \nsome Senators but it ought to make a difference to the American people. \nAnd it is not just the Secretary who is concerned about this provision. \nWe have virtually every single group of health professionals charged \nwith protecting the consumers' interests have expressed concern about \nthis issue--the President of the United States, the Secretary of HHS, \nthe Consumer Federation, the National Women's Health Network, the \nNational Order for Rare Disorders. Who are these groups and \nindividuals? They are the very people that benefit from innovations in \nmedical devices. They are the people whose lives are enhanced. They are \nones who are saying, ``No, don't do this. Support the Reed amendment.''\n\n  I am glad to listen to my colleagues. I am interested in the number \nof people employed by these companies. I am interested in what a great \njob a company does. I am interested in the opinion of some of our \ncolleagues who say, ``Well, this really isn't such an important measure \nbecause there are only a few people out there who oppose it.''\n  Go down the list of the organizations that are out there protecting \nthe people that will benefit most from progress in these areas, and \nthey say, ``Don't do this. Support the Reed amendment.'' Do they make \nthe judgment that this is not important just because it deals only with \nclass II devices--the relatively low risk devices. There has been the \nsuggestion here on the floor of the Senate that these are virtually \nlow-risk devices.\n  These are some of the devices: Ventilators. Low-risk? Who has not \nbeen in the hospital with a member of their family and hasn't \nunderstood the importance of making sure that ventilators are going to \nperform as they are labeled?\n  You have digital mammography with possibilities of missing tumors in \nwomen with breast cancer. We want to make sure that these devices are \ngoing to be safe and do what they are represented and designed to do--\nnot just what is listed on the label.\n  You have the fetal cardiac monitors that monitor infants.\n  I saw them working yesterday in Springfield at the Bay State Fetal \nCenter in one of the greatest neonatal centers in this country.\n  Do you want to take a chance on fetal cardiac monitors? Or on \nsurgical lasers?\n  The list goes on--these are class II devices, low risk. We are not \ntalking about tongue depressors. We are not talking about bedpans. We \nare talking about the kinds of items where we need to make sure they \nare going to be safe and effective. That is why these organizations \nwhose job it is to protect the public are concerned.\n  With all respect to my colleague and friend from Connecticut, who I \nheard state three times that these products, which have not been \napproved for safety and effectiveness for the uses for which they are \nbeing advertised, are not being mislabeled. And that we shouldn't \ndispute or cast aspersions on the good, legitimate name of the U.S. \nSurgical Corp.\n  Mr. President, I have right here the letter from Dr. Monica Morrow, \nprofessor of surgery at Northwestern University School of Law, dated \nSeptember 22.\n\n       Dear Senator Kennedy:\n       I am writing you to express my feelings regarding the \n     importance of the FDA's mandate to evaluate behind the scene \n     use of devices and drugs. The need for such evaluation is \n     clearly exemplified by the marketing strategy of U.S. \n     Surgical's breast biopsy device. This device was approved as \n     a diagnostic instrument. However, the company video clearly \n     depicts the use of the device for definitive breast cancer \n     therapy with no clinical trial using the accepted \n     technology for comparing cancer treatments that have been \n     conducted to evaluate this claim, and without such trials \n     the device could potentially pose a significant risk to \n     patients.\n       In addition, other claims regarding approved cosmetic \n     outcome and patient acceptance are similarly unsubstantiated. \n     The indication for use of the devices and drugs should be \n     determined by appropriate clinical and scientific data, and \n     not by their appeal as a marketing gimmick. This video was \n     dropped off at my office by a company representative as part \n     of an effort to interest me in purchasing the company \n     equipment.\n\n  I have it right here. For people who doubt it, take a minute and \nwatch the video. Read the letter. Call Dr. Morrow.\n  It is being marketed out there today. This is what we are talking \nabout. That is the issue. When colleagues get up and say, ``Well, it \nhas not been, and it won't be, and that is wrong if it is?'' I say, \n``It is being done.'' And that is exactly the problem that we are \nattempting to address.\n  Mr. President, this is an enormously significant and important health \nissue. This body has taken many actions on medical devices since the \nmid-1970's to enhance public health the protections since the mid-\n1970's that enhanced protections for public health. This provision \nwhich will create a loophole through which unscrupulous manufacturers \nof a medical device will be able to drive a truck is the exception to \nthat commendable history. This provision will make a mockery of the \nsubstantial equivalence requirement, and will allow irresponsible \ncompanies to go out, as this company has, and advertise and represent a \nparticular product for a purpose and use that differs from the one they \nput on the label.\n  Mr. President, it was interesting that some of our colleagues \naddressing the Reed amendment pointed out that there are two ways of \napproving the medical device. Only about 5 percent medical devices use \nthis particular provision, the premarket approval. That provision says, \n``In making the determination whether to approve or deny * * * the \nSecretary shall rely on the conditions of use included in the proposed \nlabeling as the basis for determining whether or not there is a \nreasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, if the proposed \nlabeling is neither false nor misleading. In determining whether or not \nsuch labeling is false or misleading, the Secretary shall fairly \nevaluate all the material facts pertinent to the proposed labeling.''\n  Mr. President, I daresay that there is probably a less compelling \nreason to use the proposed labeling as ``neither false nor misleading'' \nin this provision because you are going to have such a survey in an \noversight for new materials as it is in the other provision.\n  What the proposal that is before us now, the one that is for 95 \npercent of all devices, says is, ``* * * the determination of the \nSecretary under this subsection * * * with respect to the intended use \nshall be based on the intended use included in the proposed labeling.''\n  I would like to point out to those that have suggested here on the \nfloor that the intended use is a subjective decision to be made by the \nFDA, that isn't what the legislation says. It says, ``* * * the \ndetermination of the Secretary under this * * * section with respect to \nthe'' * * * device ``* * * shall be based on the intended use included \nin the * * * labeling.''\n  Who makes up the labeling? The manufacturer has the labeling \n``submitted a report under this section.''\n  The only thing the amendment of Senator Reed is proposing is that the\n\n[[Page S9747]]\n\nFDA be restricted to looking solely at the labeled use only in \ninstances where ``* * * the proposed labeling is neither false nor \nmisleading.''\n  How can anyone be opposed to that?\n  We have just seen the example of the approval of a biopsy needle for \none particular purpose--taking the biopsy. Then we find that this \nsimilar machine is represented as being for the purpose of biopsies, \nhere it is in their advertisement--the latest technique in minimally \nevasive breast biopsy. This device takes 50 times the amount of \nmaterial as the other one. Here it is being advertised in Canada. Here \nit is being advertised in the United States--not for use in biopsies \nbut to remove the tumor itself. And there is no information available \nto the Food and Drug Administration about how good or safe the device \nis for that use. Maybe it does work. We are not here to say it doesn't \nwork. We just want the company to have to provide the information that \nsays it does work. If that is what you are going to use it for, why \nshould the Food and Drug Administration, which has the responsibility \nof protecting Americans, be limited by the language of this particular \nlegislation that says you can only look at what is on the label? When, \nat the same time, they have letters from doctors and they have \nvideotapes that show it is being used for an entirely different \npurpose.\n\n  That is the issue. The Reed amendment says, OK, we are willing to \nonly look at the use on the label, but let's just make sure that we are \nnot going to encourage false and misleading labeling.\n  Is the Senate of the United States going to say to the FDA that if \neven if they know that the labeling is false and misleading that they \nshould be prevented from protecting the American public?\n  That is what you are going to do if you do not accept the Reed \namendment. That is what this debate is about. It is as simple as that.\n  Here we have this extraordinary example, where you have a biopsy \nmachine that is supposed to take a biopsy about the size of the lead in \nthat pencil versus something that takes 50 times the amount and the \npurposes for it is intended to be used are quite different, as \nmentioned here in the letter which says, ``I am expressing my feelings \n* * * the importance of the FDA mandate.''\n  ``The video was dropped off at my office'' with the interest of \npurchasing the equipment.\n  When the FDA became aware that the company was promoting the device \nfor this unauthorized purpose, it also became aware that it had made a \nmistake in clearing a device that was clearly designed for a purpose \nnot stated on the labeling--tumor removal for clinical testing. The FDA \nthen acted to require the company to include a strong label that the \ndevice was only to be used for tissue sampling; not tumor excision.\n  I cannot imagine why the company failed to give the full information \non that. But, nonetheless, that is what is happening.\n  Mr. President, I listened with interest to many of our colleagues \ntalking about how there really are no dangers in terms of medical \ndevices, that my examples are not really what this issue is all about. \nThey are mistaken.\n  We are committed to ensuring that these kinds of circumstances will \nnot occur in the future. That is why we are out here. We don't have to \ngo through another incidence similar to the Dalkon shield where 18 \nwomen died from a perforated uterus and 2,700 women suffered \nmiscarriages. We don't want to go through another episode like the \nShiley heart valve one where a change in the angle of the valve would \nhave changed the way the device interacted with the heart raised \nquestions as to its safety. The FDA discovered this and refused to let \nit go to market in the United States. But the modified device was \nmarketed in Europe and 15 times the number of people died using the new \ndevice over the earlier one. With all respect to those who say how much \nbetter the system is in other countries--15 times the deaths. And the \nwhole toxic shock issue that we raised and its impact on American \nwomen.\n  What we are pointing out is that there are dangers that can take \nplace in our country, that affect our people, when you start fiddling \naround with safety and effectiveness and medical devices.\n  That is the issue.\n  There are those who say, ``Look. We have a little loophole. But it \nreally isn't quite the same as it is with some of these other terrible \nkinds of situations.''\n  We have given the illustration of the kinds of challenges that are \nout there today.\n  There are the laser technologies, cutting tissue laser technologies, \nwhere you have submitted to the FDA a laser that, everyone who has \nreally looked at it agrees, is going to be used for prostate surgery. \nBut there is virtually no information as to the safety and \neffectiveness of that particular medical device for that use--none. \nThat is what happens.\n\n  There are the various digital mammography devices that may be very \ngood for obtaining diagnostic information and evaluating a particular \ntumor but may be questionable for screening purposes. Questionable as \nto there effectiveness in allowing women to know whether they are going \nto have the first indications of a small tumor. Don't we want to be \nsure that this isn't what it is going to be used for? Don't we know \nwhat they are out there marketing this for and how well it performs?\n  We have just seen in the period of the last 5 days, the example of \nthe terrible events concerning the off-label use of the drug fen/phen--\nand the health hazards and challenges faced by the people who have used \nit.\n  Are we here today saying we don't want to include language in this \nbill that will allow the FDA to be able to look at safety of medical \ndevices if they find the labeling is false and misleading? We have \noffered five different compromises to work this out. It is the No. 1 \nconcern of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the No. 1 \nconcern by the FDA. I have listened here in the Chamber, to those who \noppose this amendment who say the FDA has all the authority in the \nworld to protect the public. I have quotes here from Senators who have \nsaid, in effect, that we should not be bothered by this because the FDA \nhas all the power it needs and that this is really not a problem.\n  I was tempted to take the language of their quotes and offer it as an \namendment because their description of the FDA is not what the law is \nand will be if this legislation is passed. We would have taken the \nkinds of protections that were implied by their quotes. Where they say, \nlook, they have the real right to go behind if they think there is some \nkind of question in terms of safety.\n  The FDA would not have that authority under this bill as written. But \nif it is your understanding and that is what you want, let's take an \namendment and ensure that they do.\n  But we do not have that opportunity. We are faced with the real \npossibility for a situation where the FDA does not believe it has the \npower and the authority to protect the American consumer. The FDA does \nnot believe it has authority. If they know that the predominant use is \ngoing to be other than that which is listed on the label and which \ncould provide a substantial threat to the American people, the FDA will \nnot have the power or the authority to protect the American public.\n  Members of Congress can come out here and say, ``Oh, yes, they do.'' \nI have listened to that argument. ``Oh, I don't know why everyone is \ngetting so worked up about it. You know, they really do have the \nauthority.''\n  They do not have it. The FDA itself states they do not. They have \ntestified they do not. The President does not believe it. The Secretary \nof HHS does not believe it. The consumer groups do not believe it. \nNational Women's Health Network does not believe it, the Consumer \nFederation, the Patients Coalition.\n  We have had this discussion and debate for a number of days. We \nbelieve we are finally getting through. But where are all the consumer \ncalls saying, ``Look, let's go with what is proposed in the \nlegislation. We have read the record. We have looked at the law. We \nbelieve the FDA is out there and can protect the American public. I \ndon't know what everybody is getting worked up about.''\n  But we aren't getting those calls because virtually every consumer \ngroup\n\n[[Page S9748]]\n\nthat has looked at this issue, has discovered that the language in the \nbill will not provide adequate protection for consumers.\n  National Women's Health Network: ``Women need the FDA to act as a \nsafety sieve screening out drugs and devices that are hazardous and \ndefective. If 404 is enacted, a device manufacturer could label its \nproduct for a very simple use. The FDA would be limited to ask for \nsafety and effectiveness for that use only.''\n\n  The groups understand this issue, and they are concerned. ``Even if \nit were clear from the device's technical characteristics that it might \nbe used for other more riskier purposes.''\n  That is the biopsy needle. You have a needle that is 50 times larger \nthan is necessary for a biopsy and you have the clear evidence from \ndoctors, both in this country and abroad, who have seen the videotape \nthat the company is out there marketing it for a different use. We have \nit right here--a slick promotion for this particular issue. All we are \nsaying is if the FDA is able to show that the labeling is false and \nmisleading, they can look at safety.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on that point?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield, sure.\n  Mr. DODD. I would respectfully suggest to my colleague that U.S. \nSurgical is not marketing a video that promotes an unapproved use for \nthis device. Now, there are clinicians out there who have put out \nvideos and other educational materials on medical practice issues. U.S. \nSurgical is aware of that. It can happen. But the implication that U.S. \nSurgical is now actively promoting unapproved uses is not true.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Has the Senator seen this video?\n  Mr. DODD. No, I have not, but I am told categorically that U.S. \nSurgical is not promoting or marketing this device other than for \nbreast biopsies.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the Senator take the time to see it because \nwhen you turn it on, the first thing that you are going to see is the \nU.S. Surgical logo on it. I don't see how you can say that it is not \nbeing promoted or advanced or whatever if that is exactly what you will \nsee. I would suggest to the Senator, if you are saying that those of us \nwho have represented that it is being promoted for other uses--and we \nhave the doctors' letters and we have this video, which you haven't \nseen--I would think that perhaps you ought to check again with U.S. \nSurgical and find out what they are doing. We have just seen it.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield in a second. We have just seen what the \nmedical companies were doing with fen/phen. They weren't promoting it. \nAll they were doing was paying the doctors thousands and thousands of \ndollars to go out and promote it. When we look at this promotion, it \nhas ``U.S. Surgical'' on it, and it is a U.S. Surgical medical device--\nand we have the doctors' letters on this that say, ``The indications \nfor the use of devices. . . it should be determined by appropriate--\n\n       This video was dropped off in my office by a company \n     representative--\n\n  Company representative--\n\n     as part of an effort to interest me in purchasing this \n     equipment.\n\n  Now, there may be other information. I am glad to have it included in \nthe Record but I find this convincing.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield. This company is not engaged in \npromoting unapproved uses for this biopsy needle. And U.S. Surgical \ncategorically denies any association with any materials produced by \nothers where this might have occurred. The FDA has approved the breast \nbiopsy needle. The FDA has approved it twice, in fact, only for breast \nbiopsies. Accordingly, U.S. Surgical does not promote the device or \nmarket the device for tumor removal. It is aware now that articles and \nvideos do exist which discuss other uses of the devices. It is very \ncommon, and completely legal, for physicians to explore other possible \nuses of both drugs and devices as part of the practice of medicine. But \nthe suggestion somehow that the company is now actively promoting this \ndevice for something other than diagnostic purposes, with all due \nrespect, is just not true.\n  And the question that we should be asking here--a very important \nquestion--is, if this obviously illegal practice is occurring, if U.S. \nSurgical is actively promoting this product for an off-label use, why \nhasn't the FDA gone after the company? Now, clearly, if it were true, \nthe FDA, with all the force of law would go out and pursue them \nvehemently. Promotion of a device for unapproved uses is one of the \nmost egregious violations a company can commit. Surely if this were the \ncase, and evidence of it were so readily available, FDA would have \nacted. But there has been no FDA action, because there has been no \nviolation. And to suggest otherwise is irresponsible.\n\n  I mentioned earlier, if my colleague will continue to yield, that \nU.S. Surgical has promoted this device for the purpose for which it was \napproved--to give women and their surgeons a useful option in \nconducting breast biopsies. There are good medical reasons that a \nlarger size biopsy might need to be taken. In conducting biopsies you \ndo can not always get a reliable tissue sample just with a small \nneedle--some tumors are just too diffuse. Evidence shows that, with \nsome types of tumors, taking a larger biopsy gives the surgeon a far \nbetter chance of determining the quality of the tumor accurately \nwithout the need to take multiple, painful biopsies.\n  That is why this device was developed. And as women who have been \nthrough this will tell you, it is important to have this device as an \noption for taking an accurate and safe breast biopsy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to regain my time.\n  I say that that is a promotional document. I would suggest the \nSenator watch it before he represents that it is not. It has the U.S. \nSurgical logo on it. We have the doctors who claim this is the case. \nThe FDA has been going after U.S. Surgical.\n  That is another issue. It is an important issue. FDA ought to be \nconcerned about it, and they are. But that doesn't get away from what \nthe FDA may not be able to do sometime in the future. They won't be \nable to do it in the future, because all the FDA will have the power to \ndo is look at what is on the label.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No. I would like to just finish my presentation on this \npart here, and then I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. COATS. If the Senator will yield----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is just the part I am going to mention.\n  Let me quote some extracts because that is the issue that is before \nus--the extracts of the promotion. This is the promotion that some do \nnot think is being promoted by U.S. Surgical, even though its logo is \non it, even though doctors have said it is being distributed by company \nrepresentatives.\n  This is the quote:\n\n       U.S. Surgical is entering a new millennium in breast \n     surgery by combining advanced stereotactic technology with \n     minimal invasive surgery.\n\n  Not biopsy, surgery.\n\n       Unlike needle biopsies where small samples of the lesion \n     are removed for pathological analysis, U.S. Surgical removes \n     the entire specimen.\n\n  That sounds like an operation to me.\n\n       If the specimen proves to be cancerous but pathology \n     reports the entire margin is clear, its up to the clinical \n     judgment of the surgeon to decide to remove the additional \n     tissue, or if the procedure can be considered complete.\n\n  Translated, if you use this device and you take out the tumor, then \nit is the doctor who removes the tumor who makes the judgment whether \nhe has to do any other surgery. That is not a biopsy needle. It \ncontinues.\n\n       The U.S. Surgical system allows the surgeon to provide the \n     benefits of the minimally invasive technique to breast \n     surgery. Benefits to the patients include reduced physical \n     and emotional trauma as a woman undergoes only one versus two \n     procedures. Minimal invasive breast surgery, a new standard \n     of patient care offered only by United States Surgical \n     Corporation.\n\n  I rest my case on that, Mr. President, about advertising and \npromotion. I rest my case on exactly the words of that \npromotion. ``Minimal invasive breast surgery, a new standard of patient \ncare offered only by United States Surgical Corporation.''\n\n  If there are Members in this body who want to say U.S. Surgical is \nnot promoting it, that they are not associated with it, that they don't \nknow anything about it, I suggest that they watch this videotape.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to just come back to--how much time \nremains\n\n[[Page S9749]]\n\nbecause I know there are others who wish to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 33 minutes and 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield at this point now. I would like to go on to just \nsome other remarks.\n  Mr. COATS. Just briefly. Senator Dodd asked the question, if this is \nsuch an egregious violation of FDA policy, why hasn't FDA acted on it? \nWhy has it not acted?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. They have. As I understand, they have requested the \nadditional information on safety and efficacy. They are demanding that \nkind of information now. I will be glad to provide that.\n  But that has as much relevancy as yesterday's score of the Green Bay \nPackers. They are out there now promoting this for unintended uses. I \ndo not think they should be. FDA says they are looking into this. I \nwill find out and give the Senator a more detailed description.\n  Mr. COATS. I have a copy of a letter. The Senator was handed a \nletter. I was handed a letter.\n  The letter was addressed to Senator Kennedy thanking him personally \nfor the assistance that he provided, for the ``assistance provided by \nyour staff'' to U.S. Surgical ``in our efforts to deal with the Food \nand Drug Administration on the matter of the certification of the \nAdvanced Breast Biopsy Instrumentation.''\n  That is what we are talking about.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Sure.\n  Mr. COATS. It says here the Senator assisted in making sure the FDA \ndid not withdraw it. It specifically cites, ``Please convey my \ngratitude to Dr. David Nexon and Gerry Kavanaugh,'' who I believe are \non the Senator's staff, ``for their willing assistance.'' Maybe they \nare on the market because the Senator intervened to keep it on the \nmarket.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Senator, I will be glad, first of all, to have it \nincluded in the Record so the record is clear. But I will say to you \nthat, if U.S. Surgical was distorting and misrepresenting to the \nAmerican public, then I think they ought to be pursued to every extent \nof the law. That is my response on it.\n  I had no idea of that unfair kind of consideration at that time, but \nclearly they have misrepresented themselves in this instance. They \npracticed that kind of misrepresentation on me as they are doing it \nwith the American public.\n  Mr. COATS. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Here is their--I will yield briefly on this point. But I \nwant to get back to my theme.\n  Mr. COATS. Apparently they convinced your staff, Dr. Nexon, that this \nwas a safe procedure and it should not be withdrawn.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to take a look at the letter.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Thermo Electron,\n\n                                     Waltham, MA, October 8, 1996.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ted: I want to thank you personally for the guidance \n     and assistance provided by your staff to our representatives, \n     and those of U.S. Surgical Corporation, in our efforts to \n     deal with the Food and Drug Administration on the matter of \n     the certification of the Advanced Breast Biopsy \n     Instrumentation (ABBI) system technology. Our concern, simply \n     stated, is that the FDA will call for the withdrawal of this \n     product from the market without appropriate cause.\n       The ABBI technology, jointly developed and marketed by both \n     companies, is today in the marketplace, and as a result of \n     its success, represents a fast-growing opportunity for Thermo \n     Electron's Trex Medical Corporation subsidiary and our \n     Connecticut partners, U.S. Surgical. The technology is a non-\n     invasive, cost-effective alternative to surgery. In over 500 \n     cases in which it has been utilized, there has not been a \n     single complaint. Indeed, because it does represent a \n     significant advance in women's health care, it is fast \n     becoming the treatment of choice.\n       Thermo Electron has made a significant investment in this \n     technology, and with the recent acquisition of XRE \n     Corporation of Littleton, Massachusetts, plans to expand \n     production of the product. Along with one hundred new jobs, \n     we are projecting revenue production in excess of $50 \n     million. Thermo Electron is proud of its responsiveness to \n     societal needs. The ABBI technology is a step forward in the \n     field of women's health care.\n       Thank you for your interest, and please convey my gratitude \n     to Dr. David Nexon and Gerry Kavanaugh for their willing \n     assistance.\n           Best regards,\n                                            George N. Harsopoulos,\n                                            Chairman of the Board.\n\n  (Mr. SESSIONS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from Indiana introduced a copy of a letter \nfrom a Massachusetts constituent of mine dated October 8, 1996, which \npurports to thank me for the guidance and assistance my staff provided \nto U.S. Surgical Corp. in connection with the FDA certification of the \nadvanced breast biopsy instrumentation [ABBI]. The Senator suggested \nthat this letter was proof that I had intervened with the FDA to urge \nthem to approve an off-label use for this device. The letter does not \nsubstantiate any such allegation, and it is untrue. I ask that the full \ntext of the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Thermo Electron,\n\n                                     Waltham, MA, October 8, 1996.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ted: I want to thank you personally for the guidance \n     and assistance provided by your staff to our representatives, \n     and those of U.S. Surgical Corporation, in our efforts to \n     deal with the Food and Drug Administration on the matter of \n     the certification of the Advanced Breast Biopsy \n     Instrumentation (ABBI) system technology.

Harsopoulos,\n                                            Chairman of the Board.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Obviously, if it is a biopsy needle and it was intended \nto do that, I had no idea they were out there promoting, as they have \nbeen, and representing it for an entirely different purpose. That is \nthe issue we are talking about here, and that is what we want to do. We \nwant to make certain that the FDA is going to be able to look beyond \nfalse and misleading information on devices labels.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield in just a moment now.\n  Mr. DODD. Just on this point, if I could, on the point of the needle.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On the needle? All right.\n  Mr. DODD. I'd like to clear up for everyone why we are discussing the \nsize of the needle for the biopsy. Let's put aside for a moment your \nquestion of what the company has or hasn't said since we have been told \nthat the FDA has not found that they are promoting the needle for tumor \nremoval.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I can reclaim my time, I cannot let that go by, that \nthe FDA has said they are not promoting it. That is not the information \non it. I cannot let the statement go by. It is your opinion that it is \nnot promoting. I don't see how you can have that opinion in the face of \nthe fact that this videotape has stated what it has, with this U.S. \nSurgical's logo right on it.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, as I said earlier, if U.S. \nSurgical were promoting for uses beyond those on the label, I think the \nFDA would be acting on it. But let me again get to the point of why a \nlarger needle is useful in some biopsies situations. I am not a surgeon \nor a doctor, but I am just sharing with my colleagues here, and my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, why this larger needle may be needed. \nThis Advanced Breast Biopsy device, as it is called, does remove a \nlarger amount of tissue\n\n[[Page S9750]]\n\nthan a conventional biopsy needle. Why? Why does it need to do that? \nThis difference in needle size is not related to tumor removal. Rather, \nit addresses clinicians' requirements for sampling different types of \nlesions. Why do they do that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If my colleague----\n  Mr. DODD. I will just finish the paragraph. Breast lesions exist not \nonly as discrete nodules but oftentimes as clusters of tiny particles \nknown as microcalcifications. These microcalcifications appear diffuse \non an X-ray; similar to the Milky Way. That's how surgeons describe it.\n  Due to this fact, obtaining adequate amounts of tissue for biopsy is \nimportant in order to optimize accurate diagnosis, so that women don't \nhave to go through surgery unnecessarily. This needle allows clinicians \nto take a larger single sampling, rather than many, painful, smaller \nsamples that could perhaps miss the tumor tissue. That is why this \nproduct was developed. That is why it has been so supported by women \nand by surgeons.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts can talk about videos that promote \npurposes other than this one. However, if that is the case, the FDA \nought to be in there this very minute. But, they have not acted because \nno violation has occurred.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is not correct. The FDA is out there looking \ninto this, and it doesn't do much good to try to cloud up the issue as \nto what the purported purpose of this particular medical device is.\n  Here is what is in the ad. I say again, I wish the Senator would look \nat the ad, rather than just reading the U.S. Surgical statements on it. \nThis is what their ad says:\n\n       Minimal invasive breast surgery. A new standard of patient \n     care offered only by United States Surgical Corporation.\n\n  That is what the ad says. It doesn't say minimal invasive biopsy; it \nsays breast surgery.\n  Maybe that is a new way of doing it. Maybe that is the best way that \nhas ever been devised for protecting American women in terms of breast \ntumors. But the FDA does not have one sentence of proof or evidence \nfrom U.S. Surgical that provides data on the safety and effectiveness \non this method of removing a tumor that other medical devices should \nprovide. They have the biopsy needle. It is effectively the size of \nthis pencil. They want one that is 50 times larger. You don't have to \nhave a lot of sense to know what this is all about.\n\n  Maybe U.S. Surgical convinced the Senator from Connecticut. But the \ndocuments and their promotional materials indicate what they are about, \nand that is to provide for removal of tumors from American women, one \nout of seven, who have breast cancer. And doctors who see, ``Approved \nby the FDA,'' then tell their patient this has been approved by the \nFDA, that it must be safe, and so they undergo tumor removal with this \ndevice. These women are entitled to adequate protection, to know \nwhether that device was safe in removing that tumor. They do not know \nthat today.\n  And that is just the tip of the iceberg. You know about all the other \nkinds of medical devices that can fall within this category. We have \nmentioned some, like the mammography screening machines that may \nmisdiagnose breast cancer. All this amendment says is, you cannot, if \nyou are a medical device company, submit false and misleading \ninformation. I can say it another way, ``Do you want false and \nmisleading information on the labeling?'' If you vote against our \namendment, that is what you are going to be pegged with. We are going \nto be characterized as not caring if labels are false and misleading.\n  Why can't we say we will support the labeling as long as it is not \nfalse and misleading? That doesn't sound like an extraordinary or \nrevolutionary concept. This is basically what we are arguing about. \nThose who are opposed to us say, ``All right, let them provide false \nand misleading information.'' That is the other side of this argument. \nIf they are not going to go through this kind of loophole, to promote \nit for some other reason, what do they have to fear?\n  Mr. President, there are all kinds of technologies out there that are \njust on the cusp, ready to go on ahead through this particular kind of \nloophole. You have the mammography screening machines that have not \nbeen certified for use in screening. The manufacturers have not been \nprovided information on that use. We know the difficulty we have faced \nin terms of mammography machinery and false negatives and false \npositives.\n  Are we going to come out on the side of protecting American women on \nbreast cancer, or are we going to say we are going support whatever any \nmedical device company wants to do, no matter how false and misleading \nthat information may be? The vast majority of manufacturers won't use \nthis loophole. But you don't hear the arguments here about what the \nfinancial benefit will be to those companies that will not have to \nconduct the exhaustive tests for safety and efficacy. They will be at a \ncompetitive advantage over the other medical device companies that are \ntrying to do it right.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In a second. Because there will be those in those \ncorporate boardrooms who will say, look, our competitor is getting in \nthrough this particular labeling device loophole. All you have to do is \nchange the label a little bit. We will be able to do it as well. We can \navoid the time it will take to do it right, we will save a good deal of \nour resources. We will get on the market sooner, we will beat the \ncompetitor, we will be on the shelves sooner.\n  We can use what U.S. Surgical did, where they denied--denied--that \nthey were promoting it, and yet they had some other group that was \nputting promoting it with their logo, talking about using it for an \nentirely different purpose.\n  That is the issue. This is not a very complex issue. We heard earlier \nabout sifting out the chaff and moving to the substance on this. This \nis it.\n  What woman in this country who is facing having a tumor removed from \nher breast by a medical device believes that device is a low risk \ndevice? What mother that looks over a sick child in the hospital and \nsees a ventilator, thinks that ventilator is low risk? That is the \nreason that the Secretary of HHS, the President of the United States, \nvirtually every consumer group, every patients' group, every group that \nwill benefit the most by this kind of innovative progress in terms of \nmedical devices, are saying don't do this. Don't play with our future \nhealth, don't pass that provision without this language. That is what \nthey are telling us here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n\n  We have been out here with five different sets of language ready to \ncompromise. But, they won't compromise, they have the votes. They say, \n``We have the votes. We have the profits that are going to come from \nit.'' They will profit over their competition. Other hard-working, \ndecent, ethical medical device companies that are trying to play by the \nrules, trying to get their product in--are going to think, ``Why not? \nWhy not go ahead and do it the other way? Our competitors are doing it \nand beating the pants off of us.''\n  I have just a few moments and I will be glad to yield the floor.\n  The question is, will the Senate vote in favor of approving medical \ndevices based on false or misleading labels? Will the Senate allow \ndangerous medical devices that have not been tested for safety and \neffectiveness to be foisted on the American people? Will companies like \nU.S. Surgical Corp. be rewarded for deceiving the FDA? Will the Senate \nput a higher value on the profits of the powerful than the health of \nthe American people?\n  Section 404 of the FDA bill requires the FDA to approve a medical \ndevice based on the user claim on the label submitted by the \nmanufacturer, even if that label is false or misleading. It prevents \nthe FDA from requiring the manufacturers to show their product is safe \nand effective for the purposes for which it will really be used--as \nopposed to the purpose falsely claimed on the label. It stands 20 years \nof progress toward safer and more effective medical devices on its \nhead.\n\n  Nothing better shows the need for the Reed-Kennedy amendment than the \nrecent history of the advanced breast biopsy instrumentation system, a \ndevice developed and marketed by the U.S. Surgical Corp. This attempt \nto mislead the FDA and foist an untested machine on women with breast \ncancer\n\n[[Page S9751]]\n\nshows why it is critical that section 404 not be passed in its current \nform.\n  The U.S. Surgical Corp. submitted their new machine to the FDA for \napproval based on a labeled claim that it was to be used for biopsying \nbreast tissue suspected of being malignant. This is a common procedure \nused when mammograms or other diagnostic techniques identify suspicious \nlooking areas of the breast that may indicate malignant tumors. If the \nbiopsy of a small piece of the suspicious material indicates a \nmalignancy, surgery would normally follow to remove the cancerous \ntissue.\n  But U.S. Surgical's labeled claim was false. One of the models of the \nmachine was designed to excise a piece of tissue 50 times as large as \nprevious biopsy instruments--the size of a piece of a hot dog as \ncompared to the size of the tip of a lead pencil. It was clearly \ndesigned to be used to excise small tumors--not just to perform a \nbiopsy. But the machine was not tested to see whether it was safe and \neffective for this purpose. The company was, in effect, proposing to \nsubject women with breast cancer to surgery with a machine that might \nhave been less effective in curing their illness than existing \ntherapies.\n  Women ought to have a choice on existing therapies whether they want \nto take a chance on this.\n  It placed the company's profits first--and the patient's needs last.\n  In fact, the only clinical testing the company submitted to the FDA \nin support of their application had been performed on seven cow's \nudders and two pieces of beef.\n  Because FDA initially relied on U.S. Surgical's false and misleading \nlabel, the device was subjected only to an engineering review and was \ncleared for use on February 1, 1996. Had the product been honestly \nlabeled, FDA would have reviewed it using a multidisciplinary team and \nrequired the company to present genuine clinical data in support of the \napplication.\n  On March 29, 1996, the FDA obtained a copy of a promotional videotape \nthat U.S. Surgical was distributing to physicians to try to sell their \nproduct. The videotape clearly describes the device as appropriate for \nsurgically removing small lumps of cancerous tissue. Let me quote some \nextracts from this slick production:\n\n       U.S. Surgical is entering a new millennium in breast \n     surgery by combining advanced stereotactic technology with \n     minimally invasive surgery * * *.\n       Unlike needle biopsies where small samples of the lesion \n     are removed for pathological analysis, the ABBI system \n     removes the entire specimen * * *.\n       If the specimen proves to be cancerous but pathology \n     reports the entire margin is clear, it is up to the clinical \n     judgment of the surgeon to decide to remove additional tissue \n     or if the procedure can be considered complete.\n       The ABBI system allows surgeons to provide the benefits of \n     a minimally invasive technique to breast surgery. * * *\n       Benefits to the patient include: reduced physical and \n     emotional trauma as a woman undergoes only 1 versus 2 \n     procedures. * * *\n       Minimally invasive breast surgery. A new standard of \n     patient care offered only by United States Surgical \n     Corporation.\n\n  They have the audacity to suggest they are not promoting it.\n  It is clear that this company has designed this machine for breast \nsurgery, not just biopsy. And it is promoting it for this purpose--\ndespite the false and misleading label submitted to the FDA.\n  Here is what a distinguished physician, Dr. Monica Morrow, professor \nof surgery at Northwestern University, had to say about the company's \nmachine--I referenced that--\n\n       I am writing to express my feelings regarding the \n     importance of the FDA's mandate to evaluate ``behind the \n     label'' uses of devices and drugs.\n       The need for such evaluation is clearly exemplified by the \n     marketing strategy for the U.S. Surgical breast biopsy device \n     (ABBI). This device was approved for use as a diagnostic \n     instrument. However, the company video clearly depicts the \n     use of the device for definitive breast cancer therapy.\n       No clinical trials using the accepted techniques for \n     comparing cancer treatments have been conducted to validate \n     this claim, and without such trials, the device could \n     potentially pose a significant risk to patients. In addition, \n     other claims regarding improved cosmetic outcome and patient \n     acceptance are similarly unsubstantiated. The indications for \n     the uses of devices and drugs should be determined by \n     appropriate clinical and scientific data, and not by their \n     appeal as marketing gimmicks.\n       This video was dropped off in my office by a company \n     representative as part of an effort to interest me in \n     purchasing this equipment.\n\n  When the FDA became aware that the company was promoting the device \nfor this unauthorized purpose, it also became aware that it had made a \nmistake in clearing a device that was clearly designed for a purpose \nnot stated on the label--tumor removal--without adequate clinical \ntesting. The FDA then acted to require the company to include a strong \ncautionary label that the device was only to be used for tissue \nsampling, not tumor excision. And it required it to submit clinical \ndata on its use for the original claimed purpose of biopsy. Based on \nthis revised label and the new clinical data, the FDA re-cleared the \nmachine for breast biopsy on September 24, 1996.\n  That is what the FDA has been doing, effectively denying them the \nopportunity to use it for these other purposes, and permitting them to \nuse it only for biopsy.\n  And it further required the company to conduct studies on the safety \nand effectiveness of the machine for tumor removal, studies which are \nongoing.\n  Evidently, the company, when asked to provide the additional studies, \nthey agreed. That is interesting, isn't it? Now, once they have gotten \ncaught they say, ``OK, we'll supply the data.''\n  If section 404 is passed in its current form, the FDA will be \nhandcuffed in its efforts to protect the public against untested and \npotentially harmful--even fatal--devices. Under current law, the FDA is \nable to require that the company develop data to show that the new \ndevice was safe and effective for removing tumors--the real use \nintended by the company, not the false and misleading use submitted on \ntheir proposed label. When the FDA made a mistake and inappropriately \ncleared the device, it had the authority to go back to the company and \nwarn that it would revoke their approval unless adequate warnings were \nplaced on the label and necessary clinical testing was performed.\n  I hope our colleagues will listen to this.\n  But under section 404 of the FDA reform bill, the FDA would be forced \nto approve the new device without such evidence. Unscrupulous companies \nwill not only be allowed but encouraged to submit misleading labels, \nbecause they will gain a competitive advantage over companies that play \nby the rules.\n  American women do not want to die from breast cancer because \ncompanies are allowed to sell devices that may be unsafe and \nineffective. No Senator would want their own wife or mother or daughter \nto be subjected to such an untested device, solely because a greedy \ncompany wanted higher profits.\n  The issue goes far beyond products to excise breast cancer. If \napplies to lasers to treat prostate disease, stents to be placed in \ncarotid arteries, imaging systems to detect breast cancer, and a host \nof other treatments for dread diseases.\n  The FDA believes those numbers will increase dramatically as the new \ntechnologies come into play.\n  If allowed to stand, this provision will give unscrupulous companies \na license to lie to the FDA. It will penalize ethical companies who are \ntruthful and do the necessary testing to prove that their products are \nsafe and effective. Most of all, it will put the health of American \npeople at risk so that a greedy few may profit.\n  Companies that hope to benefit by weakening the FDA are powerful and \nprofitable. They believe they have the votes to push this disgraceful \nprovision through the U.S. Senate. Later today, we will see if they are \ncorrect. But if the American people truly understand what is at stake, \nI do not believe they will permit this dangerous provision to become \nlaw. When the vote comes, we will see how many Senators are willing to \nstand with the American people--and how many are willing to vote in \nfavor of false and misleading labeling. And let me make very clear that \nthis vote will not be the end of the story, whichever way it ends up. \nWe will continue to fight to keep this provision from becoming law, and \nI believe we will ultimately succeed.\n  The FDA reform bill has many constructive elements. But this \ndisgraceful provision should be eliminated. False or misleading labels \nshould have no place in approval of medical devices. Unscrupulous \nmanufacturers do not deserve a free ride at the expense of public \nhealth.\n  The Reed-Kennedy amendment will protect Americans against dangerous\n\n[[Page S9752]]\n\nmachines and unethical practices. It is a simple amendment. It says \nthat the FDA should not be bound by the company's label if the label is \nfalse or misleading. Every Member of the Senate should support this \nsimple, common-sense change. I know that the American public supports \nit.\n  And I know that every patient and every physician deserve to know \nthat the FDA has had a fair opportunity to assure that the devices on \nwhich lives and health depend are safe and effective.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Let me try to remove some of the confusion that I think \nmust exist. Certainly the Senator from Massachusetts most eloquently \nhas expressed his feelings, but his feelings and the law are not \nnecessarily the same.\n  I point out, first of all, that false statements, all these kinds of \nproblems, are certainly reachable. Let us get back to where we are. Let \nus remove first a couple of the things that have been invoked here in \nthe discussion. Fen/phen, for instance. Fen/phen deals with drugs, not \nwith devices. So do not get that confused with this particular \nsituation here.\n  In addition to that, I point out that because of the off-label use of \ndrugs, this committee appropriately put in place a system which would \nhave probably even prevented fen/phen but at least would have made it \npossible for the FDA to intervene through the knowledge that they might \nnot have had. So I want to take that completely out. That just raises \ninsecurities in people which is inappropriate under this legislation.\n  Second, with respect to the debate on devices, I think it is \nimportant that we take a look at what we are talking about here. \nDevices are different from drugs. Devices have to do with things which \nare implanted in you or are used like the neck collar, whatever else, \nwhich do require approval.\n  There are two ways to approve these matters. One is the PMA, the \npremarketing approval.\n  The amendment that they are asking for would require not only the \npremarketing analysis but would move the same kinds of standards which \nare in the premarketing approval process over to the 510(k) process.\n  Why is that? First of all, the premarket approval is the one which \nrequires all the clinical trials and tests and which makes it very \nclear as to whether a device is going to create a threat.\n  Let us put that into dimension here. Just in the 510(k) process, \nthere were over 5,000 a year. Over the last 6 years that has been about \n30,000 devices. There have only been five or six that have created any \nproblem which required mandatory recall.\n  So that evidence is with respect to two points: First, these are rare \nthings and, second, there is the present ability to handle those \nsituations.\n  So by putting in these words ``false and misleading,'' you take this \ndevice basically and move it back in under the premarketing approval \nprocess because, if you have to approve everything, if you have the \nduty of going out and inquiring among doctors, ``Are you using this \ndevice which has already been approved?'' and you say, ``I have \nsomething which is substantially equivalent to be used for that \npurpose,'' they would have the burden of going out among the doctors \nand finding out what the practice of medicine is and whether their \ndevice was being used for something other than what it was approved for \nunder the premarketing approval process.\n  That means a huge increase in costs to each of these companies that \nare trying to get something on the market to compete with the one that \nis already on the market. This creates huge delays. And for what \nreason? For no real purpose because it is only going to be used for \nthat use intended unless somebody decides to use it otherwise.\n\n  So I think we have to remember here there is authority under the law \nfor those people who abuse the process. But one of the purposes of the \n510(k) was to reduce the time so that competition can get out there \nwith a better device and bring the costs down because there would be no \nlonger a monopoly in that situation.\n  The second purpose is to relieve the FDA from having to recheck and \nreexamine a device which is substantially or equivalent to the one that \nhas already been studied and require the FDA to go out and examine all \nthe doctors, all those kinds of things and create a huge burden on the \nFDA.\n  So our purpose here in the bill is to make sure that we have an \nefficient, effective FDA with adequate resources to do their job. So I \nwant to make it clear as to what the discussion is supposed to be \nabout. I also remind you that the 510(k) process only applies to those \ndevices which are not life threatening, so they are not the devices \nthat would do the kind of horrendous things that the Senator from \nMassachusetts has alluded to.\n  I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. President, may I ask--the hour of 12:30 is going to arrive here. \nI think there has been an earlier order that would have us recess.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that we be allowed to proceed \nuntil 12:40.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I sat here and listened to this debate this morning. A \ngood part of it has been focused, not on the merits of the provision, \nbut on one individual company in the State of Connecticut, U.S. \nSurgical Corp., and a device which they developed for diagnostic \npurposes related to breast cancer.\n  I think it is unfortunate that there have been so many misleading \nstatements made about this company, who not once, but twice, received \nfull FDA approval for this diagnostic device.\n  I would like to make the fact extremely clear--just for the purposes \nof the Record. The company's original application was submitted to the \nFDA on October 5, 1995 and was cleared by the FDA 119 days later, on \nFebruary 1, 1996.\n\n  The company resubmitted their medical device under the 510(k) on \nSeptember 23, 1996, with additional clinical data requested by the FDA. \nThis resubmitted 510(k) was cleared by the FDA on December 20, 1996, 88 \ndays later. The process works.\n  I cite for the Record here, Mr. President, what is on the label.\n\n       Indication: For diagnostic sampling of breast tissue where \n     large diameter incisional breast biopsies are desired.\n       Contraindication: The device is used for diagnostic breast \n     tissue biopsies; it is not [in bold letters] intended for \n     therapeutic excision of tissues.\n\n  Now, I don't know what could be more clear than that. I ask unanimous \nconsent this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      ABBI biopsy device chronology\n            Original 510(K)                Indication: Transection of\n                                         tissue during a surgical biopsy\n                                                    procedure\nOctober 5, 1995                         Original 510(K) Premarket\n  through                                Notification submitted to FDA.\nFebruary 1, 1996                           Minor questions answered.\n                                        FDA clears 510(K) and issues\n                                         Substantial Equivalence letter.\n                                         (119 days)\n \nMay 8, 1996                             FDA raises questions regarding\n  through                                the ABBI device.\nJune 6, 1996                               FDA states they made a\n                                            mistake in clearing the\n                                            original 510(K) without\n                                            asking for clinical data.\n                                           FDA states USSC has done\n                                            nothing wrong; it was FDA\n                                            who neglected to request\n                                            data.\n \n                                           FDA issues Warning Letter to\n                                            USSC, 6/3/96, regarding\n                                            labeling and advertising\n                                            claims made for the ABBI.\n                                           FDA meeting held, 6/6/97,\n                                            with USSC, Dr. Barbara\n                                            Schwartzberg and Dr. Bill\n                                            Kelly to review data\n                                            demonstrating the safe and\n                                            efficacious use of the ABBI\n                                            as a diagnostic biopsy\n                                            device.

This is the chronology of the events. This device is being \nused to try and improve biopsy and diagnostic purposes and reduce, \nhopefully, the need for unnecessary surgery--something most people \napplaud. And the label clearly limits the product to that purpose.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts suggests that this is somehow a \nrationale for us to reduce or change the language of this bill that \ndeals with the approval process for less riskier medical devices. He \ncites a lot of examples that has nothing to do with this issue. Fen/\nphen has nothing to do with this amendment. The Dalkon shield has \nnothing to do with this amendment; that was a failure of technology \nthat had nothing to do with the intended purpose of the device.\n  The examples cited, one after another, do not address the issue at \nhand. The issue at hand is how the FDA interprets intended use in \nmaking a substantial equivalence determination --the first test a lower \nrisk device undergoes. That is what we are dealing with here.\n  If you have to say to a company that it must try and imagine what a \ndevice conceivably could be used for by some surgeon out there, and on \nthat basis FDA can hold up its 510(k), you might as well scrap 510(k) \nand make every new device, even low-risk ones, go through the PMA \nprocess. You can make a case for that, I suppose. But I don't hear \nanyone advocating that. But if you really believe that we ought to so \nchange this process, then get rid of 510(k) altogether--that is the \nsafest way to go. But again, I don't hear anyone suggesting that.\n  All we are saying here is, the FDA ought to look at the intended \npurpose listed, and ought not try and go beyond that, particularly when \nthey have full authority to apply the second test of reviewing \ntechnological differences. All we are trying to do here is to expedite \nthe process a bit so we do not delay further the ability of very \nworthwhile devices to get approved by the FDA and get to the \nmarketplace.\n  I regret deeply that a very fine company with a tremendous track \nrecord that has produced some wonderful devices has been the subject of \nan attack here on the floor. It is not deserved. It is not deserved. \nThey produce a very worthwhile product, the breast biopsy needle, that \nhas been approved by the FDA and is making a difference in women's \nlives. There are thousands of examples of where this device and other \nproducts made by this company have made a difference in people's lives. \nThis company, U.S. Surgical, has been manufacturing medical devices in \nConnecticut for over 30 years now and has an excellent track record for \nproducing safe, effective, and innovative products. In addition to \nsetting the gold standard for the laproscopic surgery devices, as I \nmentioned earlier, I should also note that U.S. Surgical pioneered the \ntechnique of closing wounds with staples, rather than sutures--a \nrevolution in everyday medical practice. The thousands of Connecticut \nworkers who help create these products, ought to be applauded by our \ncolleagues rather than used as an irrelevant example, somehow, of some \nattempt to limit the protections that the FDA offers.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I urge our colleagues, with all due \nrespect, to reject the Reed-Kennedy amendment and to support the \nprovision we have included in this legislation which we feel not only \nadequately protects people, but does even more than that. It allows \nthem to get the materials they need to see they have a healthier and \nsafe life.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, again I want to tell Members I think it is \nimportant to keep their eye on the goal here and on the facts. Senator \nDodd went through part of the chronology of the approval of the device \nthat Senator Kennedy was talking about.\n  I say to my colleagues, the system is working the way it is supposed \nto work. FDA has the authority. The company submitted the application, \nFDA cleared the device, then questions came up about it, and the FDA \nresponded and asked for some additional material, and then they \nacknowledge that, yes, we had the material, you sent it to us, but we \ndidn't get a chance to review it. We have now reviewed it.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. I will be happy to in a moment.\n  They made a change in the ``indication'' and ``contraindication'' in \naccordance with what FDA asked them to do. They resubmitted for a new \n510(k). FDA, with the help, apparently of Senator Kennedy and his \nstaff, approved the 510(k) and then the new 510(k) was applicable.\n  So that is exactly how FDA is supposed to work and it did work under \nthe existing procedures.\n  Again, over and over and over, what has not been described and \ndiscussed is the authority that the FDA has regarding changes in \ntechnology that raised questions of safety and efficacy, effectiveness \nof the predicate device.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. Happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If you would be willing just to maintain the current \nlaw, we could move very quickly toward final passage.\n  The Senator has just given an excellent explanation about how the FDA \nworks at the present time. That procedure is being halted dramatically \nin this law. So if the Senator would support----\n  Mr. COATS. Reclaiming my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I had yielded----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. I think the Senator from Massachusetts knows exactly what \nit is we are attempting to do and why we are doing it. It is part of \nthe two-part test. The second part, which the Senator admits on every \nexample he uses and every example he uses does not apply to the \nsituation as it exists. Dalkon shield has nothing to do with this; fen/\nphen, as the Senator knows, has nothing to do with this language. This \nwhole thing was supposedly prompted by the fen/phen scare, and the \nSenator failed to admit that fen/phen is a drug and not a device.\n  Most of us are trying to keep some level of patience and some level \nof perspective on this whole process and procedure. I don't know of \nanybody at U.S. Surgical--they may have visited my staff. I have never \ntalked to anybody that I know of from U.S. Surgical. I didn't even know \nthey made that device. All I know is when they got in trouble they went \nto Senator Kennedy, and the very device he is talking about that is so \ndangerous to women's health, he intervened, or at least participated in \nthe process of clearing U.S. Surgical.\n  I had printed in the Record the letter citing specifically Senator \nKennedy's help and the help of Dr. David Nexon, Senator Kennedy's \nstaffer and Gerry Kavanaugh. There was no explanation of that minor \nomission in the Senator's presentation. I would be interested to hear \nwhat that might be.\n  So, the Senator criticizes the Senator from Connecticut for \nsupporting this company and not being objective with the facts, when \nthe Senator, who is raising the issue in the first place, has been the \nperson to provide that support.\n  What we are attempting to do is to return to past law which sets in \nplace a reasonable procedure whereby devices that are substantially \nequivalent under FDA's determination to devices\n\n[[Page S9754]]\n\nthat have already gone through lengthy premarket approval processes, \nwhere those devices can be expedited into the system because there is \nno difference and the question is on the label what the intended use \nis, not on what somebody tries to make the intended use to be. It would \nbe impossible for anybody, any company, anybody to possibly speculate \nand list all the ways in which people might think up of using devices. \nThe company produces it for a specific purpose, it provides an \nindicator for a specific purpose, and a contraindicator for how it is \nnot to be used, and if there is in any way a technological change in \nthat device, then FDA has full and complete authority to deny the \nsubstantial equivalency label.\n  Let's keep our eyes focused on what we are attempting to do here and \nnot be confused by egregious examples that don't even fit the issue, \nthat don't even go to the core of what we are debating. It makes for \ngood theater. It makes for lousy legislation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk \nproceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nstand in recess until 2:15 p.m., and when the Senate reconvenes, there \nbe only the following time remaining, limited in the following fashion: \n20 minutes under the control of Senator Kennedy, 20 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Jeffords, 10 minutes under the control of Senator \nHarkin, and 10 minutes under the control of Senator Frist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I ask the \nmanager of the bill, would the 10 minutes under my control occur prior \nto the vote on the Reed-Kennedy amendment or after the vote?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. After the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today was a landmark day for the \nAmerican people in hearings before two Senate committee on which I \nserve.\n  As chairman of the Special Committee on Aging and the request of my \ncolleague, Senator Shelby, I assembled several panels to raise the \nawareness of the second-leading cause of cancer death for men: prostate \ncancer.\n  In the Finance Committee, we opened up 3 days of unprecedented \noversight hearings into systemic abuses of power by the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  The telephones were ringing off the hook in my office as these \nhearings were underway. That's how much these issues struck a chord \nwith the American people.\n  And suddenly, the hearings were canceled. Why? Was it a national \nemergency? The death of a colleague? An international crisis? Hardly.\n  Instead, the Democratic leadership used the Senate rules to shut down \nthe public's business.\n  They shut down important policy debates on prostate cancer and IRS \nabuses. And that's only in the two committees I was involved with. \nOther committees were affected.\n  What's apparently more important to the Democratic leadership than \nthese issues is a partisan political issue in Louisiana. It's an issue \ninvolving campaign irregularities in a campaign in Louisiana involving \none of our colleagues.\n  Certainly, this is an important issue, although political. But is it \nimportant enough to systematically close down the public's business?\n  The hearing before the Committee on Aging this morning was called at \nthe urging of Senator Shelby. He is a prostate cancer survivor. The \nhearing was designed literally to help save lives.\n  This year alone 335,000 American men will be diagnosed with prostate \ncancer. The ranking member of the Committee on Aging--Senator Breaux--\nand I worked to put together a healthy policy debate about treatment \noptions.\n  This productive debate, a debate that could help save lives, was cut \nshort this morning because of politically motivated maneuvering through \nSenate rules. We were therefore unable to engage in a full debate about \nwhen to screen and how to treat prostate cancer.\n  Among the 10 witnesses scheduled to testify this morning was the \ndistinguished former Senate majority leader Bob Dole. I'm happy we were \nable to hear his statement before the shutdown.\n  Senator Dole's testimony this morning was his first official event on \nCapitol Hill since he left the Senate in June 1996.\n  No better way, in my view, to get the message out.\n  Today, I think this legislative body would be well-served to remember \nthe productive, bi-partisan leadership of Senator Dole. The people's \nbusiness was always Bob Dole's first concern as he presided over the \nwork of the Senate for many years.\n  The second very important effort stopped by this maneuvering today \nwas landmark hearings of the Finance Committee to expose the excesses \nand abuses of the American taxpayer at the hands of the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  The fair-minded and very capable chairman, Senator Roth, spent 8 \nmonths preparing these hearings to talk about the specific problems and \nto consider specific solutions on how the IRS can be restructured to \nwork for taxpayers, not against them and at the expense of the civil \nliberties of individual Americans.\n  All of this was disrupted by the Democratic leadership who put petty \npolitics ahead of the public's health. I'm very disappointed. And I \nwouldn't be surprised to learn of the public's disappointment as well.\n  The Democratic leadership needs to explain to the American people why \npartisan politics seems more important than No. 1: raising the \nawareness of the second-leading cause of cancer death for men, prostate \ncancer. No. 2: exposing abuse and mistreatment of hardworking taxpayers \nat the hands of the IRS.\n  If you don't like the investigation into campaign irregularities in \nLouisiana, fine. But should the priorities of the American people be \nshoved aside for the partisan concerns of a political party? I don't \nthink so.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ARREARAGES\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand we are in the middle of debate \non FDA which has been going on for some days. I did want to talk \nbriefly about the President's comments in New York yesterday relative \nto the United Nations.\n  The President went to the U.N. General Assembly and made a very \neloquent speech, as he often does, in which he promised that he would \nbe paying what is represented to be the arrears of the people of the \nUnited States that we owe to the United Nations, arrears which is \nsomewhere around $1 billion. I think that was generous of the President \nto do that. But he should have made it much clearer what the conditions \nare for our paying those arrearages.\n  As chairman of the committee that has the authority over the spending \nof the money relative to the U.N. accounts, I have been working with \nSenator Helms and Senator Grams, along with the administration and with \nHouse Members, and we have developed a package which makes that payment \nto the United Nations conditioned. Unfortunately, the way the President \nexpressed it, the conditions were mentioned only in passing, and hardly \neven mentioned at that. But the conditions are critical.\n  The American people simply are not going to send another $1 billion \nto the United Nations unless the United Nations cleans up its act--\nunless they reduce the patronage; unless they put in place accounting \nprocedures that are trackable--so that we when we send $1 there we know \nwhere it goes.\n  Today the American citizens pay 25 cents of every $1 spent at the \nUnited Nations and the United Nations has no idea where that money is \nspent. Not only do they have no idea where most of that money is \nspent--they may have an idea but they certainly don't know specifically \nwhere it goes--but, more importantly than that, they don't have any \nsystems in place to assess whether or not the money is getting anything \nfor the dollars that are being spent.\n  What we are seeing is an institution which is rampant with \nmismanagement and inefficiencies. Regrettably, the President didn't \npoint that out. He had an excellent opportunity to stand before that \nbody and say, ``Listen, if you expect the American taxpayers to pay for \na quarter of the cost of this institution then the American taxpayers \nexpect adequate accounting. And the American taxpayers expect that it \nwill be spent on programs that work. And the American taxpayers do not \nwant to have their money spent on patronage. And they don't want to \nhave it mismanaged, and do not want to have it inefficiently used.''\n  The new Secretary General of the United Nations has given a \nsignificant number of talks on this topic. He has pushed forward an \nagenda for reform. But his agenda for reform doesn't go as far as the \nagreed to package, which passed out of this Senate with an overwhelming \nvote.\n  The simple fact is that I have come to the floor today to restate the \nobvious, which is that we are not going to send $1 billion to the \nUnited Nations until the conditions of that package are met, until we \nknow that the dollars are being spent effectively, and until we know \nthat there is in place a reform effort which is going to work.\n  I regret that the President did not take the opportunity to express \nthat thought to the membership of the United Nations. But I think the \npoint should be clarified before the people who are expecting to get \ntheir billion dollars think they have a blank check, because they \ndon't. We are not going to tolerate it.\n  I yield the time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9755-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9755-S9769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION MODERNIZATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF \n                                  1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1177\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we have 20 minutes to each \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 19 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes to Senator Reed. I will take 9 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, we debated this morning the Reed amendment, which \nwould give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to look \nbehind the labeled use in evaluating a class 1 or class 2 medical \ndevice before that device would be sold on the marketplace. My \namendment is very simple. It would allow the FDA, if they felt the \nlabel was misleading or false, to ask for additional information with \nrespect to possible uses other than the labeled use. This is consistent \nwith their current practice. And it would protect the public health \ndramatically.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I heard opposition on the floor this morning to the amendment--first, \nnot so much opposition but an attempt to diminish the importance of \nthis amendment by saying, ``Well, class 1 and 2 devices are just simple \nlittle medical devices. They are low-risk medical devices.'' I don't \nknow about you. But, like many Americans, I think the definition of a \nlow-risk medical device is a device that is being put into someone \nelse's body, not my own. Because, if there is any type of device that \nis coming into a person's body, they expect and anticipate that the FDA \nwould thoroughly review it, ask all the questions, and look at all the \npossible uses that are reasonably discernible from the device itself.\n  The other objection which has been made to the amendment is that it \nis unnecessary because the FDA can step in and ask for this type of \ninformation. But, in fact, that is not the case.\n  As some have explained here today, there is a two-prong test to get \n501(k) approval under current. First, the device must be substantially \nequivalent to another device already on the market, and this device \nperforms essentially the same task that the other device does. If there \nare technological differences in the device, then the FDA can make an \nevaluation of this technology to determine its effectiveness.\n  But all of these different tests collapse into one point. The \nquestion is, what is the device being used for?\n  That is where the current language in the bill is so restrictive of \nFDA responsibility and the obligation we expect them to discharge. \nBecause, according to the language in the bill, the FDA and the \nSecretary of HHS reviewing any of these proposals could only do so with \nrespect to the intended use of the device based on the intended use \nincluded in the proposed labeling of the device.\n  You have to evaluate these devices for safety and health, and \nefficacy based upon some use. And if the FDA is restricted solely to \nthe use indicated on the label, then they will not be able to look \nbehind the label to other possible uses--look beyond the label to other \npossible ways--in which the device could be used and ask for supporting \ndata to justify those uses.\n  We have seen and heard examples today on the floor with respect to \nbiopsy needles, with respect to lasers, with respect to a host of very \nimportant medical devices. The American public I hope would demand that \nthese devices be evaluated thoroughly for all reasonable uses--not only \nthe use that a manufacturer would suggest as a way to take advantage of \nthis expedited procedure for review and entry into the marketplace.\n  One does not have to repute ill will or bad motives to the \nmanufacturers of these devices. Simply stated, they have a tremendous \nincentive to get these items into the marketplace. Once they are in the \nmarketplace, there are different uses that could be promoted.\n  Also, in terms of marketing, there are scores of salesmen and women \nwho are zealous in trying to promote these goods. They might not be as \nscrupulous with respect to these uses as intended by the manufacturer.\n  All of these factored together suggest strongly that if we do not \ninitially have a good approval process which allows the Food and Drug \nAdministration to look behind the label, to look at likely uses other \nthan the ones presented by the company, we could run the risk of \nintroducing medical devices into the marketplace that would be harmful \nto the American public.\n\n[[Page S9756]]\n\n  We have made great progress on this legislation. We have done so \nbecause we all feel sincerely that our chief responsibility is to \nprotect the public health. My amendment would do so.\n  My amendment would give the FDA the authority to request additional \nsafety information in the rare circumstances in which they have \nsuspicions that the labeled use is either false or misleading. The FDA \ncould look behind that label and require additional data before they \nwould release a device onto the marketplace.\n  I hope that we all support this concept. I hope we can all rally \naround the principle that when in doubt, and when confused about the \ndifferent interpretations of various sections, that we will ultimately \nallow the FDA to use its judgment and its discretion to protect the \npublic health of the American people.\n  I yield our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Tennessee 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, the issue that we are facing in the next several \nminutes on which my colleagues will be voting appears very simple on \nthe surface. Why would anybody oppose an amendment that really strikes \nat the heart of what so much of the FDA is about--that is, a medical \nlabel that is maybe false or misleading?\n  So, on the surface it seems simple. But it really is not. The larger \nbill, the underlying bill, is about strengthening the FDA, and making \nsure that we fulfill that mission to the American people of having \nproducts, drugs, and devices that improve health and not huge barriers \nthat push over the great new technological advancements that we see--\npush them off into the future so that we cannot benefit from the \ntechnology that is out there today.\n  The amendment is unnecessary. The amendment we are going to be voting \non right now is unnecessary, and a little bit worrisome because if it \nwere to pass, there is a possibility that we hurt the system. In other \nwords, we disallow improved devices which can benefit heart disease or \nlung disease, we put up barriers and push them off into the future. So \nif the amendment passes, it may be harmful. It clearly is unnecessary \ntoday.\n  The bottom line is this. The Food and Drug Administration is required \nto deny premarket approval for a device if the proposed label is false \nor misleading--current law--and that is why it is unnecessary.\n  To really understand the overall process, we talk about 510(k) and \nPMA, premarket approval. It is really pretty simple. You have a device \ntoday that goes through the FDA system that has all sorts of standards \nthat have to be met in terms of safety, efficacy, and false and \nmisleading labels. That device goes through that process, what is \ncalled the PMA, premarket approval of the device. Then with technology \nand science new devices, better devices are developed; for example, a \nstint in the heart after a heart attack. Over time you improve the \nstint. That is the great thing about science today. That improved \ndevice may be almost exactly like the earlier version of that device. \nThe FDA has to make a decision. Does it go through a process which says \nthey are so similar that there is no reason to make it go through all \nthe other standards or is it different enough it has to go through all \nthe initial requirements and jump through the hoops and standards, and \nthe FDA has to make that decision. Premarket approval initially, an \nimprovement on that device or a new device, is it similar enough. Now, \nthe words are used, is it substantially equivalent to the initial \ndevice itself. FDA has to make that decision.\n  What we really have not talked very much about is how they make that \ndecision. It is written in the current law. We do not do anything about \ncurrent law today, whether or not this new version is ``substantially \nequivalent.'' Those are the words.\n  What is the requirement? What is the current law? They are \nsubstantially equivalent if, No. 1, the new device has the same \nintended use as the earlier device and--and--it has the same \ntechnological characteristics as the predicate device.\n  Now, that is a pretty good standard because the idea is, if you get a \nlittle stint that you put in the heart and it is improved, it works \nbetter, same principles, technologically equivalent, same intended use, \nthen you go through this process of the 510(k).\n  Now, the amendment we are going to be voting on says we have to put \nit back again through the false or misleading label requirement. \nRemember, this improved device going through this process has already \nmet the criteria of false and misleading labeling when it was in the \nPMA, the initial approval. That is very important to understand because \nwe all are against anything in terms of labeling that is false or \nmisleading. It is very important to understand the process.\n  So what we are debating right now is not whether a label is false or \nmisleading but whether the FDA will have the ability to compel a \nmanufacturer to produce clinical data to prove safety and efficacy for \nuses that are not included on the label. This brings me to the \nworrisome part of this amendment. Again, I am very comfortable that the \nFDA has standards today to make sure that the labeling is honest, is \ntruthful. The worrisome thing is about just what if the FDA came in and \nsaid that this device, which is medically equivalent to an earlier \ndevice, technologically improved but the equivalent device, what if the \nFDA says, ``No, let's make people go back and jump through all the \ninitial hoops once again.''\n  We already know for a device that we are not meeting device approval \nor disapproval over the time required in statutes. Already it takes \nmonths and years to go through the approval process. So with every \nimprovement, when it is substantially equivalent to the earlier device, \nif we take all those improvements, make them meet all these new \ncriteria again, what are we going to do? We are going to push off the \ngreat advancements today to save lives, to improve the quality of life \nto some time in the future where we and maybe even our children cannot \nbenefit from that device.\n\n  Now, a key question that I think we all have is, if a device is \ndetermined by the FDA to be safe and effective for the labeled use, \nshould the FDA--for the labeled use that has been approved --should the \nFDA be able to force a manufacturer to produce a clinical device that \nis safe and effective for other uses, other uses. Remember, it is \napproved for what is on the label. I would answer no. We do not do that \nfor pharmaceuticals today. We do not do it for drugs today. Should we \ndo it for devices? I say no.\n  My real fear is that when the FDA reaches outside of the proposed \nlabeling, it is going to require a very subjective decision in \ndetermining what goes through those initial PMA, premarket criteria.\n  Finally, let me also step back and look at the enforcement procedures \nthat the FDA already has. My colleagues make it sound as if the FDA is \nunable to protect the public health by keeping unsafe products off the \nmarket. In fact, the FDA today has the enforcement authority which \nallows the agency to remove devices that endanger public health from \nuse and availability immediately, even if the device is on the market \nand the manufacturer's intended use for a device changes over time.\n  Any device which the FDA has, and I quote, ``a reason to believe is \nmisbranded or adulterated in any way'' can be detained today under law. \nFDA has a long list of remedies to protect consumers against persons \nwho violate device laws including criminal prosecution, injunctions, \ncivil seizures, and civil penalties.\n  Claims were made earlier by some of my colleagues that manufacturers \nwill market and advertise for uses other than those approved by the \nFDA. That is illegal today.\n  Under the proposed bill--not the amendment, the underlying proposed \nbill--it is illegal. Again, let me say claims have been made over the \ncourse of the morning by some of my colleagues that manufacturers will \nmarket and advertise for uses other than those approved by the FDA. \nThat is illegal. The Reed amendment does not change the fact that \nmanufacturers cannot do this today, and it does not\n\n[[Page S9757]]\n\nchange the fact that the FDA has enforcement authority today.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Again, I \nthink it is unnecessary and worrisome in the sense that it would raise \nthe barriers sufficiently in an unnecessary way for approval of devices \nthat are substantially equivalent to devices that already have jumped \nthrough the hoops.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Chair informs the Senator \nfrom Vermont there are 8 minutes 32 seconds remaining under his control \nand the Senator from Massachusetts has 12 minutes remaining under his \ncontrol.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am going to repeat points that have \nalready been made, because I think it is essential to the understanding \nof what we are about here just before we are ready to vote.\n  Section 404, the section under debate, preserves a very key premarket \nstatutory authority to the agency. It is important for Members to \nunderstand that the agency can call, still call for a premarket action \nrequiring full data on the safety and effectiveness whenever there is a \ntechnological difference arising, and I quote from the statute, ``that \nraises different questions of safety and effectiveness in the earlier \napproved device.''\n\n  This authority is premarket. In other words, the product is never \ncleared for marketing. It is never distributed before the agency has an \nopportunity to act.\n  The authority is extremely broad. As soon as a product raises a \nquestion about safety and effectiveness, the agency can require the \nfiling of a premarket authority, PMA. The agency retains full \ndiscretion to control the showing of safety and effectiveness. There \nare no words of limitation on that statutory authority. I point out \nthat that authority has never been challenged successfully by a company \nin court.\n  It was Senator Kennedy's own committee, as chairman of the committee, \nhis own committee report on safe medical devices in the 1990 Device Act \nthat confirmed the breadth of this authority, and I quote from that \nreport.\n\n       However, notwithstanding data that may demonstrate \n     comparable performance, the agency will not find the device \n     substantially equivalent to a predicate device where the \n     newer device raises different safety and effectiveness \n     considerations than the predicate device. Under these \n     circumstances, a finding of not substantially equivalent is \n     made, necessitating a class 3 designation and the requirement \n     of an approved PMA before the new device is marketed.\n\n  This is the language that was--\n  Mr. REED. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. Incorporated in the 1990 Medical Device Act, demonstrating \nin the Senator's own committee report the breadth and scope of this \nparticular authority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. REED. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. My time has expired.\n  Mr. REED. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Two minutes.\n  Mr. REED. I concur with the Senator's notion that the FDA could look \nat safety and effectiveness but the critical question is safety and \neffectiveness to do what? To do what the labeled use is or to do \nsomething else. And the language of the bill restricts the answer to \nthat question, to do what, statutorily to simply say whatever the \ncompany puts into the label. And that seems to be the crux of this \ndebate. Yes, they can look at safety and effectiveness; yes, they can \nlook at technological change, but only in the context of what the \ncompany purports in the label to say is the intended use. They can't \nlook beyond it.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COATS). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  Mr. President, my good friend from Rhode Island has put his finger on \nexactly the problem and the issue. Now, I listened to our friend, \nSenator Frist, who believes that the FDA doesn't really have a problem \nif the information is going to be false and misleading, that the FDA \nhas the authority to look behind the label itself and find out if that \ninformation is false and misleading.\n  If that is the case, we do not have a problem. We can accept an \namendment that would restate what he has just said, or we can drop this \nwhole provision.\n  It is interesting to listen to those who are opposed to the Reed \namendment say, well, look, the FDA can do this and that and protect the \npublic, while at the same time they are emasculating the very safety \nvalve with this new provision--restricting the FDA in its ability to \njudge on the issues of substantial equivalence.\n  Now, Mr. President, before we move to the vote, I want to reiterate \nwhere we are so that those who have been listening to the debate for \nthese last few minutes understand where we are.\n\n  We are talking about the preeminent issue identified by the \nadministration's principal spokesperson charged with protecting \nAmerican health. This has been identified as the one provision in the \nwhole legislation that is of central concern to the public health of \nthe American people. They mentioned the issues of cosmetics; they \nmentioned the fact that this eliminates environmental impact \nstatements; they mentioned technical issues dealing with PDUFA; but \nthere was only one public health issue that the Secretary of HHS has \nrecognized, and it is this particular provision which Senator Reed has \ntried to address.\n  It is of such importance that the Secretary of HHS indicated that if \nthat provision remains unchanged, she would recommend that the \nPresident not sign the legislation. And it is not just the Senators \nfrom Rhode Island and Massachusetts who are concerned about this \nprovision. Every single consumer group is concerned about it as well. \nAll of the groups that speak for patient rights, all of the groups that \nare concerned about women's health issues, all of the various consumer \ngroups--I have listed them before--all of them say that we ought to \nsupport the Reed amendment, if we are truly interested in protecting \nthe American consumer. We have, over the last few days, talked about \nwhy this is so important.\n  Those who are opposed to this amendment keep repeating their \nassertions that the FDA has the authority to protect the public. That \nis hogwash. They may believe it. I have yet to see a Member of the \nSenate who is opposed to our amendment take out this legislation and \nthumb through it and point to the specific language that states the FDA \nwill have authority to protect the public if this amendment is not \ncarried by the Senate of the United States. They have not done it \nbecause they cannot do it. They cannot point to a provision in here \nthat says, ``OK, if we defeat the Reed amendment, FDA will still have \nthe authority.'' They have these assertions on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. But they have not pointed to specific language in this \nlegislation, and that is what counts. They cannot point to it because \nit is not there.\n\n  We are talking, as the Senator from Rhode Island has pointed out, \nabout medical devices submitted to the FDA for approval, which a \ncompany would say is ``substantially equivalent'' to an existing \ndevice. But which, in reality, is a device which has significant \ntechnological changes in its design and in fact, is designed for \nanother use. However, when the new device is submitted for approval, \nthe label will still maintain that the device will be used for the same \npurposes as the original device. That is what is happening. That is the \ndanger and that is what the Reed amendment is attempting to prevent.\n  We have discussed the example of this that is currently unfolding. \nThe biopsy needle that was supposed to be substantially equivalent to a \nbiopsy needle the size of your pencil lead but which actually removes \nan amount of material the size of a hot dog. This device is used to \ntake the place of surgery for women, but it is untested and untried for \nthat purpose. We don't know if it's safe. The company hasn't submitted \nevidence as to whether it is\n\n[[Page S9758]]\n\nsafe. But we know that this device developed by U.S. Surgical was not \ndesigned for the narrow biopsy; it was designed for another purpose. It \ntakes out 50 times the amount of material necessary for a biopsy.\n  We know what it was designed for, we have the promotion tape. We have \nthe statements from doctors saying they were being solicited to use it \nfor surgery, not biopsy.\n  You can claim that these are low-risk devices. You can claim that is \nreally just a technical issue, that its not important. But we know that \nis not the case. We are talking about anesthesia machines which are \nused for major surgeries. We want those to be able to perform the way \nthey should and to meet safety and efficacy standards. We are talking \nabout fetal cardiac monitors. We want to make sure that children who \nneed that kind of monitoring have a device that will be safe and do the \njob. What mother wants to discover that her child is using a fetal \ncardiac monitoring system that has been approved for some other use and \nhere the hospital or clinic is using it for a different purpose without \nknowing that it is safe and effective for that use?\n  The list goes on. We have had the situation where surgical lasers are \nbeing submitted as general cutting tools when it is clear that the \nintention is to use them for surgeries for prostate cancer and no \ninformation about how safe or effective they are for that purpose has \nbeen submitted to the FDA. Why are we risking the health of the \nAmerican people over this issue? What is the benefit?\n  I have cited examples where we have been called on in this body to \nmake decisions about whether we are going to use a limited amount of \nmoney to feed the elderly people--how much will we use in congregate \nsites? How much will we use for home delivery? If you use more in home \ndelivery, you will be able to feed fewer people. It's a painful issue, \nand whatever we do some are going to benefit, some are going to lose. \nWe can understand men and women of good judgment differing on that \nissue.\n  But not on this issue. What is the balance? The balance is that the \nprotections of American consumers are weakened in the area of medical \ndevices--significantly weakened for the first time in 25 years. And the \nprofits of the medical device industry go up. And they have a \ncompetitive advantage over the other companies who do the right thing \nand conduct the tests to provide health and safety information on their \ndevices.\n  Why are we doing that? What is the rush? Why aren't we hearing from \nthe other side that, ``We have 10 consumers' groups that believe we can \nget the information much more rapidly and their health needs will be \nadvanced and we don't need the Reed amendment.'' Where are those \nstatements, why haven't we heard them. Because they are not there.\n\n  We have to decide whether we are going to retain, for the Food and \nDrug Administration, the ability to deal with labeling. The ability to \nlook beyond the label when they find it to be false and misleading. \nThat is a pretty high standard. FDA has to find it false and \nmisleading. Only then can they look to safety. Some of us wish it was a \nlower standard, but that is the standard we have here, false and \nmisleading.\n  We have given examples, ads have been used to promote medical devices \nfor other purposes. That is happening now. We have also spelled out the \nhuman tragedies that occurred when medical devices malfunctioned, when \nwe did not have all the necessary information to assess safety.\n  Are we going to deny the principal health agency charged with \nprotecting the American public, the authority to ask for more data if \nthey find that the label on a medical device is false and misleading. \nAre we going to say your hands are cuffed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The additional 2 minutes of the Senator have \nexpired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield that to myself.\n  Are we going to tie their hands, tell them that they cannot do a \nthing? Are we going to tell them that we understand that they have done \nthe scientific review? We understand that the label is false and \nmisleading, but you are not allowed to protect the consumers or the \nAmerican public from it.''\n  I think that is the wrong position for this body to take, and I hope \nthe amendment is accepted for the reasons I have outlined and for the \nsplendid reasons outlined by the Senator from Rhode Island. I withhold \nthe remainder of my time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield to the Senator from Connecticut 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me say briefly to my colleagues that \nwhat I believe is false and misleading is to suggest what we are trying \nto do in any way is something injurious to the American consumer. What \nwe are doing is saying that we shouldn't create roadblocks in a process \nthat has been in place for more than 20 years and that has worked well \nfor lower risk devices. To prove a device is substantially equivalent \nto a product that has already been in the marketplace there are tests \nwhich must be complied with, but you don't force the product to prove \nitself all over again. That negates the process that was set up to be \nquicker and more efficient and makes patients wait too long to get \naccess to devices which can change their lives, even save their lives.\n  If you want to scrap the process altogether and require that every \nnew variation of the predicate product begin this process all over, \nthen let's do that. I don't hear anyone calling for that.\n  What the law says is that if it's substantially the same product and \nif the intended purpose as stated is the same, you don't ask the \ncompany to try to guess how someone may use that product for some \npurpose that the company has not supported. To suggest that a company \nis going to have to guess as to what other ideas someone may have for \nthe use of that product, and develop data to support those uses--that \nwould make this process null and void. We might as well scrap the \nentire section and 25 years of effort here.\n  The purpose of this bill is to take advantage of new technologies, to \nsee to it we have safe and effective products that are going to reach \nconsumers. To allow an agency to cause a company to have to guess and \nguess again as to what some other intended purpose would be, I think \nwould be a mistake.\n  So I urge, with all due respect, this amendment be rejected and the \ncommittee bill be supported.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The time of the Senator has \nexpired. Who yields time? The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as we close debate on this issue, I want \nto say if I listened to this and didn't understand the law and the \nprotections in it, I would go home and be depressed that I was backing \nsuch legislation. However, knowing the law and knowing the process, I \nstill come away totally opposed to this amendment.\n  First of all, let's take a look. We have had about 36,000 devices \napproved over the past 6 years. Out of that, there would have been six \nrecalls. So this is not an issue that is something which has proved to \nbe a failure in the law.\n  Second, what we are dealing with here is the definition of false and \nmisleading. Actually, the regulations cover the important aspects of \nit. But false and misleading means if you knew or should have known. \nThey want to get into the practice of medicine. They want to say if \nthis person has this device, and it is the same as the device with the \npremarket approval, they should be looking around and deciding and \nfinding out all the possible and conceivable uses out there, and then \nthey could be required to run clinical trials on all these.\n  The purpose of the 510(k) process is to allow something that is \nidentically the same, having gone through all this, not to have to go \nthrough it again. This would send fear through the device industry \nbecause it may know it is impossible to get anything improved again \nwithout expending thousands and thousands of dollars and waiting 2 or 3 \nyears. That is totally unnecessary. The law fully protects the consumer \nnow. This is totally unnecessary and will increase the cost to \nconsumers and decrease the availability of devices to them in a timely \nmanner. That is why I am opposed to it.\n  It has been greatly overexaggerated as to what kind of problem is \ncreated here.\n\n[[Page S9759]]\n\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Massachusetts has \nnot yet expired. If the Senator will withhold his motion? I recognize \nthe Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand I have 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I list those who support the Reed \namendment: The administration, the President, Patients' Coalition, \nConsumer Federation of America, National Women's Health Network, \nAmerican Public Health Association, National Organization for Rare \nDisorders, the Consumers Union, and the Center for Women's Policy \nStudies. I believe my time is expired. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment. Mr. \nPresident, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have a unanimous-consent request which \nI will offer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the cloture vote \nwith respect to S. 830, if invoked, there be only the following time \nremaining in the following fashion: 4 hours equally divided between the \nchairman and the ranking minority member or their designee for use \nduring today's session only; 4 hours equally divided between the \nchairman and the ranking minority member or their designee for use \nduring the session of the Senate on Wednesday, September 24, beginning \nat noon.\n  I further ask, notwithstanding rule XXII, that following the \nconclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on S. \n830, as amended, without further action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1137\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, we now have 20 \nminutes equally divided on the Harkin amendment numbered 1137, 10 \nminutes under the control of the Senator from Iowa and 10 minutes under \nthe control of the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, there are many positive provisions in this bill that I \nam pleased to support. However, I am disappointed that an essential \nelement has not been included in this bill. A major goal of FDA reform \nis to ensure that the public has access to medical innovations without \ncompromising public safety. But the multimillion-dollar cost of \nobtaining FDA approval often excludes from the review process all \nmedical therapies not promoted by major corporations, those that are \nnonpatentable or low cost.\n  Very few sponsors of alternative medicines and treatments have the \nresources to go through this process. Unfortunately, this means that \nmillions of Americans are denied access to important alternative \nmedicines and treatments every day. In committee, I proposed and \nwithdraw an amendment that would improve the access to medical care. It \nwas called the Access to Medical Treatment Act. It was introduced this \nspring by Senator Daschle, cosponsored by the majority leader, Senator \nLott, Senators Hatch, Inouye, myself, and many others. It would allow \ngreater freedom of choice and increased access in the realm of \nalternative medical treatments, while preventing abuses of unscrupulous \npractitioners.\n  However, it appears that we may not be ready to move on this \nimportant consumer reform. Mr. President, while we may not be ready for \nthis, we cannot delay in moving to assure and improve and expand \nrigorous scientific review of alternative and complementary therapies. \nThat is the purpose of my amendment.\n  Mr. President, increasingly Americans are turning to alternative \nmedicine. A study done by Harvard University showed, in 1990, American \nconsumers spent over $14 billion on these practices. In that year, \nthere were over 425 million visits to alternative practitioners, more \nthan visits to conventional practitioners.\n  In light of that, in 1992, the Congress passed a bill setting up the \nOffice of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. We \nnow have 4\\1/2\\ years' experience with that office operating. It has \ndone some good things, but it has been severely hampered by the fact \nthat it must go through the entire process at NIH, through the \ninstitutes at NIH, for its peer review and for its grant-making \nauthority.\n  The amendment I have before the Senate now would simply change the \nstatus of the Office of Alternative Medicine from an office under the \nDirector to a center for complementary and alternative medicine. It \nwould not be an institute but a center. As such, that center could set \nup a peer review process and make its own grants.\n  Now, why is that important? Mr. President, every year since we \nestablished the office, we put in the legislation that the office's \nresponsibility was to investigate and validate treatments, practices \nand medicines. That has been in there every year--to investigate and \nvalidate--because what we want is scientific analysis done of these \ntreatments. Now, I have always heard, ``There are a lot of quacks out \nthere practicing alternative medicine.'' While that may be true, there \nare a lot of good people out there doing good things with alternative \nmedicine. We need the review and the science to let us know what is \ngood and what is working.\n  I asked the Director of NIH a few months ago, who was in my office, \nhow many treatments, or practices, or medicines they had investigated \nand validated since 1992. I was met with a deafening silence. The \nanswer is, none. Yet, next year we are putting $13 million into the \nOffice of Alternative Medicine. One might rightly ask, where is it \ngoing? What is happening?\n  So the purpose of my amendment was to set up a center to elevate its \nstatus so that that center could do its own peer review and have its \nown grant-making authority. That way, we can cut through and save a lot \nof money and save a lot of time, without in any way compromising \nrigorous scientific review. That is what this amendment does. It also \nincorporates within that center the Office of Dietary Supplements, \nwhich was also set up at NIH, to bring the two of them together in a \nnew center which would provide more independence, assure economies of \nscale and efficiencies without in any way denigrating good scientific \nresearch. That is the purpose of the amendment.\n  Now, I understand that the Senator from Tennessee is going to raise a \npoint of order that this amendment is not germane. Under the rules of \ncloture, I admit that it is not germane. That doesn't mean it is not \nimportant. It is very important. It is critically important. It should \nbe passed.\n\n[[Page S9760]]\n\n  Mr. President, I understand my 5 minutes are up. I yield 2 minutes to \none of my chief cosponsors, the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to cosponsor Senator Harkin's \namendment to establish the Center of Alternative Medicine. I helped him \nestablish the Office of Alternative Medicine in 1993 at NIH. Why did I \ndo that? One, because I want everyone who is sick in the United States \nof America to have access to all possible means of treatment that are \nsafe and have efficacy. At the same time, I wanted to prevent quackery. \nI also was aware of the Harvard study by a Dr. Eisenberg that said one \nout of three Americans was using alternative or complementary medicine, \nbut we were not aware of scientific investigation to establish its \nefficacy or its safety. Yet, many of us have enjoyed those practices.\n  Some years ago, I had some very severe illnesses. Western medicine \nwas of limited utility for me and I turned to acupuncture. Acupuncture \nhelped me get well and has helped me stay well. I am pleased about \nthat. But there are many other modalities out there being utilized by \nthe American consumer. I want to make sure they are safe. I want to \nmake sure they have efficacy. I want NIH to investigate it, and then I \nwant them to validate it. I believe there is merit in this.\n  I am puzzled why NIH wants to continually try to submerge this Office \nof Alternative or Complementary Medicine. The hallmark of NIH is to \nhave an open mind and to pursue scientific investigation. I believe \nSenator Harkin is on the right track. Though this amendment might not \nbe germane, it is certainly relevant to the American people. If we \ndon't find a way to move it on this bill, let's explore other ways.\n\n  I yield back such time as I might have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I have a unanimous-consent request, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \ndebate and disposition of the Harkin amendment, Senator Murray be \nrecognized for 5 minutes to offer her amendment No. 1161, and that \nfollowing her remarks, her amendment be agreed to.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be \ncalled up, considered en bloc and agreed to: A Jeffords amendment No. \n1174; a Jeffords amendment No. 1175; a Kennedy amendment No. 1152; a \nWellstone amendment No. 1156, and Senator DeWine's amendment No. 1136, \nas modified in the amendment I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. I was hard-\npressed to hear the numbers. Was amendment No. 1131 included in that?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. There are no nongermane amendments in the unanimous-\nconsent request.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 9 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to respond to my colleague from Iowa with \nregard to an amendment to the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] reform \nbill, to establish a new national center for complementary and \nalternative medicine at the National Institutes of Health [NIH].\n  Again, remember the debate today and the past several days, and maybe \nthrough tomorrow, is on the FDA. Yet, we have introduced an amendment \non another agency--the NIH. I oppose the offering of this proposal as \nan amendment to the FDA bill for that very reason.\n  Comments have been made earlier about the importance of complementary \nand alternative medicine to the public and to this country, the \nimportance of science, and the importance of peer review--all of which \nI support. I have been in the field of medicine, in a broad sense, for \nthe last 20 years. I have been involved in many medical fields, \nincluding a great part of which has been designated as alternative \ntherapies--at least initially, because when I first started doing lung \ntransplants, very few had been done in the history of this country \nbefore. Therefore, I, as a scientist, a medical professional, and a \nU.S. Senator, do feel that alternative medicine and complementary \nmedicine is vitally important to the health and the well-being of \nAmericans and people throughout the world.\n  What I do oppose, however, is dealing with this issue of elevating an \noffice to the level of a center when most of our colleagues do not even \nknow what a center in the NIH really means. What are the \nresponsibilities of a center? What are the authorities? What is the \ndifference between an office and a center and an institute? As I talk \nto my colleagues, they do not know. Why? Because we have not addressed \nthe issue in the appropriate environment--that is, through the \ncommittee structure.\n  I am the chairman of the Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, \nwhich oversees the reauthorization of the NIH. We are, right now, \nlooking at the reauthorization of the NIH. We have held two hearings in \nthe past examining how you set biomedical and medical research \npriorities. It is a process where we have people come in and testify, \nand we discuss and debate back and forth. This amendment, as proposed \nby the Senator from Iowa, has not been taken through that process. It \nis being brought to the floor on a bill that does not have anything to \ndo with the NIH, but rather the FDA bill. Therefore, I do believe it is \nnot germane.\n\n  I believe we should not be placing NIH authorizing legislation on an \nFDA bill. Rather, the more appropriate process would be to take it \nthrough the committee structure. I should also add, for the benefit of \nmy colleagues, most of whom have not addressed this issue at all \nbecause it has not been through the committee process, that no \nlegislative bill to establish a center of alternative medicine has been \nintroduced into the Senate. Therefore, a bill has not been referred to \nthe appropriate committee, it has not been vetted, it has not had \nhearings. There has been no formal debate. This would create a huge \ncenter within the NIH without that debate. Therefore, I object to \nbypassing this process, again, with a tremendous amount of respect for \nalternative medicine.\n  My colleague from Iowa is a senior member of the subcommittee, and he \nand I have had the discussion that we do need to look at the \nappropriate role for alternative medicine at the NIH. We have scheduled \na hearing in early October. It has been mentioned on the floor of the \nSenate that one of the panels should address the issue of alternative \nmedicine.\n  We have a 4-year history with the Office of Alternative Medicine. \nLet's debate and look at the results of that history. Let's see the \nresults of peer review and see what advances have been made.\n  The issue of whether to elevate an office to a center--again, as I \ntalked to my colleagues over the last few weeks about taking an office \nat the NIH and elevating it to a center--is one that I think we need to \ndiscuss, but not today on the FDA bill, not over the course of a few \nminutes, but look at it through the appropriate hearing process. What \ndoes it mean to elevate an office to center status? What is a center at \nthe NIH? I hope my colleagues ask themselves right now, do I really \nknow what a center at the NIH is? Most will say no. The role of the \ncurrent Office of Alternative Medicine, the office--as outlined by the \nSenator from Iowa, my colleague, who basically defined what the office \nis --is to coordinate and foster the conduct and support of alternative \nmedicine research at the NIH. Right now, the office provides a central \nfocus for a research area that is germane to all NIH components. In \nother words, the office can work with all the various institutes.\n  I understand that the majority of complementary and alternative \nresearch is performed and supported by those 24 centers and institutes \nand divisions within the NIH, and it is integrated within the \nscientific research portfolio of each of those institutes. My colleague \nis arguing--and he may be right, and that is why we need to discuss \nit--that we must consider alternative medicine being a center in and of \nitself. But that would mean that the scientists and researchers who are \nresponsible for broad areas of science may not have the opportunity to \nintegrate alternative medicine into their\n\n[[Page S9761]]\n\nrespective research portfolios as they do today. It needs to be \ndiscussed. It needs to be debated in the appropriate forum.\n  I recognize that the Senator from Iowa has concerns about whether the \ncurrent approach is working or not. Again, I look forward, through our \nreauthorizing committee, to the Subcommittee on Public Health and \nSafety, on which he serves, to address this very issue.\n  I do know that when you elevate an entity like an office to an \ninstitute or to center status, the scientific potential of the field \nshould be sufficiently demonstrated so that the new institute or center \ncan support a thriving intramural and extramural program. Are we at \nthat point today? I do not know. I daresay that most of my colleagues \nhave not studied this specific issue yet.\n  I will have to say that as I have reached out to people, many others \nin the scientific community have raised concerns about establishing a \nnew center at the NIH. Let me read to you a portion of a letter sent to \nme from the Association of the American Medical Colleges expressing \ntheir concerns:\n  This is the AAMC, Association of the American Medical Colleges:\n\n       Any change in the organizational structure of the NIH of \n     this magnitude raises significant scientific and \n     administrative questions. . . .\n       Further, the AAMC believes all members of the research \n     community should have the opportunity to address these issues \n     in a full and public manner during a hearing conducted by the \n     subcommittee.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter by the AAMC be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    Association of\n\n\n                                    American Medical Colleges,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 16, 1997.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, Committee \n         on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Frist: The Association of American Medical \n     Colleges (AAMC) opposes efforts to attach to the pending FDA \n     reform bill, S. 830, a proposal creating a National Center \n     for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the National \n     Institutes of Health (NIH).\n       Any change in the organizational structure of the NIH of \n     this magnitude raises significant scientific and \n     administrative questions. The AAMC believes that research \n     into complementary and alternative medical practices is best \n     conducted by the individual disease-based institutes, and \n     that creating a separate office will isolate and impede \n     rather than promote and coordinate ongoing research \n     activities in these areas. Moreover, it appears that the \n     additional administrative costs associated with the creation \n     of a new organizational entity at the NIH are not justified \n     at the present time.\n       Further, the AAMC believes all members of the research \n     community should have the opportunity to address these issues \n     in a full and public manner during a hearing conducted by \n     your subcommittee. The necessarily limited floor debate that \n     would occur if this proposal is considered as an amendment to \n     S. 830 would not afford sufficient time or opportunity for \n     such deliberations.\n       The AAMC urges the Senate to reject the effort to attach \n     this proposal to the FDA bill and instead consider it during \n     the upcoming NIH reauthorization legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Jordan J. Cohen, M.D.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, raising the Office of Alternative Medicine \nto a center at NIH greatly increases its statutory authority. Has the \nfield of alternative medicine demonstrated that track record to date? \nAgain, let's review these issues in the committee process. The Office \nof Alternative Medicine today clearly does not have the organizational \nstructure or the necessary budget to support this proposal--creating a \nnational center for complementary and alternative medicine would \nrequire setting up a whole new administrative structure and a whole new \nresearch infrastructure to support this activity.\n  Are we ready for that today? Possibly.\n  Let's ask the scientists around the country. Let's have alternative \nmedicine researchers come forward and testify. Let's ask the National \nInstitutes of Health. Before we go out and create another center, which \nagain is a new entity, we need to look at the proposal about its \nadministration, and about how it will be paid for.\n  Again, the watchwords today are ``consolidation and coordination,'' \nnot proliferation.\n  Mr. President, I would like to reserve the remaining minute of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have a couple of minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 2 minutes and 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will respond to my friend from Tennessee \nwho made the argument. He said it would create a huge center at NIH. I \nam sorry. The Office of Alternative Medicine has 14 employees, the last \ncount I had, and its budget next year is $13 million out of $13 billion \nat NIH. That is one-tenth of 1 percent. Huge? I beg to differ.\n  There are only two changes under this amendment. It provides that it \ncould make grants, that it could do its own grants, and could have peer \nreview. That is the only difference. We are not creating anything new \nand huge. It is up to the Congress to decide later on if they want to \nexpand it or not. I am just changing its status.\n  Also, Mr. President, I want to say that if it were not for this point \nof order this amendment would pass. The cosponsors are Senators Hatch, \nDaschle, Craig, Mikulski, Lugar, Specter, Grassley, Durbin, Wellstone, \nMoseley-Braun, and a number of others. I am not going to read them all.\n  This amendment would pass, if the point of order were not raised.\n  The Senator says it should go through the committee structure, that \nwe have not had hearings, and stuff. I say in all friendship--and he is \na great friend of mine, the Senator from Tennessee--that just a couple \nof weeks ago the Senator voted on the Gorton amendment that cut out \ntitle I--vocational education, safe and drug-free schools, education \ntechnology, bilingual education--knocked it all out. And, yet, we never \nhad one hearing on it. It never went through our committee, of which \nthe Senator and I both sit. We never had any hearings on that. Yet the \nSenator from Tennessee says fine. He stepped up and voted to abolish \nall of those without going through the hearing process.\n  But I would say to my friend from Tennessee, you want more testimony. \nLook at the Record. Our subcommittee on both the appropriations side \nand on the authorizing side have had hearing after hearing after \nhearing on this. We have had all kinds of testimony come in.\n  But the most compelling testimony, Mr. President, for this amendment \nis that more and more Americans are using alternative practices in \nmedicines than they are using with mainstream doctors. They are \nspending billions of dollars a year. At last count it was over $13 \nbillion in 1 year.\n  It is up to us to make sure that we do the adequate scientific \nresearch to find out what alternative medicines are working and what \nare not.\n  That is why this center is needed. It may not be germane to this \nbill. But I will tell you. It is needed. It is drastically needed \ntoday--not next year or 2 years or 3 years from now. We have had enough \ntestimony basically from the American people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from a number of organizations supporting the amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     To the Honorable Tom Harkin, United States Senate:\n       We write in support of the proposed amendment to Bill S. \n     830, the purpose of which is to increase the authority of the \n     Office of Alternative Medicine by creating in its place a \n     national Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at \n     NIH.\n       It is our understanding that this amendment would assure \n     that relevant projects are reviewed by scientists with \n     expertise in the particular area of complementary and \n     alternative medicine proposed to be studied, and the Center \n     would have the ability to directly fund projects without \n     oversight from other NIH Institutes. In addition, the Office \n     of Dietary Supplements would be included within the proposed \n     Center, thereby ensuring improved coordination of research \n     and resource allocation.\n       These reforms will, in our view, facilitate and expedite \n     the implementation of rigorous and scientifically based \n     evaluation of complementary and alternative medical \n     therapies. Patients and their families need and deserve \n     responsible and authoritative advice concerning the use or \n     avoidance of these therapies. We must therefore do more to \n     distinguish useful from useless complementary and alternative \n     medical interventions.\n\n[[Page S9762]]\n\n       We thank you for your efforts in this area.\n           Sincerely,\n     David M.

Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment \nwith my friend from Iowa. The amendment promotes the same fundamental \ngoals that have fueled FDA reform--that is, to improve access to safe \nand effective medical treatments, and respond to the growing popularity \nof alternative health care options.\n  I commend Senator Harkin for his dedication to breaking down barriers \nthat are too often a function of ignorance, inertia or territorialism \nin order to increase the health care options available to all \nAmericans. Senator Harkin has advocated long and hard for openminded \nexploration of treatments outside the box of western medicine, and we \nowe him a debt of gratitude both for his common sense and his vision in \npromoting the safe and effective use of promising alternative \ntreatments.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for \ntheir commitment and leadership throughout this process. I appreciate \ntheir willingness to work with us on reforms aimed at creating a more \nlevel playing field for alternative medical treatments.\n  And I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge my good friend Berkley \nBedell, who represented Iowa's sixth congressional district so ably for \n12 years. Berk has worked tirelessly, against strong odds, to give \nconsumers more health care options, and the fact that we are here \ntoday, talking about the potential of alternative medicine, is largely \ndue to his vision, conviction and persistence.\n  For those of us whose health and well-being may ultimately depend on \nthese options, Berkley Bedell's contribution is an invaluable one. \nThank you, Berk, for your time, energy and unyielding commitment to \nexpanding consumers' choices.\n  The strategy outlined in this amendment--increasing the autonomy and \nauthority of the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine --is a sorely \nneeded and long overdue response to the obstacles hindering access to \nalternative medical treatments. Under this amendment, the role of the \nNIH Office of Alternative Medicine would be enhanced through the \nauthority to conduct and support intramural and extramural research.\n  The Office would no longer be relegated to the second tier, placed in \nthe untenable position of convincing other institutes within NIH to \ntake on as part of their own resource-constrained agendas, projects the \nOffice deems important. As a full research institute, the Office of \nAlternative Medicine could respond to the growing interest in \nalternative treatments by identifying research gaps and fulfilling \nthose gaps on a timely basis.\n  Mr. President, as you may recall, in February Senator Harkin and I \nreintroduced the Access to Medical Treatment Act, a bill intended to \ngive consumers greater freedom to use alternative and complementary \nmedical treatments. The bill provoked some controversy, as was \nexpected.\n  There is no stronger opponent to change than the status quo, no \nmatter how valuable. It has become abundantly clear that unless we \nshake things up a little, we will continue to tread water in our \nefforts to tap the full potential of alternative medical treatments. \nLike S. 578, this amendment definitely shakes things up, but it does so \nfrom a different angle.\n  S. 578 promotes the idea that consumers should be free to use \nnontraditional medicines. This amendment confronts the resource \nbarriers that prevent essential research into the benefits and risks of \nalternative treatments.\n  Too often an alternative treatment is written off because, the \ntraditional medical establishment claims, there is no proof of its \neffectiveness. In fact, untested does not necessarily translate as \nineffective. It may mean that insufficient resources are available to \ndefinitively prove what has been demonstrated again and again on an \nanecdotal basis. A small firm or single practitioner may not have \naccess to the resources necessary to conduct large-scale clinical \ntrials in the U.S. to document the safety and effectiveness of a drug \nor device. If the treatment isn't patentable or profitable, it may be \ndifficult to attract the interest of drug or device companies.\n  This doesn't mean the drug doesn't work or isn't safe. It means we \ndon't know. How many beneficial alternative treatments gather dust \nbecause they are not ``brand name'' material?\n  Even more important is the issue of safety. Regardless of the \nobstacles hindering alternative medical treatments, they are \nincreasingly popular. A 1993 article in the New England Journal of \nMedicine reported that more than one-third of Americans use \nalternative, nonconventional medical treatments.\n  In 1990 alone, Americans spent over $14 billion on these treatments. \nConsumers are using these medical treatments, yet research on the \nsafety and effectiveness of alternative treatments remains scarce, and \nthe current regulatory system remains focused on large-scale, \nmainstream medicines.\n  This amendment is intended to open doors to alternative treatments so \nthat they can be assessed for safety and effectiveness and, when they \nare found to be safe and effective, made widely available.\n  It's the right thing to do, and the longer we wait to do it, the more \nopportunities we forsake to make use of beneficial medical treatments. \nThis amendment promotes the best interests of every health care \nconsumer in the Nation, and I am proud to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 1 minute.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in closing, to go right to the heart of the \nmatter, to increase and elevate the alternative medicine from an office \nto a center needs to be addressed, but not in this forum. To establish \na center means you give it grantmaking authority, establish an advisory \ncouncil, and you instruct the center to study the integration of \nalternative medicine, establish a new data system, establish research \ncenters, all of which is something that is not just moving toward peer \nreview.\n  We will address it in the future--hopefully actually in a panel 2 or \n3 weeks from now, in early October.\n\n\n                             point of order\n\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending amendment No. \n1137 is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained.\n\n[[Page S9763]]\n\n  The amendment falls.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes prior to the scheduled vote on the committee substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, in 2 minutes we will be voting on the FDA \nreform bill.\n  This committee substitute has been legislated for a 2\\1/2\\ year \nperiod thoroughly and carefully and responsibly. It is a piece of work \nthat has received a 14-to-4 vote in committee by Democrats and \nRepublicans. People of different philosophical backgrounds have \nsupported it. It is legislation that has survived two filibusters, and \nthe cloture votes have been overwhelming to move forward. It is \nlegislation that has been changed and modified 34 times to meet the \nobjections of the Senator from Massachusetts and some others about its \ndeficiencies; 34 modifications since that 14-to-4 committee vote.\n  There are 8 days left in this month before PDUFA--the tax on the drug \ncompanies that funds up to 600 employees at FDA to review and to \nexpedite the review of drugs--8 days left before that authorization \nexpires. The clock is ticking. FDA will be laying off more than 600 \npeople in just 8 days unless we can move this legislation forward. We \ndon't need more filibusters. We don't need more debate. It is time to \nmove forward. If we do not, drug and device reviews will be delayed \nsubstantially, and reform will be stopped. Responsible people have \nlegislated responsibly, and I urge my colleagues to support us on this \nvote coming up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nWashington is recognized for up to 5 minutes on amendment No. 1161.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1161\n\n  (Purpose: To modify the exemption requirements relating to national \n  uniformity for nonprescription drugs to provide an exemption for a \nState or political subdivision requirement that protects the health and \n                          safety of children)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I send an amendment to the desk\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1161.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 117, strike line 24 and all that follows \n     through page 118, line 10, and insert the following:\n       ``(b) Exemption.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Upon application of a State or political \n     subdivision thereof, the Secretary may by regulation, after \n     notice and opportunity for written and oral presentation of \n     views, exempt from subsection (a), under such conditions as \n     may be prescribed in such regulation, a State or political \n     subdivision requirement that--\n       ``(A) protects an important public interest that would \n     otherwise be unprotected, including the health and safety of \n     children;\n       ``(B) would not cause any drug to be in violation of any \n     applicable requirement or prohibition under Federal law; and\n       ``(C) would not unduly burden interstate commerce.\n       ``(2) Timely action.--The Secretary shall make a decision \n     on the exemption of a State or political subdivision \n     requirement under paragraph (1) not later than 120 days after \n     receiving the application of the State or political \n     subdivision under paragraph (1).\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I filed two amendments to this bill, the intent of \nwhich were aimed at what I believe is a serious problem with national \nuniformity. And that is the issue of poison control labeling to prevent \nunintentional exposure to dangerous over-the-counter drugs and \ncosmetics by children.\n  During markup of this bill, national uniformity for labeling of over-\nthe-counter drugs and cosmetics was adopted as an amendment. At the \ntime, I raised concerns that I have about the State of Washington's \nsuccessful Mr. Yuk campaign which simply teaches children and parents \nabout the dangers of many common household products. I was concerned at \nthe time that this program, which I have personal experience with and \nknow how successful it is, would be in jeopardy.\n  This is a Mr. Yuk sticker. It is a small green sticker that parents \nand teachers can put onto products--toxic household products. And kids \nacross my State are taught if they see a Mr. Yuk sticker they don't \nswallow what is inside of it.\n  I was concerned that national uniformity would harm my State's \nability to continue this very important program. I raised this point \nduring markup, and I was assured that the objective of the amendment on \nnational uniformity was not to impede a State's ability to protect \ntheir children.\n  Since the markup, I have become even more concerned about poison \ncontrol labeling. I am well aware of the fact that Mr. Yuk is \nvoluntary, and there is no State mandate involved. However, this is \nwhere I became concerned. Under the uniformity language that is \ncontained in this bill, a State can petition the Secretary for a \nmandated labeling requirement on OTC's and cosmetics if they meet \ncertain public health and safety standards, and if--and only if--the \nlabeling requirement does not unduly burden interstate commerce. This \nstandard is extremely high and the only way for a State to meet the \nthreshold is for the Secretary to make the requirement a national \nrequirement.\n  What does this mean for Mr. Yuk? If New York, based on a local health \nconcern files a petition with the Secretary for a symbol, like a skull \nand cross bones to be placed on mouthwash or hair coloring, and they \nmake a strong and sound case, the Secretary can be convinced. However, \nin order to comply with the act and not unduly burden interstate \ncommerce, she must make this a national labeling requirement. Now \nWashington State faces a situation where they have a Mr. Yuk Program \nand must also teach about the skull and cross bones warning. This would \nbe extremely confusing to young children in my State. I can say that as \na former teacher.\n\n  Both of my amendments that I put forward attempted to address this \nissue. My first amendment would add poison control efforts using \nsymbols in the criteria a State can use to petition the Secretary and \nchange the ``and'' to an ``or'' unduly burdening interstate commerce; \ngiving the Secretary the opportunity to continue to allow States to \nhave their own poison control programs if they decide that a voluntary \neffort has not worked. Only through a mandate requirement will they be \nable to protect young children. Simply changing the ``and'' to an \n``or'' would give the Secretary the needed flexibility, and would at \nleast guarantee that one State requirement would not become a national \nrequirement if it was not applicable to all 50 States.\n  Mr. President, my amendments have strong opposition by the industry. \nThey simply don't want to have 50 different State legislatures coming \nforward with 50 different proposals. And I certainly believe there is \nan argument for preemption in many situations. But I don't believe \nthere is one in this case.\n  I am really at a loss as to why supporters of the uniformity language \nin one breath talk about the need to reform and revitalize the FDA to \nprevent unnecessary delays in approving drugs and devices and then in \nthe next breath talk about how States must petition an already \noverburdened agency for the approval to do what they have been doing \nfor years without any public threat of consumer confusion problems.\n  It is interesting to note that the managers' amendment does exempt \none State from uniformity. Our State is going to be treated \ndifferently. One State, the State of California, will be allowed to \nbypass the petition process and have different health and safety \nlabeling cosmetics.\n  Because of the strong opposition to my original amendment and the \nwell-financed national campaign to defeat my amendment, I have revised \nmy language. The new amendment which I am offering today will at least \nacknowledge the importance of protecting health and safety of children, \nand will require the FDA to act on a State's petition within 120 days. \nThe new amendment does not address all of my concerns. But because \nthere has been a strong lobby and I am only one Senator that seems to \nbe concerned about poison control, I recognize that my original \namendment does not have the\n\n[[Page S9764]]\n\nvotes. But I cannot allow these uniformity provisions to go to \nconference without some recognition of the health and safety of \nchildren.\n  So I thank the chairman for working with me. I am pleased that he has \nrecognized my efforts and has supported the pending underlying \namendment which has already been agreed to.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Washington? If not, the question is on \nagreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Washington.\n  The amendment (No. 1161) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n              Amendments Nos. 1182, As Modified, and 1183\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up and \nadopt Senator Hatch's amendment No. 1183, and 1182, as modified by the \namendment, which I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1182\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Hatch-Wyden amendment, number 1182, \nmodifies FDA's mission statement contained in S. 830.\n  For the first time, this legislation puts into statute a mission \nstatement for the Food and Drug Administration. Because of its \nimportant public health role, Congress needs to give FDA the proper \nmission.\n  In short, the Hatch-Wyden amendment charges FDA to act in partnership \nwith the public, scientific experts, and regulated entities as the \nagency performs its critical public health mission. The language of our \namendment simply makes explicit what is already implicit, proper, and, \nin fact, necessary: that FDA should work, ``in consultation with \nexperts in science, medicine, and public health and in cooperation with \nconsumers, users, manufacturers, importers, packers, distributors, and \nretailers of regulated products.''\n  As longtime advocates of modernizing and reforming the FDA, Senator \nWyden and I are convinced that this amendment will help FDA improve and \nprotect the public health. Regulators can increase their effectiveness \nif they act more closely in concert with the public that they serve.\n  As Vice President Gore, the leader of the administration's \nReinventing Government initiative, has said:\n\n       We can put the days of almighty holier-than-thou, mister-\n     know-it-all Washington behind us. We can become partners.''\n       Business owners and local governments are noticing the \n     changes, too, as the federal government becomes more of a \n     partner and less of an adversary.\n       Regulatory agencies are on orders to make partnership with \n     business their standard way of operating. We have tested it \n     long enough to know it increases compliance * * * Now we can \n     move beyond pilot programs for partnership into the \n     mainstream.\n\n  The purpose of the Hatch-Wyden amendment is to inject this spirit of \npartnership right into the FDA mission statement. Giving such \nprominence and visibility to the idea of partnership can help the \nagency better fulfill its public health mission.\n  In no way does the Hatch-Wyden amendment limit, or is intended to \nlimit, FDA from carrying out its enforcement obligations. The Hatch-\nWyden amendment does not concern itself with particular regulatory \ndecisions, that is, product approvals, enforcement sanctions, etc., \nrather it simply clarifies that as part of the general manner in which \nthe agency conducts itself, FDA should work closely with those affected \nby its regulatory actions.\n  We are informed that the FDA is supportive of this amendment so long \nas language is added to make clear that the Secretary has discretion to \nsee that only appropriate interactions between FDA and outsiders take \nplace. We have incorporated this change.\n  In order to fulfill its current statutory responsibilities FDA \nroutinely solicits advice from dozens of standing advisory committees \nof outside experts and consults with its colleagues at the National \nAcademy of Sciences, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention and many others. Similarly, FDA works \nclosely with consumer groups such as patient advocacy groups and \nvarious regulated entities such as manufacturers of foods, drugs, \ncosmetics and medical devices.\n  In fact, S. 830 contains many particular provisions that detail \npartnerships between FDA and others such as the reauthorization of the \nuser fee provisions for new drug review, and the rules that grant \naccess to experimental drugs for patients suffering from serious or \nlife-threatening conditions.\n  In March 1997 testimony to the Senate Labor Committee, Dr. Michael \nFriedman, the highest ranking FDA official, observed:\n\n       One of the themes that runs throughout the Agency's efforts \n     to improve its performance of involving all stakeholders both \n     in defining the problems that exist and in developing \n     appropriate solutions.\n\n  While this amendment is philosophical and exhortatory in nature, we \nbelieve this philosophy, if adopted, can achieve tangible benefits for \nthe FDA and pubic alike. As Lead Deputy Commissioner Friedman \ntestified:\n\n       This model of public participation . . . is most clearly \n     delineated in the procedures the Agency has promulgated for \n     the issuance and use of Agency guidance documents. Concerns \n     about the absence of public input on guidance documents and \n     the inappropriate application of such guidance raised in a \n     Citizen's Petition . . . and were the subject of a [House] \n     hearing. . . In response to these concerns, the Agency \n     undertook a thorough review . . . We found inconsistencies \n     and lack of clarity, and we set about to fix it.\n\n  As the FDA's testimony indicates, there is reason to believe that \nencouraging the agency to interact appropriately with the public can \nhave practical benefits.\n  We firmly believe that if the Congress formally embraces the \nprinciple of partnership in the FDA mission statement we will help \ncreate an atmosphere conducive to improving the public health. \nAccordingly, I hope my colleagues will support giving the FDA a 21st \ncentury mission statement.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am happy to join my colleague Senator \nHatch in offering an amendment which will add strength, substance, and \na new level of appropriate public accountability and involvement in the \nmissions of the Food and Drug Administration.\n  Quite simply, our amendment provides for real access and \nparticipation by patients and consumer groups, science and health \nexperts, and the regulated manufacturers in appropriate policy making \nfunctions within the scope of the agency's missions.\n  As my colleague Senator Hatch has pointed out, our amendment \nunderscores the real partnership FDA must forge with all Americans as \nit conducts its work certifying the safety and effectiveness of so many \nproducts important to our everyday lives.\n  I certainly want to acknowledge and applaud the assistance and \nencouragement of our colleagues Senators Jeffords and Kennedy with \nregard to the development of the FDA reform bill generally, and their \nwork with us in perfecting the agency's mission statement in \nparticular.\n  I believe this legislation will help create the dialog necessary \nbetween the agency and all interested parties in order to effectively \nexercise all of the other far-reaching elements of this reform bill. I \nwas very pleased to have played some part in the development of that \nlegislation and the broader reform effort, and I know that American \ncitizens dependent on pure food, life-saving new drugs and medical \ndevices, and safe electronic equipment will benefit for many years to \ncome from the work we do here, today.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1183, as modified\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the second amendment we are considering, \nNo. 1183, will encourage the prompt and complete reporting of \npotentially vital public health information to the FDA.\n  Essentially, my proposal codifies a rule that already applies to \ndrugs and medical devices and makes it applicable to all FDA-regulated \nproducts.\n  Specifically, my amendment would codify the liability disclaimer \nprovisions that appear at 21 CFR section 803.16, for devices; 21 CFR \nsection 314.80(l), for new drugs; and, 21 CFR 312.32(e), for \ninvestigational new drugs.\n  My amendment is closely patterned after these three provisions of \nexisting regulation.\n  The public health benefit and rationale for my amendment are simple: \nA rule that encourages reporting to the\n\n[[Page S9765]]\n\nFDA of any alleged adverse incident now and resolving liability issues \nlater, helps the FDA achieve its public health mission.\n  The FDA is a public health agency, not an arbiter of tort liability. \nThat is the job of the courts.\n  But what is important for the public health is that FDA be able to \nreceive quickly and completely raw data pertaining to adverse \nexperiences with products under its regulatory purview.\n  Please understand that my amendment, like the existing regulations, \nis tort neutral.\n  Nothing in my amendment, or in the existing regulations, increases or \ndecreases an ultimate finding of liability.\n  The Hatch amendment simply says that the mere filing of an adverse \nreaction report or submission of other information to FDA does not \nnecessarily reflect an admission of fault or a finding of liability on \nthe part of a manufacturer or the Federal Government.\n  Of course, the actual information contained in the report may, or may \nnot, justify a finding of liability but that is an entirely other \nmatter.\n  What this amendment says is that the mere filing of a report does not \nautomatically mean anything with respect to the issue of liability.\n  This is a public health amendment that encourages timely reporting \nand complete reporting to the FDA.\n  Let me give a little background into the amendment and the existing \nFDA rules that it builds upon.\n  Back in mid-1980's when FDA issued proposed and final rules governing \nmandatory reporting for adverse incidents with respect to medical \ndevices, a concern arose among those subject to these new reporting \nrequirements.\n  In particular, there arose concern about the tight reporting \ntimeframe for reporting deaths and serious injuries.\n  The argument was that medical device firms should have an opportunity \nto conduct fully its own investigation into alleged malfunctions of its \nproducts before turning over these reports to FDA.\n  After all, went the argument, this information which may have come \nfrom interested third parties--such as doctors and patients--could \nplace the manufacturing firm in a precarious position vis-a-vis \nliability.\n  Inevitably, some reports will contain inaccurate information but \nregardless of this it is clear that the FDA had an overriding public \nhealth interest in getting this information as quickly as possible to \nsee whether a national trend was developing.\n  The way this matter was resolved in the final medical device \nreporting rule was with the inclusion of language that permitted \nmanufacturers to disclaim liability based solely on the filing of the \nreport with the FDA.\n  To be sure, the information contained in the report might be used to \nestablish, or help establish, liability on the part of the \nmanufacturer. That depends on what is in the report and the veracity of \nthat information.\n\n  What the rule says simply is that the mere filing of the legally \nrequired report in and of itself does not establish liability.\n  One can easily imagine a case where a device malfunctioned and the \nMDR report does, and should properly be used to, establish liability. \nAn example would be a case in which a heart pacemaker short circuited \nand failed.\n  On the other hand, there will be occasions when required reports do \nnot necessarily establish any fault on the part of the manufacturer. An \nexample of this might include a case in which a medical scalpel is used \nas a murder weapon; an unfortunate, legally reportable event no doubt, \nbut not one likely to establish fault on the part of the manufacturer.\n  Building on the success of the disclaimer statement in the medical \ndevice rule, the FDA later included similar language both for approved \nand investigational drugs.\n  Once again, the rule advances the FDA's public health mission by \nhelping to get information to the FDA in a timely and complete fashion.\n  The Hatch amendment codifies the basic regulation that now applies to \nmandatory reports that device and drug manufacturers now must make and \nestablishes this basic principle of ``report now, resolve liability \nissues later'' for all products under the FDA's regulatory domain.\n  This would include products like foods, cosmetics, and dietary \nsupplements, as well as drugs and devices.\n  So, I have drafted the amendment to cover situations where there are \nno rigorous mandatory reporting requirements, such as those which now \ngovern drugs and devices.\n  For example, we have heard a lot in the press recently about the \nChesapeake Bay outbreak of Pfiesteria. Obviously, it would be in the \npublic interest for the Government to have reports about the incidence \nof this toxic microbe. That is something we would want to encourage.\n  I believe that it is more likely this information, even sketchy \nthird-party, unverified reports, would be transmitted to FDA if this \ndisclaimer clearly applied in this situation.\n  What is good policy for drugs and devices, is also good policy for \nfoods, cosmetics, dietary supplements, and other products under FDA's \njurisdiction.\n  The Hatch amendment embraces the ``report now/resolve liability \nlater'' rule that is already in place by regulation for drugs and \nmedical devices and applies this principle for all FDA-regulated \nproducts, and further applies the provision both to mandatory and \nvoluntary reports.\n  This is a consumer-friendly, FDA-friendly, tort-neutral provision and \nI urge its adoption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters in support of \nthese two amendments from Brian H. Moss, president of the Utah Life \nScience Industries Association, and Alan F. Holmer, president of the \nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Pharmaceutical Research and\n\n\n                                     Manufacturers of America,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: You have asked for comment on two \n     proposed amendments to S. 830. We are pleased to offer our \n     support for these amendments.\n       We particularly endorse Section 908, Safety Report \n     Disclaimers, which would place into law a disclaimer that is \n     currently found in FDA regulations. It should be noted that \n     on page 2, line 3, the word ``necessarily'' is no longer \n     found in the Medwatch disclaimer which was drafted more \n     recently than the FDA regulation and pertains to the same \n     circumstances which give rise to the need for the disclaimer. \n     It would be an improvement if the word necessarily were \n     deleted from the amendment, but in any case PhRMA companies \n     support the need for the disclaimer in legislation.\n       We would also support the suggested amendment to the \n     mission statement which sets forth a more collaborative and \n     cooperative mission for the agency. PhRMA believes that the \n     agency has responsibility to both protect and promote the \n     public health. There are times when the pendulum has swung \n     too far toward enforcement at the expense of the agency's \n     mission to help bring safe drugs to patients sooner.\n           Sincerely,\n     Alan F. Holmer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Utah Life Science\n\n\n                                       Industries Association,\n\n                           Salt Lake City, UT, September 18, 1997.\n     Hon.

We are happy \n     to extend our support for the two amendments.\n       We are pleased to support the amendment to the missions \n     statement. We support the idea of a partnership between the \n     FDA and the private sector, in such that the FDA will consult \n     with experts in science, medicine, public health, and in \n     cooperation with consumers and users. We believe that this \n     will ``help ensure'' the public health.\n       We are supportive of the amendment to the Safety Report \n     Disclaimer, and can see a need for this amendment. The \n     amendment will encourage manufacturers to send safety data to \n     the FDA, therefore, helping the FDA to protect the public \n     good.\n       Utah Life Science Industries Association was formed three \n     years ago by the Biotechnical, Biomedical and Medical Device \n     industries in Utah. We represent the interest of these Utah \n     companies on local and national issues. We are pleased that \n     you and Senator Hatch have shown such great interest and \n     concern for our industry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Brian H.

Mr. President, Members of this Chamber are well aware of \nthe national debate on the question of the Food and Drug \nAdministration's jurisdiction to regulate tobacco and tobacco products. \nTo highlight the scope of this debate, I want to point out that this \nquestion is currently under review by the U.S. Court of Appeals. It is \nalso a significant issue of debate between Members of Congress as well \nas Congress and the administration. I am concerned that the inclusion \nof this provision may be interpreted by some as an attempt by Congress \nto indirectly affirm FDA's authority to regulate tobacco.\n  It is my understanding that a recent report from the American Law \nDivision of the Congressional Research Service stated that section 404 \nor any other provision in the FDA reform bill ``would not interfere \nwith or lessen the agency's authority to regulate tobacco products.'' I \nnotice that a rule-of-construction amendment has been included in the \nFDA reform bill that is intended to clarify further that section 404 of \nthe bill will not affect any authority which the FDA may have to \nregulate tobacco. Is this the understanding of the Chairman?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes. This amendment I believe will address the concerns \nof several Senators who have a concern regarding the effect of this \nlegislation on FDA's authority to regulate tobacco. I believe we all \nhave the same intent.\n  In drafting S. 830, my intent was and is to improve the efficiency \nand accountability of the product review process at FDA. In drafting \nsection 404, we modified a provision in the FDA reform bill from the \n104th Congress in an effort to more accurately capture our policy \nintent--my point is that the subject matter is section 404 has been \nunder consideration in the Senate Labor Committee, as well as in \nlegislation introduced in the House, for several years. The concern \nover FDA's tobacco authority came to our attention only after the \nmarkup of this bill in committee, in June of this year.\n  Section 404 introduces needed elements of due process to certain, \nvery limited aspects of medical device reviews. None of the language in \nS. 830 is intended to address FDA's tobacco authority. Late in the \ncourse of negotiations on this bill, FDA raised the possibility that \nsection 404(b) might be interpreted to limit the agency's future \ntobacco regulation authority. At the time we told the agency we did not \nagree with their interpretation but eventually offered to insert the \nrule of construction now before us in the substitute to make absolutely \nclear our neutrality on the tobacco issue. Subsequently, FDA and others \nhave raised the possibility that section 404(a) of S. 830 could also \naffect FDA's authority in this area. As you mentioned, the \nCongressional Research Service, American Law Division, has evaluated S. \n830 and determined that it, in fact, does not interfere with any \ntobacco authority FDA may have. This analysis was made part of the \nCongressional Record on September 5.\n  None of the provisions of S. 830 or the substitute should be \ninterpreted as taking a position, one way or the other, on whether FDA \nhas any authority under current law to regulate tobacco products, which \nas you know, is the subject of ongoing litigation in the Federal \ncourts. The intention of the rule of construction in the substitute is \nto make clear that the Federal courts can continue to determine FDA's \nauthority over tobacco without any interference from this act. Thus, \nthe language in section 404 has no effect on whether or not FDA has \nauthority over tobacco products, it only relates to a procedural aspect \nof reviewing 510(k) medical device submissions.\n\n  To sum up, I am pleased to offer an amendment extending the rule of \nconstruction to all of section 404 on the basis outlined in my \npreceding remarks--to keep the bill strictly neutral on the question of \nFDA tobacco authority, that is that we are not prejudging the outcome \nof any pending litigation on any tobacco authority the FDA may have. \nFurther, it is my view that if this provision is included in the final \nFDA reform bill as reported by the conference committee, the conference \nreport should include language which reinforces this point.\n\n[[Page S9767]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the chairman for his explanation of this \nprovision and his efforts to bring this important legislation to the \nfloor. At some point in the 105th Congress, we may be considering the \nnational tobacco settlement entered into by the State's attorney's \ngeneral and the tobacco companies.

Section 807 of the committee substitute for S. 830 \nprohibits State and local governments from establishing or continuing--\nfor nonprescription drugs, any requirement that is different from, in \naddition to or otherwise not identical to a Federal requirement; for \ncosmetics, any requirements for packaging and labeling that are \ndifferent from, in addition to or otherwise not identical to a Federal \nrequirement. This includes any requirement relating to public \ninformation or any other form of public communication relating to a \nwarning of any kind for a nonprescription drug.\n  My State, California, has a long history of regulating \nnonprescription drugs and cosmetics and I would like to ask the bill \nmanager's to engage in a colloquy with me to clarify his intent and the \nlanguage of the bill.\n  The California Department of Health Services in a September 12 letter \nexpressed their concern that they would have to request interpretations \nfrom FDA. They wrote: ``For interpretation of Federal requirements, and \nin order to determine if a State conflict exists, it will be necessary \nfor States to continually request from the Federal Government an \ninterpretation of their requirements and both Federal and State legal \nreview of those interpretations.''\n  Could you explain the bill's intent?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. In most cases, it will be abundantly clear and States \nwill not have to continually request written interpretations of Federal \nlaw. There should be no need to delay enforcement.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. According to California officials, a number of \nrequirements now in force in California could be considered to be in \naddition to Federal law under this bill and therefore could be \npreempted.\n  The first area relates to public warning requirements. The California \nDepartment of Health Services maintains that the bill would likely \nprohibit State-initiated public health warnings.\n  California DHS asked, for example, if point-of-purchase placards \ncould be required.\n  Could my colleague comment on the intent of the bill with regard to \nState public warning requirements?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The public information and communication provisions of \nS. 830 would not prevent a State from issuing its own public statements \nto warn the public. But although the State is free to utilize the media \nand other such avenues, the State could not require point-of-purchase \nplacards to be posted.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. For both drugs and cosmetics, currently under \nCalifornia law, if DHS has probable cause to believe that a drug or \ncosmetic is adulterated, misbranded, or falsely advertised, DHS can \nembargo the product, remove it from commerce. In their letter, DHS \nsays, ``This power may be considered in addition to a Federal \nrequirement.''\n\n[[Page S9769]]\n\n  Could you clarify your intent in this area?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Enforcement authority is not covered by the preemption \nprovision of the bill, so a State's embargo and other enforcement \nauthority would not be affected.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. For nonprescription drugs, California law requires \ncomprehensive and annual inspections of manufacturers. Federal law \nrequires limited inspections on no timetable. DHS maintains that the \n``State's requirements for drug manufacturer licensing and the annual \ninspections may be considered a requirement in addition to the Federal \nrequirement.''\n  What is the chairman's intent in this bill, as it addresses licensing \nand inspections by States?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. As I said previously enforcement authority is not \ncovered by the national uniformity provisions. Thus, drug manufacturer \nlicensing and inspection in the States would not be affected.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. My State has expressed concerns about advertising, \nsaying that State law has advertising restrictions, that is prohibition \non false and misleading advertisment, advertising of unproven remedies, \nthat may be preempted. Could you elaborate on the bill's intent in the \ndrug advertising area?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The national uniformity provisions would not affect \ntraditional drug advertising laws because this bill does not address \nthe authority of the Federal Trade Commission Act. State laws that \nprohibit false and misleading advertising or to prohibit \nunsubstantiated claims for nonprescription drugs, for example, would \nnot be affected. Traditional advertising issues relating to claims \nsubstantiation, fair balanced and truth are outside the scope of \nnational uniformity.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my colleague.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the majority leader, \nafter notification of the Democratic leader, must turn to S. 25, the \nMcCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill, prior to the close of the \nfirst session of the 105th Congress, and Senator McCain will \nimmediately be recognized, then, to modify the bill, and it be in order \nthat the majority leader immediately offer an amendment relative to \ncampaign finances. I further ask unanimous consent that it not be in \norder for any Senator to offer any legislation regarding campaign \nfinances prior to the initiation of this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this is the same unanimous-consent \nrequest propounded last Friday. The difference is that I have now had \nthe opportunity to consult with my colleagues, and also to consult with \nthe President and those in the White House who have a great deal of \ninterest in our progress on this legislation.\n  The President has just sent Senator Lott and me a letter, indicating \nhis desire to either keep us here or bring us back if we are not \nsufficiently successful in meeting the goals that we have all indicated \nwe share with regard to the completion of the work on the McCain-\nFeingold bill.\n  Given his assurances that he will call us back or keep us here--and I \ncertainly hope that that is not necessary because I think there is \nplenty of opportunity for us throughout the month of October to bring \nthis legislation to the floor and have a good debate--we certainly \nwould not object.\n  As I indicated on Friday, I had two concerns, one, that we would run \nout of time and, two, that I had not had the opportunity to discuss \nthis matter, and we were precluded from offering the amendment to any \nother legislation in the event that we would have run out of time. Now \nthere is no concern for running out of time because the President will \nsee to it that we have whatever length of time we need to complete our \nwork.\n  So Mr. President, I am very pleased that we have been able to make \nthis progress, and we have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that the letter sent to me by \nthe President be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, September 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: Senators McCain and Feingold have pledged \n     to bring their campaign reform legislation to a vote. When \n     that happens, the American people will be watching. I \n     encourage you to act responsibly and support passage of this \n     long-overdue, bipartisan legislation.\n       This measure is of the utmost importance, and it deserves \n     full consideration on the Senate floor. If any attempt is \n     made to bring this bill up in a manner that would preclude \n     sufficient time for debate, I will call on Congress to stay \n     in session until all of the critical elements are fully \n     considered.\n       There is a real need for reform. The amount raised by both \n     political parties is doubling ever four years. And as \n     candidates are forced to spend ever greater amounts of time \n     raising every larger amounts of money,\n\n[[Page S9770]]\n\n     the people's business suffers. We have an obligation to \n     restore the public trust.\n       The bipartisan measure that Senators McCain and Feingold \n     intend to bring to the floor is balanced and effective. It \n     addresses many of the most pressing needs for reform. It does \n     not include every reform that I believe necessary. But it is \n     an important first step--and it represents the only real \n     opportunity to enact meaningful reform in this Congress. Any \n     attempts to attach amendments that would make it unpalatable \n     to one party or another are nothing less than attempts to \n     defeat campaign finance reform. And a vote to filibuster this \n     measure is nothing short of a vote to maintain the system \n     that favors special interests over the public good. For \n     years, the special interests and their allies have \n     filibustered reform. But this year, the American people will \n     hold accountable those who vote to maintain the status quo.\n       Despite formidable odds, the Congress faces the best \n     opportunity in a generation to enact campaign finance reform. \n     Let up work together in a bipartisan spirit, as we have \n     throughout this legislative session, to thwart special \n     interests who seek to smother reform and deny the will of the \n     people. I urge you to support the bipartisan efforts embodied \n     in the McCain-Feingold proposal, permit the Senate to debate \n     their bill, and vote to enact these needed changes to our \n     political system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                             Bill.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is the same unanimous-consent request I \noffered last Friday. I thought it was a fair procedure within the \nbounds of the 105th Congress' 1st session to take up consideration of \ncampaign finance reform. I still think it is a fair procedure. I \nindicated last Friday it was never my intent to try to have this come \nup on the last day or the last week. I do not think that would be in \nanybody's interest. And I did not intend to do that. I said at the time \nI did not intend to do that.\n  So I am glad we have this worked out. We will work now to try to \ndetermine a time to bring up consideration and debate of this issue in \na way that will allow us to have time to discuss it freely but also \ngive us time to look at other issues that we hope to have completed \nbefore the end of the session.\n  With regard to the President's letter, I have not had an opportunity \nto read the letter yet. I am always glad to have a communication from \nthe President. I do not feel threatened or intimidated by the letter \nbecause we still have an awful lot of work to do together on \nappropriations bills. I am still hopeful that we can have the ISTEA \nfollow-on transportation infrastructure bill passed. And we hope to \neven consider the fast-track legislation.\n  So the President has a lot of issues that he would like for us to \nwork with him on. We would be glad to do that. And we intend to do \nthat. However, we do not intend to be threatened or intimidated on this \nor any other issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \nfirst of all, I want to thank the majority leader for his willingness \nto take up this issue.\n  As I said on Friday when he made it very clear to all that we would \ntake up this issue in a timely fashion under the conditions of the \nunanimous-consent agreement, as he stated, I thought it was eminently \nfair.\n  There are other issues that are before the Senate that need to be \nresolved. And over time I have great confidence that the majority \nleader will bring up this issue so that it can be adequately addressed.\n  As far as the letter from the President is concerned, let me just \nsay, Mr. President, we all know that the President can call Congress \ninto session all he wants to. He cannot make them act. And I see from \ntime to time, as we address this issue, the seeking of some kind of \npolitical advantage and leverage here in this debate.\n  Let me make one thing perfectly clear, the only way we are going to \nachieve meaningful campaign finance reform is by sitting down together \nin a bipartisan fashion. We do not need letters from the President of \nthe United States now. What we need is meaningful and serious \nnegotiations between all parties committed to meaningful campaign \nfinance reform. I intend to work with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to achieve that.\n  Again, I want to thank the majority leader because he told me a long \ntime ago that this issue would receive the serious consideration that \nit deserves, and he has confirmed that confidence with the unanimous-\nconsent agreement today.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will not object either. I just want to \nask the majority leader a couple questions.\n  Mr. President, I ask, is it possible for the majority leader to share \nwith us any little bit deeper what his thinking might be as to when he \nthinks it might actually come? I know he cannot be precise, but is \nthere some variation here in the course of the next 3 weeks, Mr. \nPresident?\n  Mr. LOTT. Well, we need to look at the conference reports on \nappropriations bills. We need to look at the continuing resolution, if \none is needed. I presume it will be. We need to look at what progress \nis being made with regard to the ISTEA or the highway transportation \nbill. And we need to look at when we will need to schedule fast track. \nAnd we will need to consider when we are going to have an opportunity \nto take up serious product liability.\n  So there are several issues that we feel like, I think on both sides \nof the aisle, we must do this year, and one way or another--or should \ndo--and we will look at all of that. It is not my intent to drag this \nout to the end of the session because I would like for us to be--if I \nhad my way, I guess the last thing we would do would be probably the \nfast-track legislation in one form or another and to deal with it up or \ndown. That would be my thinking what we would do last, not because I am \npushing it off to the end but because we have to have some hearings, it \nhas to be marked up, go to Finance and I think Banking and two or three \nother Committees. That is what looks like will probably come up toward \nthe end of October or early November.\n  So it is my thinking that we would want to do it before then. I will \ntry to, you know, make sure everybody has an input here. We have \nSenators on both sides that have interest. We have chairmen that have \ninterest. It is not my desire to have this come up in the congestion at \nthe end.\n  I want to find a window. I can see a possibility of one before long \nwhere we can take this up and consider it for a period of time that \neverybody might be comfortable with.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for the breadth \nof that. I think it is very helpful to have that on the Record.\n  Secondly, I want to ask him just with respect to my own understanding \nof the request, the first amendment is the amendment from Senator \nMcCain.\n  Mr. LOTT. The original McCain-Feingold.\n  Mr. KERRY. Followed immediately by an amendment from the majority \nleader; is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. No. Followed by the modified McCain-Feingold bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. With a second degree?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Substitute.\n  Mr. LOTT. My amendment would be a first-degree amendment after the \nMcCain-Feingold modification.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I could ask, in furtherance of the \neffort here to keep the bipartisanship and discussions going, would it \nbe possible in the near term for us to learn the content of that other \namendment, of the amendment of the majority leader, so that we might be \nable to have something competent to be able to meet on and discuss?\n  Mr. LOTT. We have not made a final decision. We have a number of \noptions we are reviewing. It could be an amendment or it could be an \namendment in the nature of a substitute. And we are looking at both of \nthose possibilities. But before we bring it to the floor, we will \nnotify the Members of what our intent would be on that.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me take a moment, and reserve the right to object, \nto thank both of the leaders for coming together on this issue. It is \nof tremendous importance to everyone here in this body and to the \nAmerican people. And I think they both have an extremely difficult task \nin dealing with an issue like this that is of such personal importance \nto each Member of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S9771]]\n\n  It is very heartening to know that we have an agreement that will \nallow the open debate on this issue. Last year when the debate came up, \nthere were no amendments and a cloture vote within 2 days. It was not a \ngreat opportunity for the body and for the members of the public to be \ninvolved in. So I think this is a great step forward.\n  I want to thank my leader, Senator Daschle, for his persistence on \nthis. I want to thank the President for his absolutely relentless \nsupport of our legislation for over 2 years now. And I appreciate his \ninvolvement in this as well.\n  But overall, what I think we have seen here is a bipartisan ability \nto come together on timing. I hope it leads to a bipartisan ability to \ncome together on a meaningful piece of legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I too want to thank the distinguished \nmajority leader for working with others who are interested in this \nlegislation to create an atmosphere in which we can have an important \ndebate on an issue of enormous significance to our country. I think it \nis a sensible and orderly way to give everyone an opportunity to have \nhis or her say. I commend the majority leader and Senator McCain as \nwell for their good work to bring us to this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest of the majority leader? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9769-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9771-S9772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION MODERNIZATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF \n                                  1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now to be 4 hours of debate equally \ndivided on S. 830. The Senator from Vermont controls half that time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield to the Senator from Utah 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Record \nreflect the fact that amendment No. 1182, as modified, which was \nadopted was a Hatch-Wyden amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there is an old saying, ``No good deed goes \nunpunished.'' And it applies only too well to those who tackle the job \nof shepherding the FDA legislation through Congress.\n  The legislation we are debating today has its foundation in the last \nCongress. From my experience, I know that FDA bills are inherently \ncontentious and complicated--and that would be true even if my friend \nfrom Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, was not on the Labor Committee. \nSometimes I believe that it was this FDA bill that drove our good \nfriend Nancy Kassebaum out of the Senate.\n  So we should all take off our hats and thank Jim Jeffords for his \nefforts in forging this important compromise bill. The overwhelming \nvotes on cloture and on the motion to proceed are testament to the fact \nthat S. 830 is a solid piece of bipartisan legislation that will \nbenefit the American public for years to come.\n  Every Member of this body understands only too well the necessity of \nhaving good staff. Our staffs work long hours in order to resolve very \ndifficult issues. I commend the work of all of the staff involved in \nthe development of this bill. I will defer to tradition and allow the \nchairman and ranking member to single them out when the bill achieves \nits final passage.\n  However, I do want to depart from tradition for a moment to \ncompliment the work of Senator Jeffords' point person on FDA reform, \nJay Hawkins. It is always safe to bet against the passage of FDA \nlegislation, but Jay joined the Labor Committee this past winter and \nhit the ground running and has helped the chairman in crafting and \nbringing S. 830 through the committee and onto the floor.\n  Jay has worked hard, listened patiently to diverse viewpoints, \nidentified and solved problems, and has exhibited sound judgment and \ntremendous energy throughout this process.\n  Unfortunately for Jay and his family, on August 20, his mother, Mrs. \nDonna Lotz Hawkins, died after a long battle with cancer. Jay's mom was \na mountain climber, ocean swimmer, and distance runner who had many \nfriends that will deeply miss her.\n  The loss of a parent can never be replaced. While I never met Jay's \nmom, as a parent I know that she must have been extremely proud of her \nson for all of his important work in the Senate.\n  It is only fitting that this bill, which has so much of Jay's \nimprint, promises to speed the development of the next generation of \ncancer treatments.\n  I just wanted to take these few moments to salute Jay and the \nchairman for their considerable efforts on the FDA bill, and I want to \nextend my condolences to the Hawkins family on the loss of his mother.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the chairman and ask unanimous consent that I \nmay proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. D'Amato pertaining to the introduction of S. 1203 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nRhode Island might use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. We have made great progress with respect to the Food and \nDrug Administration [FDA] bill. That is a tribute to Chairman Jeffords \nand the ranking member, Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, and all the \nmembers of the committee and the Members of the Senate participating in \nthis debate.\n  However, there remains at least one issue of concern, one issue that \nwas a subject of extensive debate today. That issue is a provision \nregarding the 510(k) approval process for class I and class II devices. \nAs I mentioned previously, these class I and class II devices are \nserious medical devices. This is not a Band-Aid or gauze. These are \nlasers or biopsy needles or many other complicated, necessary medical \ndevices.\n  As a result, we cannot, I think, assume that this is a small or \ninconsequential issue we are debating. It is a very important issue.\n  Essentially, the legislation that is before the Senate today limits \nthe FDA from looking behind the stated use on the label presented by \nthe manufacturer when they request approval to put a new product on the \nmarket. It is important, in certain cases, to make such a searching \nreview beyond the proposed use by the manufacturer. It is particularly \nimportant in the case where there is strong suspicion that the label is \neither misleading or fraudulent or false. Although my amendment was not \nfavorably considered earlier today, it would have given the authority \nto the FDA to look beyond the label in cases where they could show--and \nthis is a very high standard of proof--that the label was false or \nmisleading.\n  There is no other provision in this new legislation that would give \nthe FDA such authority. Indeed, one could ask why the proponents of \nthis legislation deliberately chose to remove the FDA's authority and \nto effectively prevent the FDA from conducting a thorough review of \nmedical devices as they come on the market.\n  I have outlined, as many of my colleagues have, the detailed reaction \nof several sections of the FDA law. It is complicated, arcane \nlegislative language.\n  I have tried to think of a more homely and mundane example which \nmight illustrate the dilemma the FDA would be facing as it contemplates \nthis new legislation. If the FDA were in the position of not approving \nmedical devices but approving, for example, land transportation \nvehicles, they might be confronted with an existing model, perhaps a \nFord Mustang. And say, for example, a new product such as an F-16 \nfighter plane is presented for review.\n\n[[Page S9772]]\n\n Both can move over the ground, both of them are fairly fast, and both \nof them have certain similar aerodynamic capacities. Both of them can \ncarry passengers. So one could make the argument that the F-16 could be \nsubstantially equivalent in use as a ground transportation vehicle.\n  But I think anyone would have to say, upon looking at both of these \ndevices, that there is a strong suggestion the F-16 can be used for \nsomething else. If the FDA, or in this example, the hypothetical \nagency, did not have the authority to ask the simple question: Will it \nbe used to fly and can it fly? The hypothetical agency may not be doing \nthe job.\n  That is a homely example to illustrate that the FDA is frequently \nconfronted with devices that are presented as being substantially \nequivalent to existing devices. These new devices may be similarly \nlabeled to that existing device, but they have the potential for other \nuses. If it is obvious that the device is for uses not listed on the \nlabel, the FDA should have the authority to make an inquiry into those \nother uses.\n  In fact, my suspicion is that in the development of new medical \ndevices there is a long history of starts and stops. A history of \ncontact with other individuals, many researchers working together, \nexploring different uses and alternatives, different materials. In that \nprocess, it is very likely that other issues are contemplated, \nevaluated and perhaps designed into the device.\n\n  Today we have a system where there is more incentive for approaching \nthe FDA with a petition of a 510(k) approval because that is the \nfastest way to the marketplace. Even if there were uses that were \ndiscussed and contemplated, even if there are obvious uses that might \nbecome part of common practice, those may be dismissed in order to get \nthis through the system quickly.\n  What we have done today by not adopting my amendment is effectively \nprohibit the FDA from making that searching inquiry into possible uses. \nThe consequences can be severe to the public health.\n  Despite all of these issues we have discussed, this bill represents \nsignificant progress on many fronts. We are very, very close. I hope in \nthe ensuing conference--or before we go to conference--that we could \naddress this particular issue. It is an issue that has been highlighted \nby Secretary Shalala. It has been highlighted with respect to the \npotential for a Presidential veto. I hope we don't reach that point.\n  The hard work that has been done over many months by my colleagues, \nthe hard work of many representatives of the industry, and the hard \nwork of public health advocates I think will lead us, if we can get \nover this hurdle, to a bill that we will all be proud of.\n  In conclusion, today we have spent some time discussing the industry. \nWe have spent some time discussing the FDA. There have been criticisms \nby Members with respect to both the industry and the FDA. Our job at \nthis point is not to demonize or deify anyone. It is to get good laws \npassed. I believe this legislation can be approved and can succeed.\n  I note the majority leader is standing by, and I yield back my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9771-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             VISIT TO THE SENATE BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I am pleased to welcome a delegation from \nthe European Parliament to the U.S. Senate. The parliamentarians are in \nthe United States for the 47th interparliamentary meeting.\n  Europe continues to move forward with economic integration and the \nEuropean Parliament's role is increasingly important. As the European \nUnion--like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization--expands, the role \nof the European Parliament will become even more important.\n  The United States and the European Union have the world's largest \ncommercial relationship, with trade and investment approaching $1 \ntrillion.\n  I believe increased interaction between our legislature and the \nEuropean Parliament will serve the interests of both sides. I would \nlike to add that I met with the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, \nMr. Vernon Weaver, earlier this summer and was impressed with the job \nhe is doing to protect American interests in Brussels and across \nEurope.\n  I urge my colleagues to greet this delegation, led by Mr. Alan \nDonnelly of the United Kingdom.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of all of the \ndelegation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  European Parliament Delegation for Relations With the United States\n\n(47th EP/US Congress interparliamentary meeting, 21-26 September 1997, \n                             Washington DC)\n\n\n                          list of members (15)\n\n       Mr. Alan Donnelly, Chairman, PSE, United Kingdom.\n       Mr. Bryan Cassidy, 1st Vice-Chairman, PPE, United Kingdom.\n       Mr. Lucio Manisco, 2nd Vice-Chairman, GUE/NGL, Italy.\n       Ms. Nuala Ahern, V, Ireland.\n       Ms. Mary Banotti, PPE, Ireland.\n       *Mr. Jacques Donnay, UPE, France.\n       *Mr. Willi Gorlach, PSE, Germany.\n       Ms. Ilona Graenitz, PSE, Austria.\n       Mr. Fernand Herman, PPE, Belgium.\n       *Mr. Mark Killilea, UPE, Ireland.\n       Ms. Elly Plooij-Van Gorsel, ELDR, Netherlands.\n       Mr. Barry Seal, PSE, United Kingdom.\n       Mr. Michael Tappin, PSE, United Kingdom.\n       Mr. Josep Verde I.

Madam President, we are making substantial progress on \nthe FDA bill, and I applaud that progress. We have worked out a number \nof key issues on a bipartisan basis since the committee markup in June. \nWe have worked out the issues on fast tracking some innovative \nopportunities for dealing with the special challenges we are facing. We \nbuilt on the fast tracking that we have done on AIDS drugs, and we are \ntrying to do more in the areas of cancer and Alzheimer's, following \nwhat has been an important initiative at FDA for getting drugs out \nfaster. We have even worked out differences on the off-label uses of \nvarious pharmaceuticals and devices and what information and studies \nwill be required in terms of safety and efficacy. We have worked out \nthe early consultation between device manufacturers and the FDA.\n  We have been working toward reducing the total development time. A \nkey element in our negotiations has been going upstream and working \nwith the pharmaceutical companies, as well as the manufacturers, in \nshaping and formulating their applications so that they will move more \nrapidly through the approval process. Many of these initiatives were \nworked out by Dr. Kessler. We have put them into legislation under the \nleadership of Senator Jeffords and others on the committee. We have \nsettled the issues of cosmetics, after good debate and discussion. We \nhave also worked our third-party review pilot programs and timeframes \nfor some of the drug approvals. Each one of these issues was worked out \nin a way that protects the public health.\n  This process continues now with further debate today and tomorrow on \nwhat I, and others with me, consider to be the most significant threat \nto the public health remaining in the bill. These other areas that are \ncomplex and difficult, where a wide variety of different positions had \ndivided the committee in a significant way. We have\n\n[[Page S9773]]\n\nbeen able to make important and significant progress in ways that \nadvance public health. I believe that we have advanced the interest in \nthe public health. This final issue remains and has been identified by \nthe President of the United States and the Secretary of HHS as being \nthe No. 1 public health risk within this legislation. We had a good \ndebate on that issue earlier today and a real engagement of the \ndiffering ideas. I find that we were able to make important progress. \nThe Members realize and recognize what is really at stake. We were \nunable to win the majority of the Members, but we have a substantial \ngroup of Members who are likewise concerned about the public health \nissues.\n  We have heard from the various consumer groups and they are the ones \nthat will benefit the most from breakthrough devices. If you read \nthrough their concern and opposition to the provision in the \nlegislation and their strong support for the Reed amendment, you \nunderstand why we are so concerned about this particular provision.\n  The House is in the process of taking up legislation dealing with the \nsame subject matter, although they have reached a stalemate with regard \nto the extension on PDUFA. PDUFA, which I certainly support, provides \nthe additional resources for the FDA to get the kind of trained \ndisciplined personnel that represents the top of our research \ntechnology to work very effectively in the evaluation of these various \nproducts.\n  As the prime sponsor of that proposal here in the Senate, with my \nfriend and colleague, Orrin Hatch, we are clearly strongly in support \nof PDUFA. We tried to take similar action with regard to the medical \ndevice industry, but we were unable to do that. But we were able to \naccomplish it with the pharmaceutical industry, and it is necessary to \nhave this extension.\n  The House will take up the FDA. We will continue to work with the \nadministration, and with the leaders of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittees in the House to make sure the compromises reached in the \nSenate are retained or improved. We will work to make sure that the \nmedical device issue that we have been debating on the Senate floor is \nfixed.\n  We believe that the Food and Drug Administration should not be faced \nwith a situation where a device is submitted with a label that contains \nfalse and misleading information that would effectively deny FDA an \nopportunity to review the device on its real uses. And deny them the \nauthority to require the medical device company to provide information \nrelevant to the safety of that medical device.\n  There is nothing that we have heard that changes my very view that \nthe interests of the American consumer and the American public are best \nprotected by strengthening the lead agency for safety--the Food and \nDrug Administration. The agency to which all Americans turn when they \nfind that there is tampering with pharmaceuticals, or they are \nconcerned about the importation of pesticides on grapes from Chile, or \nthey are concerned about drugs and medical devices. We saw that across \nthe country this last week with the fen/phen tragedy.\n  Now we are being asked to reduce the protections for the American \npeople by prohibiting this lead agency, with all its expertise, from \nprotecting the public when it comes to medical devices. We are \nhandcuffing them from being able to reach out and protect the American \npublic when a medical device is falsely labeled. That is a serious \nerror on our part.\n  A great deal of discussion has taken place in the committee and out \nhere on the floor of the U.S. Senate as to the FDA's ability to approve \nmedical devices in a timely manner. We heard it expressed this morning. \nWe heard. ``Just look how bad the FDA really is.'' We have to accept \nthis provision because it is going to make such a difference to the \npatients that need these medical devices.\n  Let us look at what the record has been with regard to the FDA.\n  If you go through the GAO study on the FDA and its approval record, \nthe progress that has been made in the recent time is truly remarkable. \nI have it here. This shows the review times that have been decreasing, \nstarting in 1994, continuing 1995, and 1996. This is the General \nAccounting Office.\n  The premarket notification 501, the median FDA review time for \nnotification as judged to be equivalent devices already on the market \nhas dropped consistently from 199 days to 95 days in 1996. Look at that \ndifference between 1993 and 1996. The time reduced from 199 days to \nmore than half for the medical devices that are the substantial \nequivalent.\n  Here is the premarket approvals. Those take longer than the premarket \nnotifications because the FDA reviews the substantial amount of \nevidence to determine if the devices are safe and effective. The median \ntime for PMA has dropped from 766 days in 1993 to 280 days in 1996. \nAgain, a 40 percent reduction of the time--a dramatic improvement in \nthe most complicated medical devices that are new; to convince the FDA \nwith the range of different new technologies that are coming and that \nare being implanted in people. We have reduced that time for clearance \non the newest devices that have to be tested carefully and evaluated in \nterms of their safety. We have dropped the time by about 35 or 40 \npercent. Approval times have been reduced and we still have the best \nsafety record. We are seeing dramatic improvement in approval time for \nthe most complicated medical devices, and we are seeing dramatic \nimprovement in approval times for the kinds of medical devices that are \nsubstantially equivalent. And we still have a strong safety record. But \nthat isn't enough for the medical device industry. They are refusing to \nsupport an amendment which would permit the FDA to look at the safety \nfeatures of medical devices that ought to be looked at.\n\n  It would be an entirely different matter if these improvements had \nnot been made. At least you would have an argument to say you needed \ndramatic changes in the approval process. But the time it takes for the \nnewest kinds of medical devices are improving dramatically.\n  We heard on the floor of the Senate, ``Well, we have to be able to \nget these devices out there because all of us are aware of how fast \nthose devices are being approved in Europe. If we do not accept this \nprovision, all our medical device companies are going to go abroad. We \nare going to lose jobs. This is an issue of jobs. We will take a chance \nwith the health of the American people on this so we can keep our \nindustry here and protect our public.''\n  Well, let's look at the facts on this one. We have just had the GAO \nreport of June 1997 showing the remarkable progress that is being made \nin terms of approving these devices while still doing comprehensive \nexaminations of the complex safety issues. They can evaluate the new \nkinds of safety information provided by the medical device industry, \nand do it in a timely way, and protect the public. That is what Senator \nReed and myself believe should be done with regard to this provision.\n  Madam President, this is a May 12, 1997 document by the World Medical \nDevice Diagnostic News.\n  This is April 21, 1997.\n  I will include the relevant parts in the Record. But I am reading \nnow:\n\n       France calls on EU to tighten device controls. In a letter \n     to the European Council of Ministers, the French government \n     has called for tighter controls over high-risk medical \n     devices. The government is particularly concerned about \n     implantable devices and other products that fall into the \n     high-risk categories, class 3, class 2.\n\n  The letter which was sent to other EU member states has not been \nreleased publicly. It forms part of the French campaign of ever-\nincreasing intensity for more stringent relations on medical devices. \nFrance is also questioning the validity of the European approach to the \nregulation of products that pose a high risk to health.\n  Then in another section talking again about the European Union, \nindustry experts speculate the French might argue on the basis of the \nresults and the question of medical device directors being unable to \ncope with the high-risk products.\n  These are storm warnings with regard to the use of high-risk \nproducts--storm warnings from our European friends about what is \nhappening over there with their medical device industry. Then we heard \nhere, ``Well, those may be high risk but we are only looking at low \nrisk devices.'' Low risk? The list of the products that are being \nsuggested as low risk: Ventilators, fetal\n\n[[Page S9774]]\n\ncardiac monitors, imaging devices, MRI ultrasound, x-ray. Who wants to \ntake chances about whether the ultrasound that an expectant mother is \nhaving is going to do the job or not? We think that is a low risk? We \ndon't think that mother ought to be able to get satisfactory \ninformation about the adequacy of the protection and the soundness of x \nrays and CAT scans and ultrasound and MRI's, imaging devices. Low risk? \nAnesthesia machines. Low risk? We have the storm warnings about what is \nhappening in our own country.\n\n  Here is the February Business Outlook for the Medical Device Link. \nHere is their cover story February 1997:\n\n       With the improvements in FDA product review performance, \n     despite an ever more challenging domestic market, device \n     company executives are more optimistic than ever.\n\n  They talk about the FDA being cited by many as the leading source of \ntheir pessimism.\n  While nearly as many blamed the disconcerting restructuring of health \ncare providers, two years later--that is now. This is going back to \n1994 and 1995.\n\n       ``* * * two years later device company executives report a \n     substantial improvement in FDA's performance, particularly in \n     the 510(k) product approval times.\n\n  This is the medical device industry document. It continues.\n\n       In fact, this year's survey conducted last October marks \n     the highest business climate ratings ever in the 5-year \n     history of the survey.\n\n  The highest degree of approval rating ever in the 5-year history.\n  It is going well, my friends. We do not have a Shiley Heart Valve \ntragedy today. We don't have a Dalkon Shield tragedy today. It is \nworking in terms of protecting the public. But the industry is \ndemanding changes in providing the protection. Why? This is what the \nindustry is saying about the FDA. ``The impact of FDA's internal \nreforms and review time is more significant than might appear. The \nagency has not only reduced the approval delays that slowed newer \nproducts but, perhaps more importantly, has greatly reduced uncertainty \nas to the timeliness of future product introductions.''\n  I will include the appropriate amount of this. I will not take up the \nwhole record, although it is a fairly short document.\n  It continues along: Respondents' rating of the current business \nclimate for the medical device. Here are the results. A substantial \nmajority of medical device executives said, medical device industry, \ngood or excellent.\n  Then it has executive ratings of device industry business climate, \n1993 to 1997: 58 percent good or excellent. Last year it was 58 to 11. \nFind me an agency of Government where those who are being covered by \nthe regulators are saying 58 percent approval, 11 percent disapproval. \nAn examination of this review shows that it was down just in 1995, 37 \nto 23--37 percent approval, 23 percent disapproval. Now that \ndisapproval has gone from 23 to 12 to 11 in 1997 and the 37 is up to 58 \nin 2 years. This is the reflection of those who are involved in medical \ndevice businesses.\n  ``Expectation of respondents for business conditions in the medical \ndevice and diagnostic industry,'' again, going up, enormously \nfavorable.\n  ``One important cause of this year's improved outlook is the clearly \nperceived improvement in relations with the FDA. As shown in figure \n5''--that will be in the Record--``the decline in complaints about the \nagency mirrors the increase in positive business outlooks.''\n  You could not get a greater endorsement. You could not find better \nsupport for an agency that is being regulated. You could not see a more \ndramatic improvement in how that agency has been dealing with those \nthat it is required to police. And all while still protecting the \npublic health, all being done to protect the public health. As the \nSecretary of HHS and the President of the United States said, of all \nthe different provisions, this is the one that puts the public health \nat risk. All against a background of a device industry that is saying \nthings have never been better.\n  Several committee members have expressed concerns that the FDA will \ntry to think of every possible off-label use for a device and harass \nthe industry to death. There is no justification for that attitude. It \nis good rhetoric, but it just defies any kind of understanding about \nwhat is happening in the medical device industry today. The medical \ndevice manufacturers and personnel find that their relationship with \nthe FDA is improving significantly in terms of how they are being \ntreated, the times that are involved, the way that the agency has been \nconsidering various applications like the ones we have been talking \nabout. The public health is being protected, but we are being asked to \nchange it.\n  How many times around here do you hear, ``If it is not broke, why fix \nit?'' Well, this is the attempt to try to fix something that is not \nbroke. And we are not talking about widgets here. We are talking about \nreal health implications to the American public.\n  Why should we take a chance on people's health when those medical \ndevices are being carefully tailored and designed technologically to do \nsomething that is different than is on the label? It just defies me. \nThat is the issue.\n  So, as we go on through this survey report, talking about \ninternational markets: ``Just as outlooks on business are influenced by \nmarket segments, so, too, they are affected by geographical markets. In \nfact, large companies have a clear advantage over small ones in \nentering foreign markets. Of the companies surveyed, 91 percent were \nselling to the United States, just over half were doing business in \nEurope and Canada, while 36 to 40 percent were in Latin America. Of the \nlargest companies surveyed within the various''--$50 million in annual \nrevenues, 90 percent or more were involved in the survey and they show \nhere when asked what markets offered them the best prospects in 1997, \nmore respondents, 80 percent, named the United States than any other \nmarket. This are the medical device companies from Central and South \nAmerica talking about what they believe the greatest opportunity for \nmarket expansion is in the United States, and they are going to have to \nmeet the strict requirements that are being put out by the FDA. They \nthink, even going through those requirements for safety and ensuring \nthe public is going to be protected, that there is this dramatic \nopportunity for growth.\n\n  And it just continues. If we go through the Medical Economics \nmagazine of this year, January, it talks about the enormous explosion \nof the various devices, talking of the demand for devices to treat \narteriosclerosis, enlarged prostates, infertility and many others \ncreates a worldwide market of $120 billion, including about $50 billion \nin the United States. That's growing by 8 percent annually. Feeding \nthis demand are technologies that offer new ways to treat disease, \nallow doctors to treat illness more quickly, effectively and safely. \nThe coronary stint, for example, created a submarket that exploded from \n$220 million globally to more than $1 billion in 1996. Sales of this \ndevice are growing 30 to 40 percent.\n  I used that as one of the examples here the other day. This is a $1 \nbillion industry. We are talking about the power of this industry to \nput pressure on Congress, with this kind of economic power, that \npressure is dramatic. To resist that kind of pressure when it is \ncontrary to the protection of the public health I think is enormously \nimportant.\n  What we are saying is simple and fundamental. That is, the proposal \nthat is being advanced here will permit the medical device industry to \nsubmit various medical devices to the FDA and the FDA will be limited \nto examining only the uses listed on the label of the medical devices. \nIf it is substantially equivalent to a medical device that's been \napproved, all the company has to be able to show is that it has the \nsame kind of safety protections that the earlier device had, even \nthough--even though--it is the intention of the medical device \nmanufacturer to use that medical device for an entirely different \npurpose and market it for an entirely different purpose, the FDA is \nprohibited from examining the safety features.\n  Maybe those safety features are such that they will significantly \nimprove the health and well-being of the person that is using the \nmedical device, but we ought to make sure at least that the agency has \nthe information that would justify that utilization. All this is \nhappening against a background which demonstrates that the medical\n\n[[Page S9775]]\n\ndevice industry is happier with the FDA than at any time in the history \nof the 20 years, 23 years, of medical device legislation. Happier that \nthere has been a dramatic improvement in approval timeframes, important \nimprovement in terms of safety. We are taking that excellent record and \nrisking it with this particular provision. It does not make sense.\n  This makes absolutely no sense at all. We strongly believe that this \nprovision has to be altered or changed. We have missed the opportunity \nto do that on this particular legislation, but we will have further \nopportunities to do so in the near future.\n  It is amazing to me, as we went through consideration and as we were \nable to make progress on so many other items while advancing public \nhealth, but the medical device industry does not want to deal with this \none. They felt they had the votes. They had them this afternoon. But \nthis is a long road. It is a long road, the completion of this whole \nprocess, and we are going to fight every step of the way. We have seen \na variety of different options that would attend the kind of concerns \nthat the medical device industry has put expressed, which we and the \nFDA and the administration were prepared to deal with, but the device \nindustry is unprepared and unwilling to do so.\n  So if they are unwilling, we are unwilling at least to roll over. \nThere are a variety of different procedures which we will have to \nresort to in order to make sure that this threat to the public health \nof the American people does not go forward over the objections of those \nwho are in the best position and do represent the patients and the \nconsumers.\n  By accepting this change in the protections available to the American \npublic at this time, we are not saying that the health of the American \npeople is going to be advanced. If this particular provision remains \nunchanged, a provision which effectively handcuffs the FDA, it is the \nbottom line of the medical device companies that will be enhanced. And \nethical companies and the protection of the American people will \nsuffer.\n  That makes absolutely no sense. It is basically and fundamentally \nwrong, and we will continue the battle ahead.\n\n\n                       appropriations ``trigger''\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, as chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee with funding jurisdiction for the Food and Drug \nAdministration, I am compelled to state my opposition to the \nappropriations mandate in this bill. While this bill reauthorizes \nprescription drug user fees for the next 5 years, it also states that \nthe FDA cannot assess those fees unless the appropriation for FDA \nsalaries and expenses is at least equal to the appropriation for fiscal \nyear 1997, adjusted for inflation.\n  The Appropriations Subcommittee will continue to balance the needs \nand requirements of all agencies and activities under its jurisdiction \nwithin the total amounts available for discretionary appropriations. \nAny member of the Senate who disagrees with the committee's \nrecommendations is free to seek to change the allocation of resources \nproposed in the bill.\n  However, annual appropriations decisions should not be predetermined \nby the establishment of arbitrary appropriations ``floors'' and \n``ceilings'' in authorization bills. In this particular case, the bill \nseeks to dictate that FDA's salaries and expenses appropriation be \n``held harmless'' against inflation--that for each of the next five \nfiscal years, the appropriations be at least equal to the current \nappropriations level, adjusted for inflation. If not, FDA cannot assess \nprescription drug user fees.\n  Madam President, I am certain that each agency and program which \nreceives appropriations would like to secure a similar protection \nagainst inflation. However, this is unrealistic in the current budget \nenvironment and inconsistent with the levels available for \ndiscretionary appropriations under the bipartisan budget agreement.\n  Industry paid fees are expected to supplement rather than supplant \nFDA spending for drug approvals. For this reason, I understand the \nindustry's desire to make sure that FDA maintains its current level of \neffort relative to the drug approval process. However, as I indicated, \nit is unreasonable to attempt to guarantee FDA protection against \ninflation at the possible expense of other programs and activities. It \nwould be difficult for me as chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee of jurisdiction to predict what agency or program \nrestructuring might occur over the next 5 fiscal years, what a program \nor agency's future resource requirements might be, or the fiscal \nconstraints the subcommittee might face in each future year.\n  Mr. President, it could be that the minimum mandated appropriations \nlevel in this bill is met in each of those years. However, it is just \nas likely that it would not be. The Appropriations Committee will \ncontinue to do its work by considering the needs of every program and \nagency within its jurisdiction within the total resources available to \nit. It will not feel constrained to meet the proposed appropriations \n``trigger'' for the collection of prescription drug user fees if it \nremains in this bill.\n  I do not think it is the intent of the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee or the Senate to set an arbitrary mandate that might result \nin a situation during the course of the next 5 years where these fees \nmay not be collected. I believe this would undermine the existing drug \napproval process and run counter to the interests of the federal \ngovernment, the industry, and the American public. The issues and \nconcerns I raise are similar to those expressed by Senators Gregg and \nMcConnell in the additional views they incorporated in the committee's \nreport accompanying S. 830.\n  Madam President, I am hopeful that the committee take this issue \nseriously and will work in conference to remove this appropriations \nmandate and possible impediment to the continued success of the \nPrescription Drug User Fee Act.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

They died in the service of their country, and \nI know my colleagues join me in honoring their memory and their \nsacrifice.\n  The B-1 accident was the sixth military air crash in 7 days. Although \nthere is no apparent connection between the accidents, Secretary of \nDefense William Cohen rightly asked the Air Force and the other \nbranches of the Armed Forces to implement a 24-hour safety stand down \nto allow those who fly and maintain U.S. military aircraft to focus on \nsafety.\n  Despite the rash of accidents that occurred in recent days, the past \nyear has been a relatively safe year for the Department of Defense.\n  Fifty-five military aviation accidents occurred this year compared to \n67 last year, 69 in 1995, and 86 in 1994. Although this appears to be a \ngood trend, the Pentagon must strive to improve its safety record even \nfurther, and they are doing that.\n  I commend Secretary Cohen for implementing a safety stand down and am \nconfident it will yield positive results.\n\n[[Page S9776]]\n\nIf it helps to prevent just one crash or the loss of just one life, the \nsafety review will be well worth the effort.\n  As Secretary Cohen recently said, ``The lives of our aircrews and \npassengers are very precious, and each loss is a great tragedy.''\n  As the Air Combat Command, the Air Force and other branches of the \nArmed Forces study safety this week, I hope all of us will take a \nmoment to reflect on those committed and dedicated individuals who lost \ntheir lives in military crashes in recent days. I would like to take a \nmoment to review the exceptional lives of those four service members \nfrom Ellsworth Air Force Base who died in the tragic accident last \nweek.\n  Col. Anthony Beat was born in Willard, OH, in 1951. He graduated from \nOhio State University in 1973 and earned his commission through the Air \nForce Reserve Officer Training Corps the same year.\n  During his long tenure in the Air Force, Tony served in a number of \ncapacities. He was a B-52 copilot, aircraft commander and instructor \npilot. He was also assigned to the Bases and Units Division in the \nStrategic Air Command headquarters. Most recently, he served as the \nvice commander of the 28th Bomb Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base.\n  My staff and I had worked closely with Colonel Beat on a number of \nissues during his tenure as vice commander. His expertise and many \naccomplishments had a profound impact on Ellsworth Air Force Base.\n  Colonel Beat was a member of the Ellsworth Black Hills Chapel and \nenjoyed jogging, hunting, and fishing. He is survived by his wife, \nDolores Ann, and their son, James Allen.\n  Maj. Clay Culver grew up in Memphis, TN, and graduated from the \nMemphis State University in 1981. Since earning his commission in 1983, \nMajor Culver was an Advanced Electronic Warfare Systems instructor in \nthe 453d Flying Training Squadron, an assistant operations officer, and \ndefensive systems officer instructor.\n  Most recently, he served as an assistant operations officer and \nweapons systems officer in the 37th Bomb Squadron at Ellsworth Air \nForce Base.\n  Major Culver is survived by his wife, Cynthia; a daughter, Ann; and \nson, Parker. Mrs. Culver said recently her husband ``was doing the \nright thing, and it was a very honorable way to go.''\n  Maj. Kirk Cakerice was born in 1954 in Eldora, IA. He graduated from \nthe University of Northern Iowa in 1977 and married Myra Van Sickle the \nsame year.\n  Kirk earned his commission in 1982 and served in a number of \nassignments including B-1B Aircraft Commander, instructor of B-1B \nAircraft Commanders, and cadet squadron commander at the U.S. Air Force \nAcademy in Colorado Springs. Most recently, he served as an assistant \noperations officer in the 37th Bomb Squadron at Ellsworth Air Force \nBase.\n  A longtime friend of Major Cakerice said Kirk was the ``prototypical \nIowa boy.'' He ``grew up in smalltown Iowa, tremendous sense of humor, \nvery talented at sports, could learn something quickly and do it.''\n  Major Cakerice was a member of the Canyon Lake United Methodist \nChurch in Rapid City, SD. He is survived by his wife, Myra; son, Brett; \nand daughter, Kendra.\n  Capt. Gary Everett, who was engaged to be married, was the youngest \nof the four who died in the B-1B crash on Friday. He was born in \nBrooklyn, NY, in 1962 and grew up near Louisville, KY.\n  His parents, three brothers, and one sister still live in Kentucky.\n  Gary graduated from the University of Louisville with a degree in \nphysics in 1986 and earned his commission through the Officers Training \nSchool 2 years later. He served as B-1B Defensive Systems Officer in \nthe 34th Bomb Squadron and as a weapons systems officer in the 37th \nBomb Squadron at Ellsworth Air Force Base.\n  Gary had many interests outside the Air Force, including an online \nservice called RapidNet that he founded with two partners in Rapid \nCity. Gary's sister-in-law, Karen Everett, said ``Gary was a hero to \nall his younger cousins. He was a wonderful role model for all his \nachievements, in starting his own business, and for his emphasis on how \nimportant education is.''\n  Captain Everett is survived by his parents, Joseph and Dorothy \nEverett, of Glasgow, KY; three brothers, James, Joe, and William; one \nsister, Carol Ann Johnson; and his fiancee, Karen Tallent of Rapid \nCity, SD.\n  Mr. President, we suffered a tragic loss on Friday. Col. Tony Beat, \nMaj. Clay Culver, Maj. Kirk Cakerice, and Capt. Gary Everett served \nnobly, and they will be deeply missed. Their commitment and dedication \nto their families, the Air Force, and our country will not be \nforgotten.\n  Like many in South Dakota and throughout the country, my thoughts and \nprayers are with the families of those who lost their loved ones in \nthis terrible tragedy. And we think of them now.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Madam President, in 1990 Senator Nunn and I cochaired \nthe Strengthening of America Commission which among its \nrecommendations, called for abolishing the current income tax code, and \nreplacing it with a progressive consumption-based income tax code that \nwould encouraged savings and investment.\n  The National Federation of Independent Business is in Independence, \nMO, today starting a nationwide petition drive that encourages all \nsmall business owners to sign a petition calling upon the President and \nCongress to abolish the IRS Code as of December 31, 2000 and to replace \nit with a simpler, fairer tax code which will reward work and savings.\n  I intend to sign this petition and encourage all of my colleagues to \ndo likewise.\n  NFIB is launching the petition drive in Independence MO, home of \nPresident Harry Truman, who said, ``The Buck stops here.'' NFIB is \ntelling the American public that ``the code stops here.''\n  NFIB could have started their campaign in the town of Truth or \nConsequences, New Mexico. When dealing with the IRS, ``tell the truth \nor pay the consequences'' could be their motto.\n  But things have gone wrong. Compliance has become lax or nasty.\n  Despite a $7 billion in annual budget and 106,000 employees the IRS \nfailed to collect an estimated $200 billion of taxes a year.\n  Tax collection is as nasty as it is lax.\n  In New Mexico, there is a sense of frustration among people trying to \ncomply. Taxpayers receive computer generated letters. The letter is \neither a short, brutish demand for more money or an incomplete and \nunclear request for more documentation The letters usually include no \nphone number, and no contact person. Now, that is actually from my \nstaff working with constituents. The letters usually include no phone \nnumbers and no contact person.\n  The letter strikes fear. The message is clear--TRUTH or PAY the \nconsequences. But the letter usually fails to explain what truth, in \nthe form of additional documentation, is needed to avoid the \nconsequences.\n  In New Mexico, my home State, the IRS letter could originate in \nPhoenix, AZ, Ogden, UT, Albuquerque, NM, or Dallas, TX. When \nconstituents fail to figure out the point-of-origin themselves they \ncome to my office. It takes a professional case worker at least 2 days \njust to track down the IRS office handling the case of a New Mexico \nresident.\n  I know that the National Commission on Restructuring the IRS has \nissued its report and that Senators Grassley and Kerry have turned the \nrecommendations into legislation that takes a top-down approach giving \nthe IRS commissioner a longer term and more flexibility.\n\n[[Page S9777]]\n\n  But knowing what I know, I believe the legislation also needs to take \na bottom-up, common sense approach. Simple things will make big \ndifferences.\n  For example, letters from the IRS should have a contact person and \nphone number that will be answered by that one-and-the-same person. I \ndon't mean a 1-800 number that is totally automated. You have heard \nabout it. It is the number that is always busy, but if you persist for \nabout an hour you can get through. Then it puts you on hold for another \nhour, and finally provides the following helpful choices:\n  Press one for more instructions that you can't understand;\n  Press 2 for more information that will frighten you;\n  Press 3 for information that will confuse you further ;\n  Press 4 for information that contradicts what we told you when you \npressed one, two or three;\n  Press 5 for information that contradicts what we told your accountant \nyesterday.\n  I wish I were kidding.\n  Part of the problem is the IRS. But part of the problem is the \nCongress, because we passed the tax laws that made the code too \ncomplicated. And for that we should all stand up, if we voted for those \ntax measures, and take our share of the blame.\n  The IRS simplest return, the EZ form 1040 has 33 pages of \ninstructions. That is the easy form. The Form 1040 has 76 pages. The \nEarned Income Tax credit instructions are 23 pages and the worksheet is \nas ambiguous as it is long.\n  The National Federation of Independent Businesses estimates that \nAmerica's businesses will spend 3.4 billion hours, and individuals will \nspend 1.7 billion hours, simply trying to comply with the tax code. \nThat's equivalent to 3 million people working full time, year around, \njust on taxes.\n  Another problem with IRS compliance is that there are too many steps. \nI was recently contacted by constituents trying to get their Earned \nIncome check. The IRS is 6 months behind in New Mexico in reviewing the \ntax forms filed for Earned Income credits. The IRS is looking into \nabout 1,600 claims and requesting additional information from the \ntaxpayers. I don't fault the IRS for making sure that the claims are \nlegitimate, but I do find fault with their process.\n  The first letter from the IRS merely informs you that you are not \ngoing to get your EIC check until you contact IRS.\n  The next step is to contact them and wait. In 6 weeks they will get \nback to you with information on what information they want from you to \nverify your claim.\n  In northern New Mexico, many people speak Spanish. It is difficult \nfor them to understand English and certainly difficult for them to \nunderstand the complexities that I have just described. It would be \nhelpful if instructions were in Spanish as well as English. The \nGrassley-Kerry bill calls for the creation of taxpayer assistance \ncenters where people can go for face-to-face assistance. I would \nsuggest that some of these places these people be bilingual for those \nwho have difficulty speaking English and filling out complicated forms.\n  The current code is so complicated that unintended consequences are \nunavoidable.\n  We recently passed a middle class tax cut--but what the Congress \nintended, the alternative minimum tax takes away. New information from \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation estimate that individuals paying the \nalternative minimum tax will increase from 605,000 in 1997 to 8.4 \nmillion families by 2007 unless something is changed. Part of this \nincrease is caused by the new $500 child credit and college tuition \ncredits. The perversity of the alternative minimum tax is that the more \ncredits a family is entitled to, the more likely it is that the family \nwill have to pay the alternative minimum tax. But we just built these \nnew credits into the code, taking much credit with middle-income \nAmericans. Yet, the alternative minimum tax on individuals remains in \neffect. Put another way, the alternative minimum tax is hostile to \nfamilies claiming the $500 child credit and the college tuition tax \ncredit. Middle class families will find that their middle class tax cut \nis partially taken away because of the alternative minimum tax.\n  The alternative minimum tax is complicated but it is also punitive. \nFamilies who thought they were in the 15 percent tax bracket find \nthemselves in a 26 percent alternative minimum tax bracket. An 11 \npercent jump sounds bad but it is even worse when you remember that the \nalternative minimum tax base is broader than the regular income tax \nbase. In other words, you apply the new rate, the higher rate, against \na broader income than what you would have applied under the ordinary \nreturn.\n  As I wrote Secretary Rubin last Friday: ``The alternative minimum tax \nis a trap for a growing number of American families. Most people don't \nknow that it exists and those who do, view it as a tax on the rich, and \nnot something to bother with. But that is not the case.''\n  ``The passage of the Taxpayer Relief Act is going to turn more and \nmore middle class taxpayers into alternative minimum tax payers, and at \nthe same time deny them a signficant portion of the middle class tax \ncut[s we have given them].''\n  We have to fix this unintended consequence, and do it quickly.\n  Restructuring the IRS to be kinder and gentler will make taxpayers \nless frustrated, but an equally serious problem is the destructive \nimpact that the current code has on the economy.\n  The current code adds about one-third to the cost of capital, makes \nus less competitive because it is not border adjustable, and it \npenalizes savings and investment--two activities that are of tremendous \nvalue to our economy.\n  I have given dozens of speeches on the Senate floor about why this is \nso. I am not going to do that today.\n  My message today is first, to encourage every member of the Congress \nto sign the NFIB petition calling for a sunset to the IRS code, second, \nfor Congress to work quickly to solve the alternative minimum tax \nproblem which threatens to undermine the middle class tax cut that \neveryone worked so hard for, and, third, to move toward a new Tax Code \nthat will foster economic growth.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Brownback]. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9776-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9777-S9778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FCC REGULATIONS AFFECTING RURAL TELEPHONE RATES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to express my dismay, actually \nmy increasing dismay, at the direction the Federal Communications \nCommission is taking, the misguided deregulation of local telephone \nmarkets.\n  When the Telecommunications Act was debated, and then when it was \nsigned into law, many supporters hailed the legislation first and \nforemost as a boon to consumers.\n  We were told that because of the magical hand of competition, \ntelephone rates for consumers would decrease; the free market system \nwould take over.\n  Now, competition, if it is correctly injected into the telephone \nmarket, can lead to lower prices for consumers. But the FCC's ham-\nhanded attempts to implement poor legislation--and it was poor \nlegislation, which is why I voted against it--has made the problem even \nworse.\n  During the debate of the telecommunications bill, I took the Senate \nfloor and expressed real strong concerns that skyrocketing telephone \nrates for rural areas, like my own State of Vermont, seemed likely. I \nwish I had been wrong, but unfortunately my concerns seem justified.\n  Even a bad telecommunications bill--and this was--could have been \npartially mitigated by careful and proper implementation. But the FCC \nseems bent on wanting to take what was a poorly done bill and make it \nworse. They want to exacerbate the conditions I expressed concern about \nduring debate on the bill.\n  Here is what has happened.\n  Instead of increasing telephone service competition, there are three \nalarming FCC decisions that will in fact reduce telephone competition \nin rural areas and will likely result in much larger monthly telephone \nbills in States such as Vermont.\n  The result may be that many rural customers will not be able to \nafford a\n\n[[Page S9778]]\n\ntelephone at home. The dream of linking America together on the \ninformation superhighway, a dream of linking all parts of America, \nurban and rural, together will remain just that, a dream, not a \nreality, because rural America will be cut off.\n  The Telecommunications Act directed the FCC to ensure that rates for \nphone service in rural areas remain reasonably comparable to rates in \nurban areas. Now, I understand there are details being worked out, but \nmany of the decisions already rendered by the FCC do not bode well for \nrural States like Vermont.\n  For instance, the FCC decided the Federal universal service support \nwould be raised only from the interstate revenues of interstate \ncarriers. So what does that do? The FCC places off limits more than \nhalf of the retail revenue available from the telephone industry.\n  Second, the FCC has ruled they would support only 25 percent of the \nneed even in a high-cost rural State like Vermont. This leaves 75 \npercent of the need to be raised by the States themselves, presumably \nfrom the intrastate revenues generated in those States, in other words, \nto raise the largest amount from the small rural States.\n  And third, they seem to repeal the high-cost support as we know it.\n  Let me show you on this chart, Mr. President. This shows a likely \nresult of the FCC's three decisions.\n  This assumes the States are going to have to make up the support that \nthe FCC now says it will not provide. Let us see what this means. The \nblue vertical bars show the anticipated State surcharges on intrastate \nrevenues; that is, if they want to make up the difference. The red bars \nshow an alternative approach, which the FCC did not adopt, where all \nneeded support would come from a uniform Federal surcharge on all \ntelephone revenues.\n  Let me tell you what this means. If they had done what they should \nhave done, almost all States would have paid about a 2-percent \nsurcharge to make up the difference. That is the red line on the chart. \nWhether you are in the District of Columbia or North Dakota, whether \nyou are in New Jersey or Wyoming, you will be paying roughly the same.\n  However, instead of doing that, what the FCC has said, to heck with \nrural States. Instead of keeping a surcharge about the same for \neverybody, they tell North Dakota they will have to come up with about \n33 percent, South Dakota about the same, Wyoming, just under 30 \npercent, Montana similar to that, New Mexico and Kansas up over about \n12 percent. If you are a small rural State, what they are saying is \nforget about being part of the telecommunication revolution. If you are \na small rural State, forget about being told the U.S. Congress has \ngiven you a good deal in the Telecommunications Act. You have just got \na disconnect signal. In fact, you probably have to pay for that.\n  Of the top 15 States, almost all rural States, they can buy with only \na rate surcharge of 9 percent. That is money out of pocket. The act \nrequires States to have reasonably comparable rates. Boy, this sounds \ngreat. You are from a rural State or from an urban State, roughly \ncomparable rates. Who could disagree? Except what happens, if you are \npaying a 1- or 2-percent surcharge in one State and in another State a \n30- or 35-percent surcharge, you are not roughly comparable, and there \nis no way these States can compete.\n  Would it not have made more sense to say every State pays about 2.6, \n2.5 percent surcharge? Then everybody would be on an even playing \nfield, whether you are a company in North Dakota or in Vermont, or you \nare a company in Michigan or Pennsylvania, at least basic costs would \nremain the same. If you were a homeowner, if you were a renter, if you \nwere in those States, your costs would be roughly comparable.\n  Under the FCC's proposal, which make no sense at all, many experts \npredict an increase in the 100 percent to 200 percent range for phone \nrates in these very rural States. Now, I am one Vermonter who would not \nstand for that, and I cannot imagine any other Vermonter standing for \nthat.\n  I think the time will prove these unfortunate predictions correct, as \nrural phone companies go out of business, the bigger competitors cherry \npick the best customers, and the rural areas, you might as well go back \nto smoke signals, Pony Express, or shouting across the valleys because \nyou will not be able to do it by picking up the phone.\n  I think the FCC is letting a golden opportunity slip by. I think, Mr. \nPresident, we may have given them the opportunity by casting rural \nareas over the side in that Telecommunications Act. Even tossing them \nover side, you would have thought the FCC would have put out a net or a \nhelping hand. Instead, it looks like they tied the anchor around their \nneck as they went by and dropped them into the ocean.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9777-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9778-S9781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LANDMINE BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, President Clinton announced that \nthe United States would not join nearly 100 nations, including most of \nour NATO allies, in a treaty to ban antipersonnel landmines.\n  I want to take a few minutes to respond to the President's decision. \nFirst, let me say that President Clinton and I have spoken many times \nabout the landmine issue. I am convinced he wants to see these weapons \nbanned from the face of the Earth. He and I have discussed the \nhorrendous toll of innocent lives that landmines cause, and in speeches \nat the United Nations he has twice called for a worldwide ban.\n  President Clinton said, ``The United States will lead a global effort \nto eliminate these terrible weapons and stop the enormous loss of human \nlife.'' Those were inspiring words. However, as convinced as I am of \nthe President's desire for a ban, I am as convinced that a tremendous \nopportunity was lost last week. An opportunity that rarely comes in \nhistory.\n  As a USA Today editorial put it, ``having blown the best chance ever \nto negotiate an acceptable international ban on landmines, the Clinton \nadministration now finds itself churning in the wake of world affairs. \nThe United States has joined a few nations, including rogue states like \nIran and Iraq, on the outside of a remarkable process.''\n  There are many losers in the administration's last-minute failed \nattempt to negotiate in Oslo. Unfortunately, the most notable losers \nwere the innocent victims of landmines who the treaty aims to protect. \nMr. President, the victims of landmines are almost invariably children \nand innocent civilians.\n  Because while the treaty is immensely important for establishing a \nnew norm of conduct, until the United States signs it, there will never \nbe a worldwide ban. There is simply no substitute for the credibility \nand influence of the United States to bring reluctant nations on board \nand make sure that violators of the treaty are caught and punished. \nThere is no way to fully stigmatize these weapons and curtail the use, \nas has been done with poison gas, without U.S. leadership far stronger \nthan we have seen today.\n  And the tragedy of our country's decision is that it was avoidable. \nAlthough the President said his administration had gone the extra mile \nto find an acceptable compromise in Oslo, I must respectfully and \nhonestly disagree.\n  Two weeks ago I went to Oslo where I met with representatives of \ngovernments, including the United States, and nongovernmental \norganizations that were participating in the treaty negotiations.\n  The treaty they adopted was nothing short of a miracle. In less than \na year, nations as diverse as our closest European allies who have been \nmajor producers of landmines, to Mozambique whose people have been \nkilled and maimed by landmines, joined together in finalizing a treaty \nthat does nothing less than ban the use, production, stockpiling, and \ntransfer of a category of weapons that Civil War General William \nTecumseh Sherman called ``a violation of civilized warfare'' over a \ncentury ago.\n  I call the Ottawa Treaty a miracle because it was only 11 months ago \nthat Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy launched what is now \ncalled the ``Ottawa process.'' At the time, no one knew how many \nnations would take part or where it would lead, not even Minister \nAxworthy. It was a bold and courageous leap of faith, and the\n\n[[Page S9779]]\n\nsame kind of leadership I and so many others hoped to see from the \nWhite House last week.\n  The Ottawa Treaty culminates two decades of failed attempts to deal \neffectively with the landmine problem. Two decades ago many of the same \nnations that gathered in Oslo met in Geneva to draft a treaty to \naddress the growing concerns of the effects of landmines on civilian \npopulations. Landmines had been widely used in Southeast Asia, and they \nwere being sown like seed in Afghanistan and Central America and many \nAfrican countries. Vast areas were being laid to waste with the \ninnocents paying the horrifying price. I have seen victims, all over \nthe world, of these indiscriminate weapons.\n  My wife is a registered nurse and has visited the hospitals where the \namputations take place, where broken bodies are put back together as \nbest can be done in countries where medical care is often rudimentary.\n  That treaty, however--the Conventional Weapons Convention--utterly \nfailed to achieve its goal. It was doomed to fail because of the fact \nthat landmines are inherently incapable of distinguishing between \ncivilians and combatants, and that fact was never even acknowledged in \nGeneva, much less addressed. Instead, in diplomatic niceties, by people \nwho would never have to face landmines themselves, they adopted vague \nlimits of how mines could be used. Those limits were then routinely \nignored. In the years since then, the devastation inflicted by \nlandmines on innocent people, often the poorest people in the world, \nhas increased dramatically. In fact, Mr. President, it was the \nwidespread recognition of the failure of that treaty which led to the \nConventional Weapons Review Conference 2 years ago. Finally, it seemed \nthere could no longer be any excuse for doing whatever was necessary to \nstop the carnage wrought by landmines.\n\n  That was the hope. Unfortunately, the reality was a lot different. \nRather than devise a roadmap for ridding the world of these weapons, \ngovernments, including our own, fought for the right to use them. The \nidea of a ban was barely mentioned. The amended protocol, while \npreferable to the original, did far more to reaffirm the legitimacy of \nlandmines than to stop their use. Once again, governments had failed to \nact with anything like the decisiveness that was called for.\n  So it is important to remember that the Ottawa process evolved only \nafter years of failed attempts by governments to solve this problem in \nthe traditional way. There was no shortage of impassioned speeches \nabout the harm landmines were causing the innocent. But the expressions \nof outrage were qualified with the assertion that the problem wasn't \nthe mines themselves, but other people, always other people, who used \nthem irresponsibly. You would think it was a tea party rather than arms \ncontrol. And the carnage, of course, continued.\n  But we hear those same arguments today. The same failed arguments of \na decade ago. Today when a Pentagon official was asked about the tens \nof thousands of American landmine casualties in Vietnam, he said that \nwas no longer relevant because ``smart'' mines had ``solved their \nproblem.''\n  Of course, they have not solved it. Almost no one besides the United \nStates uses those mines. In Bosnia, more than 250 U.N. and NATO \nsoldiers and thousands of civilians have been injured or killed today \nby the same types of mines used in Vietnam a generation ago.\n  As I have said so many times, an effective international agreement \nbased on stigmatizing a weapon cannot have different standards for \ndifferent nations. The importance of this principle cannot be \noverstated. It is what underlies any international agreement.\n  When the Princess of Wales spoke about the insidious toll of \nlandmines, she said, ``Before I went to Angola, I knew the facts, but \nthe reality was a shock.'' Unfortunately, the reality that Princess \nDiana saw was a reality which far too few government officials have \nexperienced, including many people at the Pentagon. When people have \ngone with me and seen the carnage caused by landmines, they have a new \nunderstanding.\n  A year ago, after the President urged all nations to complete a ban \ntreaty ``as soon as possible,'' it became clear that the administration \nwas not willing to show the kind of leadership that was necessary to \nturn those words into reality.\n  Instead, other countries, led by Canada and hundreds of \nnongovernmental organizations, stepped into the void. In a matter of \nmonths we saw the number of nations participating in the Ottawa process \nexceed 100, including many nations that were producers and exporters \nand users of antipersonnel mines.\n  Those nations came together determined to overcome past failures \nbecause they knew about those failures. Many had suffered the effects \nof landmines because of those failures. They came together to do the \nonly thing that could solve the landmine problem--ban the types of \nlandmines that are triggered by an innocent footstep, ban them without \nexception, ban them without reservation. And they wanted the United \nStates to be part of it. When I was in Oslo I found a genuine desire to \ntry to accommodate the United States, if it could be done without \nweakening the treaty.\n  But the administration seriously underestimated the worldwide \ncommitment for a ban. For months, the White House belittled the Ottawa \nprocess. Since it wasn't their idea, they refused to take it seriously. \nAnd rather than throw the weight of the United States behind Canada to \nhelp achieve something unprecedented in history, something that would \nhave taken both courage and imagination, the administration tried to \ntalk other governments out of taking part.\n  They wasted valuable time by pursuing negotiations in the U.N. \nConference on Disarmament even when it was clear that avenue was \nblocked. They said the United States would only give up its mines if \nall nations did, knowing that, like the chemical weapons treaty, there \nis no chance of that happening for decades. And when they finally \ndecided at the 11th hour to go to Oslo, they went with demands that had \nno chance of being accepted, and little flexibility to negotiate.\n  Any of the nations in Oslo that have pledged to sign the Ottawa \ntreaty could make a stronger case to continue using these weapons than \nthe world's only superpower. Basically, the United States went to Oslo \nand said: we are the most powerful Nation on earth, but we can't give \nup our anti-personnel mines because we have better technology, but you \nless powerful nations, you should give up your mines.\n  Well, Mr. President, the Pentagon is, understandably, deeply \nreluctant to give up a weapon that has some utility--and it does--even \nif doing so would pressure others to end the suffering of innocent \npeople. Like any government department, the Pentagon's job is to \nprotect its options. It has always resisted giving up weapons, from \ncountermanding General Pershing in the 1920's at the first Geneva \nconvention when he wanted to ban poison gas, to nuclear testing in the \n1990's. If a Pentagon official is asked what he or she needs, the \nanswer is always ``more.'' More firepower might mean fewer casualties, \nso the Pentagon has resisted the pressure to give up antipersonnel \nlandmines.\n  The President is constantly faced with departments that do not want \nto cut their budget or eliminate programs. That is why he has the \nNational Security bureaucracy, to make those hard decisions. In the \ncase of weapons of mass destruction like nuclear and chemicals weapons, \nhis advisers have found ways to work closely with the Pentagon to find \ncreative solutions.\n  But when issue of landmines reached the surface a year and a half \nago, nobody in the administration was willing to aggressively challenge \nand prod the Pentagon into finding a workable solution. Without that \nprodding, the Joint Chiefs put far more effort into blocking the U.S. \nfrom joining the ban than into planning how to live with it--even \nthough there were those in the Pentagon who at least were honest enough \nto privately point out the fallacies in the assumptions underlying the \nPentagon's own arguments.\n  As recently as a few weeks ago--and the Pentagon did not serve the \nWhite House well in this--White House officials were not even aware of \nthe weaknesses in the Pentagon's doomsday predictions about the \nconsequences of removing antipersonnel mines from Korea, or even aware \nof the fact that the Pentagon was, at least internally, divided over \nsome of the same arguments they had made at the White House.\n\n[[Page S9780]]\n\n  They did not even have a thorough grasp of the treaty's provisions. \nRight up until the end, there were those in the administration who were \nunaware that the treaty effectively grants a twelve-year grace period \nfor removing existing minefields, such as in Korea. Last week, the \nSecretary of Defense wrote in the Washington Post that ``millions'' of \nlives could be lost if the U.S. signed the treaty because North Korea \nmight interpret our signing as a loss of resolve and start a war \nbecause of it. Good Lord, Mr. President. This is as bad as ``the \nRussians are coming, the Russians are coming'' scenario we heard, even \nas the Russian army was collapsing internally. Not only is that about \nthat as far-fetched as any dire Pentagon prediction I have heard yet--\nand that includes its assessment of the Red Army that was fit to \nconquer the world--it could not even conquer Chechnya--it ignores the \nconclusion of every serious Pentagon analyst that a North Korean \ninvasion would be destroyed, with or without antipersonnel landmines, \nbefore it could traverse 50 miles down narrow, pre-targeted mountain \npasses to Seoul. If antipersonnel landmines are going to determine the \nfate of South Korea, South Korea ought to surrender. But the fact is, \nSouth Korea has a far better trained, better equipped army, is better \nmotivated than North Korea, and is backed by the might of the most \npowerful Nation on earth. A North Korean invasion would be suicidal, \nand they know it and everyone knows it. A former commander of our \nforces in Korea says scattering landmines there would impede the \nmobility of our own forces, and inflict casualties on our own troops.\n  But it does not even matter, because the other countries in Oslo were \nprepared to try to accommodate U.S. concerns on Korea. Had the White \nHouse not waited until the last minute to get involved, a solution \ncould have been found. In fact, many of us told them that months ago.\n\n  Over 60 Members of the U.S. Senate, Republicans and Democrats, \nincluding every veteran of combat in the Vietnam war, have signed onto \nlegislation to ban antipersonnel landmines. In fact, Mr. President, the \nLeahy-Hagel bill would do no more than what Great Britain, Germany, \nSouth Africa, France, and a lot of other nations have already pledged \nto do, over the objections of some of their own armed forces. In fact, \nit does not go as far because it gives the President broad flexibility \non Korea, which the Pentagon has called a unique situation--``the Cold \nWar's last frontier.'' The Pentagon said they need time to take care of \nKorea. Our legislation gives them more time than they need.\n  I was encouraged by the President's statement last week that he wants \nto work with Congress. I welcome that, and I thank him for the kind \nwords he spoke about my efforts. I really do believe that he wants to \nsee a worldwide ban on landmines. I have always supported efforts to \nnegotiate an international export ban in the U.N. Conference on \nDisarmament.\n  But, Mr. President, the clock is ticking, and there should be no \nmistake. The Ottawa treaty is the only hope for achieving a \ncomprehensive worldwide ban on these weapons. There is no other treaty. \nIf the United States does not sign in December, we have to find a way \nto sign at the earliest possible time.\n  That is not going to happen as long as the Pentagon pretends that a \nweapon it called an antipersonnel landmine a few months ago, and which \nthe President pledged to ban a year ago, has suddenly, miraculously, \novernight become no longer an antipersonnel mine if it's placed near an \nantitank mine. They tried that in Oslo; they tried to change the \ndefinition. It would have invited any nation in the world to use \nantipersonnel mines--dumb, smart, just average, or any type--\nindefinitely, as long as they were in the vicinity of an antitank mine. \nIt was a terrible idea and literally a loophole big enough to fly a 747 \nthrough.\n  If the use of antipersonnel mines near antitank mines is what \nprevents the United States from signing the treaty, then solve it. We \nrun a little Rover around on Mars. If we can do that, we can solve this \nproblem. If the Pentagon had spent the past three years since the \nPresident first called for a worldwide ban really trying to solve that \nproblem rather than to keep from having to solve it, the United States \nmight have been able to show the leadership on this issue that the \nworld needs and, frankly, the world wants.\n  This is not a public relations problem to be managed. This is not \nabout trying to find some way to convince a focus group. It is not a \nquestion of valuing the lives of American soldiers more or less than \nthe lives and limbs of innocent civilians. Both soldiers and civilians \nwill benefit from a landmine ban. It is about the one nation on this \nplanet, whose power and influence and moral authority are unmatched, \nthe nation that I am proud to serve in the U.S. Senate. It is about \nthis nation seizing the best opportunity there is ever going to be to \ndeal with a problem that is needlessly plaguing so many countries.\n  Staying outside this treaty is not an option. We have to be part of \nit, if not now, then we need to do what needs to be done to become part \nof it.\n  I might note, Mr. President, that Japan, which like the U.S. also \nexpressed concerns about the treaty in Oslo, is apparently \nreconsidering its position and may sign in Ottawa after all. I wrote to \ntheir foreign minister saying I hope they do this. It would be \nextremely significant, as many Asian nations look to Japan for \nleadership.\n  President Clinton also spoke of efforts the United States is making \nto help other nations get rid of landmines, and to aid the victims. I \njoin him in that. But I remind the President and the Pentagon that each \nof these efforts was started by the Congress. They are vitally \nimportant, and I welcome the President's announcement that he wants to \nexpand them. But even expanding something like the Leahy War Victims \nFund is no substitute for putting an end to the use of these weapons.\n\n  I want the United States to show the kind of leadership that is \nexpected of the world's leading democracy, the greatest democracy \nhistory has ever known. The United States was a founder of the League \nof Nations and the United Nations. We have been a leading force in \nevery significant humanitarian law treaty and arms control treaty in \nhistory. Leadership by definition means taking risks. It means having \nthe faith and courage to seize an opportunity that comes rarely in \nhistory and rejecting the conventional wisdom, and taking a dramatic \nstep.\n  The chemical weapons treaty would not exist had it not been for the \nUnited States taking such a step. The nuclear test ban treaty would not \nexist without our leadership.\n  The United States showed its capacity for greatness with the Marshall \nPlan. We didn't say we would rebuild Europe ``except for this country \nor that country.'' We said all should benefit, including our former \nenemies. I am proud of what my country did then, and I want to see the \nsame kind of leadership now.\n  The Ottawa treaty will be signed in December. There is still time for \nthe White House to reconsider. Fourteen Nobel laureates sent a letter \nto President Clinton last week urging him to reconsider. There is still \ntime to aggressively engage the Pentagon on the technical issues that \nhave prevented the President from agreeing to sign. If we do not have a \nplan for solving them by December, then get busy and solve them. At \nleast commit to signing it at a future date. That is what the world \nneeds to hear. It is the least we can do.\n  Mr. President, the Ottawa treaty will set a moral standard for the \nnext century that even those nations who do not sign will ignore at the \nrisk of being condemned as international outlaws. It will be a tribute \nto those nations who recognize the urgency that this humanitarian \ncrisis demands. The treaty ends the 20th century, the bloodiest in \nhistory, in a way in which the world can be justly proud. It is our \ngift to the next century. The United States should be part of it.\n  I said in Oslo that my wife and I look forward, with great pleasure, \nto the birth of our first grandchild at the beginning of next year and, \nGod willing, that child will live most of his or her life in the next \ncentury. My prayer is that it will be a century where armies of \nhumanity dig up and destroy landmines and no one puts new ones down.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Nobel laureates' letter to the \nPresident be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S9781]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               September 18, 1997.\n       Dear President Clinton: We are writing to demonstrate our \n     support of the many other individuals and organizations \n     urging the United States government to sign a treaty for a \n     comprehensive ban on anti-personnel landmines along with 100 \n     other nations scheduled to meet in Ottawa this December.\n       Mr. President, we ask you to reflect on repercussions of \n     your final decision on this matter. We are aware that you \n     plan to condition your approval of the ban on the inclusion \n     of certain exceptions considered vital to U.S. security \n     interests and in the best interest of military personnel. \n     Consider for a moment the dangerous precedent that would be \n     set if the United States asks for concessions. Indecision by \n     a world superpower is sure to undermine the long effort to \n     reach this ban, only leading to further delays.\n       It is clear that every additional week of delay will leave \n     hundreds of innocent men, women, and children dead or maimed \n     due to these devices whose military value is highly \n     questionable. The recently publicized 1972 US Army report \n     vividly describes the terrible toll US anti-personnel \n     landmines have taken on its own soldiers during the Korean \n     and Vietnam conflicts.\n       We, Nobel Peace Laureates, are joining the Albert \n     Schweitzer Institute for the Humanities, named after the \n     renowned humanist and Nobel Peace laureate Dr. Albert \n     Schweitzer, and the Connecticut Coalition to Abolish \n     Landmines in the international call to ban landmines. We add \n     our collective voice to that of many other individuals, \n     organizations and governments who strongly support this ban.\n       As the leader of a major world power, it is in your hands \n     to demonstrate courageous leadership and endorse the \n     comprehensive ban on landmines.\n         Donald S.

Mr. President, I am here to outline certain changes to my \namendment that was accepted as part of the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education Appropriations Act as passed by the Senate. These \nchanges will be submitted to the House-Senate conference committee. My \namendment, No. 1122, would block grant funds from several K-12 \neducation programs in the Department of Education and send those funds \ndirectly to school districts. These changes have been incorporated into \na new draft of the amendment.\n  The genesis of the changes is a series of discussions with my \ncolleagues in the Senate and other interested parties. While these \nchanges correct minor drafting errors, they do so without changing the \noverall philosophy of the amendment. The most significant of the \nchanges exclude from the block grant entirely any funds from the Adult \nEducation, Vocational Education, and Rehabilitation Services programs, \nprograms not primarily directed at K-12 education. Other programs \nexcluded from the block grant are: Indian Education, the Inexpensive \nBook Distribution Program, Arts In Education, Star Schools Program, and \nTechnology Innovation Challenge grants.\n  Finally, the distribution of bilingual education funds is changed. \nThese funds will be sent to school districts in the same proportion as \nthe funds were distributed in fiscal year 1997, much like title I funds \nare distributed in the amendment. For example, if a school district \nwere eligible for .25 percent of all bilingual education funds in \nfiscal year 1997, it will be eligible for the same share in fiscal year \n1998.\n  Mr. President, these changes correct minor drafting errors and \nincorporate the suggestions of several supporters for minor \nimprovements. These changes, however, do not affect the amendment's \noverall philosophy, which is to restore the decisionmaking authority \nfor the education of our children to where it belongs; the hands of \nparents, teachers, principals, superintendents, and school board \nmembers. I look forward to discussing this issue further with my \ncolleagues during conference committee meetings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9781-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the lack of information pertaining to \nalcohol and substance abuse fatalities in the workplace is alarming. If \nwe are serious about the safety of American workers, we must carefully \nexamine all contributing factors that pose a potential threat while on \nthe job.\n  I had intended to offer an amendment to the Labor, HHS and Education \nAppropriations bill that would instruct the BLS to incorporate in their \nannual report an analysis of toxicology reports in the Census of Fatal \nOccupational Injuries. After meeting with the BLS Commissioner, \nKatharine Abraham, we agreed that the BLS will again perform this \nimportant analysis during the calendar year 1998 and issue a report no \nlater than 6 months after the data collection is completed. This \nagreement dismisses the need for a congressional mandate. I appreciate \nBLS's cooperation in properly addressing this matter.\n  In 1992, the Department of Labor initiated a program to compile data \non how alcohol and drugs contributed to fatal work injuries. The BLS's \nCensus of Fatal Occupational Injuries Program collected 1,355 \ntoxicology reports from 43 States and the District of Columbia--roughly \none report for every four of the 1992 fatalities. About one-sixth of \nthe cases for which toxicology reports were available, fatally injured \nworkers tested positive for toxic substances. The most frequent cases \nshowed alcohol use followed by cocaine and marijuana.\n  Unfortunately, the BLS stopped collecting this data in 1995. Although \nthis data was only reported over a 3-year span, it clearly shows that \nalcohol and substance abuse is a major contributor to fatal workplace \ninjuries. In an effort to understand the safety of American workers, we \nmust have data available to us. The inclusion of this analysis in the \nannual report sends a message that we do care about the safety of \nAmerican workers.\n  Prior to being elected to the U.S. Senate, I was an accountant for \nDunbar Well Service in Wyoming--a large, independent oil well servicing \ncompany. Aside from my accounting responsibilities, I also traveled the \nState collecting urine and saliva samples from our employees. Not only \nhave I given alcohol and substance abuse tests, but I've been tested. I \nunderstand a thing or two about validity and dignity. This analysis \ndoesn't hinder either of those traits. Safety in the workplace should \nbe everyone's concern. However, if we don't understand how our workers \nare killed on the job, then we only deceive ourselves. This analysis \nwill provide a better understanding of why and how frequently alcohol \nand drugs play a contributory role in fatal work injuries.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter sent to me \nfrom BLS Commissioner, Katharine Abraham, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Department of Labor,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: I am writing regarding the proposal to \n     require the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to gather and \n     analyze toxicology reports on workers who have been fatally \n     injured on the job.\n       Since 1991, the Bureau has conducted the Census of Fatal \n     Occupational Injuries (CFOI), which compiles a complete \n     roster of workers who are fatally injured at work each year, \n     along with details about the fatal events. In 1991 and 1992, \n     the Bureau conducted research studies in which toxicology \n     reports were collected as part of the fatality census. The \n     reports were analyzed with the help of Dr. William M. Marine, \n     Professor of Preventive Medicine and Biometrics at the \n     University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.\n       Toxicology reports were obtained from a variety of sources, \n     including medical examiner or coroner reports, police reports \n     of motor vehicle accidents, and autopsy reports. In some \n     jurisdictions, toxicology reports are not available to BLS \n     because of State confidentiality requirements. It also should \n     be noted that toxicology tests are not completed for all \n     deaths. Often tests are performed only when there is a \n     suspicion of drugs present, though the practice regarding \n     conduct of toxicology tests varies by State. In 1991, for \n     example, the share of work-related fatalities for which \n     toxicology reports were available varied from more than 50 \n     percent (in 8 of 23 States for which reports were provided) \n     to less than 10 percent (in 10 of the 23 States).\n       For 1991, 23 of 31 States that participated in the fatality \n     census provided toxicology reports. Toxicology reports were \n     available for 28% (829) of the 2,968 work-related fatalities \n     in the 23 States. For 1992, 43 States and the District of \n     Columbia submitted toxicology reports. Reports were received \n     for 1,355 deaths representing 25% of the total work-related \n     fatalities in these States.\n       Positive toxicology results were found for 125 of 829 cases \n     for which reports were available for 1991. Alcohol was \n     present in 49% of the 125 cases; amphetamines were present in \n     12%; marijuana in 12%; and cocaine in 10%. For 1992, positive \n     toxicology results were found for 214 deaths out of 1,355 for \n     which reports were received. Alcohol was present in 52% of \n     the 214 cases; cocaine in 17%; marijuana in 13%; and \n     antidepressants, amphetamines, barbiturates, morphine, \n     codeine, methadone or other substances in 17%. These figures \n     exclude cases in which there were toxicological findings that \n     could have been due to the life-saving efforts of hospitals \n     or others. A positive toxicological finding nonetheless does \n     not establish the extent to which alcohol or drugs \n     contributed to the fatality.\n       I would be happy to meet with you or your staff to discuss \n     the toxicological studies the Bureau has conducted and their \n     findings. If you feel, based on that discussion, that it \n     would be valuable to repeat this type of study, the Bureau \n     will gather and analyze toxicology reports on workers who \n     have been fatally injured on the job during calendar year \n     1998, and will issue a report no later than six months after \n     the data collection is completed.\n       I hope you find this information useful. Please let me know \n     if we can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                             Katharine G. Abraham,\n     Commissioner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9782-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9782-S9783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REGARDING PRODUCT LIABILITY REFORM\n\n  Mr. ENZI. President, I rise to briefly discuss S. 648, a bill to \nestablish standards and procedures for products liability legislation. \nI am proud to be a cosponsor of that bill and I feel that it should be \na legislative priority for consideration during this session of the \n105th Congress.\n  In the 104th Congress, both the House and Senate passed meaningful \nproduct liability reform legislation only to have it vetoed by \nPresident Clinton. The President now indicates that he wants to sign a \nproducts liability reform bill. Legal reform has the broad support of \nthe American people and strong bipartisan support in Congress.\n  With each passing day, we are losing an opportunity to do the \npeople's business by not enacting common sense legal reform. S. 648 is \ndesigned to inject some common sense into runaway punitive damage \nawards in view of the need for some semblance of uniformity in our \nNational interstate commerce system.\n  Last May, the United States Supreme Court held in BMW in North \nAmerica v. Gore, that punitive damages can be considered so excessive \nas to violate a defendant's constitutional due process rights. It seems \nthat many courts have not heeded this lesson. Just a few weeks ago, \nanother case received national attention for the enormity of its \npunitive damage award. A jury in a Louisiana State court levied a $2.5 \nbillion punitive damage award against CSX Transportation corporation \nand $1 billion against the other defendants in the case for their \ninvolvement in a 1987 tank car fire. The court\n\n[[Page S9783]]\n\nawarded this enormous punitive judgment despite findings by the \nNational Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that CSXT did not cause the \naccident and that no serious injuries resulted from the accident.\n  In light of these egregious examples, it is time for Congress to pass \nlegislation to reign in these exploding legal costs which have hurt \nAmerican businesses, stifled ingenuity, and punished consumers through \nhigher prices and decreased competition. S. 648 would mark an important \nfirst step in reforming a tort system which all too often better \nresembles a lottery than a forum of justice. I urge our leadership to \nmake S. 648 a priority in the first session of the 105th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9782-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 1997, \nthe Secretary of the Senate on September 22, 1997, received a message \nfrom the President of the United States submitting a nomination which \nwas referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  The nomination received on September 22, 1997, is shown in today's \nRecord at the end of the Senate proceedings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9783-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-2996.

A bill providing relief for Sergio Lozano, Fauricio Lozano, \nand Ana Lozano; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       PRIVATE RELIEF LEGISLATION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that \nprovides permanent resident status to three children, Sergio, 17 years \nold; Fauricio 15 years old; and Ana Lozano, 14 years old; who were \ngranted immigrant visas to come to the United States with their mother \nearlier this year. Now they have lost their mother\n\n[[Page S9786]]\n\nand could be deported because they were recently orphaned.\n  The children have lived with their mother, Ana Ruth Lozano, until her \ndeath in February of this year due to complications from typhoid fever. \nSince their mother's death, the children have been living with their \nclosest relative, their U.S.-citizen grandmother who lives in Los \nAngeles.\n  Without their mother, the children do not have the legal right to \nremain in the United States. The Lozano children can be deported \nbecause the immigration law prohibits permanent legal residency to \nminor children without their parents.\n  Without their mother, these children can be deported by the INS \ndespite the fact the children have no family who will take care of them \nin El Salvador except their estranged father who, INS reports show, was \nabusive to the mother and the children.\n  Without this bill, the children will most likely be sent to an \norphanage in El Salvador. Here in the United States, the childern have \ntheir U.S.-citizen grandmother and uncles who will give them a loving \nhome.\n  I have previously sought administrative relief for the Lozano \nchildren by asking the INS district office in Los Angeles and \nCommissioner Meissner if any humanitarian exemptions could be made in \ntheir case. INS has told my staff that there is nothing further they \ncan do administratively and a private relief bill may be the only way \nto protect the children from deportation.\n  I hope you will support this bill so that we can help the Lozano \nchildren begin to rebuild their lives in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the attached news \narticle and the bill be entered into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1202\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), \n     Sergio Lozano, Fauricio Lozano and Ana Lozano, shall be held \n     and considered to have been lawfully admitted to the United \n     States for permanent residence as of the date of the \n     enactment of this Act upon payment of the required visa fees.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 29, 1997]\n\n              Youth's Visas in Doubt After Mother's Death\n\n                       (By Patrick J. McDonnell)\n\n       Three El Salvadoran teenagers who were granted U.S. \n     government permission to move to Los Angeles with their \n     mother earlier this year now face deportation because their \n     mother's death has left them without a legal right to be in \n     the United States.\n       Ana Ruth Lozano a single mother who worked in a garment \n     factory in El Salvador, had long dreamed that she and her \n     children would be able to join relatives in Los Angeles, a \n     glittering place with promise beyond the postwar tumult of \n     Central America.\n       She died in El Salvador in February at the age of 33, \n     apparently of complications from typhoid fever, three weeks \n     after her family received visas to emigrate to the United \n     States following an eight-year wait.\n       Ironically, relatives say; Lozano took ill on the day she \n     was informed by officials in the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador \n     that authorities were approving the family's long-delayed \n     application.\n       ``My mother always said we'd go to the United States and \n     have a real chance to succeed,'' said Sergio Lozano, 17, who \n     finally arrived here last month with his siblings, Fauricio, \n     15, and Ana, 14.\n       With the shock of her unexpected death still raw, the \n     family is facing another blow: The Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service says that Lozano's death means that \n     her children must go back to El Salvador. Because she was the \n     primary visa beneficiary, the INS says, the law calls for the \n     papers of her children--the ``derivative beneficiaries''--to \n     be revoked upon her death.\n       The incredulous Lozano family has fallen into one of the \n     many cracks in U.S. immigration law. Their case stands out \n     even amid the often dramatic consequences in a legal arena \n     replete with tales of separated families.\n       ``It's just not fair to send these children back now.'' \n     Zoila Esperanza Lozano, 54, the children's maternal \n     grandmother, said as she fought back tears during an \n     interview at her Los Angeles apartment, where a photograph of \n     her late daughter and a Mother's Day poem from her are \n     displayed prominently.\n       Rosemary Melville, INS deputy district director in Los \n     Angeles, declined to discuss the Lozano case specifically, \n     citing privacy laws. But she confirmed that visas for family \n     members are considered ``null and void'' if the principal \n     beneficiary dies before the visa is used. In ``compelling'' \n     cases, Melville added, the agency has discretion to grant \n     residency or block deportation based on humanitarian \n     concerns.\n       In another era, legal observers say, authorities may have \n     been inclined to stretch the letter of the law or issue a \n     waiver allowing the Lozano children to stay. But such \n     exceptions are more problematic amid today's national climate \n     generally hostile to immigration.\n       ``The unfortunate track record of immigration law is if you \n     make one exception you find it spinning out of control,'' \n     said Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration \n     Reform, a group that seeks to reduce immigration levels and \n     assails ``loopholes'' in the law.\n       Relatives of the Lozano children say they were assured by \n     officials at the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador that the \n     children's visas were still good, despite the mother's death. \n     They learned otherwise upon the youths' arrival at Los \n     Angeles International Airport last month, when, according to \n     the family, the three youngsters were held and questioned for \n     six hours and faced being sent back to El Salvador on the \n     spot--an expedited ``removal'' procedure that has been in the \n     INS arsenal since April 1, when a tough new immigration law \n     went into effect.\n       Finally, inspectors agreed to allow the three into the \n     country conditionally, pending the outcome of an agency \n     review. The three teenagers have another date with the INS in \n     Los Angeles on June 25.\n       The Lozano family has mobilized to do whatever necessary to \n     keep the children in Los Angeles. The three, now enrolled at \n     Belmont High School, are staying in their grandmother's one-\n     bedroom Westlake apartment.\n       ``For me, the children are a blessing from my beautiful \n     daughter, and I'll do whatever I can for them,'' their \n     grandmother said.\n       Tough of modest means, relatives here say they are willing \n     to sign legally binding accords to care for the three and \n     ensure that they do not become public charges.\n       Francisco Lozano, Ana Ruth's younger brother, is \n     spearheading a letter-writing campaign to officials in \n     Congress and elsewhere. ``If I have to go and see President \n     Clinton, I will,'' said Lozano, a hotel pastry chef.\n       In El Salvador, the family says, the three children have \n     nothing to go back to: no home, no close kin, no means of \n     support. Ana Ruth Lozano had been estranged from the \n     children's father for years, relatives say. Most close \n     relatives on their mother's side of the family are in the \n     United States and Canada, as are many other Salvadorans, who \n     left their homeland during the civil war that engulfed it in \n     the 1980s.\n       The children's grandmother has supported them in El \n     Salvador for years, sending back monthly checks of up to \n     $300, almost half her pay as a live-in housekeeper.\n       Seated in their grandmother's home on a recent afternoon, \n     all three Lozano youths spoke of their desire to remain in \n     the United States, study, and embark upon careers: Sergio \n     wants to be a graphic artist, Fauricio would like to be an \n     airline pilot, and Ana hopes to become a lawyer.\n       ``I don't think I'd have any chance to even dream about \n     such a thing back home,'' said Fauricio.\n       ``Here one has the chance to better oneself,'' said the \n     slender, reserved Ana. ``This place is what our mother always \n     wanted for us.''\n  By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Dodd and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 1203. A bill to amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to limit \nconsumer liability for the unauthorized use of a debit card, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n             the debit card consumer protection act of 1997\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will \nprotect tens of millions of consumers who carry bank debit cards, as \nwell as millions more who are being targeted by banks to use this \nrelatively new and unfamiliar payment card. This bill extends to the \nusers of debit cards the protections that now already apply to users of \ncredit cards. And I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators \nBennett, Dodd, and Bryan, for cosponsoring this important legislation.\n  In the past few years, millions of Americans have opened envelopes \nfrom their banks to find these new payment cards. These cards look like \ncredit cards. They have ``VISA'' or ``MasterCard'' logos on the front \nof them--I am holding one up now--but they are actually debit cards, \nor, in the language of the industry, they are ``off-line'' debit cards. \nThey are called ``off-line'' cards because they can be used with just a \nsignature, and no PIN No., in order to access the consumer's bank \naccount directly.\n  These off-line cards combine the convenience of a credit card with \nthe simplicity of an ATM card. In order to make a purchase, the \nconsumer simply presents the debit card to a merchant and signs a sales \nslip. The money for the payment is then automatically\n\n[[Page S9787]]\n\nwithdrawn from the consumer's bank account and transferred to the \nmerchant.\n  But if an off-line card is lost or stolen, it poses a little known \nand potentially unlimited danger to the consumer. Because it needs only \na signature to authorize a purchase, a criminal who finds the card or \nwho steals the card can easily use it to make purchases. He can go on a \nwild shopping spree and buy thousands of dollars worth of goods on that \nstolen card.\n  But unlike a stolen credit card, these fraudulent charges are \nimmediately deducted from the victim's bank account. And unlike a \nstolen credit card, the law provides virtually no limit to the victim's \nliability.\n  And what happens to the consumer whose bank account is cleaned out by \nfraud? Soon her checks begin bouncing, bills go unpaid, late charges \nand overdraft fees pile up, suddenly the victim is facing financial \ndisaster. Unraveling this mess can mean weeks of letters and phone \ncalls, and nobody will compensate the victim for the lasting damage to \nhis or her name or reputation.\n  Furthermore, the victim will be literally penniless until the bank \ninvestigates the theft and, hopefully, restores the account.\n  Under current law, the bank could take up to 20 days to complete this \ninvestigation. Imagine losing one's entire bank balance and then being \nunable to write a check for rent, car payment or groceries for 20 days.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that consumers do not understand the \noff-line debit card. They may think it is just like an ordinary ATM \ncard. But without the protection of a secret PIN number, the card is \nnot secure. In reality, it is a direct line of access to the consumer's \nbank account. That line of access is open to anyone who possesses the \ncard, including a thief. Just the number on the face of the card is all \nthe thief needs to totally drain the consumer's bank account.\n  Financial institutions have sent out tens of millions of these cards \nunsolicited in the last few years. By 1994, there were 25 million off-\nline cards in circulation. By 1996, the number had jumped to more than \n60 million. Millions more will be mailed out this year, because \nalthough banks cannot legally mail out an unsolicited credit card, a \nloophole in the law allows them to mail out these unsolicited off-line \ndebit cards as replacements for consumer's ATM cards.\n  Mr. President, this is a ticking time bomb for millions of unwary \nconsumers. Does the consumer understand how this new card differs from \nan ordinary ATM card? Does the consumer understand the risk that comes \nfrom carrying the new off-line card? Too often the answer is no. A \nrecent survey by Mastercard found that 59 percent of the consumers who \ncarry debit cards do not realize just how important it is to report a \nlost or stolen card immediately. At a minimum, consumers need to be \nwarned before they start carrying these off-line cards, and they need \nprotection in the event that anything goes wrong.\n  Mr. President, we need reform and we need it soon. The bill we have \nintroduced today, the Debit Card Consumer Protection Act of 1997, \nprovides a level of protection that is clearly needed.\n  First, it prohibits the banks from mailing out unsolicited debit \ncards. Only people who want these cards should be getting them in the \nmail.\n  Second, it requires a clear disclosure to the consumer that the card \nprovides a direct line of access to the consumer's bank account.\n  Third, it prohibits the bank from sending out live debit cards. Cards \nmust not be valid for use until the recipient identifies himself or \nherself as the rightful owner.\n  Fourth, it limits the consumer's liability to $50 in the event the \ncard is lost or stolen.\n  Fifth, it expedites the restoration of funds to the consumer's \naccount within 5 business days. Current law can make the consumer wait \n20 business days.\n  Mr. President, this bill would bring the consumer protection laws up \nto date and into line with what the consumer is entitled to and \nexpects. That is why consumer groups strongly support this bill, \nincluding the Consumer Federation of America, the Consumers Union, and \nthe U.S. Public Interest Research Group. These organizations have all \ngone on record to say that this legislation provides essential \nprotection for users of debit cards.\n  Now, Mr. President, some of the provisions of this bill were recently \nput forth in another bill, S. 1154, by my colleague, Senator Reed of \nRhode Island, who I see is on the floor. And some of these measures are \nnow being implemented voluntarily by the industry. I want to commend \nSenator Reed for his work in this area. I think that a consensus exists \nthat consumer protections are needed to improve a situation that \npresents a very real risk for millions of consumers.\n  In fact, MasterCard and VISA recently announced that they will \nvoluntarily cap the consumer's liability at $50 in the event of an \nunauthorized use. One bank, Bank of America, has announced it will not \nhold consumers liable for any unauthorized charges. I commend the \nindustry for responding to these concerns. Because of this \nresponsiveness, I am hopeful the industry will vigorously support \nlegislation to make these essential consumer protection laws permanent \nand universal.\n  Finally, I thank Senators Bennett, Dodd, and Bryan for cosponsoring \nthis bill. Senator Bennett, as chairman of the Banking Subcommittee on \nFinancial Services and Technology, is very aware of the enormous impact \nfinancial fraud is having on the industry and consumers. This \nlegislation will help to protect both the industry and consumers from \nhaving to pay these high costs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1203\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Thank you, Mr. President. I am pleased to take the floor \ntoday in support of the Consumer Payment Card Security Act of 1997. \nThis legislation, of which I am an original cosponsor, would address a \nserious gap in our consumer laws which govern the use of debit or check \ncards. I would particularly like to thank my friend and Chairman of the \nBanking Committee, Senator D'Amato, for his leadership role in \ndeveloping this legislation.\n  Many of my colleagues may be aware of these cards through the \nintensive ad campaign mounted by VISA and MasterCard with such famous \ncelebrities as Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, and our former colleague, \nBob Dole. But these commercials may not exactly explain how these check \ncards--or debit cards--work. Essentially, a debit card is a card that \nlooks just like your ATM card that uses the National Credit Card \nElectronic Networks to access your checking account. In this way, you \ncould go into any business that accepts VISA or MasterCard, and instead \nof charging your purchase, you could pay for it right out of your \nchecking account. Thus, bank customers have access to their accounts in \nhundreds of thousands of locations across the globe, not just at the \nATM machines that are part of their banks' network.\n  In general, I believe that the private sector should be commended for \ndeveloping this new technology. Clearly, if used properly, these debit \ncards will provide bank customers with greater flexibility and \nconvenience.\n  However, we would not be standing on the floor today introducing \nlegislation if the introduction of this card had gone as smoothly as \neveryone may have hoped. As with all new technologies, there are \ngrowing pains, and in this particular case, legislation appears \nnecessary to help ease those pains.\n  The goal of this legislation is refreshingly simple: It puts debit \ncards under the same umbrella of consumer protections that currently \ngovern the use of both credit cards and ATM cards.\n  Let me briefly recount some of the debit card problems--some might go \nso far as to say abuses--confronted by consumers and how the \nlegislation would address them.\n  First, since a debit cards looks almost identical to an ATM card, \nmany consumers don't know that their bank has made a switch. Until very \nrecently, this could have posed a significant financial hardship for \nconsumers since debit card liability--if it's lost or stolen--isn't \ncapped at $50 the way it is capped for both credit cards and ATM cards. \nAlso, debit cards are known as ``off-line'' cards; in other words, no \nPIN--personal identification number--is required to use the card--a \ncrook can simply swipe it through any electronic scanner, just like a \ncredit card, and empty your bank account.\n  It should be noted that in the last few weeks, the industry--\nparticularly VISA and MasterCard, responding to increasing public \npressure, has volunatrily moved to change these practices. \nNevertheless, these belated efforts, while laudable, do not provide the \nsame certainty to consumers that the statutes do. This legislation \nwould clearly limit consumer liability to $50, It would also ensure \nthat consumer disclosure is improved so that the bank customer is aware \nthat these cards do not need a PIN to be used.\n  The legislation would also end the practice of replacing ATM cards \nwith debit cards without a customer's consent. One of the ways in which \nthese cards become subject to abuse is that consumers aren't aware that \nthey've even received this debit card as a replacement for their old \nATM card. The legislation would conform debit cards with credit cards \nby preventing the mailing of unsolicited cards to bank customers.\n  Last, the bill would address a potential problem by shortening the \ndispute resolution process from 20 to 5 days, again conforming it to \nthe standards currently in use for credit cards. When there is credit \ncard fraud, the cardholder is credited for the loss until the \ninvestigation is complete, and that investigation must be done within 5 \ndays. Under current law, debit cardholders are not always credited \npending investigation and those investigations can take as long as 20 \ndays. That's a long time for someone whose checking account has been \nemptied by a criminal.\n  Again, Mr. President, I note that in most instances, the legislation \ncodifies what has become the industry standard. But the fact remains \nthat given the difficulties surrounding the introduction of debit \ncards, and the uncertainties that arise from some companies failing to \nfollow the industry standard, it is incumbent upon the Congress to \nprovide the same statutory safeguards for debit card users as we\n\n[[Page S9789]]\n\nhave for both credit card and ATM card users.\n  I hope that I will soon be able to stand here and mark the passage of \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \n        Craig, Mr. Mack, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Burns, Mr. Hatch, \n        Mr. Enzi, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 1204.

Mr. President, I am introducing today, with Senators \nLandrieu and Dorgan, the Property Owners Access to Justice Act of 1997, \na bill to simplify access to the Federal courts for private property \nowners whose rights may have been injured by government action. The \nfifth amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides individuals with \nprotection from having their property taken by the Government. The \nConstitution requires that when private property is taken for a public \npurpose, the property owner must be compensated.\n  However, property owners seeking protection of their rights are \nfrequently frustrated by endless bureaucratic delay and countless \nprocedural hurdles that prevent them from having their day in court. \nThey are told they must resolve all of their State court remedies and \nall of their administrative remedies before their case is ripe for a \nhearing in Federal court.\n  Unfortunately, most property owners cannot afford the long and often \nfruitless process of resolving all possible remedies before their case \nis ripe. This process can mean years of court battles and tens of \nthousands of dollars in legal fees just to win the right to have the \nmerits of the case heard in Federal court. The hurdles are so \noppressive that one study concluded less than 6 percent of takings \nclaims filed during the 1980's were ever deemed ripe for Federal court \nadjudication.\n  This unfair result happens because the requirement to exhaust all \nadministrative remedies before getting their day in court subjects \nproperty owners to endless rounds of appeals with the relevant agency. \nHowever, property owners should be able to know with some degree of \ncertainty what rights they have in their own property. The Property \nOwners Access to Justice Act says that property owners must try to \nresolve their differences with the agency in question, but once the \nagency has denied their appeal or waiver attempt, the property owner \nhas the right to go to court.\n  The property owner would still shoulder the burden of proof that he \nor she has been injured and deserves compensation, but at least the \nowner will be able to have the merits of the case heard. And there is \nan end to the process, instead of leaving the property owner in the \nregulatory limbo of appealing and appealing and appealing before \ngetting the right to seek relief in court.\n  To deal with the problem of resolving all State court remedies, this \nbill essentially gives property owners a choice of how to assert their \nproperty rights under the Constitution. If the property owner wants to \npursue action against a local or State agency that has infringed on his \nor her rights, the property owner can sue in State or local court, as \nhe would now. Or, if the property owner wants to reject that route and \ninstead pursue only a fifth amendment takings claim, the case can be \nheard in Federal court.\n  This will correct the current situation in which a property owner can \nbe bounced between State and Federal courts for years, with the merits \nof their Federal claim never being heard.\n  The Property Owners Access to Justice Act of 1997 is strictly \nprocedural in nature. It does not change substantive law. It does not \ndefine a taking or establish a trigger for when compensation is due. It \ndoes not give property owners any special access to the Federal courts. \nOn the contrary, it allows property owners the same access to Federal \ncourts that other claimants currently have. Citizens alleging \nviolations of their first amendment rights or fourth amendment rights \nare not told to resolve their administrative and State court remedies \nfirst--they go to Federal court. Property owners deserve to be treated \nthe same as everyone else.\n  Mr. President, this bipartisan bill is simply an effort to provide \nproperty owners with a less complicated way to have their day in court. \nIt gives them the access to justice and the chance to present the \nmerits of their case that all Americans expect as a matter of simple \nfairness.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the \nProperty Owners Access to Justice Act of 1997 and ask unanimous consent \nthat the full text of the bill be entered in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1204\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall apply to actions \n     commenced on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Coverdell, in introducing the Property Owners Access \nto Justice Act of 1997.\n  Mr. President, in my view, this bill is particularly aptly named. \nJustice and fairness are what this bill is all about. Unlike other \ncountries, when this Nation was created, we did so with a contract \nbetween the people and the Government. It is not very long, but the \nfreedoms it guarantees are quite profound. Among its provisions is a \nsimple promise from the Government to the people. Private property \nshall not be taken for public use without just compensation. These very \nfew words included in our Constitution provide one of the strongest \ndefenses we have against arbitrary government. The certainty that our \nproperty cannot be expropriated by government without our being \ncompensated, provides the essential infrastructure for America's great \neconomic strength. We could never be the world's largest market without \nsuch an assurance.\n  However, for often well-intentioned reasons, all levels of government \nhave made claims on private property which conflict with the \nprotections of the fifth amendment. Whether through zoning, \nenvironmental protections, or claims of eminent domain, people have \nfound their property rights under increasing assault. Unfortunately, \nnot only are their rights under assault, but then they have inadequate \nprotection in our legal system.\n  We should not be confused as to whom this bill helps. Large \ncorporations and wealthy landowners and developers do not need our help \nin Congress. They can hire a legion of lawyers and lobbyists to take up \ntheir case at city hall, at the statehouse, or even here in Washington. \nWhether this bill passes or not, their interests will be protected. The \npeople we help with this bill are the small landowners and family \nfarmers who lack the means to expedite the administrative process. It \nwill help first-time home buyers in my State, who are trying to build \ntheir first home but have to put their plans on hold because they run \ninto administrative deadlocks.\n  Our bill will help these people and countless others in two ways. \nFirst, it will clarify when a person has exhausted their administrative \nremedies. Right now, property owners spend countless hours and great \nexpense in fruitless litigation over this subject. Legislation to end \nthis unproductive debate should be welcomed by all parties.\n  Second, the bill would allow property owners to choose between \nbringing their claim for relief before Federal or State courts. As it \nstands, we all possess a fifth amendment right which we have no \npractical way of enforcing. The Supreme Court has interpreted the fifth \namendment as applying to the States under the due process clause of the \nfourteenth amendment. However, the Federal courts have left it to State \ncourts to adjudicate fifth amendment claims in this area. Only if \nissues of State law are resolved in the case, may plaintiffs have their \nconstitutional claim heard in Federal court. Working people simply \ncannot afford a process that would require them to go all the way \nthrough the State court system and then into the federal courts to \nenforce their constitutional rights.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that our colleagues will join this \nbipartisan effort and take a concrete step to provide real relief to \nmiddle class people. We will all benefit by a judicial process that is \nmore equitable and transparent.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 1205. A bill to amend the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 to clarify that records of arrival or \ndeparture are not required to be collected for purposes of the \nautomated entry-exit control system developed under section 110 of such \nact for Canadians who are not otherwise required to possess a visa, \npassport, or border crossing identification card; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n       THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ACT CANADIAN EXEMPTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \namend a controversial provision in last year's illegal immigration \nlegislation that threatens to stifle legal travel and commerce between \nthe United States and Canada.\n  Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration Reform Act requires the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service to develop an automated entry \nand exit system for the purpose of documenting the entry and departure \nof every alien entering and leaving the United States. The legislation \nI am introducing today, will amend the illegal immigration legislation \nto clarify that records of entry and departure are not required for \nCanadians. This is consistent with long-standing U.S. policy toward \nCanadian citizens traveling to the United States.\n  My constituents are extremely concerned about the onerous \nimplications of section 110. As a frequent visitor to Bellingham and \nWhatcom County, I hear again and again from the local community about \nthe importance of unimpeded travel between the United States and \nCanada. I've visited the border crossings at Blaine, WA. At certain \ntimes, travel between the United States and Canada is already subject \nto lengthy delays and traffic back-ups that sometimes exceed 1 mile in \nlength. Section 110 will further complicate border crossings if it is \never instituted on our northern border.\n  I have been a long proponent of strengthening and promoting the \npartnership between Washington State and British Columbia, Canada. \nBritish Columbia is a billion dollar neighbor for my State, generating \njobs and economic activity important to all of Washington. Canadian \ntourism and commerce is particularly important to Bellingham and \nnorthwest Washington where border trade thrives to the benefit of both \nAmericans and Canadians.\n  This legislative initiative follows up on a late 1996 letter I sent \nto Attorney General Janet Reno inquiring about section 110. The letter \nexpressed my strong opposition to a border fee or other interpretation \nof section 110 which would inhibit legal tourism and trade between the \nUnited States and Canada. I continue to vigorously oppose nuisance \nmeasures that will unduly delay legal border crossings. A border tax is \nthe most obvious nuisance measure, however, section 110 if fully \nimplemented will have a potentially disastrous impact on communities in \nmy state.\n  I do not expect section 110 to ever be applied to Canadians. To do \nso, would be a phenomenal waste of limited resources. We can't neglect \nour northern Border, but we can certainly be a lot smarter. Exempting \nCanadians from section 110 is the smart thing, the right thing to do.\n  I encourage my colleagues to review this important legislation and to \njoin me in supporting the passage of this legislative exemption at the \nearliest opportunity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Allard, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Grassley):\n\n[[Page S9791]]\n\n  S. 1206. A bill to provide for an enumeration of family caregivers as \npart of the 2000 decennial census of population; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                   THE FAMILY CAREGIVERS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhighlight the millions of family caregivers across this country, by \ncalling on the Census Bureau to count family caregivers in the Census \n2000. This bill is a companion to House legislation introduced by \nRepresentative Canady. I would like to thank Senators Jeffords, \nMikulski, Allard, Harkin, and Grassley for joining me in support of \nfamily caregivers by cosponsoring this bill.\n  As the population of this country ages, more and more Americans have \nand will assume the role of family caregivers--people who provide \nnoncompensated care for an elderly or disabled family member in their \nown home. Today, nearly 80 percent of elderly people needing long-term \ncare services are estimated to reside outside the nursing home setting, \nand many nonelderly people are cared for by a family member as well. In \nfact, family caregivers provide two-thirds of all home care services in \nthis country.\n  The decision to care for a loved one who is ill or incapacitated on a \nfull-time basis requires significant personal sacrifice on the \ncaregiver's part. Yet the compassionate services provided by family \ncaregivers to those who are unable to care for themselves is \ninvaluable. Without the contributions of caregivers, immense pressure \nwould be brought to bear on our nursing home and health care systems. \nUnfortunately, caregivers and their contributions to the Nation's \npublic health system have historically gone unrecognized.\n  While the issue of family caregivers has obvious policy implications, \nadequate statistical and survey information is not available to help \npolicymakers address issues concerning these individuals. That is why I \nam introducing legislation to request that family caregivers be counted \nby the Census Bureau in the Census 2000. By counting caregivers in the \ncensus, we will be able to collect more information about this rapidly-\ngrowing group and form policy solutions that will take into account \ntheir special needs.\n  In her book, ``Helping Yourself Help Others,'' former First Lady \nRosalynn Carter reminds us that there are only four kinds of people in \nthe world: those who have been caregivers, those who are caregivers, \nthose who will be caregivers, and those who will need caregivers. I \nurge my colleagues to support this important legislation and to draw \nattention to the needs of family caregivers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Daschle, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Conrad, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Reed, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1207. A bill to authorize the President to award a Congressional \nGold Medal to the family of the late Raul Julia, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                  congressional gold medal legislation\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nauthorizing the President of the United States to award a Congressional \nGold Medal in honor of the late Raul Julia, a remarkable person who \ntouched the lives of millions.\n  Raul Julia is known to most people as a talented actor who performed \nin movies and on stage. He excelled in such films as ``The Kiss of the \nSpider Woman,'' ``Presumed Innocent,'' and ``The Eyes of Laura Mars.'' \nIn his greater love, the theater, he starred in several productions, \nincluding the New York Shakespeare Festival's ``Macbeth,'' ``Othello,'' \nand ``The Taming of the Shrew.'' His brilliant career earned him four \nTony Award nominations and a countless number of accolades.\n  However, Raul Julia was more than just a remarkable actor and \nentertainer--through his work, he was able to conquer stereotypes \nunfairly attached to Latin actors and performers. It is clear that the \nLatino community still suffers discrimination in the entertainment \nfield. Too many times, we see Latinos cast as gang members, drug \ndealers, and other negative characters.\n  With his dignified presence and undeniable talent, Raul Julia was \nable to overcome these stereotypes. He became a role model for Latinos \ntrying to break into the entertainment industry, and today is still an \ninspiration to Latino and non-Latino alike.\n  Raul Julia was also a dedicated activist and humanitarian. He was \nespecially concerned with worldwide hunger, in part because of his \nupbringing in Puerto Rico. In honor of his lifetime of unselfish \ngiving, this legislation will divide profits from the sale of duplicate \nmedals equally between the Raul Julia Hunger Fund and the National \nHispanic Foundation for the Arts.\n  A Congressional Gold Modal is a fitting tribute to the life and work \nof Raul Julia. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed at \nthis point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1207\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Raul Julia was an accomplished, talented performer, \n     entertaining millions through his work in film and theater;\n       (2) Raul Julia was a leader in the entertainment industry, \n     particularly as a tireless mentor and role model to emerging \n     Latino actors;\n       (3) a dedicated activist and humanitarian, Raul Julia was a \n     major supporter and spokesperson for the Hunger Fund, a \n     nonprofit organization committed to the eradication of world \n     hunger; and\n       (4) Raul Julia received the Hispanic Heritage Award \n     recognizing his many career achievements for the Latino \n     community, including his involvement in ``La Familia'', a New \n     York City outreach program for Latino families in need, the \n     Puerto Rican traveling theater, the Museo del Barrio, and the \n     New York Shakespeare Festival.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The President is authorized \n     to present, on behalf of the Congress, to the family of the \n     late Raul Julia a gold medal of appropriate design, in \n     recognition of his dedication to ending world hunger and his \n     great contributions to the Latino community and to the \n     performing arts.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall strike a gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and \n     inscriptions to be determined by the Secretary.\n       (c) Gifts and Donations.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary may accept, use, and \n     disburse gifts or donations of property or money to carry out \n     this section.\n       (2) Appropriation authorized.--No amount is authorized to \n     be appropriated to carry out this section.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of \n     the gold medal struck pursuant to section 2 under such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price \n     sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor, \n     materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and \n     the cost of the gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATUS OF MEDALS.\n\n       The medals struck pursuant to this Act are--\n       (1) national medals, for purposes of chapter 51 of title \n     31, United States Code; and\n       (2) numismatic items, for purposes of section 5134 of title \n     31, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 5. TRANSFER OF ANY PROFIT TO LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.\n\n       The Secretary shall transfer in equal amounts from the \n     Numismatic Public Enterprise Fund an amount equal to the \n     amount by which the sum of any gifts and donations received \n     by the Secretary in accordance with section 2(c)(1) and any \n     proceeds from the sale of duplicate medals pursuant to \n     section 3 exceeds the total amount of the costs incurred by \n     the Secretary in carrying out this Act to--\n       (1) the Raul Julia Ending Hunger Fund; and\n       (2) the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1208. A bill to protect women's reproductive health and \nconstitutional right to choice, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n         the family planning and choice protection act of 1997\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I come today to the Senate floor to \nintroduce the Family Planning and Choice Protection Act of 1997, a \ncomprehensive pro-choice, pro-family planning, and pro-women's health \nbill. The bill is cosponsored in the Senate by Senator\n\n[[Page S9792]]\n\nMurray, and the companion bill was introduced by Representative Nita \nLowey.\n  This bill has three purposes: to improve family planning programs and \nservices; to strengthen women's right to choose; and to increase \nresearch on women's health.\n  In the past months and years, Congress has curbed women's \nreproductive rights again and again. We've seen it in the \nappropriations process, as women in the military and military \ndependents are prevented from using their own funds to obtain an \nabortion at military facilities. Similarly, the District of Columbia \nhas been prevented from using local funds to provide abortion services. \nThese are just two examples. Bit by bit, anti-choice legislators are \nchipping away at women's fundamental right to choose.\n  Even family planning programs and services have been under attack. In \nJune, the House of Representatives voted to cut off funding for family \nplanning to overseas organizations unless they comply with certain \nrestrictions. These restrictions amount to a global gag rule, \nprohibiting these organizations from using even non-Federal funds to \nprovide abortion services or advocate to change abortion laws or \npolicies abroad.\n  The Family Planning and Choice Protection Act of 1997 addresses these \nattacks. It is a positive statement of what freedom of choice really \nmeans. The bill has three parts--family planning, choice protection, \nand health.\n  The family planning part does four things. First, it authorizes \nadditional funds for family planning services. Second, it bans gag \nrules, which have restricted the information health providers can give \nand women can receive about reproductive health services. Third, it \nrequires all health plans to cover contraceptive services and drugs if \nthey cover other prescription drugs. Fourth, it promotes understanding \nof emergency contraceptives, which can be used after intercourse to \nprevent pregnancy.\n  The part on choice protection has four elements. First and foremost, \nit takes the basic principles of Roe versus Wade and makes them Federal \nlaw. Second, it repeals the many restrictions that Congress has placed \non funding of abortions, including services for poor women, women in \nthe military, women in the District of Columbia, and Federal employees. \nThird, it calls for additional Federal resources to ensure that women \nand health care providers have safe access to reproductive health \nclinics, and protection against violence at these clinics. Fourth, it \ndirects the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that the \napproval of RU-486 is based on health considerations only--not \npolitical decisions.\n  The third part of the bill focuses on women's health. First, it \nsupports funding for preventive health measures in all 50 States, such \nas screening for breast and cervical cancer and chlamydia. Second, it \ncalls for funding for more research on contraception and infertility.\n  The American people overwhelmingly support a woman's right to choose, \nfamily planning, and women's health research. Yet there are those in \nthis Congress who are determined to turn the clock back. This bill \nworks to ensure that no American woman will ever have to go back to the \ndays of ignorance, isolation, and injustice. The women of America \ncannot afford to go back. The Family Planning and Choice Protection Act \nof 1997 calls on Congress to strengthen women's right to choose and to \nhold firm against further attacks on this fundamental right.\n  I am proud to sponsor this important initiative in the Senate, and \nproud to join Representative Lowey and groups such as the National \nAbortion Rights Action League to make this positive statement for \nwomen's rights and health.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1208\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Family Planning and Choice \n     Protection Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) reproductive rights are central to the ability of women \n     to exercise full enjoyment of rights secured to women by \n     Federal and State law;\n       (2) abortion has been a legal and constitutionally \n     protected medical procedure throughout the United States \n     since 1973 and has become part of mainstream medical practice \n     as is evidenced by the positions of medical institutions \n     including the American Medical Association, the American \n     College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American \n     Medical Women's Association, the American Nurses Association, \n     and the American Public Health Association;\n       (3) the availability of abortion services is diminishing \n     throughout the United States, as evidenced by--\n       (A) the fact that 84 percent of counties in the United \n     States have no abortion provider; and\n       (B) the fact that, between 1982 and 1992, the number of \n     abortion providers decreased in 45 States; and\n       (4)(A) the Department of Health and Human Services and the \n     Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences \n     have contributed to the development of a report entitled \n     ``Healthy People 2000'', which urges that the rate of \n     unintended pregnancy in the United States be reduced by \n     nearly 50 percent by the year 2000;\n       (B) nearly 60 percent, or approximately 3,100,000, of all \n     pregnancies in the United States each year are unintended, \n     resulting in 1,500,000 abortions in the United States each \n     year; and\n       (C) the provision of family planning services, including \n     emergency contraception, is a cost-effective way of reducing \n     the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in the \n     United States; and\n       (5) at a minimum, Congress must enact legislation \n     establishing or retaining the following policies to preserve \n     the choice and reproductive health of women:\n       (A) Authorization of family planning programs.\n       (B) The prohibition of any gag rule on information \n     pertaining to reproductive medical services.\n       (C) The promotion of equitable treatment and coverage of \n     prescription contraception drugs and devices in the provision \n     of health insurance.\n       (D) The provision of funding for emergency contraceptive \n     education.\n       (E) The establishment of breast cancer, cervical cancer, \n     and chlamydia screening programs in all 50 States.\n       (F) Full implementation of contraceptive and infertility \n     research programs.\n       (G) Funding through the medicaid program under title XIX of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) for abortion \n     services.\n       (H) Protection of women from clinic violence.\n       (I) Final approval of the drug called Mifepristone or RU-\n     486.\n       (J) The maintenance of a fundamental right to choose, as \n     stated in the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. \n     113 (1973).\n       (K) The establishment of the right of the District of \n     Columbia to access locally raised revenue to provide abortion \n     services to low-income women.\n       (L) The promotion of fairness in insurance.\n       (M) The establishment of the ability of military personnel \n     overseas to obtain abortion services.\n                          TITLE I--PREVENTION\n                      Subtitle A--Family Planning\n\n     SEC. 101. FAMILY PLANNING AMENDMENTS.\n\n       Section 1001(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     300(d)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(d) For the purpose of making grants and entering into \n     contracts under this section, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated $275,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 and such sums \n     as may be necessary for each of fiscal years 2000 through \n     2003.''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FREEDOM OF FULL DISCLOSURE.\n\n       Title XI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000h \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 1107. INFORMATION ABOUT AVAILABILITY OF REPRODUCTIVE \n                   HEALTH CARE SERVICES.\n\n       ``(a) Definition.--As used in this section, the term \n     `governmental authority' means any authority of the United \n     States.\n       ``(b) General Authority.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, no governmental authority shall, in or \n     through any program or activity that is administered or \n     assisted by such authority and that provides health care \n     services or information, limit the right of any person to \n     provide, or the right of any person to receive, nonfraudulent \n     information about the availability of reproductive health \n     care services, including family planning, prenatal care, \n     adoption, and abortion services.''.\n       Subtitle B--Prescription Equity and Contraceptive Coverage\n\n     SEC. 111.

PROGRAMS REGARDING CONTRACEPTION AND INFERTILITY.\n\n       (a) Research Centers.--It is the sense of Congress that the \n     program assisting research centers under section 452A of the \n     Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285g-5) should receive a \n     level of funding that is adequate for a reasonable number of \n     research centers to be operated under the program.\n       (b) Loan Repayment Program Regarding Conduct of Research.--\n     It is the sense of Congress that the program of loan-\n     repayment contracts under section 487B of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C 288-2) should receive a level of \n     funding that is adequate for a reasonable number of \n     individuals to conduct research under the program.\n                      TITLE III--CHOICE PROTECTION\n\n     SEC. 301. FUNDING FOR ABORTION SERVICES.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Federal and State \n     governments should provide funding for abortion services to \n     women eligible for assistance through the medicaid program \n     carried out under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1396 et seq.), as such services are essential to the \n     health and well-being of women.\n\n     SEC. 302. CLINIC VIOLENCE.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Federal resources are necessary to ensure that women \n     have safe access to reproductive health facilities and that \n     health professionals can deliver services in a secure \n     environment free from violence and threats of force; and\n       (2) it is necessary and appropriate to use Federal \n     resources to combat the nationwide campaign of violence and \n     harassment against reproductive health centers.\n\n     SEC. 303.

FREEDOM OF CHOICE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, 410 \n     U.S. 113 (1973) established constitutionally based limits on \n     the power of States to restrict the right of a woman to \n     choose to terminate a pregnancy. Under the strict scrutiny \n     standard enunciated in the Roe v. Wade decision, States were \n     required to demonstrate that laws restricting the right of a \n     woman to choose to terminate a pregnancy were the least \n     restrictive means available to achieve a compelling State \n     interest. Since 1989, the Supreme Court has no longer applied \n     the strict scrutiny standard in reviewing challenges to the \n     constitutionality of State laws restricting such rights.\n       (2) As a result of the recent modification by the Supreme \n     Court of the strict scrutiny\n\n[[Page S9795]]\n\n     standard enunciated in the Roe v. Wade decision, certain \n     States have restricted the right of women to choose to \n     terminate a pregnancy or to utilize some forms of \n     contraception, and the restrictions operate cumulatively to--\n       (A)(i) increase the number of illegal or medically less \n     safe abortions, often resulting in physical impairment, loss \n     of reproductive capacity, or death to the women involved;\n       (ii) burden interstate and international commerce by \n     forcing women to travel from States in which legal barriers \n     render contraception or abortion unavailable or unsafe to \n     other States or foreign nations;\n       (iii) interfere with freedom of travel between and among \n     the various States;\n       (iv) burden the medical and economic resources of States \n     that continue to provide women with access to safe and legal \n     abortion; and\n       (v) interfere with the ability of medical professionals to \n     provide health services;\n       (B) obstruct access to and use of contraceptive and other \n     medical techniques that are part of interstate and \n     international commerce;\n       (C) discriminate between women who are able to afford \n     interstate and international travel and women who are not, a \n     disproportionate number of whom belong to racial or ethnic \n     minorities; and\n       (D) infringe on the ability of women to exercise full \n     enjoyment of rights secured to the women by Federal and State \n     law, both statutory and constitutional.\n       (3) Although Congress may not by legislation create \n     constitutional rights, Congress may, where authorized by a \n     constitutional provision enumerating the powers of Congress \n     and not prohibited by a constitutional provision, enact \n     legislation to create and secure statutory rights in areas of \n     legitimate national concern.\n       (4) Congress has the affirmative power under section 8 of \n     article I of the Constitution and under section 5 of the 14th \n     amendment to the Constitution to enact legislation to \n     prohibit State interference with interstate commerce, \n     liberty, or equal protection of the laws.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to establish, \n     as a statutory matter, limitations on the power of a State to \n     restrict the freedom of a woman to terminate a pregnancy in \n     order to achieve the same limitations as were provided, as a \n     constitutional matter, under the strict scrutiny standard of \n     review enunciated in the Roe v. Wade decision and applied in \n     subsequent cases from 1973 through 1988.\n       (c) Definition.--As used in this section, the term \n     ``State'' includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth \n     of Puerto Rico, and each other territory or possession of the \n     United States.\n       (d) General Authority.--A State--\n       (1) may not restrict the freedom of a woman to choose \n     whether or not to terminate a pregnancy before fetal \n     viability;\n       (2) may restrict the freedom of a woman to choose whether \n     or not to terminate a pregnancy after fetal viability unless \n     such a termination is necessary to preserve the life or \n     health of the woman; and\n       (3) may impose requirements on the performance of abortion \n     procedures if such requirements are medically necessary to \n     protect the health of women undergoing such procedures.\n       (e) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be construed to--\n       (1) prevent a State from protecting unwilling individuals \n     or private health care institutions from being required to \n     participate in the performance of abortions to which the \n     individuals or institutions are conscientiously opposed;\n       (2) prevent a State from declining to pay for the \n     performance of abortions; or\n       (3) prevent a State from requiring a minor to involve a \n     parent, guardian, or other responsible adult before \n     terminating a pregnancy.\n\n     SEC. 305. FAIRNESS IN INSURANCE.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal law \n     shall be construed to prohibit a health plan from offering \n     coverage for the full range of reproductive health care \n     services, including abortion services.\n\n     SEC. 306. REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS OF WOMEN IN THE MILITARY.\n\n       Section 1093 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting before the period the \n     following: ``or in a case in which the pregnancy involved is \n     the result of an act of rape or incest or the abortion \n     involved is medically necessary or appropriate'';\n       (2) by striking subsection (b) (as added by section 738 of \n     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 \n     (Public Law 104-106; 110 Stat. 383)); and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Abortions in Facilities Overseas.--Subsection (a) \n     does not limit the performing of an abortion in a facility of \n     the uniformed services located outside the 48 contiguous \n     States of the United States if--\n       ``(1) the cost of performing the abortion is fully paid \n     from a source or sources other than funds available to the \n     Department of Defense;\n       ``(2) abortions are not prohibited by the laws of the \n     jurisdiction where the facility is located; and\n       ``(3) the abortion would otherwise be permitted under the \n     laws applicable to the provision of health care to members \n     and former members of the uniformed services and their \n     dependents in such facility.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1209. A bill improving teacher preparation and recruitment; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n      the higher education act title v reauthorization act of 1997\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to introduce President \nClinton's proposal for the reauthorization of title V of the Higher \nEducation Act. The goal of this important legislation is to improve the \nquality of teacher preparation programs and to bring more qualified \nteachers into America's classrooms, particularly in the areas of \nhighest need.\n  Investing in teachers is an investment in the Nation's children and \nits future. The Nation is clearly committed to the highest quality \ntraining for our doctors, engineers, and attorneys, both in their \ninitial training and in subsequent professional development \nopportunities. President Clinton is right to ask us to make that same \ncommitment to the training of teachers who are charged with educating \nthe Nation's most precious resource--our children. Not since the \nTeacher Corps initiatives of the 1970's has the Federal Government \ngiven such high priority to teaching and teachers. Through inaction, \nthe Nation has tacitly condoned low standards in too many schools, \nparticularly in urban and rural areas. Through inaction, we have left \ntoo many of these schools understaffed and unsupported. We must \nrecognize the urgency of this situation and act now.\n  In other initiatives, we are already asking teachers to ensure that \nchildren meet high standards, but we are not asking whether teachers \nare ready to meet this challenge. Because of the shortage of teachers, \nmany educators are forced to teach subjects outside their certification \narea. This shortage is especially serious in communities with high \nconcentrations of students from low-income families. Annually, more \nthan 50,000 underprepared teachers enter the classroom. One in four new \nteachers do not fully meet State certification requirements, and 12 \npercent of new hires have had not teacher training at all. Students in \ninner-city schools have only a 50-percent chance of being taught by a \nqualified science or math teacher. In Massachusetts, 30 percent of \nteachers in high-poverty schools do not even have a minor degree in \ntheir field.\n  This gap is unacceptable. Teachers must have a strong knowledge base \nin their subject area, so that they can motivate young learners and \nteach strong basic skills. Teachers must be comfortable with topics, so \nthat they encourage extended thinking and questioning on issues. \nTeachers must also have opportunities to improve their own skills, \nlearn how to integrate technology, and employ strategies that encourage \nall students to achieve.\n  Clearly, we must invest in better teacher preparation, do all we can \nto ensure that all of our schools are fully staffed with qualified \nteachers. We must attract the best and the brightest new teachers to \nadequately prepare students to compete in the global marketplace. \nDuring the next decade, because of rising student enrollment and \nmassive teacher retirement, the Nation will need over 2 million new \nteachers. But teacher preparation programs are currently producing \nbetween 100,000 and 150,000 new teachers a year, leaving the system \nwith an annual deficit of at least 50,000 teachers, particularly in \nunderserved, high-poverty schools.\n  The Federal Government, through the Eisenhower Professional \nDevelopment Program, already invests in upgrading the skills of current \nteachers, but the investment is far from sufficient. In addition, we \nmust invest in the front end of teacher training, to ensure that the \nNation's children are taught by highly qualified, well informed \nteachers. The President's proposal will help improve teacher \npreparation and bring well-qualified teachers into more classrooms.\n  The legislation addresses these issues by encouraging strong \npartnerships among institutions of higher education with exemplary \nteacher preparation programs, other institutions that want to improve \ntheir programs, and the school districts that they serve. The program \nwould be authorized at $67\n\n[[Page S9796]]\n\nmillion for fiscal year 1999. A Lighthouse Partnership Program will \nidentify lead institutions from the variety of successful teacher \npreparation programs that now exist. These programs provide aspiring \nteachers with the newest information about the best classroom \npractices, and give them the concrete clinical experiences they need to \ndevelop the skills to help students achieve high standards.\n  State and local education agencies, community colleges, and other \nprofessional groups will participate as partner institutions. The lead \ninstitutions will demonstrate their strength in cutting-edge, \nclinically based teacher preparation and course content. They must also \ndemonstrate that they are committed to strong ongoing cooperation with \nschool districts that serve needy families in rural and urban America.\n  A second major part of the President's proposal focuses on recruiting \nthe best and the brightest teachers to serve in needy school districts. \nIt supports partnerships between teacher preparation institutions and \nlocal education agencies that provide scholarships and other assistance \nto students who complete teacher preparation programs and agree to \nteach in targeted underserved areas for at least 3 years.\n  President Clinton's proposal is far-reaching, and it discusses broad \nbipartisan support. The United States is in urgent need of creating and \nmaintaining a stronger supply of world-class teachers. These wise \ninvestments will provide high-quality opportunities today to the \nteachers who will be teaching the Nation's children tomorrow. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nenact this major teacher recruitment and training proposal.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1209\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n       TITLE V--EDUCATOR RECRUITMENT, PREPARATION, AND INDUCTION\n\nSec. 501.

The Congress finds as follows:\n       ``(1) What teachers know and can do has a critical impact \n     on student achievement, yet too often prospective teachers \n     are not receiving the initial preparation they need in order \n     to teach children from diverse backgrounds to challenging \n     standards.\n       ``(2) A number of elementary and secondary schools \n     throughout the United States are implementing educational \n     reform strategies that are research-based, have records of \n     demonstrated effectiveness in enabling students to achieve to \n     high State or local standards, are replicable in diverse and \n     challenging circumstances, and are supported by networks of \n     researchers and experienced practitioners. Yet preparation to \n     implement these strategies is not generally a central \n     component of initial teacher preparation.\n       ``(3) Institutions of higher education that provide \n     teachers for urban and rural schools that enroll \n     concentrations of children from low-income families often \n     have the greatest need to restructure their teacher \n     preparation programs because the teachers they graduate will \n     face the greatest classroom challenges.\n       ``(4) Improvement of teacher preparation in mathematics and \n     reading represents a particular challenge for American \n     education. For example, most future elementary and middle-\n     school mathematics teachers take no more than one or two \n     college-level mathematics courses, and these courses are not \n     designed for prospective teachers and do not cover the \n     mathematics content that elementary and middle-school \n     teachers should teach to enable students to meet \n     challenging mathematics standards. In reading, most \n     teacher preparation programs have not incorporated the \n     large body of research on effective reading instruction.\n       ``(5) If current trends continue, American schools will \n     need to hire more than two million teachers in the next \n     decade to educate an increasing number of students and to \n     replace current teachers who will retire or leave the \n     profession. High-poverty urban and rural schools will \n     experience the most severe teacher shortages. Of the more \n     than two million teachers needed, approximately 15 percent, \n     or 345,000, will be needed in central cities, in schools with \n     large concentrations of low-income students. An additional \n     207,000 teachers will be needed in isolated, and often poor, \n     rural areas. Recent trends in the number of people preparing \n     to enter teaching indicate that the normal operation of the \n     labor market, by itself, will not produce the number of \n     qualified teachers schools will need.\n       ``(6) Schools are already having trouble recruiting \n     qualified teachers. Nearly three-quarters of physical science \n     students and one-third of English students in high-poverty \n     schools take classes with teachers who lack even a college \n     minor in their field. The National Commission on Teaching and \n     America's Future found that 50,000 uncertified individuals \n     annually enter teaching because schools, frequently those in \n     urban and rural areas with large concentrations of children \n     from low-income families, cannot find all the certified \n     teachers they need.\n       ``(7) Teaching excellence and diversity are inextricably \n     connected. By bringing distinctive life experiences and \n     perspectives into the classroom, enriching the instructional \n     curriculum and the school climate, and strengthening \n     connections to parents and communities, teachers from diverse \n     racial and ethnic groups, and those with disabilities, \n     enhance the quality of American education. Yet today, while \n     one-third of American students are members of minority \n     groups, members of racial and ethnic minority groups make up \n     only 13 percent of the teaching force and nearly half the \n     school districts in the Nation have no minority teachers. In \n     addition, few individuals with disabilities are teaching in \n     American classrooms.\n       ``(8) The Federal Government, by itself, cannot ensure \n     needed improvements in teacher preparation or solve the \n     problem of teacher shortages. However, the Government can \n     make limited, targeted investments that--\n       ``(A) encourage more institutions of higher education that \n     operate teacher preparation programs, working in partnership \n     with local educational agencies and States, to adopt the \n     practices and strategies of the best programs;\n       ``(B) encourage a more diverse mix of Americans to enter \n     teaching and complete high-quality preparation programs; and\n       ``(C) encourage more Americans to serve as teachers in \n     underserved communities.\n\n\n                               ``purpose\n\n       ``Sec. 502.

Mr. President, it is with great pride that I \nrise today to recognize the 25th Anniversary of the Uniformed Services \nUniversity of the Health Sciences [USUHS]. Over the past 25 years, \nUSUHS has provided an invaluable service to our Armed Forces and to our \nNation.\n  The founders of USUHS wanted to create a medical school to produce \nphysicians who would remain on active duty for a full career, ensuring \nthe continuity of lessons learned in the practice of uniformed \nmedicine. This concept has made USUHS a unique institution which \nenables doctors to target their skills to meet the changing demands of \nthe modern battlefield.\n  USUHS is essential to our military mission because it ensures \nreadiness. Readiness doesn't just mean supplying our troops with the \nbest equipment and training. It also means that we are ready to provide \nthe best possible medical care in the worst possible situations. If we \nsend our military to battle without skilled and experienced medical \nprofessionals--we are sending them out unarmed.\n  This concept for medical training was a success during recent \nconflicts. During Operation Desert Storm, USUHS physicians were \nimmediately deployable to combat areas and utilized their training in \nmilitary combat, unconventional warfare, and preventive medicine. This \nsaved countless lives during the gulf war and will keep our troops safe \nin any future military conflict.\n  I am proud of USUHS's accomplishments. I hope they will continue \nserving our armed services by keeping them safe and healthy well into \nthe 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9801-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AVIATION INSURANCE REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, and Senator \nFord, to introduce the aviation insurance reauthorization Act of 1997. \nThe bill would reauthorize the aviation insurance program for five \nyears. The program is set to expire at the end of this fiscal year.\n  The aviation insurance program, commonly known as war-risk insurance, \nhas been in place since 1951. It insures air carriers against losses \nresulting from war, terrorism, or other hostile acts, when commercial \ninsurance is canceled, or is unavailable at reasonable rates. For an \nair carrier to qualify for the program, the President must determine \nthat a flight is essential to the foreign policy interests of the \nUnited States.\n  The FAA can issue both premium and nonpremium insurance under the \nprogram. Premium insurance is issued to air carriers flying commercial \noperations in foreign air commerce, or between two or more points \noutside the United States. Nonpremium insurance is issued to air \ncarriers flying missions for Federal agencies, such as the Departments \nof Defense and State, that have indemnification agreements with the \nDepartment of Transportation. Nonpremium insurance accounts for 99 \npercent of the aviation insurance program.\n  Both the premium and nonpremium insurance provides hull coverage for \nthe loss of, or damage to aircraft. The insurance also provides \nliability coverage for death or bodily injury, and damage to property, \nbaggage and personal effects. Program coverage is limited to the amount \nof insurance that an air carrier's commercial policy would have \nprovided. The program is self-financed through the aviation insurance \nrevolving fund.\n  Reauthorization of the aviation insurance program is \nnoncontroversial. The program enjoys the support of all of its \nparticipants. I want to note, however, that my bill adds a new element \nto the program. It authorizes the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] \nto borrow money from the Federal treasury to pay a claim, in the event \nthat the revolving fund is not sufficient to cover a large claim, or \nsimultaneous claims. I believe that this provision is necessary to \nensure that timely payments for hull losses can be made to air \ncarriers. These same carriers typically lease aircraft under agreements \nthat stipulate that the carriers must repair or replace damaged \naircraft within 30 days of the incident.\n  Although the Congressional Budget Office claims that this provision \ndoes not have a significant budget impact, I understand that the Office \nof Management and Budget [OMB] may disagree. The FAA and the OMB are \nworking with the aviation leadership on the Commerce Committee to \nresolve this issue. I pledge my full cooperation, and I hope and expect \nthat we can resolve this issue before the Commerce Committee reports \nout the legislation.\n  The Commerce Committee plans to report out the bill as early as next \nweek. The House plans to approve companion legislation next week, as \nwell. I urge my colleagues to work with me to reauthorize the aviation \ninsurance program before it expires at the end of the fiscal \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9801-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9801-S9802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN RECOGNITION OF 10TH ANNUAL HEAT'S ON DAY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to my \ncolleagues' attention to the HEAT'S ON partnership of Grand Rapids, MI, \nwhich serves people who need special assistance in preparation for the \nharsh winter months that lie ahead.\n  On Saturday, September 27, 1997, plumbers and steamfitters of UA \nLocal\n\n[[Page S9802]]\n\n70 and the Mechanical Contractors Association of Grand Rapids will join \ntogether with Community Action to participate in the 10th annual HEAT'S \nON Day. The HEAT'S ON--Handicapped and Elderly Assistance to Serve Our \nNeighbors--Program began in 1987 in Minneapolis and St. Paul, MN. \nHEAT'S ON Day has become an annual event in the Grand Rapids area, as \nmembers of plumbers and steamfitters local 70 and the Mechanical \nContractors Association of Grand Rapids donate their time and talents \nto ensure that the homes of elderly and disabled people in Grand Rapids \nand the nearby cities of Grandville, Kentwood, Walker, and Wyoming are \nsafe for the winter.\n  Participating servicepeople check homes approved for the program and \nrepair and replace broken parts in furnaces and heating units. They \nalso install easy-to-read thermostats and smoke alarms for people who \nneed them. In the past 9 years, HEAT'S ON participants have discovered \nmore serious--and potentially life-threatening--problems, such as \nplugged chimneys, defective furnaces, and homes exposed to carbon \nmonoxide poisoning. These discoveries have enabled homeowners to have \nthe problems repaired before suffering dangerous accidents.\n  HEAT'S ON is a community effort, as evidenced by local businesses who \ncontribute time, money, and products to help defray the costs. \nConsumers Power, Meijer, and Dominos are just a few of the local \nbusinesses who participate in this vital program.\n  HEAT'S ON Day brings together many people to help ensure that nobody \nwho requires assistance needlessly suffers through a cold winter. In \nGrand Rapids, union workers and business owners combine their resources \nand abilities to serve those in need. They are an inspiration, and they \ndeserve our recognition. I know my colleagues will join me in extending \nour congratulations and thanks to the HEAT'S ON partnership of Grand \nRapids, MI for 10 years of service to their community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9801-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CHARACTER COUNTS IN NEW MEXICO\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as we approach National Character \nCounts Week, October 19-25, I want to relate another example of how \ncharacter education programs are expanding across the State of New \nMexico.\n  In New Mexico, over 30 communities and cities have adopted \npartnerships with their school systems to promote the Six Pillars of \nCharacter: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, \nand citizenship. There are literally thousands of young people involved \nin character-related programs in their youth organizations and public \nor private schools. Some communities have expanded their local efforts \nto include Character in the Workplace programs.\n  Character Counts is not just a slogan. It represents, instead, \nexciting and well-developed programs by citizens who believe there are \nimportant and positive benefits to be derived from good character. \nBecause families, churches, community groups, civic leaders, and school \nadministrators and teachers want to place more emphasis on the value of \nethical behavior, Character Counts has become one of the fastest \ngrowing and localized movements in the State's history.\n  As an example, in Farmington, NM, the Navajo Preparatory School is \ninitiating an all-encompassing character education program for its \nstudents. The Navajo Preparatory School is chartered by the Navajo \nNation to operate as a college preparatory school program for Navajo \nand other native American youth. Its mission is to educate highly \nmotivated and talented students who have the potential and desire to \nachieve a college education and become leaders of their respective \ncommunities. It has 195 boarding and day students from the Navajo \nNation, Jicarilla Apache, and various Pueblo Tribes. It has an \nexcellent academic record, with 85 percent of its graduating students \nenrolled in college.\n  Some weeks ago I was invited to visit the school to hear about its \nCharacter Counts Program. Attending were teachers, students, school \nadministration officials, and members of the board of trustees. The \nbriefing included an innovative audio-visual program designed to \ntransfer the concepts of the Six Pillars of Character into traditional \nNavajo teachings, as well as a review of the schools's translation of \nthe Six Pillars into the Navajo language. In addition to its Character \nCounts curriculum, Navajo Prep also supports the development of student \nactivities that will maximize the messages of the Six Pillars. It wants \nto ensure that its students have a comprehensive and cohesive program \nthat surrounds both their academic and social conduct.\n  The board of trustees presented their resolution for ``Endorsing and \nImplementing the Character Counts Program at the Navajo Preparatory \nSchool.'' I would like to quote from this resolution so Members of \nCongress will know how thoroughly the school's officials have developed \nthis character education program.\n\n       The Navajo Preparatory School Board supports and endorses \n     Character Counts which are based on six core ethical values: \n     trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, \n     and citizenship.\n       The Navajo Preparatory School Board requests its staff to \n     examine the curriculum and integrate Navajo-specific \n     character development teachings, strategies, methods and \n     partnership initiatives into the overall school program as an \n     ongoing part of school instruction.\n       The Navajo Preparatory School Board empowers the school \n     staff to join forces with the State of New Mexico Navajo \n     Nation and other local organizations and become a leader for \n     community action through teaching, enforcing, advocating and \n     modeling the six pillars of character.\n       The Navajo Preparatory School staff shall pursue available \n     funding to develop Navajo curriculum materials which promote \n     the development of good character.\n\n  As evidenced by Navajo Prep's creative character education program \nand as explained well in its resolution, ``* * * no single entity can \ninstill ethical behavior in youth and adults if it is acting without \nthe support of the other institutions and groups.'' Character-building \nactivities are for all. They can be embraced by the young and old and \nthe public and private sectors in a way the transcends political, \ncultural, religious, and socioeconomic differences.\n  In New Mexico, Character Counts is a statewide and communitywide \neffort. It is a program with unbelievable energy because everyone who \nhears about it believes in it and wants it to work. It works because \npeople, like those associated with the Navajo Preparatory School, are \nwholeheartedly committed to making it a reality.\n  I applaud the fine work of the Navajo Preparatory School, and welcome \nit as a new member of the ever-growing family of Character Counts \nenthusiasts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9802-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9802-S9803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  AMERICAN HERITAGE RIVERS INITIATIVE\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to \nthe proposed amendment by my colleague from Arkansas.\n  First, I think it is important to point out that the American \nheritage rivers initiative does not force designation upon any river or \nriver community. It is a voluntary program.\n  American heritage rivers enables communities who wish to protect, \nrestore, and revitalize their waterways, who want to protect their \nvital natural, historical, cultural, and recreational resources, to \nvoluntarily develop and submit a locally driven nomination and to seek \ndesignation.\n  As proposed by the administration, any nominated river must \ndemonstrate broad community support for the nomination. It must \ndemonstrate that members of the river community have had ample \nopportunities to comment on the nomination and plan of action. The \nadministration has also made it very clear that if a Member of Congress \nopposes a river designation in his or her district, the designation \nwill not occur in that district.\n  Second, American heritage rivers establishes no new regulations, and \nwas specifically designed to streamline Federal assistance to \ncommunity-led riparian restoration efforts. By requiring written \napproval from all property owners along a river, and subjecting \ndesignation to a lengthy congressional selection process, this \namendment in effect creates crippling delays and places unnecessary \nregulatory burdens on the nomination preparation and selection \nprocesses.\n  Third, this amendment unnecessarily restricts the broad objectives of \nAmerican heritage rivers by focusing only on the water pollution \naspects of river revitalization. American heritage rivers is designed \nto celebrate and address\n\n[[Page S9803]]\n\nnot only natural resource and environmental protection, but to also \npromote economic development and the protection of our historical, \ncultural, and recreational resources.\n  In my own State of Maryland, and throughout the entire Potomac \nwatershed, a broad coalition of local governments, private citizens, \nbusinesses, and others, known as the Friends of the Potomac, has \nmounted a concerted effort to nominate the Potomac. This coalition is \nstriving to make ``Our Nation's River'' one of the first 10 designated \nAmerican heritage rivers, and I fully support and encourage their \nefforts.\n  Mr. President, the American heritage rivers initiative is simply an \neffort to better coordinate and leverage existing Federal resources. \nThe Council on Environmental Quality, participating agencies and \ndepartments already have congressionally provided authority and \nresponsibility to carry out this program. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in opposing this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9802-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE 50-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE KSEN RADIO STATION IN SHELBY, MT\n\n Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, today, I want to pay tribute to \nan important institution in the Wisconsin State Legislature on its 50th \nanniversary: the Wisconsin Legislative Council.\n  The legislative council was created as a joint committee of the State \nlegislature in 1947, charged with convening special committees each \nbiennium to study the more complex, controversial or sometimes tedious \nbut necessary legislative issues, and to develop legislative solutions. \nThe unique aspect of the council's directive has been to identify and \nappoint knowledgeable Wisconsin citizens to work alongside legislators \nto craft bills, often recodifying whole chapters of the statutes at a \ntime.\n  The Wisconsin Legislative Council is derived from the same Wisconsin \nIdea, fostered by the Progressives in the early part of this century, \nthat created the Congressional Research Service. Senator ``Fighting \nBob'' LaFollette saw the importance of having nonpartisan, professional \nstaff provide research, analysis and bill-drafting to legislative \nbodies. The Wisconsin version, which has been the model for many other \nState legislatures, further improves on the concept by setting up a \nmechanism for open discussion and citizen participation directly in the \ndevelopment of legislative solutions in subjects selected by a \nbicameral body every 2 years.\n  Since its inception, the joint legislative council has overseen 426 \nindividual studies, conducted by not only State legislators but also \nincluding over 6,000 Wisconsin citizens as full voting members of \ncommittees. These committees are staffed by the legislative council \nstaff under the direction of the joint legislative council. These \nnonpartisan professional staff members further support the work of the \nlegislature by staffing committees, providing research and analysis to \nindividual legislators and their staff, and performing a technical \nreview of all proposed State regulations.\n  Many of the members of the Wisconsin congressional delegation have \nhad the experience of serving on legislative council committees--I \nserved on three, once as chairman of a study committee reviewing laws \non interstate sales and use taxes.\n  On its 50th anniversary, I am pleased to pay tribute to Wisconsin's \nJoint Legislative Council and the dedication of the legislative council \nstaff. May they continue their service to the state for many years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9803-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DAVID SCHMELTZER\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I rise to honor a truly \noutstanding, dedicated public servant--David Schmeltzer. Dave is \nretiring from the Federal Government after 35 years of service, \nincluding 25 years at the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, \nwhere he is the Director of the Office of Compliance. Over the years I \nhave been fortunate to have gotten to know Dave personally. A native \nNew Yorker, he received a bachelor of arts degree from Long Island \nUniversity in 1957. He attended Brooklyn Law School with my dear friend \nLarry Elovich, and became a member of the New York Bar after graduating \nin 1960. I want to wish Dave, his wife Louise, and their son Daniel and \nhis family the best of luck on this happy occasion.\n  David Schmeltzer has had a truly remarkable career in Federal \nservice. I am unaware of anyone with Dave's experience and knowledge \nwhen it comes to product safety regulation and enforcement. At the U.S. \nConsumer Product Safety Commission, in addition to his current position \nas Director of the Office of Compliance, Dave has served as both Deputy \nGeneral Counsel and Acting General Counsel. Before joining the \nCommission in 1973--at its inception, I should note--Dave served as the \nAssistant Chief Counsel for Enforcement and Administrative Law with the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration. He has also served as \nthe Vice Chairman for the International Consumer Health and Safety \nOrganization Symposium [ICPHSO] and is presently on ICPHSO's executive \ncommittee.\n  While the list of Government positions Dave has held is quite \nimpressive, it does not begin to measure his contributions in improving \nproduct safety for all Americans of all ages, from infants to our \nseniors. Dave has never been someone who has ducked the tough calls, \nand he has been willing to take the heat for doing so when many others \nwould have run away. He has always been fair and balanced in exercising \nhis judgment, a real straight shooter. The results speak for \nthemselves. On behalf of those consumers who have been spared the pain \nof a loss or devastating injury to a child or other loved one, I want \nto thank Dave Schmeltzer for his years of service and wish him well in \nhis future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9803-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9803-S9804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMEMORATING THE INDEPENDENCE OF ARMENIA\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the sixth \nanniversary of Armenian Independence.\n  With the fall of the Soviet Union, Armenians were quickly faced with \nthe possibility of realizing a vision which they had long sought--\nindependence. On September 21, 1991, Armenia held a referendum to \ndecide its future. More than 94 percent of Armenia's eligible voters \nturned out to support independence. Two days later, on September 23, \nthe Armenian Parliament made the people's desire official when it \ndeclared Armenia's independence from the Soviet Union.\n  The historic vote for independence on September 21, 1991, has far \ngreater significance when examined in light of Armenia's modern \nhistory. Throughout the last century, the Armenian people have \nexperienced incredible hardship and tragedy in their efforts to rule \nthemselves. Armenia began the 20th century under the control of the \nOttoman Turks. Ottoman Turk rule turned savage at the beginning of \nWorld War I when it waged a government-organized genocide on the \nArmenians. During the Armenian Genocide of 1915-23, 1.5 million people \nperished as the Ottoman Turks tried to permanently silence Armenian \ncalls for independence.\n  Following the defeat of the Ottoman Turks in World War I, Armenians \nwere able to briefly fulfill their wishes of independence. On May 28, \n1918, the Republic of Armenia was established.\n\n[[Page S9804]]\n\n However, this independence was short-lived as the Republic of Armenia \nsoon collapsed because of renewed Turkish and Soviet pressure. On \nNovember 29, 1920, Armenia was declared a Soviet republic and spent the \nnext 71 years under Soviet rule. With the fall of the Soviet Union in \n1991, Armenia was finally able to fulfill its goal of self-\ndetermination.\n  Today, September 23, Armenia celebrates the sixth anniversary of its \nindependence. I know that the many Armenian-Americans in Michigan and \nthe United States join in this celebration. The support Armenian-\nAmericans have given to their homeland has been indispensable as \nArmenia emerges from many years of Soviet domination. I applaud their \nefforts and the efforts of the Armenian people to build an independent \nand democratic Armenia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9803-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FURTHER EVIDENCE OF NEED FOR LEGAL REFORM NOW\n\n Mr. GORTON. A jury in New Orleans the other week issued a \nclarion call for legal reform. A monstrous judgment against CSX \nTransportation and four other companies illustrates once again the \narbitrary and perverse nature of our current tort system.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to bring to my colleagues' attention a \n$2.5 billion punitive damage award against CSX Transportation stemming \nfrom a 1987 chemical-car fire in the New Orleans neighborhood of \nGentilly. Even in the context of our current broken legal system, this \none is shocking. The jury awarded $2.5 billion, out of a total punitive \ndamage award of $3.4 billion, against CSXT, Mr. President, despite the \nfact that Federal experts had determined that CSX was not at fault; \ndespite the fact that the jury did not allocate any significant portion \nof the compensatory damages to CSXT; despite the fact that actual \ncompensatory damages awarded to date in the case are only $2 million; \nand despite the fact that the accident resulted in no deaths, no \nserious injuries, and no significant property damage.\n  Comparisons made in a New Orleans Times Picayune article put the \ntotal punitive damage award into perspective, warped as it is. Consider \nthat the punitive damage award in this case is seven times the amount \nUnion Carbide paid to settle a claim relating to a chemical leak in \nBhopal, India, that killed 4,000 people and injured 300,000. Despite \nonly minor property damage, this award is two-thirds of the punitive \ndamage award against Exxon for the environmentally devastating spill \nthat occurred in Alaska in 1989.\n  Let me set out the facts of the case as I understand them from the \npress accounts. On September 9, 1987, a railroad tank car containing \nbutadiene, a volatile compound used in making synthetic rubber, was \nlocated in a rail yard in New Orleans on tracks that belonged to CSXT. \nDue to a faulty gasket, the contents of the car leaked and the car \ncaught fire. Local officials determined that the best approach was to \nlet the fire burn itself out. To avoid harm to nearby residents, \nauthorities ordered the evacuation of those living near the yard. Many \npeople were inconvenienced, but although there are 8,000 people in the \nplaintiff class, only 2,300 people claim to have been located within \nthe evacuation zone, and contemporary estimates of how many people were \nactually evacuated put the number at about 1,000.\n  One year after the accident, the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, the Federal agency that investigates transportation accidents, \ndetermined that a misaligned gasket and other factors, not involving \nCSXT, had caused the accident. In fact, other than providing the track \non which the train car was placed, CSXT had no connection to the car. \nCSXT did not own or repair the tank car, and it did not transport the \ncar.\n  Significantly, even though the NTSB determined that CSTX had not \ncaused the accident, the jury held CSXT 15 percent responsible for the \n$2 million on compensatory damages that have been awarded to 20 \nplaintiffs at this time. The remaining plaintiffs will have to prove \ntheir damages in separate proceedings. Though it seems unfair that CSXT \nwould be responsible for any compensatory damages if it was not at \nfault, it is unspeakably outrageous that CSXT would be assessed over 75 \npercent of the punitive damages, and only 15 percent of the \ncompensatory damages.\n  How can it be that a Federal agency determines that a company has no \nresponsibility for causing an accident and yet this huge verdict is \nawarded? The answer, unfortunately, is that our tort system is broken. \nThe case in New Orleans is the latest, though perhaps most egregious, \nexample of why we have to reform our civil justice system, to place \nsome reasonable limit on punitive damage awards, to modify the laws \nregarding joint and several liability, and to provide disincentives for \nlawyers to go after the ``deep pockets,'' simply because they're there.\n  CSXT is a big corporation, but that should not be reason to impose \nhuge penalties on it, penalties that could affect its thousands of \nemployees, thousands of middle-class stockholders who own shares in the \ncompany through their pension plans, and everyone who uses its vital \ntransportation facilities. Until we undertake meaningful legal reform, \nwe will continue to disadvantage businesses and consumers, stunt career \nopportunities, breed contempt for the law, and do injustice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9804-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9804-S9805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF TRUMBULL, CT\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, located in the hilly country of \nsouthwestern Connecticut in the watershed of the Pequonnock River is \nthe quaint residential community of Trumbull. Despite its proximity to \nmany highly industrialized cities, Trumbull has been able to preserve \nits small-town New England character and charm, and this year the town \nof Trumbull will celebrate its 200th anniversary.\n  The Trumbull area was permanently settled in 1690, and in the \nfollowing years families began migrating to this secluded wilderness \nregion, building mills, churches, and schools. In 1725, the settlement \nofficially became the village of Unity, and this village was eventually \nabsorbed by the larger community of North Stratford. Nearly a century \nafter it was settled, the residents began the petition process for \nindependence from North Stratford, and in 1797, the general assembly \ngranted this request, established town bounds, and declared that this \narea shall forever be a distinct town known by the name of \n``Trumbull.''\n  The town was named after one of the most respected families in \nConnecticut history, the Trumbulls of Lebanon, CT. The family's \npatriarch, Jonathan Trumbull, Sr., was the first of four ``Governor \nTrumbulls'' in Connecticut. He was a close ally of George Washington, \nand he was the only colonial Governor to support the Revolution. In \nrecognition of his contributions to his State and his country, a statue \nof Jonathan Trumbull, Sr., currently stands in the Statuary Hall of the \nU.S. Capitol.\n  His son, Jonathan Trumbull, Jr., also had an illustrious career as an \nearly American statesman. He was a member of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives where he served as Speaker of the House. He also \nrepresented the State as a U.S. Senator and was elected Connecticut's \ngovernor in 1797, shortly after the town of Trumbull was incorporated.\n  In addition, Jonathan Trumbull, Sr.'s youngest child, John, was one \nof the most noteworthy American artists known for painting important \nhistorical events. Today, four of his paintings hang in the U.S. \nCapitol rotunda, his most famous being ``The Surrender of Cornwallis.''\n  While the namesakes for this town were truly heroic individuals, the \nmany generations of Trumbull residents who have settled this town and \nshepherded its evolution over the years are equally heroic in their own \nright. They met the crises of their times. They worked hard to ensure a \npromising future for their children. They lent a helping hand to their \nneighbors when they were in need. They did all of the things that are \nnecessary to sustain a community and help it develop into a wonderful \nplace to live.\n  Today, Trumbull is a vibrant residential community which is dedicated \nto the preservation of its family-oriented atmosphere. Its schools are \namong the best in the State and the Parent-Teachers Association is very \nactive. There are places of worship for more than a dozen different \nreligions, strengthening the fabric of the community and adding to its \ndiversity. More\n\n[[Page S9805]]\n\nthan 1,000 acres of town-owned open space are set aside for \nrecreational use, and Trumbull is renowned for its numerous public \nparks. Trumbull has also invested in its children by establishing an \nexcellent youth sports program. In fact, one of the town's and the \nState of Connecticut's proudest moments came when a resilient group of \n11- and 12-year-olds from Trumbull pulled off one of the greatest \nupsets in baseball history and won the Little League World Series in \n1988.\n  Trumbull's motto is ``Pride in our past. Faith in our future.'' I \nwould like to personally say that the people of Trumbull should be very \nproud of their town's history and heritage. But more important, I have \ncomplete faith that the future for the people of Trumbull will be even \nbrighter than the past. I congratulate the town of Trumbull on this \nhistoric milestone and offer my best wishes for future centuries of \nsuccess and prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9804-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS--NATIONAL PARK AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT \n                                  FUND\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as part of the Interior \nappropriations bill (H.R. 2107) the Senate adopted an amendment I \noffered with Senator Stevens to create a National Park and \nEnvironmental Improvement Fund. The fund is financed with $800 million \nin disputed oil revenue awarded to the Federal Government by the \nSupreme Court. Under the amendment, the annual interest from the fund \nwould be available, subject to appropriation, for top priority capital \nimprovements within the National Park System; to assist States with \ntheir own park planning and development; and to finance ocean research.\n  As I stated, disbursements of the interest revenue would be subject \nto appropriation. I want to be clear that it is not our intent to \ncreate this fund in vain, by appropriating the interest and reducing \nother vital park or environmental accounts in order to remain below the \napplicable budget caps. Our goal and intent is to ensure these funds \nwill supplement the appropriations parks and environmental accounts \nwould otherwise receive. The distinguished chairmen of the Budget \nCommittee and the Appropriations Committee have agreed to work to \nensure that end and I thank them for their courtesy and leadership.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. I look forward \nto working with him next year to address this issue during the budget \nprocess to ensure this fund provides additional resources to meet park \nand relevant environmental needs so that it will not require offsets \nfrom other park or vital environmental accounts.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I concur with my colleagues, and I will \nwork as chairman of the Appropriations Committee to make sure that \nthese funds are additional, not replacement, revenues to meet park and \nenvironmental purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9805-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ELIMINATION OF SECRET SENATE ``HOLDS''\n\n Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the work \nof Jim Wengert--a good friend and great fighter for working people \nacross the state of Iowa and around the country.\n  For well over a generation, Jim Wengert has been a leader at the Iowa \nFederation of Labor. From 1966 to 1979, he was Secretary-Treasurer of \nthe statewide organization. And from 1979 until his retirement this \nyear, Jim has been at the helm of the Iowa Federation of Labor serving \nas its President.\n  Prior to his years at the Iowa Fed, Jim worked at Swift and Company \nin Sioux City. In 1952, he joined Local 71 of the United Packinghouse \nWorkers of America and he wasted no time rising up the ranks. He served \nas Vice President and Steward of his local--and Recording Secretary and \nPresident of the Woodbury County Labor Council.\n  In addition, Jim has been a legislator in the Iowa General Assembly, \nand a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, the \nUniversity of Iowa Labor Advisory Committee, and the Iowa Workers' \nCompensation Advisory Committee.\n  Mr. President, Jim Wengert has had a long and distinguished career \nbut there is a common thread that weaves all his work together. For \nalmost half a century, Jim Wengert has been on the frontlines of the \nbattle for dignity and economic and social justice for the working \npeople of this country.\n  That fight has not been easy--far too often, the deck has been \nstacked against working people. But Jim never picked his battles \nbecause the odds were on his side. He did it because America's best \nvalues were on his side. Values like dignity, justice and fair play. \nTime and again, Jim Wengert put it on the line for workers on the line.\n  To Jim, it's simple. Fighting for working people is a labor of love. \nThat's why he has used his position and his platform to speak out for \ngood jobs, a living wage, secure pensions, and a better future for our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  And if one looks across the landscape of Iowa and at all that's \nhappened that's been good for working people, I guarantee you'll find \nthe fingerprints of Jim Wengert. Because whether it's passing \nlegislation, electing progressive candidates, or changing attitudes, \nJim helped make it happen.\n  Mr. President, Jim Wengert is an optimist, a doer and a believer. He \nbelieves with his head and his heart that tomorrow can be better than \ntoday. And the power to make that happen isn't in the hands of \n``them''--the powerful and privileged. The power to make the future \nbrighter rests with us--by organizing and working together.\n  That is what a union is all about. And that's what Jim Wengert is all \nabout.\n  I know the Senate joins me in wishing Jim many more years of health \nand happiness. And even though his retirement is a loss for the working \npeople of Iowa, it is truly a gain for the Wengert family--for Jim's \nwife Joanne, his children and, of course, his grandchildren.\n  Once again, Mr. president I want to thank Jim Wengert for his \ncommitment and service. We owe him an enormous debt for a lifetime of \nbuilding our communities and advancing the cause of justice and dignity \nfor the working people of Iowa and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/23/senate-section/article/S9805-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9805-S9806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AUSTRIAN-AMERICAN DAY\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The President's messages are as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (the ``Treaty'' \nor ``CTBT''), opened for signature and signed by the United States at \nNew York on September 24, 1996. The Treaty includes two Annexes, a \nProtocol, and two Annexes to the Protocol, all of which form integral \nparts of the Treaty. I transmit also, for the information of the \nSenate, the report of the Department of State on the Treaty, including \nan Article-by-Article analysis of the Treaty.\n  Also included in the Department of State's report is a document \nrelevant to but not part of the Treaty: The Treaty on the Establishment \nof a Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban \nTreaty Organization, adopted by the Signatory States to the Treaty on \nNovember 19, 1996. The Text provides the basis for the work of the \nPreparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty \nOrganization is preparing detailed procedures for implementing the \nTreaty and making arrangements for the first session of the Conference \nof the States Parties to the Treaty. In particular, by the terms of the \nTreaty, the Preparatory Commission will be responsible for ensuring \nthat the verification regime established by the Treaty will be \neffectively in operation at such time as the Treaty enters into force. \nMy Administration has completed and will submit separately to the \nSenate an analysis of the verifiability of the Treaty, consistent with \nsection 37 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act, as amended. Such \nlegislation as may be necessary to implement the Treaty also will be \nsubmitted separately to the Senate for appropriate action.\n  The conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is a \nsignal event in the history of arms control. The subject of the Treaty \nis one that has been under consideration by the international community \nfor nearly 40 years, and the significance of the conclusion of \nnegotiations and the signature to date of more than 140 states cannot \nbe overestimated. The Treaty creates an absolute prohibition against \nthe conduct of nuclear weapon test explosions or any other nuclear \nexplosion anywhere. Specifically, each State Party undertakes not to \ncarry out any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear \nexplosion; to prohibit and prevent any nuclear explosions at any place \nunder its jurisdiction or control; and to refrain from causing, \nencouraging, or in any way participating in the carrying out of any \nnuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion.\n  The Treaty establishes a far reaching verification regime, based on \nthe provision of seismic, hydroacoustic, radionuclide, and infrasound \ndata by a global network (the ``International Monitoring System'') \nconsisting of the facilities listed in Annex 1 to the Protocol. Data \nprovided by the International Monitoring System will be stored, \nanalyzed, and disseminated, in accordance with Treaty-mandated \noperational manuals, by an International Data Center that will be part \nof the Technical Secretariat of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban \nTreaty Organization. The verification regime includes rules for the \nconduct of on-site inspections, provisions for consultation and \nclarification, and voluntary confidence-building measures designed to \ncontribute to the timely resolution of any compliance concerns arising \nfrom possible misinterpretation of monitoring data related to chemical \nexplosions that a State Party intends to or has carried out. Equally \nimportant to the U.S. ability to verify the Treaty, the text \nspecifically provides for the rights of States Parties to use \ninformation obtained by national technical means in a manner consistent \nwith generally\n\n[[Page S9807]]\n\nrecognized principles of international law for purposes of verification \ngenerally, and in particular, as the basis for an on-site inspection \nrequest. The verification regime provides each State Party the right to \nprotect sensitive installations, activities, or locations not related \nto the Treaty. Determinations of compliance with the Treaty rest with \neach individual State Party to the Treaty.\n\n  Negotiations for a nuclear test-ban treaty date back to the \nEisenhower Administration. During the period 1978-1980, negotiations \namong the United States, the United Kingdom, and the USSR (the \nDepositary Governments of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \nNuclear Weapons (NPT)) made progress, but ended without agreement. \nThereafter, as the nonnuclear weapon states called for test-ban \nnegotiations, the United States urged the Conference on Disarmament \n(the ``CD'') to devote its attention to the difficult aspects of \nmonitoring compliance with such a ban and developing elements of an \ninternational monitoring regime. After the United States, joined by \nother key states, declared its support for comprehensive test-ban \nnegotiations with a view toward prompt conclusion of a treaty, \nnegotiations on a comprehensive test-ban were initiated in the CD, in \nJanuary 1994. Increased impetus for the conclusion of a comprehensive \nnuclear test-ban treaty by the end of 1996 resulted from the adoption, \nby the Parties to the NPT in conjunction with the indefinite and \nunconditional extension of that Treaty, of ``Principles and Objectives \nfor Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament'' that listed the \nconclusion of a CTBT as the highest measure of its program of action.\n  On August 11, 1995, when I announced U.S. support for a ``zero \nyield'' CTBT, I stated that:\n\n  ``. . . as part of our national security strategy, the United States \n    must and will retain strategic nuclear forces sufficient to deter \n    any future hostile foreign leadership with access to strategic \n    nuclear forces from acting against our vital interests and to \n    convince it that seeking a nuclear advantage would be futile. In \n    this regard, I consider the maintenance of a safe and reliable \n    nuclear stockpile to be a supreme national interest of the United \n    States.\n  ``I am assured by the Secretary of Energy and the Directors of our \n    nuclear weapons labs that we can meet the challenge of maintaining \n    our nuclear deterrent under a CTBT through a Science Based \n    Stockpile Stewardship program without nuclear testing. I directed \n    the implementation of such a program almost 2 years ago, and it is \n    being developed with the support of the Secretary of Defense and \n    the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This program will now be \n    tied to a new certification procedure. In order for this program to \n    succeed, both the Administration and the Congress must provide \n    sustained bipartisan support for the stockpile stewardship program \n    over the next decade and beyond. I am committed to working with the \n    Congress to ensure this support.\n  ``While I am optimistic that the stockpile stewardship program will \n    be successful, as President I cannot dismiss the possibility, \n    however unlikely, that the program will fall short of its \n    objectives. Therefore, in addition to the new annual certification \n    procedure for our nuclear weapons stockpile, I am also establishing \n    concrete, specific safeguards that define the conditions under \n    which the United States can enter into a CTBT. . .''\n\n  The safeguards that were established are as follows:\n\n  --The conduct of a Science Based Stockpile Stewardship program to \n    ensure a high level of confidence in the safety and reliability of \n    nuclear weapons in the active stockpile, including the conduct of a \n    broad range of effective and continuing experimental programs.\n  --The maintenance of modern nuclear laboratory facilities and \n    programs in theoretical and exploratory nuclear technology that \n    will attract, retain, and ensure the continued application of our \n    human scientific resources to those programs on which continued \n    progress in nuclear technology depends.\n  --The maintenance of the basic capability to resume nuclear test \n    activities prohibited by the CTBT should the United States cease to \n    be bound to adhere to this Treaty.\n  --The continuation of a comprehensive research and development \n    program to improve our treaty monitoring capabilities and \n    operations.\n  --The continuing development of a broad range of intelligence \n    gathering and analytical capabilities and operations to ensure \n    accurate and comprehensive information on worldwide nuclear \n    arsenals, nuclear weapons development programs, and related nuclear \n    programs.\n  --The understanding that if the President of the United States is \n    informed by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy \n    (DOE)--advised by the Nuclear Weapons Council, the Directors of \n    DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories, and the Commander of the U.S. \n    Strategic Command--that a high level of confidence in the safety or \n    reliability of a nuclear weapon type that the two Secretaries \n    consider to be critical to our nuclear deterrent could no longer be \n    certified, the President, in consultation with the Congress, would \n    be prepared to withdraw from the CTBT under the standard ``supreme \n    national interests'' clause in order to conduct whatever testing \n    might be required.\n\n  With regard to the last safeguard:\n\n  --The U.S. regards continued high confidence in the safety and \n    reliability of its nuclear weapons stockpile as a matter affecting \n    the supreme interests of the country and will regard any events \n    calling that confidence into question as ``extraordinary events \n    related to the subject matter of the treaty.'' It will exercise its \n    rights under the ``supreme national interests'' clause if it judges \n    that the safety or reliability of its nuclear weapons stockpile \n    cannot be assured with the necessary high degree of confidence \n    without nuclear testing.\n  --To implement that commitment, the Secretaries of Defense and \n    Energy--advised by the Nuclear Weapons Council or ``NWC'' \n    (comprising representatives of DOD, JCS, and DOE), the Directors of \n    DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories and the Commander of the U.S. \n    Strategic Command--will report to the President annually, whether \n    they can certify that the Nation's nuclear weapons stockpile and \n    all critical elements thereof are, to a high degree of confidence, \n    safe and reliable, and, if they cannot do so, whether, in their \n    opinion and that of the NWC, testing is necessary to assure, with a \n    high degree of confidence, the adequacy of corrective measures to \n    assure the safety and reliability of the stockpile, or elements \n    thereof. The Secretaries will state the reasons for their \n    conclusions, and the views of the NWC, reporting any minority \n    views.\n  --After receiving the Secretaries' certification and accompanying \n    report, including NWC and minority views, the President will \n    provide them to the appropriate committees of the Congress, \n    together with a report on the actions he has taken in light of \n    them.\n  --If the President is advised, by the above procedure, that a high \n    level of confidence in the safety or reliability of a nuclear \n    weapon type critical to the Nation's nuclear deterrent could no \n    longer be certified without nuclear testing, or that nuclear \n    testing is necessary to assure the adequacy of corrective measures, \n    the President will be prepared to exercise our ``supreme national \n    interests'' rights under the Treaty, in order to conduct such \n    testing.\n  --The procedure for such annual certification by the Secretaries, and \n    for advice to them by the NWC, U.S. Strategic Command, and the DOE \n    nuclear weapons laboratories will be embodied in domestic law.\n\n  As negotiations on a text drew to a close it became apparent that one \nmember of the CD, India, would not join in a consensus decision to \nforward the text to the United Nations for its adoption. After \nconsultations among countries supporting the text, Australia requested \nthe President of the\n\n[[Page S9808]]\n\nU.N. General Assembly to convene a resumed session of the 50th General \nAssembly to consider and take action on the text. The General Assembly \nwas so convened, and by a vote of 158 to 3 the Treaty was adopted. On \nSeptember 24, 1996, the Treaty was opened for signature and I had the \nprivilege, on behalf of the United States, of being the first to sign \nthe Treaty.\n\n  The Treaty assigns responsibility for overseeing its implementation \nto the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organization (the \n``Organization''), to be established in Vienna. The Organization, of \nwhich each State Party will be a member, will have three organs: the \nConference of the States Parties, a 51-member Executive Council, and \nthe Technical Secretariat. The Technical Secretariat will supervise the \noperation of and provide technical support for the International \nMonitoring System, operate the International Data Center, and prepare \nfor and support the conduct of on-site inspections. The Treaty also \nrequires each State Party to establish a National Authority that will \nserve as the focal point within the State Party for liaison with the \nOrganization and with other States Parties.\n  The Treaty will enter into force 180 days after the deposit of \ninstruments of ratification by all of the 44 states listed in Annex 2 \nto the Treaty, but in no case earlier than 2 years after its being \nopened for signature. If, 3 years from the opening of the Treaty for \nsignature, the Treaty has not entered into force, the Secretary-General \nof the United Nations, in his capacity as Depositary of the Treaty, \nwill convene a conference of the states that have deposited their \ninstruments of ratification if a majority of those states so requests. \nAt this conference the participants will consider what measures \nconsistent with international law might be undertaken to accelerate the \nratification process in order to facilitate the early entry into force \nof the Treaty. Their decision on such measures must be taken by \nconsensus.\n  Reservations to the Treaty Articles and the Annexes to the Treaty are \nnot permitted. Reservations may be taken to the Protocol and its \nAnnexes so long as they are not incompatible with the object and \npurpose of the Treaty. Amendment of the Treaty requires the positive \nvote of a majority of the States Parties to the Treaty, voting in a \nduly convened Amendment Conference at which no State Party casts a \nnegative vote. Such amendments would enter into force 30 days after \nratification by all States Parties that cast a positive vote at the \nAmendment Conference.\n  The Treaty is of unlimited duration, but contains a ``supreme \ninterests'' clause entitling any State Party that determines that its \nsupreme interests have been jeopardized by extraordinary events related \nto the subject matter of the Treaty to withdraw from the Treaty upon 6-\nmonths' notice.\n  Unless a majority of the Parties decides otherwise, a Review \nConference will be held 10 years following the Treaty's entry into \nforce and may be held at 10-year intervals thereafter if the Conference \nof the States Parties so decides by a majority vote (or more frequently \nif the Conference of the States Parties so decides by a two-thirds \nvote).\n  The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is of singular significance \nto the continuing efforts to stem nuclear proliferation and strengthen \nregional and global stability. Its conclusion marks the achievement of \nthe highest priority item on the international arms control and \nnonproliferation agenda. Its effective implementation will provide a \nfoundation on which further efforts to control and limit nuclear \nweapons can be soundly based. By responding to the call for a CTBT by \nthe end of 1996, the Signatory States, and most importantly the nuclear \nweapon states, have demonstrated the bona fides of their commitment to \nmeaningful arms control measures.\n  The monitoring challenges presented by the wide scope of the CTBT \nexceed those imposed by any previous nuclear test-related treaty. Our \ncurrent capability to monitor nuclear explosions will undergo \nsignificant improvement over the next several years to meet these \nchallenges. Even with these enhancements, though, several conceivable \nCTBT evasion scenarios have been identified. Nonetheless, our National \nIntelligence Means (NIM), together with the Treaty's verification \nregime and our diplomatic efforts, provide the United States with the \nmeans to make the CTBT effectively verifiable. By this, I mean that the \nUnited States:\n\n  --will have a wide range of resources (NIM, the totality of \n    information available in public and private channels, and the \n    mechanisms established by the Treaty) for addressing compliance \n    concerns and imposing sanctions in cases of noncompliance; and\n  --will thereby have the means to: (a) assess whether the Treaty is \n    deterring the conduct of nuclear explosions (in terms of yields and \n    number of tests) that could damage U.S. security interests and \n    constraining the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and (b) take \n    prompt and effective counteraction.\n\n  My judgment that the CTBT is effectively verifiable also reflects the \nbelief that U.S. nuclear deterrence would not be undermined by possible \nnuclear testing that the United States might fail to detect under the \nTreaty, bearing in mind that the United States will derive substantial \nconfidence from other factors--the CTBT's ``supreme national \ninterests'' clause, the annual certification procedure for the U.S. \nnuclear stockpile, and the U.S. Safeguards program.\n  I believe that the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is in the \nbest interests of the United States. Its provisions will significantly \nfurther our nuclear nonproliferation and arms control objectives and \nstrengthen international security. Therefore, I urge the Senate to give \nearly and favorable consideration to the Treaty and its advice and \nconsent to ratification as soon as possible.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, September 22, 1997.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification the \nProtocol Amending the Convention Between the United States of America \nand Canada with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Signed at \nWashington on September 26, 1980 as Amended by the Protocols Signed on \nJune 14, 1983, March 28, 1984 and March 17, 1995, signed at Ottawa on \nJuly 29, 1997. This Protocol modified the taxation of social security \nbenefits and the taxation of gains from the sale of shares of foreign \nreal-property holding companies.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthis Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, September 23, 1997.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty Between the \nGovernment of the United States of America and the Government of the \nRepublic of India, signed at Washington on June 25, 1997.\n  In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, a related \nexchange of letters signed the same date and the report of the \nDepartment of State with respect to the Treaty. As the report states, \nthe Treaty will not require implementing legislation.\n  The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content \nof extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.\n  Upon entry into force, this Treaty would enhance cooperation between \nthe law enforcement authorities of both countries, and thereby make a \nsignificant contribution to international law enforcement efforts. With \nrespect to the United States and India, the Treaty would supersede the \nTreaty for the Mutual Extradition of Criminals between the United \nStates of America and Great Britain, signed at London December 22, \n1931, which was made applicable to India on March 9, 1942, and is \ncurrently applied by the United States and India.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                  William J.
