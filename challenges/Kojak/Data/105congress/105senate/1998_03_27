Mr. President, this is really a great morning. After 2 \nyears, I have the immense pleasure of voting with the majority of my \ncolleagues to confirm two judges that I have worked very hard to get \nthrough this often difficult process. I thank my colleagues for their \nsupport of these two fine individuals, Ms. Margaret McKeown and Mr. Ed \nShea. In particular, I thank our chairman, Senator Hatch, our ranking \nmember, Senator Leahy, and my colleague, Senator Gorton, for their \nperseverance on behalf of these two individuals.\n  I would first like to tell my colleagues about the newest judge to \nthe Ninth Circuit, Ms. McKeown. Before coming to the Senate, I had \nheard across the spectrum that Ms. McKeown was one of the finest \nbusiness lawyers in the northwest. Now that she and I have spent time \ntogether, I have come to understand why she had that reputation: she is \ntenacious, does outstanding work, is an accomplished advocate, and has \nthe patience of Job.\n  Let me summarize some of the high points of Ms. McKeown's career:\n  She was the first woman partner at the 70-year-old, prestigious firm \nof Perkins Coie;\n  She has served for 11 years on the Perkins Coie executive and \nmanagement committees;\n  She is a nationally recognized litigator who was named in Top Players \nin High Tech Intellectual Property;\n  Her range of litigation is amazing: one day she is litigating about \nthe typeface in personal computers, the next day she is defending a \nsecurities case, the next day she might be litigating avionics in \nmilitary aircraft;\n  She was president of the Federal Bar Association for the Western \nDistrict of Washington and a lawyer representative to the Ninth Circuit \nJudicial Conference;\n  She has worked as an aide to United States Senator Cliff Hansen of \nWyoming, as a special assistant under President Carter to Interior \nSecretary Andrus, and as White House Fellow under President Reagan;\n  She is on the executive committee of the Washington State Council on \nInternational Trade; and\n  She has served as counsel for the Downtown Seattle Business \nAssociation.\n  While who you know is important, and what you do as a lawyer is \ncritical, where you put your priorities is also vital. One of the \nreasons I so strongly supported Ms. McKeown's nomination is because of \nher commitment to her community and family.\n  I am amazed that the same person who represented Boeing in a multi-\nbillion dollar merger and who has successfully defended Citibank in a \ncomplex leverage buy out case has also served in virtually every \nposition in the Girl Scouts. She has been a Brownie leader, troop \nconsultant, committee member, and for nine years, member of the \nNational Board of Directors of Girl Scouts of the USA and a member of \nthe Executive Committee. Even with her national commitments, Ms. \nMcKeown makes time for the girls themselves, leading her daughter, \nMegan's, Junior Girl Scout Troop #1091.\n  Ms. McKeown is active in other arenas as well. She volunteers in the \nschools, with YMCA, with the Children's Museum, and on abused children \nprojects. I want to point out something else special about Ms. McKeown: \nShe has received the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. That magazine \nseveral years ago named Ms. McKeown as one of the ``100 Women of \nPromise in America.''\n  Mr. President, Margaret McKeown is a highly-qualified lawyer with a \ndiverse background, who has demonstrated her commitment to community \nand family. Now, finally, after surviving the political and judicial \nbattles for two years, she will take her seat on the Ninth Circuit and \nbecome an outstanding judge. Congratulations, Margaret, we finally made \nit!\n  Mr. President, I also want to thank my colleagues for confirming Mr. \nShea this morning to serve on Washington's Eastern District Court. \nWhile Mr. Shea's road to confirmation has not been as filled with \nhurdles as Ms. McKeown's, it is a great pleasure to see this fine \nlawyer move onto the Federal bench.\n\n  Mr. Shea will make an excellent judge. He is a highly respected \nmember of the legal profession. He has served with distinction as a \ntrial lawyer, including national recognition as a Fellow of the \nAmerican College of Trial Lawyers.\n  The five superior court judges in Benton and Franklin counties, where \nMr. Shea has lived and practiced for more than 25 years, have written a \nletter describing him as having a ``well-earned reputation, not only in \nour community but throughout the Northwest, as an outstanding trial \nlawyer.'' His fellow Washington state lawyers honored him by electing \nhim president of the Washington State Bar Association, where he served \nwith distinction. Many of them have approached me to congratulate me on \nmy role in promoting Mr. Shea's judicial candidacy.\n  While we must look first to his legal qualifications, I believe the \nbest judges are those who have worked in their communities to make them \nbetter places. Mr. Shea is well-qualified in that arena, too. He has \nbeen an advocate of equal access to the law, volunteering and working \nto get free or reduced legal services to local organizations, such as \nthe March of Dimes, the Sexual Assault Response Center, and the Faith \nChristian Academy.\n  Mr. Shea also worked hard in an area nearest to my heart: education. \nHe pushed to improve access to education in his community by helping \nestablish a branch campus of the Washington State University in the \nTri-Cities. He too has been a stalwart supporter of the March of Dimes, \nrecently being named the Chapter Counsel of the Year by the national \nMarch of Dimes.\n  Mr. Shea is a well-respected member of the business community. He has \nthe unanimous support of the board of the Tri-City Industrial \nDevelopment Council. Mr. Shea has received two strongly-supportive \neditorials in the Tri-City Herald. Numerous members of the business \ncommunity have thanked me for championing his nomination.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Shea was selected by a bi-partisan Judicial Merit \nSelection Committee comprised of a diverse group of lawyers and \ncommunity leaders. I have faith in that selection process and believe \nMr. Shea will be an outstanding member of the Federal bar.\n  Let me close by saying a few words about judicial nominations and the \nprocess we have developed in Washington. As I travel around my state, \npeople ask me why we have so many judicial vacancies. I haven't been \nable to give them a good answer, but can only point to political one-\nupmanship as the culprit.\n\n[[Page S2695]]\n\n  After this morning, I can happily report we are finally moving \nforward and that two excellent judicial candidates have been confirmed.\n  Let me also add that while I have been the Senator of the same party \nas the President, I have invited and encouraged Senator Gorton to \nparticipate in judicial nominations. I recognize this is a tremendous \nbreak in tradition, but I know our citizens are best served when we \nwork together.\n  I intend to continue working with Senator Gorton to find the very \nbest and most able members of the Washington bar to recommend to \nPresident Clinton. I will fight to ensure our citizens have their day \nin court and that justice is not denied because nominations are \ndelayed.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the endorsement of my colleagues for Ms. \nMcKeown and Mr. Shea. There are many other qualified judges waiting to \nmove through the process. I urge the Senate to move quickly to hear and \nconfirm them so the crisis our judiciary faces will come to an end.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to applaud the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington State. Senator Murray has stated the reasons why the \nSenate voted the right way on Margaret McKeown and on Ed Shea. I would \nalso note for the record that the Senator from Washington has been \nextraordinarily diligent in working very hard for these two highly \nqualified nominees. I know the frustration she has felt with the delay, \nespecially on Margaret McKeown and with so many vacancies on the Ninth \nCircuit and given that this has been 2 years--in fact, 2 years this \nSunday.\n  This delay is the result of a process that has become a little bit \ncrazy. I commend the distinguished Senator, and I thank her for her \nhelp on this. I think it would have been impossible for us to be here \nfor this vote without her help, and I applaud her for that.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to congratulate the two \njudicial nominees from Washington state. The federal bench will be \nenriched by the addition of Margaret McKeown to the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals, as it will by Edward Shea's presence on federal district \ncourt for the Eastern District of Washington.\n  Both Margaret McKeown and Edward Shea are deservedly respected within \nthe legal community and in the community at large, and well qualified \nto perform the important jobs for which they have been chosen.\n  Ed Shea has been in private practice in Pasco, Washington for many \nyears. He has handled a wide range of cases, both civil and criminal, \nand his experience will have prepared him well for the job he's about \nto undertake. As testament to the respect he commands within the \nWashington legal community, Ed served as President of the Washington \nState Bar Association in 1996. Equally impressive as his commitment to \nhis profession is his commitment to his community. Over the years, he \nhas contributed his time and talent to a host of worthy causes, \nincluding the March of Dimes, the Tri-Cities Sexual Assault Response \nCenter, and the Association of Retarded Citizens.\n  Margaret McKeown also comes to the bench from private practice. She \nis a high technology litigator of national repute, with a particular \nexpertise in antitrust and intellectual property. She was also the \nfirst woman partner at the prestigious Seattle law firm, Perkins Coie, \nwhere she practices today. Her remarkable intellect, and the \naccomplishments that evidence speak to her ability to perform the job \nwith which she has been entrusted. There is no question that Margaret \nMcKeown is familiar with the law. But, as her statement to the \ngraduating class of the University of Washington Law School last year \nreflects, in this case familiarity did not breed contempt. Her mastery \nand understanding of the legal process rang through her commencement \naddress. As did her continued respect for the law. She also urged the \nnew lawyers to bear in mind her own formula for survival, a formula \ncomposed of five elements: humor, humility, hubris, humanity and home. \nThe formula is one that has made Margaret an excellent lawyer. I am \nconfident it will make her an excellent judge.\n  I thank my colleagues for joining me in supporting both of these \nnominees. And I congratulate them again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/27/senate-section/article/S2694-3", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2695-S2696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE NOMINATION OF MARGARET McKEOWN AND THE JUDICIAL EMERGENCY AMONG THE \n                       FEDERAL COURTS OF APPEALS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me speak a little bit about Margaret \nMcKeown. She was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee on a \nvote of 16 to 2. She has the support of Chairman Hatch, a number of \nRepublican Senators, is supported by both Senators from her State. Why \nthis was held up for 2 years, I cannot understand. And then she is \nconfirmed 80 to 11. How many of us have ever won an election with those \nkinds of percentages? Yet, apparently somebody held her up for 2 years \nbecause she was supposed to be controversial. How controversial is 80 \nto 11? Those are pretty good numbers. Perhaps her secret critics will \nexplain their views, the reason she has been held up for 2 years.\n  I have been urging action on judicial nominees for many months. This \nweek, faced with 5 continuing vacancies on a 13-member court, Chief \nJudge Winter of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit certified a ``judicial emergency'' and took the unprecedented \nstep of authorizing panels including only one Second Circuit judge and \ntwo visiting judges. In addition he has had to cancel hearings.\n  The Judiciary Committee has reported to the Senate the nomination of \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit, but that nomination \ncontinues to sit on the Senate calendar. This is another woman who has \nsat here and had to wait and wait and wait, while the Senate holds her \nup. Her nomination was received back in June 1997. She was finally \nfavorably reported by a committee vote of 16 to 2--pretty good odds. \nShe is strongly supported by both New York Senators, one Republican, \none Democrat. But the nomination continues to languish without \nconsideration. And three more Second Circuit nominees are pending \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, and await their confirmation hearings.\n\n  I mention the Second Circuit because that is my Circuit. It is the \nCircuit to which my State resides. I have been urging action on the \nnominees for this Circuit for many months. The Senate is failing in its \nobligations to the people of the Second Circuit--to the people of New \nYork, Connecticut and Vermont. We should call an end to this stall and \ntake action. We should consider the nomination of Judge Sotomayor. We \nshould do it today. We should hold hearings on the three other Second \nCircuit nominees next week and confirm them before the upcoming recess. \nOur delay is inflicting harm and giving proof to the warning that the \nChief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court gave in his 1997 Year End \nReport that continuing vacancies would harm the administration of \njustice. I urge the Republican leadership to proceed now.\n  Earlier this week, the distinguished majority leader indicated that \nhe feels he has proceeded too quickly with respect to judicial \nnominations. I strongly disagree. No reference to the number of judges \nthe Senate has begrudgingly confirmed over the past 2 years excuses the \ndelay on any of the nominees pending on the Senate Calendar. There is \nno excuse or justification for the judicial emergency the Senate is \ninflicting on the Second Circuit.\n  The distinguished majority leader says there is no clamor for Federal \njudges. I recognize that there are no vacancies on the Federal bench in \nMississippi, but there are numerous, longstanding vacancies in other \nplaces, vacancies that are harming the Federal administration of \njustice.\n  The people and businesses in the Second Circuit and other circuits \nand districts need additional Federal judges. Indeed, the Judicial \nConference of the United States recommends that in addition to the \nalmost 80 vacancies that need to be filled, the Congress authorize an \nadditional 55 judgeships throughout the country, as set forth in S.678, \nthe Federal Judgeship Act that I introduced last year.\n  Must we wait for the administration of justice to disintegrate \nfurther before the Senate will take this crisis seriously and act on \nthe judicial nominees pending before us? I hope not.\n  We are sworn to uphold the Constitution, we are sworn to uphold the \nlaws,\n\n[[Page S2696]]\n\nand we are paid pretty well to do that. We are failing our oath and we \nare failing the job the taxpayers of this country pay us to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/27/senate-section/article/S2695-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONFIRMATION OF EDWARD F. SHEA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted to see the Senate confirm Ed \nShea as a Federal District Judge. I attended his confirmation hearing \nback on February 4 and found him to be all that his supporters and \nfriends had said he would be. I know that he has the support of the \nSenators from the State of Washington. He also has the strong support \nof this Senator from Vermont. Ed Shea was nominated last September for \na vacancy that occurred in 1996, over 15 months ago. Mr. Shea was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee without dissent and without \nobjection. He was rated qualified for this position by the American Bar \nAssociation. I spoke of his nomination last week and am now delighted \nto see this nomination considered by the Senate.\n  With this confirmation the Senate will have acted favorably on only \n14 nominees this year. I am glad that Margaret McKeown is luck number \n13 and Ed Shea is number 14, but remain concerned for the other \nnominees who have been unlucky and remain stalled on the Senate \ncalendar.\n  I have tried to bring to the attention of the Republican leadership \nthe need to consider and confirm the two judicial nominees for District \nCourts in Illinois who have been languishing on the Senate calendar \nwithout action for the last five months.\n  It is time for the Senate to consider the nominations of Patrick \nMurphy and Judge Michael McCuskey. The Senate Judiciary Committee \nunanimously reported these two nominations to the full Senate on \nNovember 6, 1997. Their confirmation are desperately needed to help end \nthe vacancy crisis in the District Courts of Illinois.\n  Pat Murphy is an outstanding judicial nominee. He has practiced law \nin the State of Illinois for 20 years as a trial lawyer and tried about \n250 cases to verdict or judgment as sole counsel. During his legal \ncareer, Mr. Murphy has made an extensive commitment to pro bono \nservice--dedicating approximately 20 percent of his working time to \nrepresenting disadvantaged clients in his community. For instance, Pat \nMurphy has served as the court-appointed guardian to a disabled minor \nsince 1990, without taking any fee for his services. The American Bar \nAssociation recognized this extensive legal experience when it rated \nhim as qualified for this nomination. Mr. Murphy also served his \ncountry with distinction as a Marine during the Vietnam War.\n  Judge Michael McCuskey is also an outstanding judicial nominee. Judge \nMcCuskey served as a Public Defender for Marshall County in Lacon, IL \nfrom 1976 to 1988. In 1988, he left the Public Defender's office and \nthe law firm, Pace, McCuskey and Galley to sit on the bench in the 10th \nJudicial Circuit in Peoria, IL. He has served as a judge of the Third \nDistrict Appellate Court of Illinois since his election in 1990.\n  The American Bar Association recognized his stellar qualifications by \ngiving Judge McCuskey its highest rating of well-qualified for this \nnomination.\n  The mounting backlogs of civil and criminal cases in the dozens of \nemergency districts, in particular, are growing more critical by the \nday. This is especially true in the Central and Southern District \nCourts of Illinois, where these outstanding nominees will serve once \nthey are confirmed. Indeed, in the Southern District of Illinois, where \nPat Murphy will serve if his nomination is ever voted on by the full \nSenate, Chief Judge Gilbert has reported that his docket has been so \nburdened with criminal cases that he went for a year without having a \nhearing in a civil case. In 1996, 88 percent of the cases filed in all \nfederal trial courts were civil, while 12 percent were criminal. But in \nthe Southern District of Illinois, not one of those civil cases was \nheard by Chief Judge Gilbert.\n  The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court has called the \nrising number of vacancies ``the most immediate problem we face in the \nfederal judiciary.'' There is no excuse for the Senate's delay in \nconsidering these two fine nominees for Districts with judicial \nemergency vacancies.\n  I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of the \nPresident's judicial nominations to reconsider and to work with us to \nhave the Judiciary Committee and the Senate fulfil its constitutional \nresponsibility. Those who delay or prevent the filling of these \nvacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the \nadministration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, incarcerate the \nguilty or resolve civil disputes without judges.\n  I hope that the Majority Leader will soon set a date certain to \nconsider the nominations of G. Patrick Murphy and Judge Michael \nMcCuskey.\n  These nominees may well be a case in which a secret hold by one \nSenator is delaying Senate action. I recall receiving a Dear Colleague \nletter from the Majority Leader in January 1997, the first day of this \nCongress. In that letter he proposed to address the frustrations with \nthe hold system and what he termed ``a correction.'' The letter goes on \nto describe the hold as ``a request for notification of or protection \non an unanimous consent request or proposed time agreement.'' The \nMajority Leader advised a Senator placing a hold ``should understand \nthat he . . . may have to come to the floor to express his objection \nafter being notified of the intention to move the matter to which he \nobjects.''\n  I also recall last summer when the nomination of Joel Klein to be the \nAssistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division was a source of \nsome controversy. I recall then that the Majority Leader proceeded to \nconsideration of that nomination and allowed opponents to debate their \nconcerns and the Senate was able to proceed to a vote and to Mr. \nKlein's confirmation.\n  I hope that model will be utilized without further delay in \nconnection with the Murphy and McCuskey nominations. These nominees are \nstrongly supported by their home State Senators. Any Senator outside \nthose Districts who wishes to oppose, speak against or vote no for any \nreason or no reason is free to do so. What we need to find a way to \novercome is the veto of these nominations by a single Senator when a \nmajority of the United States Senate is prepared to confirm them.\n  We are falling farther and farther behind the pace the Senate \nestablished in the last nine weeks of last year. When the Chief Justice \nof the United States Supreme Court wrote in his 1997 Year End Report \nthat ``some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for \na . . . final floor vote'' he could have been referring to Patrick \nMurphy, Judge Michael McCuskey, Margaret McKeown and Judge Sonia \nSotomayor.\n  Nine months should be more than a sufficient time for the Senate to \ncomplete its review of these nominees. During the four years of the \nBush Administration, only three confirmations took as long as nine \nmonths. Last year, 10 of the 36 judges confirmed took nine months or \nmore and many took as long as a year and one-half. So far this year, \nJudge Ann Aiken, Judge Margaret Morrow, and Judge Hilda Tagle have \ntaken 21 months, 26 months and 31 months respectively. Margaret \nMcKeown's nomination has already been pending for 24 months. Judge \nSotomayor's nomination has already been pending for 9 months. Pat \nMurphy's and Judge McCuskey's nominations have already been pending for \n8 months. The average number of days to consider nominees used to be \nbetween 50 and 90, it rose last year to over 200 and this year stands \nat over 300 days from nomination to confirmation. That is too long and \ndoes a disservice to our Federal Courts.\n  I urge the Republican leadership to proceed to consideration of each \nof the judicial nominees pending on the Senate calendar without further \ndelay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/27/senate-section/article/S2696-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2696-S2698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SPECIAL PROSECUTOR STARR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, every week I wonder just what new step the \nspecial prosecutor, Mr. Starr, will find himself carrying out, and each \nweek it seems he does not disappoint.\n  One week, we will recall, a citizen had the temerity to ask why \nProsecutor Starr was using the results of an illegal wiretap, something \nthat had been reported in the press that, without a doubt, he was using \nan illegal--illegal--wiretap. This citizen had the audacity to question \nMr. Starr. Of course,\n\n[[Page S2697]]\n\nhe got slapped with a subpoena, had to spend as much money on a lawyer \nas he saved for a year's college tuition for one of his children and \nwas brought into the star chamber, the grand jury, and had to say why \nhe dared question the man behind the curtain.\n  This was probably as outrageous an abuse of prosecutorial discretion \nas anything I have seen in a while, but unlike prosecutors who are \nelected or Senators who are elected or people who are elected, Mr. \nStarr, the Republican prosecutor, does not have to respond to anybody, \nand he has an unlimited budget. He sent a very clear signal: ``If you \ndare question my use of illegal tactics, I'll stop you from questioning \nme, I'll make you spend so much money that you can't do it.'' And, of \ncourse, he has an unlimited amount of money himself so he can do that.\n  He then topped that outrageous activity by bringing Monica Lewinsky's \nmother before him and for day after day grilled her on things that her \ndaughter may have told her in confidence. So he set the precedent that \na prosecutor will have a mother in there for something that has nothing \nto do with violent crime or crime against the country or anything else \nand say, ``You have to tell us what your daughter told you.'' If your \ndaughter dares to confide in you, if your child dares to come to a \nparent and ask advice or confide in a parent, then Prosecutor Starr \nwill want to know what you said to your parent. This is in between \ngiving paid speeches to groups to talk about family values.\n  I was outraged as were many others. I have introduced a measure to \nlead to our reviewing the law on this point. On March 6, I introduced \nS.1721 to develop Federal prosecutorial guidelines to protect familial \nprivacy and parent-child communications in matters that do not involve \nallegations of violent conduct or drug trafficking. In addition, the \nlegislation would direct the Judicial Conference to undertake a study \nand then report whether the Federal Rules of Evidence should be amended \nexplicitly to recognize a parent-child privilege.\n  Then what was this week's latest outrage? As I said, I keep wondering \nhow he is going to top himself. He did this time by going to a \nbookstore and saying I want to know what books somebody was buying and \nreading. Now, the bookstore knows that this is an outrageous request, \nand the bookstore knows that people ought to be able to come into a \nbookstore, read anything they want, look at anything they want, buy \nanything they want without having Prosecutor Starr and his henchmen \ncome right in behind them and see what they read.\n  The bookstore had it made very clear to them by Prosecutor Starr and \nhis henchmen that ``If you want to fight this, you are going to have to \nsell one heck of a lot of books to pay the lawyers. You probably won't \nsell enough books this year to pay what we will cost you for defending \nthe rights of your customers.''\n  Prosecutor Starr doesn't have to worry because he has already spent \n$40 million of what we, the taxpayers, have given him, with no end in \nsight. So he can tell that bookstore, ``Go ahead, make my day, you go \non in and try to fight this. I'll bankrupt you. I'll just grind you \ndown into the ground.''\n  So now there is this idea, Mr. President, that everyone has to think \nif they go into a bookstore, ``Am I going to have a subpoena in there \nto see what I read or don't read?''\n  I remember when Judge Bork was before the U.S. Senate for \nconfirmation. Somebody came into the Senate Judiciary Committee and \nsaid, ``We have a list of what Robert Bork has been renting from video \nstores.'' I was so incensed that anybody would do that, I introduced \nlegislation to make it illegal to give out the lists of what people \nrented in a video store. To make it bipartisan, my good friend Alan \nSimpson, the distinguished Republican whip and a conservative \nRepublican, joined me on that, and we passed the Leahy-Simpson bill. \nWhat we said in the Leahy-Simpson bill is that it is nobody's business \nwhat you rent for videos, and I think the American people agreed with \nus.\n\n  The difference is we had Democrats standing up for the rights of a \nRepublican nominee in that instance and all Americans. Now, of course, \nwe have a Republican prosecutor who says it doesn't make any difference \nto him, ``I want to know what you are reading.'' Are we going to start \nwith people following us through a video store now and say, ``Well, we \ncan't tell you what he rented, but we know he glanced over at one of \nthe R-rated videos.''\n  Or are they going to follow us into the library and say, ``He read \nChaucer's `Canterbury Tales,' and you know what they say.'' Actually \nmost people don't, because they never bothered to read it in an English \nclass--but they think something unseemly may be in there.\n  Or, ``He read `Catcher in the Rye.' '' Woo-wee, there is going to be \na field day.\n  If Prosecutor Starr followed me through a bookstore, he is going to \nfind me reading everything from ``Angela's Ashes'' to ``Batman.'' He \ncan have a lot of fun with this. ``Angela's Ashes'' talks about Frank \nMcCourt going into the library and reading dictionaries, where he \nlooked up words that his parents wouldn't tell him the meaning of. Of \ncourse, ``Batman'' is a guy who runs around in a suit with a mask on. \nNow, that is going to kind of raise some questions.\n  What about the person who goes into a magazine store to buy Time or \nNewsweek magazine, but they may have slowed down by the magazines that \nhad pictures of unclothed people or certain sports magazines with their \nswimsuit editions?\n  Or what about this--here is something for Prosecutor Starr to look \nat--check the person who has an average income who goes into the \nmagazine store and picks up the magazine with expensive sports cars \nthat they couldn't possibly afford. They are reading about Ferraris, \nMaseratis and Porsches. Maybe we better subpoena that person's bank \naccounts; maybe we better check him out. Why would they be reading \nabout a Maserati and a Ferrari if they only make $40,000 a year? \nSomething is going on here.\n  New Englanders have asked during witch hunts whether there is any \nsense of decency. Let's get a grip.\n  If, as Mr. Starr has indicated in his activities with the Paula Jones \nattorneys and with other groups, that he wants to get rid of the \nPresident of the United States who was elected twice--fine, let him \njust come forward and say so. Just say, ``Look, I want him out of \noffice; I will do anything possible to get him out of office,'' and \nmaybe people will understand. But let us at least realize the damaging \nprecedents that are being set.\n  Are we going to have thought control? Are we really going to go to \nthe point where we ask people what they read, what they see? Are we \ngoing to next ask, ``Well, what newspapers do you read?'' It is not \nenough to ask what newspaper do you read, ``What sections of the \nnewspaper do you read? I mean, do you read the sports section or the \nbusiness section? Do you read the comic page or the gossip page? Do you \nread the front page or the obituaries, and why those obituaries, what \nwere you looking for?''\n  We Americans have a sense of privacy. We ought to be able to read \nanything we want. We ought to be able to look at what we want. We \nshouldn't have to worry that a prosecutor is going to come in and, \nbasically, threaten a bookstore with bankruptcy if they don't tell you \nwhat their customers read or buy.\n  Just as Senator Simpson and I passed a law so people couldn't ask \nJudge Bork or any other nominee what videos they rent, we ought to be \nprotecting what people read. This is America. This is not some \ntotalitarian, thought-controlled country.\n  So let us have a sense of right and wrong. Frankly, this Vermonter \nfinds the idea of asking bookstores what books their patrons read or \nbuy, wrong. I find it chilling, I find it frightening, and I hope that \nthe press and everybody else will consider it. I hope they will, \nbecause if they can ask what books you read, they can ask what \nnewspapers you read, what television news programs you watch or radio \nstations you listen to. It is all one in the same.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S2698]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recall the contributions \nmade to Alabama and the Nation by Roy Johnson, the district attorney \nfor the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Alabama. Roy's untimely death on \nFebruary 11, 1998, at age 49, cut short his career and deprived his \nwife Anita, his son Matthew, and his daughter Gabrielle of a loving and \ndevoted husband and father.\n  Roy was the friend of thousands, and I was pleased to call him a \npersonal friend. In addition, I knew him well as a professional \nprosecutor with whom I worked on a regular basis during the years I \nserved as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama.\n  Service to his country as a Marine captain demonstrated his love for \ncountry, but it also caused him to develop, during his service time, a \nform of hepatitis that damaged his liver and which ultimately resulted \nin his having to undergo a liver transplant operation.\n  There were high hopes for the success of the operation. He seemed to \nbe doing well when there occurred a sudden turn for the worst, and Roy \nwas gone.\n  After nearly 18 years of service to Bibb, Dallas, Hale, Perry and \nWilcox Counties, Roy had made plans to retire from his post as district \nattorney and to commence the practice of law with his brother Robert W. \n``Robin'' Johnson II in his beloved hometown of Marion. And they also \nhave law offices in Birmingham and Washington, DC.\n  I am pleased today, Mr. President, that his brother Robin is here \ntoday to hear these remarks about my good friend, his brother, Roy \nJohnson. As his long-time chief assistant, Ed Greene said, ``Everything \nseemed so bright for him.'' His death was truly a shock to me and to \nmany.\n  Roy had great pride in his circuit and the people in it. He loved \nthem deeply. He worked tirelessly on their behalf. The fourth judicial \ncircuit is located in the heart of Alabama's Black Belt region--a \nbeautiful area of the State in which the people know not only their \nneighbors, but they know the grandparents and grandchildren of their \nneighbors.\n  E.T. Rolison, Jr., supervisory U.S. attorney in Mobile, AL, noted, \n``Roy did as much for law enforcement coordination as anyone I have \n[ever] seen in my 25 years with this office.'' And this was a high \ncompliment from Mr. Rolison, who served for many years in the U.S. \nattorney's office and worked hard to further coordination between \nlocal, State and Federal law enforcement agencies.\n  Mr. Barron Lankster, himself a district attorney in nearby Marengo \nCounty, and an African American, noted that he had commenced his career \nin Roy's office. Mr. Lankster said, ``He fully integrated his office \nwhen he took over and treated everyone fairly and equitably.''\n  A graduate of Tulane University and the University of Alabama School \nof Law, Roy was prepared intellectually and professionally for the \nbroad demands of his work. He loved history and he loved the wonderful \nAntebellum home in which he lived. The home was located right on the \nparade grounds at Marion Military Institute, an excellent military \nschool. MMI, along with Judson College, have played a key role in \nmaking the town of Marion an extraordinary academic and intellectual \ncommunity.\n  Roy's love and support for Marion Military Institute was deep and \nlongstanding. Certainly, his career in the U.S. Marines helped shape \nhis belief that we must have a strong national defense. I remember with \ndelight the occasion when Roy's fellow marine, Col. Ollie North, was \nunder great attack in Washington. This was before Colonel North's \nrebuttal that turned the tables on his accusers a bit. But Roy spoke \nout for him then. He served with him in the Marines, and he spoke up at \na time of great unpopularity. I congratulated him later when it turned \nout that Colonel North had turned the tables a bit on that \ncircumstance. He stood by his friends. He was indeed forever true.\n  During the mid-1980s, we worked together on the prosecution of three \nindividuals for voter fraud in Perry County. The prosecution caused a \ngreat deal of furor locally and nationally. During that time I came to \nappreciate Roy's cool head, his innate decency, his legal skills, and \nhis character.\n  Despite political pressure, this marine never wavered. He stood firm \nfor what he believed to be right, and did so in a fair and just manner. \nThe bond which we developed in that case was never broken.\n  There is much more that can be said about this educated, caring, \nfair, strong, loyal and kind son of the South. Certainly he was big in \nstature and big in spirit.\n  I am confident that if we were able to accomplish a fully accurate \nanalysis of the many contributions he made to his judicial circuit and \nhis region, the most significant would be his skill and determination \nduring a period of rapid social change. He helped provide equal justice \nto all and conducted himself and his office in a manner that reflected \nfairness to everyone.\n  His leadership and his strength of character provided a framework \nwhich allowed for the development of harmonious relations between the \nraces. Sometimes there would be periods of good feeling and sometimes \nthere would be periods of tension and conflict. But whatever the \nsituation, Roy stood firm and strong for justice and contributed \nmightily to the historic changes that have taken place in this region.\n  Roy loved Marion. He loved the Black Belt and the people who lived \nthere and the people he represented. I know he is pleased that his \nstrong and effective chief deputy, Ed Greene, in whom he placed such \ntrust over the years, has been appointed to complete his term. I have \nthe greatest respect for Ed's ability and have enjoyed working with him \nover the years, and I compliment Governor Fob James for his wise \nappointment.\n  I have been honored to know Roy Johnson. He was a superior public \nservant, an outstanding prosecutor. And I thank the Chair for allowing \nme to place these remarks upon the record and to express my sincerest \nsympathy to his fine family for the great loss they have suffered.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, a few comments on another subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/27/senate-section/article/S2698-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2698-S2699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SPECIAL PROSECUTOR KENNETH STARR'S INVESTIGATION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, another Senator in this body made some \nvery strong criticisms of the special prosecutor, Mr. Ken Starr. Judge \nStarr was appointed to that office some time ago. In recent months he \nwas asked to continue his investigation into matters involving the \nMonica Lewinsky situation and to the possible obstruction of justice.\n  It happened this way: Mr. Starr presented information to the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, Janet Reno. He told her about the \ncircumstances and what he knew and the evidence that had been obtained. \nShe agreed that a special prosecutor should be appointed. They then \nwent to a three-judge court, and the three-judge court, as the law \nrequires--Federal judges, all with lifetime appointments, above \npolitics--those three judges commissioned Kenneth Starr to be an \ninvestigator of this circumstance. He, therefore, has been directed by \na court. He accepted that responsibility. As a result of that, he has a \nduty to perform.\n  Now, Mr. President, I know that the Chair has served, himself, as \nattorney general of the great State of Missouri. I have served as \nattorney general of Alabama. And I served almost 12 years as a Federal \nprosecutor, a U.S. attorney. I have prosecuted a great many public \ncorruption cases, fraud cases, white-collar-crime cases. They are not \neasy. The people who have committed those kinds of crimes do not desire \nthat they should be caught. They do not make it easy that they should \nbe apprehended. It would be their preference to be able to get away \nwith whatever they may have committed.\n  Now, many say Ken Starr as special prosecutor has a duty or \nresponsibility to get someone. I assure you, that is not true. I assure \nyou, with all confidence, because I have served in the Department of \nJustice with Mr. Starr and I know his reputation, that he has\n\n[[Page S2699]]\n\nabsolutely no desire to get anyone. But he has been commissioned, he \nhas been given a mandate, he has been given a responsibility to find \nout what the facts are. Sometimes that requires issuing subpoenas. If \nyou do not get the facts, you have not conducted an investigation, and \nyou have violated your responsibility and the requirements that have \nbeen given to you. If you do not interview the secretary sitting \noutside the office about what went on there, what kind of investigation \nis that? What kind of investigation is that? That would be like no \ninvestigation at all.\n  What about this circumstance--some say that his attempt to question \nthe mother of Miss Lewinsky is somehow wrong. Congress makes the laws \nof the United States. I was a prosecutor for nearly 17 years. I know \nhow the law is written. There is no grant of immunity or protection for \na mother for confidentiality of communications under these \ncircumstances. It is not there.\n\n  If the Senator from Vermont or other Senators in this body want to \nchange the Federal law to create a protection for that, let them \nintroduce the legislation. Let us have it out right here. Let us \ndiscuss it. But that is not the law.\n  So we have, in the special prosecutor, an individual who is supposed \nto gather the evidence he can legally gather. Presumably he believes \nthe mother of this young lady has information that she ought to give, \nand he has every right to ask for it. In fact, to fail to ask for that \ninformation would be a failure of the responsibility that has been \ngiven to him by the courts and laws of this country.\n  There are a lot of other things being said, such as why would you dig \ninto his books? I saw a report recently about an individual who was \ncharged with poisoning someone. This is not hypothetical but it is an \nexample, I think, of why subpoenas sometimes are issued. Under the \nsubpoena the authorities discovered and uncovered a book the individual \nhad describing how to make poisons.\n  I had an occasion to personally prosecute, a number of years ago, a \ndoctor. He was the subject of two national television movies and a \nbook. In the course of that, we discovered a book that he had on deadly \npoisons and how to commit murder. It was relevant to our case, and it \nwas introduced in the case.\n  So I do not know what it is that Mr. Starr issued that subpoena for. \nHe cannot defend himself. He cannot run in here and say, ``Oh, Senator, \nlet me tell you why we did that. Your remarks are unkind. They're \nunfair. I had a specific reason for issuing that subpoena. Let me tell \nyou what it is.'' He can't do that. So he is a victim of these kinds of \ncomplaints by those who want to undermine his ability to do the job he \nhas been commissioned to do.\n  I am really troubled by this. I am very, very troubled that we in \nthis body, and, in fact, the President of the United States of America \nand his staff, are systematically trying to intimidate and undermine \nthe legal and moral authority of the commissioned special prosecutor. \nTo my knowledge, that has never happened before in our country.\n  If there is nothing to hide, why not let him do his job? They say, \nwhy doesn't he finish? If they would be more forthcoming, he would have \nalready been finished. How can you finish when people refuse to give \ntestimony? They claim executive privilege and therefore make you go to \ncourt to obtain court orders, which takes months to get, to argue over \nthese issues.\n  The President committed early on that he would be forthcoming, that \nhe would give all the evidence, and the truth should come out. But, as \nso often occurs with this President, we are finding that not to be the \ncase.\n  Mr. President, I will just conclude and say that, if nothing else, we \nneed to respect the rule of law. That great hymn, ``Our Liberty is in \nLaw,'' that is the American form of government. We respect the rule of \nlaw. We do not use political power or other efforts to undermine that \nrule. We trust our system to work. We have multiple opportunities to \nappeal if the system goes awry at any stage. Ultimately we have to \naccept that. And if we respect it and give ourselves to it with \nintegrity and ability, I think we can get just results.\n  We may not ever know the full truth in this circumstance. That is not \nMr. Starr's responsibility. Mr. Starr's responsibility is to get as \nmuch truth as he can get. He can find the truth within the rule of law. \nSo it is really discouraging to me to see when a subpoena is issued to \nany institution for a specific piece of information, it is to be \ncompared to some fishing expedition. Because I assure you, that is not \ntrue. I assure you that that subpoena would not be issued unless there \nwas a sound basis for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/27/senate-section/article/S2698-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this President has not defended his \nactions on the basis that this is a private matter; ``it is something \nbetween me and my wife and consenting adults,'' and that sort of \nthing. He has denied these allegations flat out, and he has placed in \ndispute, under oath, contradicting statements.\n\n  So now we have a mess in this country, and it is a direct result of \nthe actions of the President of the United States. He has gotten \nhimself in a situation in which his statements directly contradicts \nthat of other people's statements, under oath. That is a matter that is \nnot going away lightly.\n  I will say what is offensive to me and is of concern to me: He has \nembroiled the Office of the Presidency in this matter. He has used the \npower, the staff, the people of his office to defend himself and to \nentwine them into this affair. He has, therefore, during the course of \nthis activity, in my opinion as one Senator--and I had no intention to \nspeak this morning on this subject, but it has been troubling me for a \nlong time--I think he has dishonored the Presidency in that regard. He \nhas not handled it properly. I wish it were not so. It is not good for \nthis country. It is not the right thing for us to have to be going \nthrough today.\n  There is no one who has any responsibility for it but the President. \nIf he thinks he can go around and claim that is the fault of the person \nwho has been commissioned by an objective Federal court to investigate \nhis activities instead of the President--that is what he is \nsuggesting--then that is not accurate. I am very troubled by this \nmatter.\n  I think what we need to do is simply to allow the special prosecutor \nto do his job. He may well find there is evidence of wrongdoing. He may \nfind there is no evidence of wrongdoing. He may find there might be \nsome evidence of wrongdoing but there is insufficient proof to bring \ncharges. I don't know what will happen. I hope we get it over with. I \nhope the President will cooperate. But I think we need to be respectful \nof the legal process in this country and not attempt to undermine it, \nbecause we don't undermine a part of it without undermining all of it.\n  Every day, by a prosecutor in America, young people are being tried \nfor drug offenses and other offenses, and they have to accept the \nworkings of that system. Police accept the workings of that system. \nMothers and fathers accept the workings of that system when their \nchildren are charged with a crime. It is a painful, horrible, difficult \ntime for all, but we have to respect the rule of law. I am very, very \ntroubled by those who, in my opinion, make comments and suggestions to \ntry to attack an investigation and, in effect, undermine the law by \npolitical power and political influence. This should not happen. I \nthink it is a matter we need to talk more about in this body.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/27/senate-section/article/S2699-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2699-S2701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            REVISING OUR NUCLEAR STRATEGY AND FORCE POSTURE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, over the course of the last several \nmonths, I have come to the Senate floor 3 times now to discuss this \nnation's nuclear strategy and forces in the post-cold-war era. In each \nof those previous statements, I made the central point that I perceive \na growing mismatch between our strategy and forces and the\n\n[[Page S2700]]\n\nreal world considerations they were designed to address. I also used \nthese opportunities to indicate several practical steps I thought we \ncould take immediately to correct this growing imbalance.\n  I come to the floor today, not to amend my previous observations, but \nrather to provide new, more compelling evidence to buttress my earlier \nconclusions.\n  Let me reiterate the context of this debate.\n  First, despite the end of the cold war nearly 7 years ago, the United \nStates and Russia together still field roughly 14,000 strategic nuclear \nweapons--each with a destructive power tens or hundreds of times \ngreater than the nuclear devices that brought World War II to a close. \nThe closest rival, friend or foe, has less than 500 strategic weapons.\n  Second, both the United States and Russia continue to keep roughly \n5,000 of their strategic nuclear weapons on a high level of alert, \nready to be launched at a moment's notice.\n  Third, the United States and Russia continue to adhere to an overall \nstrategic concept known as mutual assured deterrence or MAD. In \naddition, each side follows operational concepts that permit the first \nuse of nuclear weapons and allow for the launch of weapons after \nreceiving warning of attack but before the incoming warheads detonate.\n  This set of facts is disconcerting to say the least. It has led the \nNational Academy of Sciences, in an excellent report entitled ``The \nFuture of U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy,'' to conclude that:\n\n       The basic structure of plans for using nuclear weapons \n     appears largely unchanged from the situation during the Cold \n     War, with both sides apparently continuing to emphasize early \n     and large counterforce strikes . . . As a result, the dangers \n     of initiation of nuclear war by error or by accident remain \n     unacceptably high.\n\n  This same set of circumstances moved General Lee Butler, who just 4 \nyears ago as a former commander of the Strategic Command was \nresponsible for setting U.S. policy for deterring a nuclear war and, if \ndeterrence failed, fighting such a war, to observe that, ``our present \npolicies, plans and postures governing nuclear weapons make us \nprisoners still to an age of intolerable danger.''\n  Mr. President, I agree with the National Academy of Sciences and \nGeneral Lee Butler. Our strategic nuclear forces are too large for the \npost-cold-war period, and our operational procedures carry an \nunacceptable level of risk.\n  What are the practical ramifications of this assessment? I have \nconcluded that the United States should seek an agreement to \ndramatically cut these forces and change the way they are operated. \nMutually agreed upon and significant reductions in the numbers of \nstrategic nuclear weapons are in the best interests of the United \nStates. Mutually agreed upon changes in how we operate our forces and \nsystems will increase trust and reduce pressure to launch nuclear \nweapons on a moment's notice.\n  As I noted earlier, I have held these views for some time and have \nseen nothing to convince me otherwise. To the contrary, recent events \nhave only served to strengthen my convictions.\n  In particular, I am referring to an excellent two-part series from \nlast week's Washington Post entitled, ``Shattered Shield: The Decline \nof Russia's Nuclear Forces,'' and a study released last Friday by the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  The main conclusion reached in the Washington Post series is that \nRussia's nuclear forces and its early warning and command and control \nsystems suffer from a lack of resources that jeopardizes their very \nexistence.\n  According to these articles, knowledgeable experts in the United \nStates and Russia have concluded that, ``regardless of whether the \nUnited States and Russia move ahead on bilateral arms-control treaties, \na decade from now Russia's forces will be less than one-tenth the size \nthey were at the peak of Soviet power.'' Russia's strategic nuclear \narsenal is expected to decline from a cold war high of nearly 11,000 \nweapons in 1990 to a low of roughly 1,000 by 2007--less than 10 years \nfrom now. As evidence, experts point to growing number of Russia's \nnuclear-powered submarines piled up in port unfit for patrol, her \nstrategic bombers incapable of combat, and a steady deterioration of \nher land-based missile force.\n  In addition, they note that Russia is dedicating few resources to \naddress this decline by developing new strategic systems.\n  In short, Russia's strategic triad could cease to exist within the \nnext 10 years.\n  If forecasts about this decline are correct, as I and most experts \nbelieve, this turn of events presents an opportunity for U.S. and \nRussian policymakers to immediately push for much deeper joint \nreductions than currently contemplated under START II or even the START \nIII framework. If the Russians are headed downward, now is the time to \nlock them in on significantly lower levels.\n  If we fail to reach an agreement with the Russians on lower levels, \nfuture Russian governments will be free to act unencumbered by strict \nand verifiable limits. Fewer Russian nuclear weapons will reduce the \nthreat this nation faces from intentional, accidental or unauthorized \nlaunch. Fewer U.S. nuclear weapons will still allow us to effectively \ndeter any adversary and makes sense in the post-cold-war environment.\n  In addition, this Post series highlighted a troubling development. \nRussia's systems designed to give it warning of an attack and command \nand control of its nuclear forces are facing the same precipitous \ndecline as its nuclear forces for the same reason--lack of resources.\n  Russia has lost access to many radar sites located on the territory \nof newly independent states while its system of satellites for \ndetecting missile launches is slowly being depleted. According to one \nformer Russian air defense officer, ``Russia is partially blind.'' And \nthe situation is no better with respect to its command and control \nstructure. About a year ago, then Defense Minister Igor Rodionov \nobserved, ``no one today can guarantee the reliability of our control \nsystems. . . . Russia might soon reach the threshold beyond which its \nrockets and nuclear systems cannot be controlled.''\n  These developments should not cause anyone in this country to \nrejoice. Russian problems with their early warning and command and \ncontrol systems can very quickly become our problem. Russian inability \nto correctly assess whether a missile has been launched or to properly \ncontrol all of its nuclear weapons puts our national security at risk. \nAll of this is compounded by the fact that both sides continue to \nmaintain excessively large numbers of nuclear weapons at excessively \nhigh levels of alert.\n  It is in our interest to reduce Russia's dependence on these aging \nsystems. This can best be done by changing the way the U.S. and Russia \noperate their forces. Each country should lower the number of weapons \non hair-trigger alert, and the United States should consider sharing \nearly warning intelligence with the Russians.\n  A final piece of evidence to back up my conclusions surfaced late \nlast week. The Congressional Budget Office, in a study carried out at \nmy request, concluded that the Pentagon spends between $20 and $30 \nbillion annually to maintain and operate our current level of nuclear \nweapons--roughly 7,000 deployed strategic weapons and between 500 and \n1,000 tactical weapons.\n  Moreover, if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to \nreject the advice of many outside experts and prevent us from even \nreducing to the Senate-ratified START II level of 3,500 strategic \nweapons, CBO estimates this shortsightedness will cost the Pentagon \nnearly $1 billion a year in constant 1998 dollars.\n  If the Pentagon is forced to stay at these excessive nuclear weapons \nlevels, the Defense Department must dump a billion dollars a year on \nunneeded systems, thereby depriving much more worthy Defense Department \nprograms of much needed resources.\n  If the Pentagon were allowed to follow a more rational course, this \nfunding could be used to enhance the housing of our military personnel, \nto improve their quality of life, to increase their readiness and to \narm them with the most sophisticated conventional weaponry available. \nIf we are forced to stay on our current track, we will do none of \nthese.\n\n[[Page S2701]]\n\n  Incidentally, CBO noted that if we were to reduce down to the level \nthe Russians are expected to reach shortly, roughly 1,000 strategic \nnuclear weapons, the savings could reach as high as $2.5 billion \nannually.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I stand by the conclusions I stated in my \nprevious statements on this subject. Our current strategic nuclear \npolicy and force posture is outmoded and in need of major and immediate \nreassessment. The only change in the intervening period since my first \naddress on this subject is the emergence of new information that has \nstrengthened my case and heightened the sense of urgency on this issue.\n  As the Washington Post series points out, we have an opportunity and \na responsibility to act quickly to change both our policy and our \nforces.\n  The decline in Russian nuclear forces provides an ideal opportunity \nfor us to make significant progress on the arms reduction front. The \ndeterioration of Russia's early warning and command and control systems \ncompels us to seek ways to reduce the unnecessary level of risk brought \nabout by how we operate our forces. Finally, CBO's study demonstrates \nthere is a financial cost from inaction as well. Our current defense \nposture forces the Pentagon to divert billions of dollars of scarce \nresources from more needed and important defense programs.\n  Mr. President, now is the time to step into the future. We must \ndramatically reduce the levels of nuclear weapons and the associated \nrisk levels.\n  If we act in this manner, we will greatly reduce the risks of nuclear \nwar, enhance our conventional force capabilities, and improve our own \nnational security.\n  Mr. President, acknowledging the presence of the distinguished Chair \nof the Senate Budget Committee, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to object to the Clinton \nadministration's continual, I would say, anti-Israel position, but \ncertainly the anti-Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu position. \nPresident Clinton, during the 1996 Israeli election, was very involved, \nand he was very involved in favor of the Labor candidate.\n  U.S. News & World Report quoted an aide in the White House saying:\n\n       If he could get away with it, Clinton would wear a ``Peres \n     for Prime Minister'' button.\n\n  He was very involved in the election. His candidate didn't win. Since \nthen, we have seen more anti-Netanyahu, or anti-Israel, statements from \nthe administration that bothers this Senator.\n  Yesterday there was a report in the paper that the United States was \npressuring Israel to give up more of the West Bank. And I am wondering \nwhere my colleagues were. I remember when they thought that the Bush \nadministration--and particularly Jim Baker--was putting pressure on \nIsrael. They objected very strongly. They spoke out very strongly \nagainst that coercion.\n  This administration has repeatedly tried to put pressure on Mr. \nNetanyahu, or repeatedly snubbed the Prime Minister of Israel, our best \nally in the region, the only democracy in the region, and they have \nalmost resorted to a philosophy of, Well, we are going to use snub \ndiplomacy. As a matter of fact, an administration official was quoted \nin the Washington Post as calling the Clinton Administration's actions \ntowards Mr. Netanyahu as snub diplomacy.\n  There was an incident in November of last year where both planes--the \nPresident's plane and Netanyahu's plane--were adjacent to each other, \nand yet President Clinton couldn't find time to meet with him. This \nyear, in January, Mr. Netanyahu was scheduled to be here in \nWashington--I will read something that was in the January 20 edition of \nthe Washington Post:\n\n       Having declined to find time for Netanyahu in November, \n     even as the aircraft parked nose to tail at Los Angeles \n     International Airport, Clinton is continuing what one \n     administration official described as a deniable but obvious \n     pattern of ``snub diplomacy.'' Today's schedule includes no \n     breaking of bread, no visit to the Blair House, no joint \n     public appearance, no touch at all of the usual warmth that \n     greets Israeli leaders on visits of state.\n\n  The Washington Post article includes this telling quote from an \nadministration official:\n\n       We are treating him like the President of Bulgaria, who is \n     arriving to a modest reception on February 10. Actually, I \n     think Clinton will go jogging with the President of Bulgaria. \n     So that is not fair.\n\n  I am embarrassed by this.\n  Then there was a snub by the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, \nwhen she returned to Israel in February and expressed publicly that she \nwas ``sick and tired'' of the positions taken by both sides in the \npeace process. I can understand why she might be upset at the \nPalestinians, after they continued to embrace violence and refused to \nchange their national charter--which they have agreed to do on at least \nthree previous occasions--that calls for the destruction of Israel, \nwhen the Palestinians have yet to reduce the size of their police \nforce, as again they have agreed to do. And when the Palestinians \nwalked away from the bargaining table when Israel was more than willing \nto work out problems encountered by the first phase of the troop \nredeployment. But to criticize Israel--for what? They have complied. \nThe Palestinians didn't comply, but yet our Secretary of State treats \nthem as equals.\n\n  In the meetings that I alluded to before, the administration went to \ngreat lengths in January to give the same amount of attention--which is \nvery little--to Mr. Netanyahu as it did to Mr. Arafat.\n  I might mention that Mr. Arafat, not long before, was embracing one \nof the leaders of Hamas who was directly responsible for terrorism and \nviolence and death on innocent women and children in the Middle East--\nembracing him. Yet they were treating Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat as \nequals.\n  Then the administration remained silent when Mr. Arafat on February \n13 was quoted as saying the ``peace negotiators achieved nothing, \nnothing, nothing.'' And then he goes on a little bit further. I will \nread this. It says:\n\n       Reuters reported the same day that Mr. Arafat stated, ``We \n     declared the Palestinian state in Algiers in 1988, and we \n     will declare it again in 1999 over our Palestinian land, \n     despite those who wish it wouldn't happen, and whoever \n     doesn't like it may drink from the Gaza Sea or the Dead Sea. \n     We have made the greatest intifada. We can erase those years \n     and start all over again.''\n\n  As a matter of fact, Mr. Arafat said he was going to cross out the \npeace agreements and unleash a new uprising against Israel.\n  Mr. President, to me those hardly seem to be the words of a man, who \nis really interested in peace.\n  Did the administration criticize him for those kind of remarks? Not \nto my knowledge. As a matter of fact, we searched to see if there was \nany response from the State Department for\n\n[[Page S2702]]\n\nany criticism for such unacceptable comments. There was nothing.\n  Did they condemn him for those kinds of outlandish statements? No. \nDid they criticize him for not complying with the peace accord that he \nagreed to? No.\n  Now we find the administration dragging its feet to fulfill the \ncommitment that Congress has made--by a bipartisan, overwhelming vote \nin Congress--to move our Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. What has \nthe administration done? Absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing. Have \nthey spent any money for site selection? Or have they done anything to \nmake it happen that we would move our Embassy, as Congress called for, \nwhich we are supposed to be doing next year? The answer is no. This \nadministration has done nothing in that regard.\n  Now, what has the administration done? In yesterday's paper, the \nWashington Post, it is reported that President Clinton decided in \nprinciple to unveil an American peacemaking package that the Israeli \nGovernment categorically rejects. The article reports that the Clinton \nplan will require Israel to withdraw its troops from about 13 percent \nof the West Bank, calls for a time-out on Jewish settlements and \nincludes unspecified steps by the Palestinians to address Israeli \nsecurity concerns. In other words, the administration is trying to \ndictate to Israel, that yes, you have to give up more land. Our policy, \never since the recreation and recognition of the state of Israel in \n1948, has always been to say that Israel has the right--not the United \nStates--to guarantee the security of its land and its people. Yet, this \nadministration is trying to put pressure on Israel.\n  Are they putting pressure on the Palestinians for not living up to \ntheir commitments? For the third time, Mr. Arafat signs a document and \nsays they will eliminate in their charter the section calling for the \ndestruction of Israel. They have not done it yet. Why aren't they \ncalling on the Palestinians to comply? Instead they put more pressure \non Israel to give up more land.\n  I think it is unconscionable that the United States would use our \nforce, our leadership, our power, and our prestige to try to dictate to \nIsrael that they must give up land that might jeopardize its security. \nI think that is a mistake. This administration has been doing it, \ncertainly, ever since Mr. Netanyahu's election. They have not treated \nhim with the respect that I think he should be accorded as the elected \nleader of Israel. Instead, this administration seems to think, we \nweren't happy with the election, so we are going to undermine Mr. \nNetanyahu. I resent that.\n  I don't think this President of the United States, or any President \nof the United States, should be getting involved in Israeli politics \nand trying to influence elections, as this President did in 1996. Now \nhe is putting continued pressure on the Netanyahu administration and \nIsrael as a country to try to compel or force it to give up additional \nlands, which might jeopardize its security. Who should make the \ndecision whether it jeopardizes Israel's security, the United States or \nIsrael? Frankly, I think it should be Israel. They are a sovereign \nnation, and they have the right to defend themselves and to protect \nthemselves. They are willing to engage in the peace process, and that \ntakes two sides to comply. Yes, we can cajole people or encourage \nparticipation and compliance. We have encouraged participation, but we \nhaven't encouraged compliance. The Palestinians have not complied with \nthe peace process. They have not done what they said they were going to \ndo on several occasions. So the administration should direct their \npressure, their leverage, their leadership on the Palestinians, and \nparticularly Mr. Arafat, to comply and stop this snub diplomacy, and \ndiplomacy by dictating, on a plan that is going to be released, what we \nthink is best, regardless of Israel's security needs.\n  Mr. President, I hope this administration will have a change in \npolicy, in its attitude, and towards the way it has treated Israel over \nthe last 3 years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a March 26, 1998, Washington Post \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, March 26, 1998]\n\n U.S. to Push Peace Plan Israel Rejects--Split With Jerusalem Grows On \n                          West Bank Withdrawal\n\n                          (By Barton Gellman)\n\n       Convinced that flagging Israeli-Palestinian talks are near \n     collapse and already doing substantial harm to U.S. regional \n     interests, President Clinton has decided in principle to \n     unveil an American peacemaking package tha the Israeli \n     government categorically rejects, according to senior \n     policymakers.\n       Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has yet to commit to the \n     proposal, but he has signaled growing approval as the depth \n     of disagreement between Washington and Jerusalem became plain \n     in recent weeks. Unless averted by a final round of diplomacy \n     in the region beginning today, senior Clinton administration \n     officials say, the initiative will step up pressure on Prime \n     Minister Binyamin Netanyahu by casting him as the lone \n     holdout against his country's strongest ally.\n       Developed in White House meetings of Clinton's closest \n     advisers, the American package falls well short of a \n     comprehensive peace plan and is intended only to break an \n     impasse and restore productive talks. The initiative \n     nonetheless highlights the Clinton administration's alarm and \n     the extent to which it has interjected itself as a party to \n     Israeli-Palestinian talks begun without U.S. knowledge five \n     years ago.\n       Though the main elements of the American package already \n     are well known, Netanyahu has strongly opposed its formal \n     announcement. In recent days, the Israeli premier has \n     intensified a campaign to raise the political price for \n     Clinton, dispatching cabinet ministers and friendly American \n     Jewish leaders to tell Washington it is on a collision \n     course. Israeli Communications Minister Limor Livnat, who \n     shared a Capitol Hilton stage Tuesday with Vice President \n     Gore, ambushed him before more than 1,000 Jewish fund-raisers \n     with the rhetorical question, ``Will the United States stand \n     by its commitment that Israel will be the one to decide her \n     own security needs?''\n       Clinton and Netanyahu spoke at length by telephone on \n     Thursday and Saturday in conversations described as ``very \n     tough'' by U.S. policymakers, with Clinton declining to budge \n     from a proposal combining Israeli withdrawal from 13.1 \n     percent of the West Bank, a precisely stated ``time out'' on \n     Jewish settlement building and a series of concrete \n     Palestinian steps to address Israeli security demands.\n       Netanyahu, who sought unsuccessfully this month to arrange \n     a meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, \n     urged Clinton to dispatch special envoy Dennis B. Ross for \n     one more Middle East tour. According to accounts from both \n     governments, the premier said he had detailed new ideas in \n     which Israel would give up less land but make it more \n     attractive by choosing portions of the West Bank that would \n     connect scattered Palestinian enclaves.\n       On Sunday, the morning after his last talk with Clinton, \n     Netanyahu orchestrated a cabinet statement affirming that his \n     ministers unanimously regarded the U.S.-supported 13 percent \n     withdrawal as out of the question. On Monday, he told a \n     parliamentary committee that it was ``unacceptable'' for \n     Americans to impose ``dictates from outside.''\n       Clinton administration officials expressed skepticism about \n     Netanyahu's new proposals and said they had heard of nothing \n     like the offer of 11 or 12 percent of the West Bank that some \n     Netanyahu allies have been shopping privately to opinion-\n     makers in the United States. Israel's offer to the \n     Palestinians for the present stage of interim withdrawal \n     remains at 9.5 percent.\n       By temperament and philosophy, according to aides, Clinton \n     is not eager to break publicly with Netanyahu. But he \n     authorized Martin Indyk, assistant secretary of state for \n     Near Eastern affairs, to testify to Congress recently that \n     ``the role of facilitation is coming to its end point'' and \n     that ``the strategic window for peacemaking is now closing.''\n       If the current round of diplomacy fails, according to \n     aides, Clinton intends to permit Albright to deliver a fully \n     drafted speech she has urged on the president for some time, \n     coupling a public recitation of the American package with a \n     blunt admission that the American efforts have not borne \n     fruit.\n       ``The president is comfortable in his mind with the \n     proposals he put on the table in January, which haven't \n     changed substantially, and he recognizes that if he doesn't \n     get the support of the parties we will have to explain where \n     we came out,'' a senior administration official said \n     yesterday.\n       The admission of failure is not intended as a hand-washing \n     exercise, officials said. Arafat, under this scenario, is \n     believed likely to come forward publicly and accept the \n     American plan. This would re-create roughly the dynamic that \n     forced Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to accept the \n     U.S.-Soviet invitation to the Madrid peace conference in 1991 \n     after Syrian President Hafez Assad agreed to attend.\n       In recent days, U.S. Consul General John B. Herbst in \n     Jerusalem gave Arafat a detailed briefing on the American \n     package, which Palestinians disliked initially because it is \n     closer in substance to the Israeli position than to theirs. \n     But Arafat encouraged the United States to present the \n     initiative and spoke positively of its contents without \n     committing himself, according to diplomats familiar with the \n     exchange.\n\n[[Page S2703]]\n\n       ``We would like to have in our pocket a 'yes' from \n     Arafat,'' said one U.S. official, describing that commitment \n     as a principal objective of the trip that Ross begins today. \n     Palestinians are tempted, the official said, using \n     Netanyahu's Israeli nickname, ``because they see Bibi making \n     a big fuss about it, and they wonder if it's in their \n     interest to say yes and watch us duke it out with the \n     Israelis.''\n       Ross plans a side trip to Egypt to recruit President Hosni \n     Mubarak to press Arafat. Clinton asked for Mubarak's support \n     in a telephone call late last month, but the Egyptian leader \n     has thus far not acted. Jordan's King Hussein told Clinton \n     last week that he will work to persuade Arafat.\n       In Miami yesterday, where he stopped en route to the Middle \n     East, Ross told Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai \n     that Clinton will make his final decision on the package \n     after returning from Africa on April 2. Mordechai, who is \n     Clinton's strongest ally in the Netanyahu cabinet, told Ross \n     that ``there is not any chance'' that Israel will accept the \n     American package as now formulated, according to an Israeli \n     with firsthand knowledge of the exchange. ``We are trying to \n     convey to the American decision-making process the \n     information that confrontation will not help,'' the Israeli \n     said. ``There are limits that Israel will not cross, whatever \n     will be the decision in Washington.''\n       American Jewish leaders, meanwhile, have warned Clinton and \n     Gore of repercussions in the event of a public breach with \n     Israel. Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the \n     Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish \n     Organizations, said in an interview that the Clinton \n     administration was on the verge of unveiling its package \n     earlier this month ``and I think we've staved it off.''\n       But David Bar Illan, a top political adviser to Netanyahu, \n     said by telephone yesterday that ``obviously they still have \n     an intention to come out with something.''\n       ``Since for us it's a pure question of security, and since \n     every administration since Ford has said over and over that \n     matters of security are up to Israel and only Israel to \n     decide, we feel this is a departure--let's say in diplomatic \n     language --from a policy that has been honored until now,'' \n     said Bar Illan.\n       Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, whom Netanyahu dispatched \n     to meet Albright and Gore last week, said by telephone last \n     night that the cabinet is united as on few other subjects \n     against the American demands. ``If there is external \n     pressure, it can only strengthen the resistance,'' he said.\n       Among the premises of the administration's plan, however, \n     is that Netanyahu has at least as much to lose from a public \n     conflict as Clinton, whose share of the U.S. Jewish vote was \n     high in 1992 and higher in 1996. Management of the crucial \n     U.S. alliance is seen as a central test of Israeli premiers, \n     and Clinton's approval ratings in Israel regularly exceed \n     Netanyahu's.\n       ``If you did a survey either of the American Jewish \n     community or the Israeli people and asked who has been the \n     president who in the last 50 years has done the most to \n     enhance Israel's national security . . . the overwhelming \n     result would be Bill Clinton,'' said Steven Grossman, \n     national chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a \n     former chairman of the American Israel Public Affairs \n     Committee.\n       Both leaders have suffered, by their own and U.S. \n     government accounts, from the 14-month stalemate in \n     peacemaking. ``Almost all our friends in the region are in a \n     worse position,'' said a senior Middle East policymaker, \n     citing also Morocco, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and Persian Gulf \n     emirates, including Oman. ``They staked their positions on \n     pursuit of peace, and it is eroding.''\n\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate Finance Committee, since last \nfall, has been holding hearings on the Internal Revenue Service. We now \nexpect to mark a bill up sometime next week, though we have not yet \nseen the bill.\n  I appreciate very much the leadership of the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. However, Mr. President, I must say that I believe we are \ndoing what is commonly referred to as ``making the perfect the enemy of \nthe good.'' In other words, we are taking a good piece of legislation \nthat passed the House last November in a 426-4 vote, which would give \ntaxpayers substantial new powers. Over 100,000 collection notices are \nsent out every single day. There are over 238,000 incoming phone calls \nto the IRS every single day and, by some estimates, over 40 percent of \nthem are not answered, and a very high percentage of those calls that \nare answered are answered incorrectly. The collection notices go out \nwith no concern about whether or not negligence has occurred. So \nfearful are the American people when they receive a collection notice \nthat former Commissioner Richardson--when she came before the Finance \nCommittee this year, she said that her first paycheck came with an IRS \nreturn address and it terrified her to open it. She was the \nCommissioner of the IRS, and she was practically too frightened to open \na letter from the IRS.\n  About 114,000 collection notices go out every single day. The bill \nthat passed the House would say that, if an error has been made, the \ntaxpayer can recover the cost that they put into trying to defend \nthemselves against the IRS. If the IRS is negligent, the taxpayer would \nbe able to collect up to $100,000 in punitive damages. For the first \ntime, we change the environment in which the IRS sends out its \ncollection notices.\n  In addition, the IRS would be required to publicly say: Here is the \nobjective criteria for our audits. Today to get that information, you \nhave to put in a Freedom of Information Act request. Thus, in the \nhearings we have had, both in the Restructuring Committee as well as \nthe Finance Committee, through this Freedom of Information Act request, \nwe had an opportunity to see substantial differentials between the \nbases of audits in one State versus another State and examples where \nthe IRS agents were actually given quotas and incentives to go out and \nget more, even though there was no basis for it. There are all sorts of \nexamples of abuses that are corrected in the bill that passed the \nHouse.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee is trying to improve that bill. \nI think that is terrific. He has a lot of terrific ideas that he has \npulled from the hearings he has had. I think that is all well and good.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Republican leader will say to the chairman \nof the Finance Committee that we need a process that will meet the \ndeadline that the American people have. The deadline they have is April \n15. That is after we go out of session next Friday. But for 120 million \ntaxpayers, they have to have their taxes paid by the 15th of April. I \nhope we can put together an expedited process that would have the \nchairman of the Finance Committee meeting with Ways and Means Committee \nChairman Archer, the ranking members of both committees, with the \nadministration, sometime early next week, because if we can pass a bill \nin the Finance Committee and on the floor of this Senate which could be \nconferenced quickly with the House and signed by the President, we \ncould give the taxpayers of the United States of America a tremendous \nbonus on the 15th of April--more power, more certainty that, if the IRS \nsends a collection notice out, they are going to send a notice out to \nthe taxpayer that actually owes additional money rather than one that \ndoesn't.\n\n  In addition, this new legislation, again, was passed by the House \nwith some good improvements that the chairman wants to put on this \nbill, which would give the commissioner authority to manage the agency. \nThis is a terribly important issue, Mr. President. Currently, we have \nregions, districts and areas, and we organize the IRS geographically. \nWhat the Commissioner indicated he wants to do is restructure the IRS \nso that it is organized around the category of taxpayer--small \nbusiness, large corporation, individual payers, as well as nonprofit. \nThat way the Commissioner is going to have an opportunity to not only \nrun the IRS more efficiently, but to reduce the cost to the taxpayer to \ncomply with the Tax Code. By organizing it by category of taxpayer, the \nCommissioner has indicated, and I think quite correctly, that he is \ngoing to be able to say to some taxpayers that it costs us more to \ncollect the money than we get from you; thus, we are going to provide \nregulatory relief,\n\n[[Page S2704]]\n\nespecially in the area of small business, in situations where the cost \nexceeds what we are able to collect, be able to manage the problems \nthat large businesses have, that nonprofits and individuals have, in a \nmuch different way than we currently see.\n  Next, with that authority, and especially with an oversight board \nthat is independent from the executive branch, and hopefully a \nrestructured congressional oversight--and, remarkably, some have \nactually proposed that we strike the consolidation of the oversight in \nthe Congress. We had hearings in the Restructuring Commission with \nCongressman Portman, a Republican from Ohio, and I for over a year, and \nalmost every witness said problem No. 1 is Congress. Remember, the IRS \nis not Sears & Roebuck. This is not a private-sector organization. They \nhave 535 members of their board--the Congress. There are six committees \nthat have oversight responsibility over the IRS, and what we were told \nrepeatedly, both with anecdotes and with data, was that they need to \nconsolidate the oversight so the Commissioner, with a new independent \nboard, can meet and achieve consensus on what the vision and the \npurpose of the IRS is going to be. Why? For a variety of reasons, Mr. \nPresident. One is making certain that funding is going to be constant, \nbut, more importantly, to make certain that the investment in \ntechnology is done right.\n  This whole effort started a couple of years ago. Senator Shelby and \nI, in oversight hearings on the Appropriations Committee, noted with \nconsiderable concern that almost $4 billion of taxpayer money had been \nwasted in a thing called ``tax system modernization,'' trying to get \nthe computers to operate, to talk to one another so the stovepipes \nwould not prevent the conversations back and forth.\n  Tax systems modernization, Mr. President, is very difficult to do, \nunless you have a shared consensus between the executive and \nlegislative branches, with consolidated oversight on the congressional \nside and with an independent board that is able to act on behalf of the \ntaxpayers. In that kind of environment, it is much more likely that \ntechnology investments will be made right.\n  Most importantly, I hope the majority leader will instruct the \nFinance Committee chairman, let's get a meeting next week with Mr. \nArcher, Mr. Rangel, Senator Moynihan, and Mr. Rubin, and whatever we \npass in the Senate committee, let's do it in a fashion that enables us \nto meet this April 15 deadline.\n  Mr. President, there are important things in this legislation. I have \nbehind me a chart which I call the IRS Reform Index. I will mention \nsome of the things that are on that chart. The date the IRS reform \nlegislation passed the House with 426 votes to 4 was November 5, 1997. \nThe date by which the Senate Republican leadership promised to bring \nthe IRS reform to the floor is March 30, 1998. I think the majority \nleader understood why it needed to be done then--because we need to set \na deadline of April 15 to complete our work, and I very much appreciate \nthat that in fact is what is possible for us.\n\n  Still, if we expedite the process, rather than putting something out \nof committee that has no chance of being conferenced and perhaps won't \nbe signed by the President as well--again, one of the worst mistakes \nhere is making the perfect the enemy of the good. Since November 5 to \nMarch 30, over 17 million Americans have received a collection notice. \nThat is a huge number of people who have received a collection notice \nwithout the power of the law that has passed the House, as well as some \nsignificant new powers the chairman wants to provide. That legislation \nwould pass 100-0 if we brought it up quickly, 34 million Americans \ncalled the IRS since November 5, nearly 17 million did not get through \nand of those who did, over 1 million received wrong answers. We have 40 \ncosponsors in the Senate, and 14 of the Finance Committee's 20 members \nare cosponsors of the bill. All this is to say that, if we want to pass \ngood, strong legislation and meet the April 15 deadline, there is \nabsolutely no legislative reason for us not to.\n  I am hopeful that sometime early next week the majority leader will \ntalk with the Finance Committee chair and say meet with Mr. Rangel, \nmeet with Mr. Archer, meet with Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Rubin; let's have \na joint meeting so whatever we pass out of the Finance Committee we can \npass here on the floor of the Senate, conference it quickly with the \nHouse, get it on to the President for signature, meet the April 15 \ndeadline that 120 million American taxpayers have imposed upon them \nunder current law.\n  I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, fellow Senators--Senator Lautenberg is\n\n[[Page S2705]]\n\npresent on the floor--we have just agreed that we will relinquish 6 \nhours of the debate time of the 50 hours that we are allotted under \nstatute. I personally do not intend today to make an opening statement \nexplaining this budget. I will do that Monday evening when I arrive \nback from a funeral in New Mexico for Representative Steve Schiff. \nAnybody who would like to come down and speak is welcome. I now yield \nthe floor to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for \ninitiating some movement now. We want to try to get this budget done. \nWe do not, however, want to deprive any of our Members, be they \nRepublican or be they Democrat, from the opportunity of offering \namendments in accordance with the procedure as we know it, with the \ntime consumed, again, according to the structure for budget resolution \nconsideration. But I want to make sure for those Members who want to \nstart the process that we give them the courtesy of using time in \naccordance with their need and that we don't deliberately invade the \nresponse time because we want to consume time to be able to get the \nprocess really underway.\n  First of all, I ask whether or not we can start the debate on Monday \nsomewhat later--if we are here late, we will be here late; we are \nwilling do that--whether we can start perhaps at 1 o'clock or 12 \no'clock? We are going to consume 10 hours on Monday. I ask the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee whether that is a \nproblem.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me respond in this way. Normally \nwhat time we start Monday would be up to the distinguished Republican \nleader. I strongly recommend and concur with the Senator that there is \nno real need to start early. They are going to have plenty of time. I \nconcur with my colleague and want to make sure everybody knows, we are \nnot going to cut off any debate as far as debate on this resolution. As \na matter of fact, what is going to happen is unless we fix the process \nup a little bit, we are still going to have, at the end, 10 or 15 or 20 \namendments. I would like to find a way to alleviate that.\n  But in the meantime, it seems to me, it would be better to start \nsometime after lunch. We will have somebody here representing me. I \nthink the Senate knows I cannot be here until sometime shortly after 5. \nThe distinguished Senator from New Jersey is not going to be available \nin the morning either, is he?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is true, Mr. President. And we have a designee, \na member of the Budget Committee, who will represent us to make the \nprocess available, make the resolution available for laying down \namendments. There is not going to be any problem with that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would ask the majority leader, and will do that \nimmediately upon our completing here, that we not be back on this \nresolution before 1 o'clock on Monday. I cannot agree to that at this \npoint, but I will ask and I think it will be agreed to.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I appreciate that. At the same time, just to make \nsure that we have the appropriate, usually competent staff that we \nalways have working with us when we do our committee work, I ask \nunanimous consent that Sue Nelson and Amy Abraham, who are analysts \nwith the Budget Committee, be given full floor privileges for the \nduration of all debate on the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2165.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR CLASS SIZE \n                   REDUCTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the Senate, revenue and spending \n     aggregates and other appropriate budgetary levels and limits \n     may be adjusted and allocations may be revised for \n     legislation to reduce class size for students, especially in \n     the early grades, provided that, to the extent that this \n     concurrent resolution on the budget does not include the \n     costs of that legislation, the enactment of that legislation \n     will not increase (by virtue of either contemporaneous or \n     previously-passed deficit reduction) the deficit in this \n     resolution for--\n       (1) fiscal year 1999;\n       (2) the period of fiscal years 1999 through 2003; or\n       (3) the period of fiscal years 2004 through 2009.\n       (b) Revised Allocations.--\n       (1) Adjustments for legislation.--Upon the consideration of \n     legislation pursuant to subsection (a), the Chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate may file with the \n     Senate appropriately-revised allocations under section 302(a) \n     of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and revised \n     functional levels and aggregates to carry out this section. \n     These revised allocations, functional levels, and aggregates \n     shall be considered for the purposes of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974 as allocations, functional levels, and \n     aggregates contained in this resolution.\n       (2) Adjustments for amendments.--If the Chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate submits an adjustment \n     under this section for legislation in furtherance of the \n     purpose described in subsection (a), upon the offering of an \n     amendment to that legislation that would necessitate such \n     submission, the Chairman shall submit to the Senate \n     appropriately-revised allocations under section 302(a) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and revised functional \n     levels and aggregates to carry out this section. These \n     revised allocations, functional levels, and aggregates shall \n     be considered for the purposes of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974 as allocations, functional levels, and aggregates \n     contained in this resolution.\n       (c) Reporting Revised Allocations.--The appropriate \n     committees shall report appropriately-revised allocations \n     pursuant to section 302(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 to carry out this section.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment that we have sent to the \ndesk has to do with education and class size. I ask this amendment be \nlaid aside and have debate at a time to be determined by the ranking \nmember.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me just state, it has been our precedent around \nhere that we do not have amendments for the first 4 hours we invite \ngeneral discussion. But we are going to count 6 hours against the bill, \nand I think it is only fair, under those circumstances, rather than \nmake her wait for 4 hours, that she be allowed to introduce this \namendment now.\n  I want it understood that we have not agreed as to the timing of this \namendment in that it has usually been a Republican has an amendment, \nthen a Democrat. This sequencing or chronology of her amendment, the \namendment of the distinguished Senator, will be up to the Senator from \nNew Jersey as it pertains to Democratic amendments. Is that acceptable, \nSenator?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is fine.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for \nconceding this opportunity for Senator Murray. I do not know whether \nthe Senator from New Mexico has any further business. We have nothing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As modified, the unanimous consent agreement \nwith respect to the Murray amendment is agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have nothing further, no further discussion, and we \nhave under the unanimous consent agreement how much time is taken off \nthe bill.\n  Mr. President, I assume until the leadership decides otherwise, we \nwill be in open session in quorum calls or other business. But if \nSenators want to speak to the budget resolution, I assume for a \nsignificant amount of time the floor is going to be open for them to do \nthat. I have already indicated that I cannot stay here and manage under \nthese circumstances, but I assume that, with the Parliamentarian, \nthings will run pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement.\n\n[[Page S2706]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will run pursuant to the unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to such time as I \nmight use from the Democratic side on the budget debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Nation's students deserve modern \nschools with world class teachers, but too many students in too many \nschools in too many communities across the country fail to achieve that \nstandard.\n  The latest international survey of math and science achievement \nconfirms the urgent need to raise standards of performance for schools, \nteachers and students alike. It is shameful that America's 12th graders \nrank among the lowest of the 22 nations participating in this \ninternational survey of math and science.\n  Schools across the Nation face serious problems of overcrowding. \nAntiquated facilities are suffering from physical decay, and are not \nequipped to handle the needs of modern education.\n  Across the country, 14 million children in a third of the Nation's \nschools are learning in substandard buildings. Half the schools have at \nleast one unsatisfactory environmental condition. It will take over \n$100 billion just to repair the existing facilities nationwide.\n  This chart is a good summation as to what the current conditions are. \nThis year, K-12 enrollment reached an all-time high and will continue \nto rise over the next 7 years. 6,000 new public schools will be needed \nby the year 2006 just to maintain current class sizes. We will also \nneed to hire 2 million teachers over the next decade to accommodate \nrising student enrollments and massive teacher requirements. And \nbecause of the overcrowding, schools are using trailers for classrooms \nand teaching students in former hallways, closets, and bathrooms. \nOvercrowded classrooms undermine discipline and decrease student \nmorale.\n  This chart reflects, again, the kind of crisis we are facing for our \n52 million American students: 14 million children learn in substandard \nschools; 7 million children attend schools with asbestos, lead paint, \nor radon in their ceilings or walls; 12 million children go to school \nunder leaky roofs; a third of America's children study in classrooms \nwithout enough outlets and electrical wiring to accommodate computers \nand multimedia equipment.\n  The General Accounting Office has determined that it will take in \nexcess of $100 billion just to repair existing facilities nationwide. \nWe send a very powerful message to the children in this Nation when \nthey are going to substandard schools. The message is this: The \nparents, or the older generation, don't give education the priority \nwhich it deserves.\n  Politicians of both parties are out there talking about our \nresponsibility to education and to our children and our future, but we \nfail to have decent facilities with enough classrooms and well-trained \nteachers and fail to care for children both before they get into school \nand in the after school hours. Putting children first--when we fail to \ndo that, we send a very powerful message to children that it really \ndoesn't make an awful lot of difference how they perform in school and \nwhether they conform to various rules and regulations. We send a \nmessage to children every single day that they go to dilapidated \nschools or overcrowded schools that education for the children of this \ncountry is not our first priority.\n  We have to ask ourselves as we begin the budget debate, How does this \nbudget reflect our Nation's priorities? This budget, which we are \nbeginning a debate on today and will continue to debate through the \ncourse of next week, how is that really going to reflect our Nation's \npriorities? What are we prepared to do to try to work with States and \nlocal communities to improve the schools in our country?\n  Just throwing money at a problem is not the answer; we have all \nlearned that. But I tell you that the amount of resources you allocate \nto a particular purpose or policy is a pretty clear reflection about \nwhat kind of priority the Nation is going to place on it.\n  If we are not going to provide the resources that are necessary to \nreduce class size and enhance educational achievement, if we are not \ngoing to try to address the problems of dilapidated and decaying \nschools, not only in urban areas but in rural areas, if we are not \nprepared to help recruit additional schoolteachers who are well trained \nand certified to teach the courses which they are instructing, if we \nare not going to help provide education opportunity zones to assist \ncommunities that are trying to innovate and be imaginative and work \nwith teachers and parents to enhance academic achievement--all of which \nhave been proposed by the President--if we are not going to say we care \nsufficiently about children when they leave school in the afternoon, \nthe 5 million children that go home to empty houses every single day, \nwe don't care about them--if we don't care enough about children before \nthey go to school in Head Start programs, if we are not prepared to \ninvest in children, then we are sending a very powerful message.\n  Those speeches that Members are making in here are empty. We are \nchallenging our Republican leadership and Republican colleagues to \ninvest in children, reject what the Budget Committee has done in \nturning its back on children--and I say ``turning their back on \nchildren.'' We will get into the particular details of the budget \nresolution later.\n  Now, incredibly, the Republican budget proposal ignores the pressing \nneeds that I have outlined here. The Republican plan cuts funding for \neducation. It refuses to provide key new investments to improve public \neducation. If that anti-education plan is passed, schools and students \nwill get even less help next year than they are getting this year. Let \nme repeat that: If this budget that is before the Senate now is not \naltered and changed, then the help and assistance for public schools \nwill be less next year than it was this year. That is the end result, \nbecause even if the Appropriations Committee increases funding later on \nduring the course of this Congress, it will violate the budget \nresolution.\n  This budget resolution is the time to debate the allocations of \nresources to enhance the public schools in this country. Under the \nresolution that is before the Senate this afternoon, there is a real \ncut, a real cut in support for public education. That is what I find so \nincredibly offensive in terms of the budget proposal that is before the \nSenate. The Republican anti-education budget cuts discretionary \nspending by $1.6 billion below the President's budget. It cuts funding \nfor education and Head Start programs by $1 billion below the level \nneeded to maintain current services.\n  The Head Start Program had bipartisan support. We have expanded Head \nStart programs for Early Start on the basis of the Carnegie Commission \nReport and the wide range of different testimony that has been before \nour Education Committees: The earlier the kind of contact, as the \nchild's brain is developing, and building confidence and helping and \nassisting that child through a nurturing experience and expanding their \nhorizons, has a very, very important impact in the ability of that \nchild to expand their academic achievement in the growing years of \neducation. That has been proven. We saw a small allocation--about 4 \npercent--in the early education programs in the Head Start Program, and \nit has been successful. We have been trying to expand it. But all of \nthose resources are being cut back in the Republican budget proposal \nthat is out here before the Senate.\n  As I said, it cuts the Head Start Program. The Republican anti-\neducation budget denies 3.7 million students the opportunity to benefit \nfrom smaller class size. It denies 900,000 disadvantaged students the \nextra help they need to improve their reading and math skills. It \ndenies 400,000 students the opportunity to attend after-school \nprograms, those programs which are so essential.\n  We know that the best teacher that any child has is the parent--the \nparent; second, it is the schoolteacher. But we\n\n[[Page S2707]]\n\nalso know what children do before they come to school in the morning is \nimportant, and we know what happens to children in the afternoon is \nvery important. We won't take the time to elaborate on the after-school \nprograms and what it means in terms of helping and assisting a child, \nworking with that child, to help them with their homework, help them \nwith auxiliary programs as I have seen out in Dorchester, MA, just 3 \nweeks ago in an excellent program. I saw the liveliness of those \nchildren in the after-school programs.\n  You would think a child, after going through a full day of education, \nwould be pretty tired, but the light in those children's eyes as they \nare involved in doing their homework and involved in artwork, involved \nin photography, and even in cooking so that they would be of help and \nassistance in the home--the idea of helping those children get their \nhomework done in the afternoon with help and assistance, so when their \nparents are at home at nighttime after a full day of work, they can \nenjoy some common time together and the parents are not going to the \nchild saying, ``You better go off and do your homework.''\n  These are pretty commonsense recommendations, after school programs. \nI won't take the time, at least now, to go through the excellent \npresentations of Paul Evans, our police commissioner in Boston, who \ntalks about the importance of after-school programs in order to reduce \ncrime and violence in a community--eloquent, eloquent testimony. I \ndaresay that we have had a better record in Boston in reducing youth \nhomicide than any city in the country. We went over 2 years without a \nsingle youth homicide--over 2 years without a single youth homicide.\n  If you had Paul Evans here on the floor of the U.S. Senate this \nafternoon, he would say there are three elements. You need to have a \ntough kind of action in dealing with the violent youth that are \ninvolved in gangs, you have to have an effective program to police the \nproliferation of weapons, and you have to have an effective after-\nschool program. How many times I have listened to his eloquence. Those \nthree elements are the key.\n  But an after-school program is key if we are serious in terms of \ntrying to do something about violence in our society, and that case is \nso powerful. The President has an after-school program. It has been a \nmodest program for the last year. It has been tried and tested. It \nrecognizes that the increase in crime among juveniles rises about 60 \npercent between the hours of 3 and 4 every single day, just when kids \nget out. And 70 percent of the illegitimate births among teenagers are \ncaused during the time of between 3 and 6 in the afternoon. It is a key \ntime, Mr. President, when too many of our young people are cast loose \nout into society, or just into their own homes with a television set, \nor if they are older, to a street corner. This is an important \ningredient in terms of the education component.\n  Now the President requested that program, and it is effectively \nzeroed out in the Republican program. So you are going to deny some \n400,000 students the opportunity to attend after-school programs.\n  The Republican budget denies 6,500 middle schools, serving 5 million \nstudents, extra help to ensure that they are safe and drug free. It \ndenies 1 million students in failing schools the opportunity to benefit \nfrom innovative reforms. It denies 3.9 million needy college students \nan increase in their Pell grants.\n  The President requested a very modest increase in Pell grants, which \nwould have a significant impact on students such as those who attend \nUMASS-Boston. Their tuition may be up now to $1,350 a year. Eighty-five \npercent of those kids' parents never went to college. Eighty-five \npercent of them are working 25 hours a week or more. When the tuition \nis up $100 at UMASS-Boston, they see a 10 percent decline in admissions \nrequests. That $100 makes a difference to those kids. That $100 is a \nlife-and-death thing to those kids. And the President had recommended \nsome $300 on it. The way it works out, in terms of the formula, it \nwould be a little over $100 per kid in the Pell grant program that was \nlost dramatically in purchasing power over the past years. That is \neliminated, Mr. President.\n  All of these are paid for in the President's program. These aren't \nadd-ons to the budget. They are all paid for under the President's \nprogram that moves us to a balanced budget. But no, no, we have to cut \nthose programs investing in kids and provide a $30 billion tax cut for \nwealthy individuals. Take that money that is going to after school, \ntake that money away from Pell grants, take that money away from \nchildren for math and science, take that money away from smaller \nclassrooms and take that money away from strengthening teacher \ntraining, and put it where? In a tax break. Now, that is the issue. It \nis an issue of priorities. It is an issue of priorities. It is who is \non whose side? If you want to cut to the meat of it, who is on the side \nof working families and their kids, and who is on the side of those \nthat need another tax break? It isn't the working families that get a \ntax break, because the Republicans have opposed any increase in the \nminimum wage. This isn't even a tax break. These are men and women who \nare working hard, playing by the rules, and want to provide their \nkids with food on the table and, after working two jobs, to be able to \nspend some time with them.\n\n  You would think they would at least say that if we are not going to \ngive them a tax break--because they don't benefit from a tax break--at \nleast say let's give them an increase in the minimum wage. No, no, no. \nThat is what we heard last year, but we were eventually able to win it. \nBut we haven't got one single Republican cosponsor of an increase in \nthe minimum wage for this year--not one--when we have seen the most \nexpanding, growing economy, with 320,000 jobs added in the job market \nlast month, and 12,000 in the restaurant industry; they are always \ncomplaining about any increase and how it is going to be devastating to \nthe restaurant industry, but they grew 12,000 jobs just last month.\n  So, Mr. President, these are some of the issues that are in this \nbudget and what we have to address. We must test students early so that \nwe know where they need help in time to make that help effective. We \nmust provide better training for current and new teachers so that they \nare well prepared to teach to high standards. We must reduce class size \nto help students obtain the individual attention they need. We must \nprovide after-school programs to make constructive alternatives \navailable to students. We must provide greater resources to modernize \nand expand the Nation's school buildings to meet the urgent needs of \nschools for up-to-date facilities.\n  I hope that during the consideration of the budget resolution next \nweek, we will give education the high priority that it deserves.\n\n\n                        Cigarette Price Increase\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment of the Senate's \ntime to talk about another decision and another priority that was made \nin the Budget Committee in the past 10 days.\n  The Republican budget would also prohibit using the money raised by a \ncigarette price increase from being directed to programs that prevent \nchildren from starting to smoke and help those who are already addicted \nto quit smoking. These programs are essential to any effective \nantismoking effort.\n  What you have to have, if you are going to be serious about trying to \nstop the youth from smoking, is a dramatic increase in costs in a short \nperiod of time. That is the record. We have examples of it. We can \nspend some time in going through those various reports. You need to \nhave that. It also has to be accompanied by an effective \ncounteradvertising campaign. If you only rely on an increase, what \nhappens is the tobacco industry goes out and increases their \nadvertising, and that overwhelms the discouraging aspect of a price \nincrease. That is the record of it. We have seen that, and we will have \na chance at another time when we go through the whole debate on \ntobacco.\n  So you have to find a corresponding action. What the public health \ncommunity, who studied this for years, says is that you not only have \nto have counteradvertising of tobacco, which amounts to $5 billion a \nyear--you don't expect to match it with $5 billion a year, but under \nthe Republican proposal it talks about $125 million that they are \nprepared to authorize but won't even guarantee. Even the last spring \nsettlement, which was deficient in some important areas, provided for \nthe mandatory spending for\n\n[[Page S2708]]\n\ncounteradvertising. But not this Republican budget, not this Republican \nbudget. No. They said, effectively, no, we won't require that moneys \nthat come in as a result of an increase in price--sure there should be \nsome moneys for the Medicare Program, but let me depart for a moment.\n  The best way to help the Medicare Program is to get kids to stop \nsmoking. The costs of the Medicare Program are $9 billion a year, \napproximately. When you stop kids from smoking, you are going to save \nMedicare billions of dollars. So we allocate, under the Conrad \nproposal, some resources on Medicare. But we are talking now about the \npublic health measures that have been turned down by the Budget \nCommittee. These public health measures had been included in the first \nMcCain proposal that was offered last fall. He knew they were \nimportant. They were included in the Hatch proposal, which also \nincludes these measures, funds to try to deal with the public health \naspects of children. They were included in a bipartisan program on \nHarkin-Chafee. They included that. But not the Budget Committee, not \nthe Budget Committee, well-known protectors of the public health; not \nthe Budget Committee, no, sir.\n\n  Zero in terms of counteradvertising; zero in support of local \ncommunities for cessation programs to stop kids from smoking in the \nschools, to try to help local communities, work in local schools, \nnonprofit agencies, groups that have been working with cessation \nprograms for years, zero for them, no way; zero for studying the \nproblems of addiction to narcotics, and to study the problems with \nhealth-related issues that are attached to tobacco, such as lung \ncancer; effectively zero for any kind of a review, study, or investment \nin those particular programs; and zero with regard to looking out after \nfarmers who are going to be impacted by this program. I may have my \ndifferences on the public policy issue on tobacco, but I am not \nprepared, like the tobacco industry has done it, to do it on the backs \nof those tobacco farmers.\n  If you look back over what those tobacco farmers' increase has been \nover the past 10 years, when you have had record profits by the tobacco \nindustry, it was pittance for those tobacco farmers. The first thing \nthat happens, if the tobacco industry gets in any problem, they rent \nthose big buses and park them on the mall and let them come up here and \nask us why we are against those individuals and their families. How \nmany times have we done that, Mr. President? We will have a chance to \ngo on through that.\n  But the point that we are making, Mr. President, is that these \nprograms are essential to any effective antismoking effort and \neducation on the dangers of tobacco use, counteradvertising, \ndeglamorizing smoking among children, smoke cessation programs, and \nmedical research to cure tobacco-induced diseases. They should be the \nfirst priority for the dollars produced by a cigarette price increase.\n\n  All of us agree that Medicare should be protected for future \ngenerations. All of us recognize that tobacco imposes a heavy cost \nexceeding $9 billion a year on Medicare, and that a share of any \ntobacco revenues should be used for Medicare.\n  But one of the best ways to keep Medicare strong for the future is to \ninvest in important public health and tobacco control programs that \nprevent children from beginning to smoke and help current smokers to \nquit smoking.\n  But not this budget. Every public health official that has appeared \nbefore Republicans and Democrats alike in the House and in the Senate \nhas said these are essential. But not the Budget Committee. But we will \nhave a chance to address that. That is an important priority. Americans \nwill lead healthier lives, and the burden of tobacco-induced diseases \nwill be greatly reduced.\n\n  Obviously, it makes good sense to earmark funds for Medicare and \nsmoking cessation programs, for tobacco counter-advertising campaigns, \nfor tobacco-related research and education programs, and for FDA \nenforcement of provisions to reduce smoking by children.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican budget earmarks all of the tobacco \nrevenues for Medicare. It prohibits using even one dollar of the \ntobacco revenues to deter youth from smoking. That's unacceptable.\n  Smoking has inflicted great damage on people's health. It makes sense \nto use tobacco revenues for these important anti-tobacco initiatives \ntoo.\n  These programs work. Every dollar invested in a smoking cessation \nprogram for a pregnant woman saves $6 in costs for neonatal intensive \ncare and long-term care for low birthweight babies.\n  Listen to this. Every $1 invested in a smoking cessation program for \na pregnant woman saves $6 in costs for neonatal intensive care and \nlong-term care for low-birthweight babies. But there is nothing in this \nprogram for that.\n  The Republican budget offers no help in cases like this, and that \nmakes no sense.\n  The Republican budget offers no help to states and communities for \npublic health advertising to counteract the $5 billion a year--$5 \nbillion--that the tobacco industry pours into advertising to encourage \npeople to start smoking and keep smoking.\n  The Republican budget offers no help to the Food and Drug \nAdministration to enforce the laws against the sale of tobacco products \nto minors, even though young people spend $1 billion a year to buy \ntobacco products illegally.\n  You would think that we would want to try to do something about that \nas well. Talk to any serious official in the public health community, \nand they will say that we need a multidisciplined approach if we are \ngoing to have an impact in reducing tobacco use among young people. We \nhave to do all of these things. But not the Budget Committee. And the \nRepublican budget offers no help for medical research on tobacco-\nrelated diseases, even though such research can lead to enormous \nsavings for Medicare. The country supports, I believe, these \nfundamental, sound public health proposals, and the Senate should as \nwell.\n\n\n                     Medicare Buy-In and The Budget\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to mention just two other areas. One \nis the area of the Medicare buy-in and the budget.\n  Mr. President, the President has advanced a proposal to permit those \nnear the age of 65 and those 62 years old to be able to buy into \nMedicare and do it in a fiscally sound way that will not interfere with \nthe financial integrity of Medicare. These individuals in their early \nsixties are too young for Medicare but too old for affordable private \ncoverage. Many of them face serious health problems that threaten to \ndestroy the savings of a lifetime and prevent them from finding or \nkeeping a job. Many are victims of corporate down-sizing or a company's \ndecision to cancel the health insurance protection they relied on. No \nAmerican nearing retirement can be confident that the health insurance \nthey have today will protect them until they are 65 and are eligible \nfor Medicare.\n\n  Three million Americans aged 55 to 64 have no health insurance today. \nThe consequences are often tragic. As a group, they are in relatively \npoor health, and their condition is more likely to worsen the longer \nthey remain uninsured. They have little or no savings to protect \nagainst the cost of serious illness. Often, they are unable to afford \nthe routine care that can prevent minor health problems from turning \ninto serious disabilities or even life-threatening illness.\n  The number of uninsured is growing every day. Between 1991 and 1995, \nthe number of workers whose employers promise them benefits if they \nretire early dropped twelve percent. Barely a third of all workers now \nhave such a promise. In recent years, many who have counted on an \nemployer's commitment found themselves with only a broken promise. \nTheir coverage was canceled after they retired.\n  The plight of older workers who lose their jobs through layoffs or \ndownsizing is also grim. It is hard to find a new job at age 55 or 60--\nand even harder to find a job that provides health insurance. For these \nolder Americans left out and left behind through no fault of their own \nafter decades of hard work, it is time to provide a helping hand.\n  And finally, significant numbers of retired workers and their \nfamilies have found themselves left high and dry when their employers \ncut back their coverage or canceled it altogether.\n  Democrats have already addressed legislation to address these \nissues--and\n\n[[Page S2709]]\n\nthe budget must provide for its enactment. The legislation allows \nuninsured Americans age 62-64 to buy in to Medicare coverage and spread \npart of the cost throughout their years of eligibility through the \nregular Medicare program. It allows displaced workers aged 55-62 to buy \ninto Medicare to help them bridge the period until they can find a new \njob with health insurance or until they qualify for Medicare. It \nrequires companies that drop retirement coverage to allow their \nretirees to extend their coverage through COBRA until they qualify for \nMedicare.\n  This legislation is a lifeline for millions of older Americans. It \nprovides a bridge to help them through the years before they qualify \nfor full Medicare eligibility. It is a constructive next step toward \nthe day when every American will be guaranteed the fundamental right to \nhealth care. It will impose no additional burden on Medicare, because \nit is fully paid for by premiums from the beneficiaries themselves.\n  In the budget there ought be the opportunity for us to debate this \nissue, and if judgment is made that we are going to move forward on it \nto ensure that we are going to have the votes and not be blocked from \nmoving forward on it because of the failure of the Budget Act, to at \nleast consider that possibility.\n\n\n                         Investment in Children\n\n  Mr. President, everyone knows that investments in children pay off, \nand focusing the attention of the Nation on a central priority for vast \nnumbers of American parents--the availability and affordability and \nquality of child care and after-school programs--I believe is \nessential. There is a shocking lack of child care that meets these \nthree basic tests: Affordability, availability, and quality. It is a \ndramatic fact of life for millions of families across the Nation. \nThirteen million children spend all or part of their day in child care. \nFive million are left unsupervised after school. Their parents are \nworking parents and deserve to know that their children are not just \nsafe but well cared for.\n  We must make sure that we take care of our children and have child \ncare development programs. We need to expand the child care development \nblock grant and ensure there is mandatory money to invest in our kids. \nAnd we have failed to do so in this budget.\n\n\n                            EEOC Enforcement\n\n  Mr. President, this year, Congress must commit greater resources to \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Although many of my \nRepublican colleagues want to eliminate all forms of affirmative action \nthat have benefited women and minorities, shouldn't everyone--\nRepublicans and Democrats alike--support strong enforcement of our \ncivil rights laws? To do otherwise undermines the promise of equal \njustice and equal opportunity for all.\n\n  The EEOC is the only government agency solely devoted to enforcing \nour great civil rights laws--the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act, and the Equal Pay Act. But, while the \nagency has received greater enforcement responsibilities, including the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Civil Rights Act of \n1991--its congressionally appropriated resources have decreased.\n  The Republican leadership must support its anti-discrimination \nrhetoric and support the work of this agency. The EEOC needs the tools \nnecessary to quickly investigate charges of discrimination against \nindividuals, as well as patterns of discrimination found in the \nworkplace. I hope my Republican colleagues agree with the sentiment of \nour former majority leader, Bob Dole. Senator Dole said,\n\n       [W]e must conscientiously enforce our antidiscrimination \n     laws. Those who violate the law ought to be punished, and \n     those who are the victims of discrimination must be made \n     whole. Unfortunately, our nation's top civil-rights law \n     enforcer, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, is \n     burdened with an unacceptably high . . . case backlog. We \n     must give the EEOC the tools it needs to do its job properly.\n\n  The budget must include President Clinton's request for $270 million \nfor the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. It is the right thing \nto do for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, am I correct that we are in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently considering the \nconcurrent Senate budget resolution.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak in morning business for not more than 7 or 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first let me say in response to the recent statement \nby my good friend from Massachusetts about the degree of compassion \nassociated with the Republican Members of the Senate that I disagree. I \nam sure that the Budget Committee and its able chairman, Senator \nDomenici, will respond in detail to the generalizations that have been \nexpressed by my friend from Massachusetts. But let me just make one \nspecific point.\n  We have heard that the Republicans and the Republican budget do not \ninvest enough in education; that they have not adopted the two key \nplans of the President's budget: $5 billion for school construction, \nand $7.3 billion to hire 100,000 more teachers over the next 5 years.\n  The facts show that, indeed, the Republicans have kept their word. We \nhave increased education spending by exactly what the President and the \nCongress agreed to do last year in the balanced budget agreement. We \nhave provided $8 billion in additional discretionary education funding \nover the 5-year period, and in total we will provide close to $20 \nbillion in kindergarten-through-grade 12 education funding this year. \nThat is a 98-percent increase over the last 10 years.\n  I would not take criticism relative to the Republicans' commitment to \neducation. It supports exactly what the President has asked for. Again, \nthat is $20 billion for kindergarten through grade 12 education funding \nand a 98-percent increase over the last 10 years.\n  I am sure others on the Budget Committee will address other \ngeneralizations in more detail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/27/senate-section/article/S2704-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2709-S2711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WARD VALLEY TRESPASSERS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, my purpose in seeking time this morning \nis to communicate to the other Members of a grievous trespass occurring \non public lands, a trespass that would certainly not be allowed in the \nState of Minnesota or in my State of Alaska.\n  Today we have a significant standoff in the southern California \ndesert between the Federal Government and trespassers at the Ward \nValley site. For several years, the State of California and Governor \nWilson have sought to purchase from the Federal Government the 1,000-\nacre Ward Valley site in southern California out in the Mojave Desert, \na pretty inhospitable area. Large transmission lines go over the \nproperty. You can hear the buzz of the electrical energy going through \nthose wires. And it has been determined to be a suitable site for low-\nlevel waste. California wants to build a low-level waste disposal \nfacility on this Federal property which is located in a federally \ndesignated utility corridor, as I have indicated, with the power lines \ngoing over it. It is close to an interstate highway. The State of \nCalifornia has proposed to purchase this land from the Department of \nthe Interior. It is appropriate to reflect that this waste has to go \nsomewhere. Nobody wants waste, either high- or low-level, but we have \nto acknowledge the merits of the technologies that produce the waste. \nThey improve our health. Because most of this waste is biotech, used \nfor the treatment of cancer and other medical uses, x ray and \nradiological type of medical treatments that we all receive. It \nlengthens our lives and eases our misery.\n\n  Currently this waste is located at just the State of California, over \n800 temporary sites throughout the State. Many of these locations are \nin urban areas, near universities, communities, clinics.\n  It has been determined that Ward Valley would be an appropriate \ndisposal facility. The State of California, as well as other States, \nhas been given the authority under certain terms and conditions to \nbasically provide long-term waste storage, assuming that the Federal \nand State criteria are met. In\n\n[[Page S2710]]\n\nthis case Ward Valley has met the State of California criteria, yet the \nDepartment of the Interior refuses to support the selection of this \nsite and move with the land purchase. We have had is a decade of \nenvironmental tests. I guess we are stuck with decades and a \nconfirmation by the National Academy of Science--the last word, if you \nwill, in science--that this property is suitable for low-level \nradioactive waste disposal facility.\n  It is either this property or leave it where it is, 800 sites \nthroughout California, on the way to schools, churches, shopping \ncenters; facilities that have never been designed to hold this waste. \nHowever, the Interior Department still is not satisfied with the tests \nthat have taken place. It is not satisfied with the report from the \nNational Academy of Sciences.\n  In February of 1996, the Interior Department announced it had planned \non conducting additional environmental tests at Ward Valley. Let's do \nsome more tests. These tests were finally scheduled to begin last \nmonth, 2 years after the original announcement. That is how long it \ntakes, and I am not sure it is over yet. The tests still have not \nbegun. They have not begun now because protesters at the site have \nrefused to move off the site.\n  These are protesters, trespassers on Federal land. Last month, the \nCalifornia State Office of the Bureau of Land Management ordered the \nprotesters at the Ward Valley site to relocate by February 18 so the \ntests could begin. The protesters have been occupying the property for \nthe last couple of years under a land use permit, issued by the BLM. I \ndid not know this, but you can evidently get a land use permit to \ninitiate civil disobedience.\n  These protesters are already in violation of their original land use \npermit. They have refused to comply with the February 18 deadline. \nIncredibly, the protesters, who are clearly trespassing on Federal \nland, are still there today. February 18 has come and gone. Federal \nrangers made no effort to evict them from the property. In fact, on \nFebruary 25 all Federal rangers were withdrawn from the property. The \nquestion is, why?\n\n  Even more incredibly, over the past 6 weeks the trespassers have now \ntaken control of the property. They now, the trespassers, mind you, \nrefuse to allow the BLM employees access to the property to initiate \nthe testing. The protesters have also refused to allow the U.S. \nEcology, the State's licensee who is going to do the test, access to \nthe property for environmental monitoring and refueling of its \ngenerators. When the BLM and the U.S. Ecology employees have been \nallowed to enter the property, they have been frisked by the protesters \nand all vehicles have been searched by the protesters' so-called \nsecurity forces.\n  Isn't that a turnaround? This is Federal property. The trespassers \nhave taken it over and are dictating the terms and conditions by which \nthe Federal agencies can have access to their own property. Where in \nthe world is the Secretary of the Interior? Where in the world is the \nAttorney General? As chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, I am extremely disappointed with how the Department of the \nInterior has handled this entire matter. The Department of the Interior \nis allowing persons who are in clear violation of the law to not only \noccupy Federal land but also control the Federal land by determining \nwhether or not tests can occur. Even more incredible, the Department is \nallowing the trespassers, who are now outfitted with knives, cans of \nMace and handcuffs, to dictate the terms and conditions under which the \nFederal employees have access to the Federal lands. What message does \nthis send to our Federal employees? What message does it send to our \ncitizens?\n  The Department of the Interior says they are in negotiation with the \ntrespassers, who include representatives of environmental groups and \nIndian tribes. However, there should be no room for negotiation with \ntrespassers. They are just holding the Federal government hostage. The \ntrespassers say that they will not leave Ward Valley until the \nDepartment of the Interior promises that no testing will occur and the \nproperty will not be transferred to the State of California. So they \nare saying, in effect, it cannot be used.\n  The Federal government has spent tens of millions of dollars, to \ndate, on Ward Valley. The State of California has spent tens of \nmillions of dollars. California's licensee alone has spent about $80 \nmillion in preparation for their license to build the facility. Yet, \nprotesters are dictating the terms and solutions. With such an absolute \nposition, well, there doesn't appear to be much room for negotiation.\n  I have asked the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary Babbitt, to \ninform me and advise me how he intends to deal with the trespassers on \nthe Department of the Interior land and how he intends to deal with \nthem on other Federal lands he controls. I also want to know what the \nDepartment intends to do if the standoff continues. Does the Department \nintend to allow our public land to be controlled by trespassers? This \nis an unacceptable and dangerous precedent.\n  I have also written the Attorney General, Janet Reno. As this \nNation's chief law enforcement officer, I want to know how she plans to \nhandle the trespassing at Ward Valley. Does she condone this illegal \nactivity? Is she prepared to enforce Federal law? Will she fully and \nfaithfully prosecute those trespassers? I hope this standoff can be \npeacefully resolved, but it needs to be resolved now--now, rather than \nlater. It has already been 6 weeks in the making.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent correspondence I have directed \nto both the Honorable Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of the Interior, and \nJanet Reno, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      Committee on\n\n\n                                 Energy and Natural Resources,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 1998.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madame Attorney General: For several years, the State \n     of California has sought to purchase from the Federal \n     Government the 1,000 acre Ward Valley site in southern \n     California for the construction of a low-level radioactive \n     waste facility. Before deciding whether or not to transfer \n     the property, the Department of the Interior plans on \n     conducting additional environmental tests. At present, \n     however, trespassers at the site refuse to allow these tests \n     to begin. As this country's chief law enforcement official, \n     this letter is to determine the extent of the Department of \n     Justice's involvement with the current stand-off at the Ward \n     Valley site.\n       Last month, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which \n     manages the site, ordered protesters on the property to \n     relocate so that the tests could begin. The protesters \n     refused to comply with BLM's February 18th deadline and \n     Federal rangers made no effort to evict them from the \n     property. In fact, on February 25th, all Federal rangers were \n     withdrawn from the property. For the past six weeks, the \n     protesters have refused to allow BLM employees access to the \n     property for purposes of conducting additional tests. The \n     protesters, with one exception, also have refused to allow \n     U.S. Ecology--the State's licensee--access to the property \n     for environmental monitoring and refueling of its generators. \n     when BLM and U.S. Ecology employees have been allowed to \n     enter the property, they have been frisked and all vehicles \n     have been searched by the protesters' ``security forces.''\n       As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources, which has jurisdiction over this nation's public \n     lands, I am extremely disappointed with how this matter has \n     been handled. Persons--in clear violation of the law--have \n     been allowed to not only occupy Federal land but also control \n     whether or not environmental tests occur at the Ward Valley \n     site. Even more incredible, the trespassers--outfitted with \n     knives, cans of mace, and handcuffs--are dictating the terms \n     and conditions under which Federal employees have access to \n     public land. What message does this send to our Federal \n     employees? What message does this send to our citizens?\n       To help me, and the Committee, assess this troubling \n     situation, please respond to the following questions by \n     Wednesday, April 1st:\n       1.  Has the Department of the Interior consulted with, or \n     sought assistance from, the Department of Justice on this \n     matter?\n       2.  What must happen before the Department of Justice \n     assumes control over the current stand-off at the Ward Valley \n     site?\n       3.  What is the general policy of the Department of Justice \n     with respect to trespassers on public lands?\n       Include in your response, the name, title, and phone number \n     of the Department of Justice official with responsibility for \n     monitoring the situation at Ward Valley.\n       In an effort to assist the Department in preparing thorough \n     and responsive answers to these questions, and to ensure that \n     there is a clear understanding as to the scope and nature of \n     this request. Committee staff is available to meet with your \n     staff to discuss any matter raised in this letter. If you \n     have any questions about this request or if your\n\n[[Page S2711]]\n\n     staff would like to meet with Committee staff, contact Kelly \n     Johnson, Counsel to the Energy and Natural Resources \n     Committee, at 224-4911. All correspondence regarding this \n     request should be addressed to the attention of Ms. Johnson.\n       Thank you in advance for your cooperation with the work of \n     the Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Frank H.

Bruce Babbitt,\n     Secretary, Department of the Interior, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: In February 1996, Deputy Secretary John \n     Garamendi announced that the Department of the Interior \n     intended to conduct additional testing at Ward Valley before \n     deciding whether or not to transfer the property to the State \n     of California for a low-level radioactive waste disposal \n     facility. The Interior Department's field tests finally were \n     scheduled to begin last month. These tests have now been \n     indefinitely postponed because of the illegal occupation of \n     the Ward Valley site. I write to find out how you, as \n     Secretary of the Interior, intended to proceed with the tests \n     and handle the protesters at the Ward Valley site.\n       Last month, the California State Office of the Bureau of \n     Land Management (BLM) ordered protesters at the Ward Valley \n     site to vacate the property by February 18th so that field \n     testing could begin.

Mr. President, we have before the Senate today, and will \nhave on into next week, the budget resolution which has been reported \nfrom Senate Budget Committee, on which I serve. I commend ranking \nmember Lautenberg from New Jersey for his leadership as well as \nChairman Domenici for his work on the budget resolution. Obviously, we \nhave differences relative to some components of the budget resolution. \nI think the current resolution is significantly lacking in many serious \nways. At the same time, however, I want to acknowledge the \nextraordinary circumstance that we now find ourselves in as Americans \nhere in the spring of 1998.\n  Many of us recognize that, upon his election 5 years ago, President \nClinton faced a pool of red ink totaling around $292 billion per year, \na pool of red ink that had exploded through the 1980s. When President \nCarter left office, this nation had accumulated a national debt of \naround $1 trillion. At the end of the 1980s, the accumulated debt of \nthis country was four times that, in the $4 trillion range, and growing \nbeyond sight.\n  After five successive years in reducing the annual budget deficit, we \nnow find ourselves, in this fiscal year, with a budget surplus as \nmeasured under the unified budget-scoring system. We are in the black \nfor the first time in 30 years. The last time the Federal Government \nhad a unified budget surplus was in 1969 during the Lyndon Johnson \nadministration when taxes were raised in order to pay for the Vietnam \nwar. We slipped back into deficit again and then drowned in red ink \nthrough the 1980s.\n  So, we find ourselves in an extraordinary time. We must decide what \nkind of framework our Federal Government should have, and what kind of \nframework our budget should have, going on into the next millennium. \nAfter 5 years of budget discipline--in no small measure as a \nconsequence of a very difficult vote on the 1993 budget reconciliation \nbill, which laid much of the groundwork for this progress--we find \nourselves with record low inflation, record low unemployment, one of \nthe highest levels of housing ownership that we have seen in decades, \nrecord low levels of crime and, again, the first budget surplus, at \nleast under a unified budget, that we have seen in 30 years.\n  Where do we go from here? That is the question that the pending \nbudget resolution asks. This is not just a budget issue. This is one \nthat really reflects the values and the priorities and the philosophy \nof the American people. It has enormous ramifications for us all.\n  There are some very fundamental areas where the two political parties \nare in agreement on the budget resolution. I am thankful for that. I am \npleased we have found common ground, first of all, in deciding that the \nbudget resolution should sustain and continue the budget discipline \nmechanism that has been a factor in producing a budget surplus for the \nfirst time in 30 years. We will continue on a pay-as-you-go basis. No \nmore new spending unless the cost is offset by spending decreases or \nrevenue adjustments; no more tax cuts, even in an election year, unless \nthose cuts are paid for by reduced spending or revenue increases \nsomewhere else in the budget.\n  This is the kind of discipline that one would have thought should \nhave been present in our Government for 200 years but, in fact, has \nbeen present for just this past decade. It is the kind of discipline \nthat we must sustain. While there are some who, I think, are expressing \nsome sense of giddiness over a budget surplus, we need to recognize \nthat that surplus will remain only with continued budget restraint and \ndiscipline; that we must face the question of budget priorities; and \nthat the election year Christmas trees that took place in the past are \nno longer an accepted part of budget strategy in this day and age.\n  Secondly, there is agreement between the parties, at least in the \nSenate Budget Committee, that the so-called budget surpluses ought to \nbe preserved for the purpose of strengthening Social Security. We ought \nnot to run off in any number of directions with tax cuts or spending \nincreases premised on utilizing those particular\n\n[[Page S2712]]\n\ndollars. These so-called surpluses are really surpluses only if the \nSocial Security trust funds are included in the budget, which is the \nnature of the unified budget.\n  We have an agreement on the budget resolution that has emerged from \nour committee that those two underlying principles will be continued. I \nacknowledge the very great importance of those two underlying \nprinciples.\n  There are some great differences, however, that I am hopeful can be \naddressed with amendments during the course of debate this coming week.\n  One of the most fundamental differences, frankly, is how to utilize \nany resources that might be generated by a tobacco settlement. We all \nunderstand that a tobacco settlement is still only a possibility--it \nmay occur or it may not--and the terms of any tobacco settlement ought \nto be driven by the merits of that issue itself. We should not see the \nsettlement as simply a revenue generator for other purposes, regardless \nof how worthy they might be.\n  Nonetheless, the President in his budget and Democrats in their \nalternative budget recognize that we do need to be thinking about how \nto utilize most constructively additional resources if they are, in \nfact, made possible by a tobacco settlement. Therein lies one of the \nmost fundamental differences between the two parties.\n  We are in agreement on preserving the Social Security trust funds; we \nare in agreement that we need to shore up Medicare. I think few people \nhave done more to protect, preserve and strengthen Medicare than my \ncolleagues on the Democratic side. We are pleased, however, to have \nsupport from our Republican colleagues on an issue that ought not to be \npartisan and one where we should be able to find common ground.\n  The budget resolution that is coming to this floor, over the \nobjections of the White House and over the objections of Democrats on \nthe Budget Committee, sees to it that none of the potential new \nresources from a settlement will be used for health care for children; \nfor schools; for child care; for expanding the National Institutes of \nHealth research on cancer, heart disease, and so on; for rural \ndevelopment, or for deterring youth smoking. That is not to say that \nthere are not attempts in other areas of the budget to touch on some of \nthese issues, but certainly none of the tobacco funds could be used for \nthese purposes.\n  I have to say, simply being candid and looking across the political \nlandscape in the Budget Committee, that what we have here is not so \nmuch a concern about the long-term viability of Medicare--we all share \na concern for that. It seems to me that those who are making certain \nthat none of the tobacco money may be used for many of the other \nproblems created by use of tobacco, or for child care or education, are \nless concerned about Medicare, than they are simply opposed to creating \na better partnership among the Federal, State, and local governments, \nand public and private entities, to address the problems of education \nand child care and health care in general.\n  Mr. President, we have some enormous needs that the Federal \nGovernment cannot fix by itself, nor should it attempt to fix by \nitself, but where a constructive partnership makes a lot of common \nsense.\n  We have found over the last several budget debates that the American \npeople are not terribly ideological in the sense that they are far \nright or they are far left, they tend to be fairly pragmatic and down \nthe center. That is why Democrats on the Budget Committee attempted to \npass an alternative budget. In doing so, we recognized that replacing \nand renovating schools has always been and will always be primarily a \nfunction of local school districts and local citizens, taking it upon \nthemselves to determine whether a particular school needs to be \nreplaced or renovated. Those are local decisions and will remain so. \nBut we have suggested that a small portion of these resources ought to \nbe used to help buy down interest rates for the bond issues that are \nsupported at the local level.\n\n  Because of the enormous backlog of school repair and renovation work \nthat is out there--it is in small towns, it is in large cities, \nsuburban areas, rural and urban alike. As we head into this next \nmillennium, we understand that those countries which focus on quality \neducation and developing the brain power of the next generation are \nnations that will do well; those nations that neglect those resources, \nthose nations that think these needs will somehow take care of \nthemselves will slide backwards.\n  We need a new commitment to education and to providing the resources \nfor education, not simply for the intrinsic value of increasing the \nintellectual capability of our young people--although that certainly is \nthe principal goal--but also from even a purely dollars-and-cents point \nof view. Our economy cannot thrive, our communities cannot prosper, \nunless we do better at making sure that every young person in this \ncountry has an opportunity to develop his or her God-given talents to \nthe maximum extent possible, and that the resources are there to make \nit happen. We must have a public and private, a Federal, State, and \nlocal partnership that can make it happen.\n  So it is with some frustration that I view this budget resolution, in \nits current form, as a wasted opportunity.\n  I am hopeful that we can restore some of these priorities in the \ncontext of a balanced budget in a way that does, in fact, make some of \nthese key investments in other areas as well.\n  In the area of child care, we have an increasingly stark reality of \nmore and more children being unsupervised, not having constructive \nafter-school programs, that they are getting along on a latchkey basis. \nMore and more often we have single-parent households. We also have more \ndual-income households, not necessarily because they want that to be \ntheir circumstance but because economic reality dictates that \ncircumstance.\n  Yet, at the age when children have the greatest brain development, \nwhen it is determined how well these children will succeed in their \nlater years in terms of their fitting into society and being \nconstructive citizens, that is the one age where we make the least \ncommitment, where we have the greatest patchwork system, where quality \nis uneven, where affordability is uneven.\n  I have held child care meetings all around my State with parents and \nchild care providers and other concerned citizens. I am pleased that \nthe Republican Governor of my State is very supportive of strong new \ninitiatives for after-school programs and for child-care. We ought to \nbe able to bridge this nonsensical partisan gap and look after the \nneeds of our kids and the future generations of this country. That \nmeans, again, some level of partnership, not a system that is \nmicromanaged out of Washington or that involves a new bureaucracy out \nof Washington. We do none of that in the Democratic alternative budget. \nWe allow the decisionmaking to be made at the local level. We allow the \ninitiative to be there. We allow tremendous innovation at the State and \nlocal level, but we believe there is a partnership needed for those \ncommunities and for those nonprofit organizations and for those schools \nto make a viable investment in our children.\n  Mr. President, there is no funding for President Clinton's education \ninitiatives in this budget resolution. There is no help for school \nconstruction. Fourteen million children currently attend classes in \nbuildings that need major renovations; 7 million kids in our country go \nto school in buildings that currently have safety code violations; 16 \nmillion children are in classrooms without proper ventilation, heating, \nor air conditioning.\n  This is where we get on to a particular concern of mine involving \nNative American children. We have currently 60 BIA schools that need \ncomplete replacement. We are replacing them at the rate of one per \nyear. I thank Chairman Domenici for his sharing a concern with me about \nthis. We haven't really reached an entirely satisfactory solution to \nthis problem, but I do appreciate that we have joined together in the \ninclusion of report language expressing our concern to the \nappropriators that additional funds be allocated for these Indian \nschools. These schools have some children from the most difficult \ncircumstances imaginable, with 40 percent studying in portable \nclassrooms, with dropout rates and other attendant problems of poverty \nand desperation at such high levels.\n\n  I thank the chairman for his work with me on this very significant \nproblem, and I understand his profound appreciation of the challenges \nwe face in that regard.\n\n[[Page S2713]]\n\n  So, we have a budget resolution, Mr. President, that contains some \nstrong underlying principles, and I am very, very pleased at that, \nbecause I think by maintaining a balanced budget, we can do more than \nalmost any other single thing the Federal Government can do to reduce \nthe cost of borrowing money. That makes going to college, buying a \nhouse, buying a car, expanding a business, hiring more employees, all \nmore affordable. That will do more to maintain America's role as the \nworld's great economic superpower than any other single thing we can \ndo, and there is strong bipartisan support in that regard.\n  But we have these other fundamental differences that I am hopeful can \nbe addressed, at least in part, in the course of this coming debate on \nthe Senate budget resolution. We can create a framework for investment \nin our communities, investment in our kids, in our schools, in health \nresearch, in a more meaningful way than the budget resolution that we \ncurrently have on the floor allows.\n  We can do that. We can sustain Social Security, we can sustain \nMedicare, we can make other needed investments, while keeping the \nbudget in balance. This is a remarkable point in time, one that many \npeople thought would never occur in our lifetime. This, along with the \nfall of the Berlin Wall and some other events, are things that many \npeople thought would not happen, but they are on the verge of \nhappening. Now it is our responsibility in this body, the U.S. Senate, \nto make sure it happens in a responsible, sustainable way and we \ncontinue to make the key investments that will create the framework, \ncreate the foundation, for our country to prosper and to continue to \ngrow, to create greater opportunity for all of its citizens. Not to \nguarantee success for anyone--that comes only about through their own \nlabor, their own efforts, and their own talent--but to create the \ntools, the starting point for every American, regardless of his or her \nbackground, as an opportunity to prosper and to succeed.\n  Mr. President, I want to make one additional comment unrelated \ndirectly to the budget resolution but on an issue which does impact our \noverall economy. I wish to express great, great concern over recent \naction by our colleagues in the other body who have failed to extend \nthe ethanol fuel tax incentives that the Senate, by a large bipartisan \nmajority, included in the ISTEA legislation.\n  It appears, at this point, that our colleagues on the other side \nmanaged in effect to terminate a critically needed tax provision. This \nprovision will not only allow ethanol fuel usage an opportunity to \nreach critical mass, a substantial benefit to farmers, but also will \nhelp clean our air and make this Nation less reliant on unstable Third \nWorld nations as sources of petroleum. At this point, however, it \nappears that there will not even be an opportunity for members of the \nother body to vote for an extension of the ethanol tax incentives.\n  I am very concerned about this, and it is certainly my hope and \nexpectation that Senate conferees, in the course of negotiating \ndifferences between the Senate and the House highway legislation, will \ngive this a very high priority. It is important that we make the proper \ninvestments in our Nation's transportation infrastructure.\n  It is also important that we move forward with a commonsense, cost-\nefficient strategy for expanding use of clean, American alternative \nfuels. That can only be done by the conferees on the Senate side \nlooking after the interests of the American people in that regard when \nthe conference committee comes about.\n  So, Mr. President, this coming week should be tumultuous but very \nimportant for the American people as we deal with the fundamental \nissues in the budget for the coming fiscal year, as well as \ntransportation and fuel strategy into the next century.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back my time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). If there is no objection, time \nwill be divided equally between both sides. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Also, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 3 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, I just rise for a few moments this \nafternoon to pay tribute to the University of Minnesota basketball \nteam--the Golden Gophers of Minnesota.\n  Just a little over a year ago I stood here on the Senate floor \nsaluting the Minnesota Gophers basketball team for their accomplishment \nof winning the Big Ten championship. That was the team that eventually \nwent on to the NCAA Final Four.\n  Mr. President, I want to take time to salute an equally deserving \nteam--and that is the 1998 NIT champions, the Minnesota Golden Gophers, \nwho defeated the Penn State Nittany Lions last night by a score of 79-\n72.\n  Now, this team overcame the loss of many key players from last year's \nFinal Four squad, but the leadership from seniors Sam Jacobson and Eric \nHarris, and the excellent play from Kevin Clark and Quincy Lewis helped \nthe Gophers improve from their slow start this season to finish the \nyear by winning eight of their last nine games.\n  Every member on the team contributed to the success of this Gopher \nteam, leading to the Gophers' sixth consecutive 20-win season.\n  Mr. President, Coach Clem Haskins received many coach-of-the-year \nawards last year. But I must say, the job he did this year is equally \nimpressive and truly deserves recognition today.\n  So, again, Mr. President, I rise to salute the 1997-1998 NIT \nchampions, the Golden Gophers of the University of Minnesota.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the tragedy which occurred in Jonesboro, \nAR, this week raises many questions. Two come to mind immediately. Why \ndo children kill? I do not know the answer to that. I have heard a \nvariety of opinions from people who suggest that violent television and \nviolent movies are somehow contributing to this. There are others who \nsay, if the children would just pray in school, it would make all the \ndifference in the world. Some look to the families more than the \nschools; others think the schools have a greater role to play.\n\n  We will debate at length, and I am sure many of us will come up with \na lot of different explanations as to why children reach that point in \ntheir young lives when they would take the life of another.\n  But the tragedy in Jonesboro raised another question which I think we \ncan address because it is a simpler question. It is a question of, how \ndo children at that young age come to possess lethal weapons? Think \nabout it. An 11-year-old and a 13-year-old with 10 firearms--rifles, \nshotguns, and handguns, and 3,000 rounds of ammunition--went into the \nwoods behind that middle school, tricked the students out with a fake \nfire alarm, opened fire and shot off somewhere in the range of 30 to 40 \nrounds before they were finally stopped.\n\n[[Page S2714]]\n\n  Four little girls were killed. A teacher, who deserves all of our \nrecognition and praise for her courage, stood in the line of fire to \nprotect one of those little girls and lost her own life. This teacher, \nthe mother of a 2-year-old, lost her life defending her students.\n  How do kids come into possession of firearms? They do not buy them. \nIn most States it is unthinkable that they would even approach a \ncounter and try. And yet, day after day in America there is further \nevidence of children, younger and younger, being found with firearms.\n  The day after the Jonesboro, AR, tragedy, in Cleveland, OH, it is \nreported a 4-year-old showed up at a day-care center with a loaded \nhandgun.\n  In my home State of Illinois, in Marion, IL, a high school student \nshowed up at school the next day with a handgun.\n  In Daly City, CA, the day after Jonesboro, a 13-year-old was arrested \nfor attempting to murder his principal with a semiautomatic pistol.\n  There is something we can do about this. I am not sure that it will \nsolve the problem completely, but it can help. Fifteen States have \nalready recognized this problem and done something about it. These \nStates have passed a childhood access prevention law which is known as \na CAP law, saying to those who purchase and own handguns, it is not \nenough for you to follow the law in purchasing them and to use those \nguns safely; you have another responsibility. If you are going to own a \nfirearm in your home, you have to keep it safely and securely so that \nchildren do not have access to it.\n  Should we consider this as a national model? I think the obvious \nanswer is yes, because the tragedy in Jonesboro, which we will not \nforget for a long, long time, unfortunately, is not unique. Every day \nin America 14 young people, ages 19 and under, are killed in gun \nhomicides, suicides and unintentional shootings, with many more \nwounded.\n  The scourge of gun violence frequently attacks the most helpless \nmembers of our society--our children.\n  Here is what I am proposing. I am proposing Federal legislation that \nwill apply to every State, not just 15, but every State. And this is \nwhat it says. If you want to own a handgun, a rifle or shotgun, and it \nis legal to do so, you can; but if you own it, you have a \nresponsibility to make certain that it is kept securely and safely. You \nmay buy a trigger lock. Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin has a proposal \nthat all handguns be sold with trigger locks. I support it. I am a \ncosponsor of it. It makes sense.\n\n  How many times do you read in the paper, how many times do you listen \non TV, to kids with their playmates and the gun goes off and someone is \nkilled? A trigger lock, as Senator Kohl has proposed, is sensible. It \nshould be required. It shouldn't even be debated. I think that \nlegislation will go a long way toward reducing gun violence. Beyond \nthat, we say to every gunowner, if it is not a trigger lock, put that \ngun in a place where that child cannot get to it.\n  As to these two kids, 11 and 13 years old, God only knows what was \ngoing through their minds when they were setting out to get the guns to \ngo out and start shooting. They first stopped at the parents of one of \nthe kids and wanted to pick up that parents' guns. That parent had the \nguns under lock and key in a vault and they couldn't get to them. So \nthey thought about it and said, wait a minute, my grandfather has some, \ntoo; let's go over to his place. And that is where they came up with \nthe weapons and the ammunition.\n  In one instance, one parent had taken the necessary steps to take the \nguns and keep them away from kids. Sadly, it appears--and I just say \n``appears'' because I do not know all the details--in another case that \ndid not happen.\n  Now a lot of people will say to me, ``There they go again, those \nliberals on Capitol Hill. Another bill, another law to infringe on \nsecond amendment rights.'' Oh, I know I will hear from the folks from \nthe National Rifle Association, all the other gun lobbies, screaming \nbloody murder about the second amendment.\n  Look at 15 States that have already passed these laws, these child \naccess prevention laws, to protect kids, to say to gunowners ``you have \na special responsibility.'' You will not find a list of the most \nliberal States in America. The first State to pass this legislation in \n1989 was Florida. The list goes on: Connecticut, Iowa, California, \nNevada, New Jersey, Virginia, Wisconsin, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, \nNorth Carolina, Delaware, Rhode Island, and in 1995, the last State to \npass a child access prevention law, certainly no bleeding heart State \nby any political definition, was Texas--Texas. The Texas law says it is \n``unlawful to store, transport or abandon an unsecured firearm in a \nplace where children are likely to be and can obtain access to it,'' \nand it is a criminal misdemeanor if you do it.\n  I am going to ask my colleagues in the Senate to not only return home \nthis weekend, as I am sure we all will, and witness those sad events on \ntelevision, the funerals in Jonesboro, the tributes, the teacher who \ngave a life, but to resolve to do something about it. That is what we \nare here for. That is why we were elected to the Senate and the House, \nnot just to be sad as we should be, but to do something about it. Not \nto infringe on people's right to own firearms, but to say ``Own them \nresponsibly, put them securely in your homes, keep them safely, keep \nthem away from children.''\n  Mark my words, my friends, and you know this from human experience, \nno matter where you hide a gun or a Christmas gift, a kid is going to \nfind it. You can stick it in a drawer and say, ``Oh, they will never \nlook behind my socks, that is the last place in the world,'' or up on \nsome shelf in the closet and believe your child can't reach that, but \nyou know better. You know when you are gone and the house is empty \nthose kids are scurrying around and looking--I plead guilty and did the \nsame thing as a kid, and it helps now with tragic consequences when a \ngun is involved. So I hope we can address this issue.\n\n  First, Senator Kohl's legislation for these child safety devices, \nthese trigger locks, will help. But then take the extra step, follow \nthese 15 States and say as we address the overriding question, the big \nquestion, why do children kill, we will come to a conclusion that there \nare troubled children in America and we should never ignore that fact.\n  But please, let this Senate and this House, before we leave this \nyear, do something to make certain that those troubled children cannot \nget their hands on a firearm. I think every parent in America, \nparticularly those of children of school age, paused at least for a \nmoment after they heard about Jonesboro and thought, could it happen to \nmy son, my daughter, my grandson, my granddaughter? The sad reality of \nlife in modern America, is, yes, it could. There are so many weapons \nbeing kept so carelessly that it could happen to any of us or any of \nour children in virtually any school in America.\n  Mr. President, I know that the Senate has a very busy schedule and \nlimited opportunity this year, but I hope as part of our work we will \nlet the lesson of the tragedy of Jonesboro result in legislation that \nwill be designed to protect children and schoolteachers and innocent \npeople in the future.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/27/senate-section/article/S2713-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2714-S2715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATIONS JUDITH M. BARZILAY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, for the Barzilay, Morgenstern and Specter \nfamilies, it is a great honor for Judith M. Barzilay to become a judge \non the U.S. International Court of Trade. She was nominated by the \nPresident on January 27 and confirmed by the Senate March 11, 1998.\n  For her immigrant grandparents, Harry and Lillie Specter and Max and \nRegina Morgenstern, it is an accomplishment beyond their aspirations \neven though they knew they came to a land of great opportunity.\n  In May of 1947, Max and Regina left the bar and grill which they \noperated on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn to visit their son, Arthur, his \nwife Hilda, her parents in Russell, KS, and, most of all to see their \ngranddaughters, Judith, age 3, and Julia, 3 months old. By then, Judy \npretty much presided over her parents' household just as she had\n\n[[Page S2715]]\n\nover the household of her Specter grandparents after she was born on \nJanuary 3, 1944.\n  Judith was the New Year's baby of Russell for 1944. In New York City, \nthe first born in the New Year probably arrived at 12:01 a.m., but it \ntook 3 days for Russell's first arrival in 1944. She came with a \nretinue of presents from the town's merchants and to our five-room \nbungalow at 115 Elm Street.\n  My sister, Hilda, her mother, was a brilliant graduate from the \nUniversity of Wichita in 1942, had won a scholarship to Syracuse \nUniversity to pursue a masters degree in governmental administration. \nShe had met, Arthur Morgensten, a handsome lieutenant stationed at Fort \nRiley, when he came to Wichita in the fall of 1941 to attend Yom Kippur \nservices. They fell in love. So when he was about to ship overseas to \nthe South Pacific in April 1943, Hilda took the transcontinental train \nride to San Francisco where they were married. It was not the typical \nwartime romance with a weekend honeymoon, because the marriage has \nlasted 1 day shy of 55 years and is still going strong.\n  When Hilda came home to Russell, KS, to await Judith's arrival, our \nfamily was overjoyed, including me, her little brother, although I took \nup residence in the scorpion-infested basement and gave up high school \nbasketball to take over Hilda's bookkeeping job at O.K. Rubber Welders \nI might add--at 50 cents an hour.\n  For me, Judy was more like a sister than a niece during that time. \nFor my parents, Judy was the apple of their eyes. When our sister, \nShirley, took off a year from Oklahoma College for Women to teach \ncountry school, my father would leave his junkyard to drive Shirley to \nschool with his virtual constant companion, Judith, sitting beside him \nin the truck without the modern safeguards of seat belts.\n  My brother, Morton, returned to Russell to join my father and Arthur \nin a partnership which moved from junk, that is scrap metal, to used \noil field equipment to stripper wells. The Morgenstern children, Judy \nand Julia, joined by twins Jonathan and Johanna in 1952, were the \ncenterpieces of our close-knit family.\n  When the children grew older and their parents wanted a Jewish \neducation for them, the Morgensterns moved to Wichita where Hilda took \non the job of superintendent of the Hebrew School. Wichita was \ninadequate so they moved to Denver. Denver was inadequate so they moved \nto New York City. New York City was inadequate, so they moved to \nJerusalem where Hilda and Arthur live to this day.\n  Meanwhile Judy was a serious and accomplished student receiving a \nB.A. degree from Wichita State University and M.L.S. and J.D. from \nRutgers University. After graduation from law school, she was a staff \nattorney with the International Trade Office of the U.S. Department of \nJustice from 1983 through 1986. She then practiced law with the \nprestigious firm of Siegel, Mandell & Davidson in New York City for \n2\\1/2\\ years before joining Sony Electronics, Inc., where she worked \nfrom October 1988 to the present attaining the position of vice \npresident of government affairs.\n  With 16 years of experience as a manager, litigator, and business \nadviser, she was appointed by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in 1995 \nto the Treasury Advisory Committee on Commercial Operations of the U.S. \nCustoms Service. She has lectured on international trade law and its \napplication to business. With this extraordinary background, she is \npreeminently well qualified for the U.S. International Court of Trade.\n  While it is customary to make a floor speech on confirmation of a \nnominee, I have taken a little more time of the Senate and the cost of \nprinting in the Congressional Record because I believe it is worthwhile \nto note the accomplishments and contributions of families of America's \nimmigrants. We debate the immigration issue in Congress in a variety of \ncontexts, so it is important to chronolog how our country has been \nenriched by the immigrants' families as evidenced by the new judge for \nthe U.S. International Court of Trade: the Honorable Judith M. \nBarzilay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/27/senate-section/article/S2714-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I was saddened to learn this morning of \nthe death of Dave Powers, who was one of President Kennedy's closest \nfriends and advisors throughout my brother's entire political career.\n  President Kennedy loved Dave Powers like a brother, and so did all of \nus in the Kennedy family. My brother couldn't have had the New Frontier \nwithout him, and we will miss him very much.\n  Dave had a warmth and wit and charm that were impossible to match. \nHis Irish eyes were always smiling, and almost everyone he met became \nhis ``pal.'' His extraordinary common sense and his down-to-earth \ngenius for politics at its best made Dave Powers at home in the White \nHouse and in anyone else's house.\n  President Kennedy and Dave discovered each other while climbing the \nstairs of three-decker houses in Charlestown, MA, in my brother's first \ncampaign for Congress in 1946, and they were inseparable ever after.\n  They both were veterans of World War II, and both were new to \npolitics. The instant bond they formed took them to the House, the \nSenate, the White House, and around the world, including their most \nmoving and memorable journey of all, to the Ireland of their dreams. \nTogether, they touched and improved and inspired the lives of countless \npeople in this country and many other lands.\n  In happy times and stressful times, Dave had a special human quality \nthat could bring an instant smile from Jack or Jackie, or a hug from \nJohn and Caroline. Dave's total recall made him the unofficial \nhistorian of the New Frontier. He loved to regale my brother by \nreciting the earned run average of a Red Sox pitcher, or the name of a \nState convention delegate from a decade ago.\n  Later, Dave's extraordinary energy and dedication in carrying out his \nlabor of love at the Kennedy Library made it a magnificent tribute to \nmy brother and the years of the New Frontier. In a very real sense, \nJack's Library became Dave's Library too.\n  I extend my deepest sympathy to Dave's wife, Jo, his children Mary \nJo, Diane, and David John, and all of Dave and Jo's wonderful \ngrandchildren.\n  ``David, we hardly knew ye.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/27/senate-section/article/S2715-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, it's painfully obvious that the nation \nfaces a serious problem in providing our companies with the skilled \nworkers they need to grow and create jobs in America. We do not need a \nreport to tell us there's a problem. All one needs to look at are the \njob ads in newspapers and on the Internet which are\n\n[[Page S2716]]\n\nexploding with offers of high tech jobs that cannot be filled. There \nare even reported shortages of the recruiters needed to recruit other \nskilled workers.\n  There is ample evidence that companies face an inability to fill key \nskilled positions. The Federal Reserve's latest survey of nationwide \neconomic conditions made public on March 19 stated ``shortages of both \nskilled and entry-level workers worsened.''\n  The unemployment rate among electrical engineers nationwide is 0.4 \npercent. Congressional testimony shows that leading American companies \nlike Microsoft and Sun Microsystems have over 2,000 unfilled positions \neach. CEOS of companies like Dell Computers and Texas Instruments warn \nthat America's global leadership in high technology fields will be \nthreatened if this problem is not addressed. ``We are disarming the \neconomy of the United States if we don't allow skilled workers to come \nin,'' explained Dell Computer Corp. CEO Michael Dell.\n  Companies are so desperate for workers they are even hiring teenagers \npart-time at $50,000 a year, as The Washington Post reported in a March \n1st front-page article. The National Software Alliance, a consortium of \nconcerned government, industry, and academic leaders that includes the \nU.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force has warned that the current severe \nunderstaffing could lead to inflation and lower productivity and \nthreaten America's competitiveness.\n  And in the last two years, difficulties finding workers, economic \ngrowth and the globalization of business has led to a dramatic increase \nin the use of H-1B visas for skilled foreign-born professionals. The \nsituation has changed so swiftly that the allotment of these visas will \nbe exhausted an astounding four to five months before the end of this \nfiscal year.\n  The recent General Accounting Office report is little more than an \ninside-the-beltway squabble over how to measure shortages that ignores \nthe real marketplace. The GAO report focused on one study by the \nCommerce Department, a study that was not even raised by witnesses at a \nrecent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on H-1B visas. In turn, the \nCommerce Department has responded by criticizing GAO for doing a report \nthat ``contains several inaccuracies.''\n  The GAO acknowledges it ``did not perform any independent analysis to \ndetermine whether a shortage of IT workers exists in the United \nStates'' but merely critiqued the methodology of a Commerce Department \nstudy, a critique the Commerce Department critiques. In fact, the GAO \ndoes not question that the U.S. economy will create more than 100,000 \njobs a year in information technology over the next decade.\n  There is a legitimate debate about how best to address the supply of \nneeded skilled workers. The legislation I have introduced is a balanced \napproach that utilizes a combination of college scholarships for young \npeople, training for the unemployed, and an increase in foreign-born \nprofessionals on H-1B temporary visas. The legislation, supported by my \ncolleagues Senators Hatch, McCain, DeWine, Specter, Grams and \nBrownback, will be strongly pushed before the April recess. If American \ncompanies cannot find home grown talent, and if they cannot bring \ntalent to this country, a large number are likely to move key \noperations overseas, sending those and related jobs currently held by \nAmericans with them. We do not want that to happen. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support the American Competitiveness Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support for the bill from \nEmpower America's Jack Kemp, the National Asian Pacific American Legal \nConsortium, and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, as well as \nrecent editorials in the Oakland Press and the Washington Times be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 18, 1998.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As you are aware, America's high-\n     technology firms are among the most dynamic and innovative in \n     the world today. From the stock market--where the current \n     boom has been fueled, in large part, by high-tech stocks--to \n     the retail market--where consumers benefit from steadily \n     decreasing prices and expanding choices--the success of U.S. \n     high-tech businesses has played an integral role in creating \n     prosperity and opportunity that transcends Silicon Valley.\n       Despite aggressive recruitment and education efforts, \n     America's high-technology sector faces a severe labor \n     shortage. The unemployment rate among electrical engineers \n     has plummeted to 0.4%. According to the Information \n     Technology Association of America, more than 346,000 skilled \n     positions remain vacant. A shortage of skilled workers is \n     preventing high-tech U.S. firms from growing at their full \n     potential.\n       By November of 1997, the U.S. issued its annual cap of \n     65,000 H-1B temporary visas, which allow skilled foreign \n     professionals to work in the United States. This year the cap \n     will be hit at least four months before the end of the fiscal \n     year, shutting the door to thousands of skilled employees and \n     causing serious disruption to high-tech industry. U.S. \n     companies and universities will effectively lose access to a \n     crucial pool of skilled labor within eighteen months unless \n     the cap is expanded. This will devastate many of the most \n     dynamic sectors of our economy.\n       In public statements by Commerce Secretary Daley, and in \n     Congressional testimony from the Department of Labor, your \n     administration has not only expressed opposition to \n     increasing the cap; it has insisted on vastly expanded \n     regulatory burdens that will dramatically reduce U.S. \n     employers' access to this key source of personnel.\n       Equally troubling, these so-called reforms are packaged in \n     a way that can only be described as anti-immigrant, and I do \n     not use the term casually. It cannot be lost on Department of \n     Labor officials that the majority of the people entering the \n     United States on-H-1B visas are of Hispanic or Asian Pacific \n     origin. Cypress Semiconductor CEO T.J. Rodgers recently \n     testified to Congress, ``Most of our H-1B hires are \n     individuals of either Asian Pacific or Hispanic descent, just \n     like many other immigrants. Neither these individuals nor \n     anyone who comes through the family immigration or refugee \n     system should be maligned unfairly for `taking away American \n     jobs.' '' I agree.\n       Mr. Rodgers has also stated, ``We would lose jobs without \n     our immigrant talent. The logic of those who claim otherwise \n     including high-ranking members of the Clinton Administration, \n     borders on folly.''\n       I have been dismayed to hear nativist appeals to ``protect \n     U.S. workers'' coming from the Labor Department. I urge you t \n     overrule those protectionist sentiments and support an \n     increase in the H-1B cap without attaching new and highly \n     restrictive measures that will harm the H-1B recipients, U.S. \n     employers, and the U.S. economy. These new burdens will \n     ultimately cost American jobs by pushing American firms \n     offshore.\n       I also urge you to support the American Competitiveness \n     Act, authored by Senator Spencer Abraham. This bill increases \n     the cap on H-1B visas sufficiently to meet the current needs \n     of companies and universities; it provides college \n     scholarships for 20,000 more young people a year to study in \n     math, engineering, and computer science; and it targets \n     enforcement at serious violators of the H-1B program, rather \n     than restricting the ability of law-abiding employers to hire \n     needed employees.\n       The American Competitiveness Act will allow an additional \n     25,000 skilled workers to enter the United States this year \n     on H-1B visas. This and its attention to education will help \n     to ameliorate labor shortages in high-tech industry now and \n     in the future. In the interest of encouraging economic growth \n     and expanding employment opportunities throughout the entire \n     economy, I hope that you will instruct members of your \n     administration to end their nativist attacks and support \n     Senator Abraham's bill.\n           Very sincerely yours,\n     Jack Kemp.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            National Asian Pacific\n\n\n                                    American Legal Consortium,\n\n                                  Washington, DC., March 26, 1998.\n     Senator Spencer Abraham,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: We are writing to you regarding your \n     proposal, S. 1723, which seeks to increase the annual number \n     of H1-B visas to allow U.S. companies to employ additional \n     foreign-born professionals on a temporary basis. First and \n     foremost, we would like to thank you for your leadership in \n     Congress in support of legal immigration. In particular, the \n     Asian Pacific American community recognizes your strong \n     leadership in ensuring the preservation of family immigration \n     during the 1996 debates in Congress.\n       Your proposal to increase the annual number of H1-B visas \n     further highlights the significant contributions that \n     immigrants make to this country and to the U.S. economy. As \n     you know, 38% of those entering the United States through the \n     H1-B program are from Asian countries, with the largest \n     numbers coming from India, China, Japan and the Philippines. \n     Your proposal, if passed, will help to guarantee that the \n     American economy will continue to benefit from the talents \n     and skills of individuals from Asia.\n       It has come to our attention, however, that House \n     Immigration Subcommittee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX) is \n     preparing to add a provision in the companion House bill \n     which would impose new restrictions on family immigration. \n     Although we support the entry of\n\n[[Page S2717]]\n\n     more professionals under the H1-B visa program, we would \n     oppose any legislation that contained provisions to limit or \n     further restrict the current family immigration system in any \n     way. We understand that you will strenuously oppose any \n     attempt by Rep. Smith or others to add a ``poison pill'' \n     provision on family immigration, and that you will withdraw \n     your bill if such a provision is in fact added to the final \n     version.\n       In addition, we hope that you will be vigilant in pushing \n     for all appropriate safeguards and measures to protect the \n     wages and working conditions of H1-B workers, with proper \n     enforcement mechanisms should an employer fail to comply with \n     these measures.\n       We understand that your bill will be marked up on April 2 \n     before the full Senate Judiciary Committee. We support your \n     bill based on your commitment and continued assurance to \n     withdraw the bill if a provision is added that limits or \n     further restricts family immigration in any way.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Karen K. Narasaki,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                            U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 26, 1998.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: On behalf of the United States \n     Hispanic Chamber of Commerce we would like to congratulate \n     you for introducing legislation such as the American \n     Competitiveness Act. This legislation will help many \n     Hispanic-owned businesses in finding the key personnel they \n     need to grow and prosper in an increasingly competitive \n     global market.\n       As you know, many companies are finding it extremely \n     difficult to find skilled personnel. Clearly there is a \n     shortage of skilled workers in America, particularly in high \n     technology fields. This has meant that many companies are \n     leaving positions unfilled, which affects their ability to \n     provide new products and services to customers, and to create \n     more jobs in this country. Moreover, many of our members are \n     establishing greater ties to global export markets. To \n     succeed, they often need people who have grown up and \n     experienced the cultures and markets to which these companies \n     are exporting.\n       The need for skilled people will not disappear soon. And \n     your legislation takes a balanced approach by raising the cap \n     on H-1B visas for foreign-born professionals, while also \n     increasing efforts at education and training in this country.\n       As you know the USHCC's goal is to represent the interests \n     of over one million Hispanic-owned businesses in the U.S. and \n     Puerto Rico. With over 210 Hispanic Chambers of Commerce \n     across the country, the USHCC has become the umbrella \n     organization which actively promotes the growth and \n     development of Hispanic entrepreneurs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jose F. Nino,\n     President/CEO.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Oakland Press, Mar. 19, 1998]\n\n          Admitting More Immigrants Would Provide More Workers\n\n                            (By Neil Munro)\n\n       Would you believe we're running out of workers in this \n     country?\n       It's true, especially those capable of serving in our \n     technology industry--computer programmers, for example. Some \n     employers in Oakland County reportedly are having a problem \n     finding enough workers.\n       But something can be done to ease the squeeze, as they say.\n       And U.S. Sen. Spencer Abraham is working on it.\n       He has introduced legislation to increase the number of \n     temporary immigrants who can come here to work in high-\n     skilled occupations. A 1990 law limits their ranks to 65,000 \n     annually.\n       This year, that is expected to be reached by summer. Just a \n     year or so ago, it came into play for the first time. And if \n     there is no change, the limit will be enforced earlier next \n     year, even sooner the year after that, and so on.\n       Abraham's bill would increase the cap to 90,000 this year, \n     automatically increase that by 25,000 if it is reached, and \n     automatically keep moving it upward in subsequent years.\n       The obvious question is why can't employers find such \n     workers in this country?\n       It seems youngsters aren't being encouraged or trained to \n     enter the field--the old disconnection between education, \n     people's expectations and the real world.\n       In addition, there have been published complaints that too \n     many employers are unwilling to hire older qualified \n     Americans who say they can't re-enter the high-tech work \n     force they left.\n       Both those who meet that definition and people who oppose \n     added immigration argue that some employers prefer younger, \n     cheaper workers who are willing to put in more hours than \n     they perhaps should.\n       Whatever the truth of all this may be, the fact is a \n     significant employee shortage in the computer industry--or \n     any other industry--would likely end the nation's longest-\n     running economic boom. That boom began in 1990.\n       We really wouldn't want to end up with a lot of Americans \n     lining up for unemployment checks again.\n       Except for largely rural backwaters and resort areas in \n     which work is highly seasonal, joblessness is all but unknown \n     in Michigan.\n       The unemployment rate in Oakland County, for instance, is \n     just 3 percent of the work force--about the number of people \n     normally between jobs because they're changing them \n     voluntarily.\n       Of course, there's nothing bad about immigrants. Except for \n     native Americans, our families all originally are from \n     somewhere else. Abraham's bill no doubt will face opposition \n     for the above-mentioned reasons. But it's hard to imagine \n     that the nation dares do without it.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 16, 1998]\n\n                     Fruits of the Bumper Job Crop\n\n                           (By Donald Lambro)\n\n       The continuing decline in America's jobless rate to 4.6 \n     percent, the lowest level in nearly 30 years, is welcome \n     news. We added another 310,000 workers to payrolls last \n     month, and more than 3.4 million over the past year.\n       ``It's worker heaven driven by consumer heaven. There are \n     more jobs for more people with more pay and more worker power \n     than in decades. It's stunning,'' economist Allen Sinai told \n     The Washington Post's business reporter John Berry.\n       Traditionally, economists have viewed full employment to be \n     around 4 percent. That is the normal percentage of people who \n     are at any given time out of work because of layoffs, \n     bankruptcies or job changes. So, with some exceptions (in \n     West Virginia the jobless rate is a bleak 6.4 percent), we \n     are at nearly full employment in the economy right now.\n       But this good news on the job front masks a serious labor \n     force problem that is not getting the news media attention it \n     deserves: not enough qualified workers to meet the growing \n     demand of America's expanding high-tech industries.\n       Sen. Spencer Abraham of Michigan put this issue into sharp \n     perspective in a recent speech in the Senate:\n       ``All is not well with this crucial sector of our economy. \n     American companies today are engaged in fierce competition in \n     global markets. To stay ahead in that competition, they must \n     win the battle for human capital. But companies across \n     America are faced with severe high-skilled labor shortages \n     that threaten their competitiveness in this new Information \n     Age economy.''\n       A study by Virginia Tech for the Information Technology \n     Association of America finds there are now more than 340,000 \n     unfilled, high-skilled U.S. jobs in the information \n     technology industry. And this excludes government agencies, \n     non-profits, mass transit systems and businesses with 100 \n     employees or less.\n       In this one high-tech field alone, the U.S. Department of \n     Labor projects that American businesses will create more than \n     130,000 information technology jobs a year over the next 10 \n     years. That's 1.3 million job openings. But our colleges and \n     universities are producing less than a fourth of the number \n     of qualified graduates needed to fill them.\n       The National Software Alliance, a consortium of industry, \n     government and academic leaders, recently concluded that \n     ``The supply of computer science graduates is far short of \n     the number needed by industry.''\n       This is a critical problem that threatens to undermine \n     economic growth and new job creation. Computer hardware and \n     software industries have become one of the fastest-growing \n     sectors of our economy and now account for about a third of \n     our economic growth rate. A study by the Hudson Institute, an \n     Indiana think tank, warns that if this shortfall persists, it \n     will result in a 5 percent decline in the rate of economic \n     growth--the equivalent of $200 billion in lost output.\n       High-tech companies around the country are already \n     reporting that they have had to forgo major new contracts \n     because they cannot find enough skilled workers to fulfill \n     them. This is resulting in untold billions of dollars in lost \n     business and lost employment opportunities.\n       Mr. Abraham has a short-term solution to this problem and a \n     long-term one as well.\n       In the short term, he proposes we modestly raise the \n     immigration restrictions on the entry of skilled workers from \n     abroad by about 25,000. The number of allowable skilled \n     temporary workers has been frozen at 65,000 for nearly a \n     decade and last year businesses reached that yearly limit by \n     the middle of August. This year that limit could be reached \n     in May.\n       His bill, the American Competitiveness Act, also takes a \n     long-term approach to the problem, offering $50 million to \n     pay for more than 20,000 scholarships each year for low-\n     income students in the fields of math, engineering and \n     computer sciences. It also contains some additional funding \n     to train unemployed workers for related high-tech jobs.\n       No doubt his bill will be attacked by the protectionists \n     and nativists who continue to believe immigrants are a net \n     cost to our economy when, as the declining jobless rate \n     overwhelming shows, they are a net plus as workers and job-\n     creating employers.\n       But there is a very strong argument against the anti-\n     immigration offensive that every American will understand:\n       ``If American companies cannot find home-grown talent, and \n     if they cannot bring talent to this country, a large number \n     are likely to move key operations overseas, sending those and \n     related jobs currently held by Americans with them,'' Mr. \n     Abraham told his Senate colleagues last week.\n       Needless to say, his bill has a lot of support among \n     hundreds of high-tech executives like T. J. Rodgers, chief \n     executive of Cypress Semiconductor, Scott McNealy of Sun\n\n[[Page S2718]]\n\n     Microsystems, and Bill Gates, head of Microsoft, all of whom \n     are desperate for skilled workers. Mr. Gates and Mr. McNealy \n     alone have 4,522 technical job openings right now that they \n     cannot fill.\n       ``Raising these [skilled immigrant] caps . . . would be a \n     good thing for the technology industry and for the country,'' \n     Mr. Gates told the Senate earlier this month.\n       Not too many years ago the overriding issue in our country \n     was unemployment and job security. Today it is skilled, high-\n     paying jobs going begging and the specter of the mighty \n     American economy turning away business opportunities and \n     markets because it lacks qualified workers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/27/senate-section/article/S2715-4", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-4443.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 147\n\n       Whereas, The Great Lakes are unique and priceless \n     resources. In addition to their importance as the world's \n     most accessible source of fresh water, this network of inland \n     seas plays pivotal roles in transportation and in the \n     economies of the bordering states and Ontario; and\n       Whereas, A key component of Michigan's maritime \n     infrastructure is our system of small harbors. These harbors \n     are in jeopardy of losing the federal funding that provides \n     for maintenance through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The \n     Corps of Engineers has reportedly informed the Michigan \n     Department of Natural Resources that it plans to eliminate \n     funds for small harbor dredging and maintaining seawalls and \n     docks. For many years, the federal government and the state \n     have operated a partnership in keeping the small harbors. \n     While these are not major contributors to commercial \n     interests, the nearly fifty small harbors presently in \n     jeopardy are very important to boating and fishing activities \n     in this state. Boating and fishing represent as much as one \n     fifth of the state's tourism industry, a fundamental part of \n     our economy; and\n       Whereas, Another federal program in danger of being \n     eliminated or inadequately funded is the work of combating \n     the sea lamprey in the Great Lakes. This species is a \n     persistent threat to fishing. Individual states should not be \n     required to bear this economic burden alone. The federal \n     government has underfunded the lamprey control program to an \n     extent that forces Michigan to spend much more than it should \n     to deal with a problem facing several states and our \n     neighbors in Canada; and\n       Whereas, if the federal government abandons its commitments \n     in the areas of small harbor maintenance and lamprey control, \n     the ultimate result will be higher costs and more \n     difficulties for the region's economy and countless \n     communities. To eliminate or seriously cut federal investment \n     in the Great Lakes is a short-sighted approach to take; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to provide full funding for harbor \n     maintenance and lamprey control in the Great Lakes and to \n     urge other Great Lakes states to join in this effort; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the legislatures and \n     governors of the other states bordering the Great Lakes.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-373.

A bill to improve the ability of small businesses, Federal \nagencies, industry, and universities to work with Department of Energy \ncontractor-operated facilities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n   the department of ENERGY SMALL business and INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIP \n                        enhancement act OF 1998\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, partnerships among our federal \nlaboratories, universities, and industry provide important benefits to \nour nation. They help to create innovative new products and services \nthat drive our economy and improve our quality of life.\n  I have personally observed the positive impacts of well crafted \npartnerships. These partnerships enhance the ability of the \nlaboratories and other contractor-operated facilities of the Department \nof Energy to accomplish their federal missions at the same time that \nthe companies benefit though enhanced competitiveness from the \ntechnical resources available at these sites.\n  I have also seen important successes achieved by other federal \nagencies and companies that utilized the resources of the national \nlaboratories and other Department sites through contract research \nmechanisms. Contract research enables these sites to contribute their \ntechnical expertise in cases where the private sector can not supply a \ncustomer's needs. Partnerships and other interactions enable companies \nand other agencies to accomplish their own missions better, faster, and \ncheaper.\n  I've seen spectacular examples where small businesses have been \ncreated around breakthrough technologies from the national laboratories \nand other contractor-operated sites of the DOE. But, at present, only \nthe Department's Defense Programs has a specific program for small \nbusiness partnerships and assistance.\n  All programs of the Department have expertise that can be driving \nsmall business successes. Historically, in the United States, small \nbusinesses have often been the most innovative and the fastest to \nexploit new technical opportunities--all of the Department's programs \nshould be open to the small business interactions that Defense Programs \nhas so effectively utilized.\n  I have been concerned that barriers to these partnerships and \ninteractions continue to exist within the Department of Energy. In \naddition, the Department's laboratories and other sites need continuing \nencouragement to be fully receptive to partnership opportunities that \nmeet both their own mission objectives and industry's goals. And \nfinally, small business interactions should be encouraged across the \nDepartment of Energy, not only in Defense Programs.\n  For these reasons, I introduce today the Department of Energy Small \nBusiness and Industry Partnership Enhancement Act of 1998. This \nPartnership Enhancement Act removes barriers to more effective \nutilization of all of the Department's contractor-operated facilities \nby industry, other federal agencies, and universities. The bill covers \nall the Department's contractor-operated facilities--national \nlaboratories and their other sites like Kansas City, Pantex, Hanford, \nSavannah River, or the Nevada Test Site.\n  This bill also provides important encouragement to the contractor-\noperated sites to increase their partnerships and other interactions \nwith universities and companies. And finally, it creates opportunities \nfor small businesses to benefit from the technical resources available \nat all of the Department's contractor-operated facilities.\n  This bill amends the Atomic Energy Act, which limited the areas \nwherein the Department's facilities could provide contract research, \nnot in competition with the private sector, to only those mission areas \nundertaken in the earliest days of the AEC. My bill recognizes that the \nDepartment's responsibilities are far broader than the original AEC, \nand that all parts of the Department should be available to help on a \ncontract basis wherever capabilities are not available from private \nindustry.\n  One barrier at the Department to contract research involves charges \nadded by the Department to the cost of work accomplished by a site. \nThis bill requires that charges to customers for contract research at \nthese facilities be fully recovered, and stops the addition of extra \ncharges by the Department. The bill requires that any customer of\n\n[[Page S2720]]\n\nthese facilities pay only the direct charges at that facility for their \ncontracted work, plus an overhead rate that is calculated for broad \ngroups of customers. For example, where other federal agencies, \ncompanies, or universities do not require secure facilities or do not \nutilize the extensive special nuclear material capabilities of the \nlaboratories, then the customer will be charged an overhead rate that \nexcludes security costs and environmental legacy costs. This will \nensure that each class of customers is paying for the services they \nactually utilize.\n  The bill provides direct encouragement for expansion of partnerships \nand interactions with companies and universities by requiring that each \nfacility be annually judged for success in expanding these interactions \nin ways that support each facility's missions. The bill requires that \nthe external partnership and interaction program be considered in \nevaluating the annual contract performance at each site.\n  And finally, the bill sets up a new Small Business Partnership \nProgram in which all of the Department sites participate. This action \nwill enable small businesses across the United States to better access \nand partner with any of the Department's contractor-owned facilities. A \nfund for such interactions up to 0.25 percent of the total site budget \nis available for these small business interactions.\n  With these changes, Mr. President, the Department of Energy \nfacilities will be better able to meet their critical national \nmissions, while at the same time assisting other federal agencies, \nlarge and small businesses, and universities in better meeting their \ngoals and missions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1874\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to initiate a coordinated national effort to prevent, \ndetect, and educate the public concerning Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and \nFetal Alcohol Effect and to identify effective\n\n[[Page S2721]]\n\ninterventions for children, adolescents, and adults with Fetal Alcohol \nSyndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n  The Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect Prevention and \n                              Services Act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in numerous ways, this nation \ndemonstrates that our children are our most valuable investment and our \nmost precious asset. We work to improve their education, to give them \ngreater access to high quality health care, to minimize their exposure \nto tobacco and other addictive agents. We are driven to do all we can \nto help them realize their potential and achieve their personal and \nprofessional goals.\n  In that context, it is inconsistent and shortsighted that, year after \nyear, we pay little or no attention to a public health problem that is \n100 percent preventable, yet affects more and more children each year, \nand that inalterably damages physical, mental and emotional processes \ncritical to a child's ability to grow into an independent, fully \nfunctioning adult. The public health problem I am referring to is fetal \nalcohol syndrome. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and the related \ncondition, fetal alcohol effect (FAE), are lifelong conditions \ncharacterized by multiple physical, mental, and behavioral handicaps. \nFAS and FAE cross racial, ethnic and economic lines to affect families \nthroughout the United States. Both conditions are 100 percent \npreventable--and 100 percent irreversible.\n  In January of 1997, I introduced S.148, a bill to establish a program \nfor the prevention of FAS and FAE. S.148 calls for the development of \nan interagency task force at the federal level to promote prevention \nand detection of FAS and FAE, as well as a grant program to help \ncommunities expand public awareness and prevention at the state and \nlocal levels.\n  I introduced bills similar to S.148 in the 102nd, 103rd and 104th \nCongresses, but, as is too often the case, these measures were too \nmodest in scope to compete against ``the issue of the moment.'' Seven \nyears is a long time to push a bill, but I don't see this effort as a \nmatter of choice so much as a matter of necessity. It is a crime to sit \nback while more and more women each year drink during pregnancy and \nmore and more children each year are handicapped for life because of \nit.\n  In fact, the more I have learned about these conditions and their \nimpact on children and their families, the more apparent it is to me \nthat, if we truly care about children, we must not only embrace the \ngoals of S.148, we must go beyond them. Not only should we do all we \ncan to protect more children from a life sentence of devastating \nhandicaps, we should acknowledge that for many children, prevention \ncomes too late.\n  We must open our eyes to the fact that FAS and FAE children and their \nfamilies often have nowhere to turn for information, guidance and the \nsocial services necessary to respond to their special needs.Up to \n12,000 children with FAS are born each year in the United States. \nAccording to some estimates, the rate of FAE is 3 times that.\n  The incidence of FAS is nearly double that of Down's syndrome and \nalmost 5 times that of spinal bifida. The incidence of FAS may be as \nhigh as one per 100 in some Native American communities.\n  FAS and FAE are characterized by a complicated and debilitating array \nof mental, physical, and behavioral problems. FAS is the leading cause \nof mental retardation, and, let me repeat, it is 100 percent \npreventable.\n  But rather than setting our sites on decreasing the incidence of FAS \nand FAE, the nation is witnessing a rapid increase in its incidence. In \n1995, the Centers for Disease Control reported a six-fold increase in \nthe percentage of babies born with FAS over the preceding 15 years. \nAgain according to the CDC, rates of alcohol use during pregnancy \nincreased significantly between 1991 and 1995, especially the rates of \n``frequent drinking.''\n  This trend defies the Surgeon General's warning against drinking \nwhile pregnant. It defies a strongly worded advisory issued in 1991 by \nthe American Medical Association urging women to abstain from all \nalcohol during pregnancy. Clearly, we need to do more to discourage \nwomen from risking their children's future by drinking while pregnant.\n  In addition to the tragic consequences for thousands of children and \ntheir families, these disturbing trends have immense implications from \na fiscal perspective. The costs associated with caring for individuals \nwith FAS and FAE are staggering.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the \nlifetime cost of treating an individual with FAS is almost $1.4 \nmillion. The total cost in terms of health care and social services to \ntreat all Americans with FAS was estimated at $2.7 billion in 1995. \nThis is an extraordinary and unnecessary expense.\n  To the extent we can prevent FAS and FAE and help parents respond \nappropriately to the special needs of their children, we can reduce \ninstitutionalizations, incarcerations and the continual use of medical \nand mental health services that otherwise may be inevitable. It makes \nfiscal sense, but far more importantly, it is the humane thing to do.\n  The bill I am introducing today will establish a national task force \ncomprised of parents, educators, researchers and representatives from \nrelevant federal, state and local agencies. That task force will take \non a difficult and critically important task. It will be responsible \nfor reporting to Congress on FAS and FAE--on the nature and scope of \nthe problem, the current response at the federal, state and local \nlevels, and on ways the federal government can help states and \nlocalities make further progress. In conjunction with the task force \nefforts, the Secretary would establish a competitive grants program. \nThis program would provide the resources necessary to operationalize \nthe task force recommendations.\n  The concept of a national task force with membership from outside of, \nas well as within, the federal government make sense for FAS and FAE, \nbecause the true experts on these conditions are the parents and \nprofessionals who deal with the cause and effects of these conditions \nday in and day out. If we want to respond appropriately, parents, \nteachers, social workers, and researchers should have a place at the \ntable. A national task force will also provide the opportunity for \ncommunities to share best practices, preventing states that are newer \nto this problem from having to ``reinvent the wheel.''\n  Mr. President, responding to the tragedy of alcohol-related birth \ndefects is an urgent cause. I would like to thank the many concerned \nparents, researchers, educators, and federal agencies who helped \ndevelop this bill. Their input has produced what I believe is a solid \nresponse to the challenge and obligation before us. I urge my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me in an effort that \ncan save children from a legacy of unnecessary and overwhelming \nhandicaps, and help those for whom prevention is too late to live \nindependent, fulfilling lives. I believe that if they look at this \nissue closely, they will agree that it would be a crime to do any less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1875\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and \n     Fetal Alcohol Effect Prevention and Services Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the leading known cause of \n     mental retardation, and it is 100 percent preventable;\n       (2) each year, up to 12,000 infants are born in the United \n     States with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, suffering irreversible \n     physical and mental damage;\n       (3) thousands more infants are born each year with Fetal \n     Alcohol Effect, also known as Alcohol Related Neurobehavioral \n     Disorder (ARND), a related and equally tragic syndrome;\n       (4) children of women who use alcohol while pregnant have a \n     significantly higher infant mortality rate (13.3 per 1000) \n     than children of those women who do not use alcohol (8.6 per \n     1000);\n       (5) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect are \n     national problems which can impact any child, family, or \n     community, but their threat to American Indians and Alaska \n     Natives is especially alarming;\n\n[[Page S2722]]\n\n       (6) in some American Indian communities, where alcohol \n     dependency rates reach 50 percent and above, the chances of a \n     newborn suffering Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol \n     Effect are up to 30 times greater than national averages;\n       (7) in addition to the immeasurable toll on children and \n     their families, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol \n     Effect pose extraordinary financial costs to the Nation, \n     including the costs of health care, education, foster care, \n     job training, and general support services for affected \n     individuals;\n       (8) the total cost to the economy of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     was approximately $2,500,000,000 in 1995, and over a \n     lifetime, health care costs for one Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     child are estimated to be at least $1,400,000;\n       (9) researchers have determined that the possibility of \n     giving birth to a baby with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal \n     Alcohol Effect increases in proportion to the amount and \n     frequency of alcohol consumed by a pregnant woman, and that \n     stopping alcohol consumption at any point in the pregnancy \n     reduces the emotional, physical, and mental consequences of \n     alcohol exposure to the baby; and\n       (10) though approximately 1 out of every 5 pregnant women \n     drink alcohol during their pregnancy, we know of no safe dose \n     of alcohol during pregnancy, or of any safe time to drink \n     during pregnancy, thus, it is in the best interest of the \n     Nation for the Federal Government to take an active role in \n     encouraging all women to abstain from alcohol consumption \n     during pregnancy.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to establish, within the \n     Department of Health and Human Services, a comprehensive \n     program to help prevent Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal \n     Alcohol Effect nationwide and to provide effective \n     intervention programs and services for children, adolescents \n     and adults already affected by these conditions. Such program \n     shall--\n       (1) coordinate, support, and conduct national, State, and \n     community-based public awareness, prevention, and education \n     programs on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect;\n       (2) coordinate, support, and conduct prevention and \n     intervention studies as well as epidemiologic research \n     concerning Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect;\n       (3) coordinate, support and conduct research and \n     demonstration projects to develop effective developmental and \n     behavioral interventions and programs that foster effective \n     advocacy, educational and vocational training, appropriate \n     therapies, counseling, medical and mental health, and other \n     supportive services, as well as models that integrate or \n     coordinate such services, aimed at the unique challenges \n     facing individuals with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal \n     Alcohol Effect and their families; and\n       (4) foster coordination among all Federal, State and local \n     agencies, and promote partnerships between research \n     institutions and communities that conduct or support Fetal \n     Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect research, programs, \n     surveillance, prevention, and interventions and otherwise \n     meet the general needs of populations already affected or at \n     risk of being impacted by Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal \n     Alcohol Effect.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend part S of title I of the Omnibus Crime \nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to permit the use of certain \namounts for assistance to jail-based substance treatment programs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  \n\n\n[[Page S2723]]\n\n      THE JAIL-BASED SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT PROGRAM ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. LUGAR Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation amending \nthe Residential Substance Abuse Treatment program, known as R-SAT, to \nenable jurisdictions below the state level to realize greater benefits \nfrom the program. The R-SAT program allows the Attorney General to make \ngrants for the establishment of treatment programs within local \ncorrectional facilities, but only a few jurisdictions have been able to \ntake advantage of these grants.\n  The legislation I am offering today will solve this problem by \nestablishing a separate Jail-Based Substance Abuse Treatment Program, \nor J-SAT. Under this new program, states will be explicitly authorized \nto devote up to ten percent of the funds they receive under R-SAT to \nqualifying J-SAT programs.\n  This legislation will provide matching funds to jail-based treatment \nprograms that meet several criteria. First, the program must be at \nleast three months in length. This is the minimum amount of time for a \ntreatment program to have the desired effect. To qualify for funding, a \nprogram must also have been in existence for at least two years. This \ncriterion is intended to ensure that jurisdictions which have already \ndemonstrated a commitment to treatment programs at the local level \nreceive first priority for funding. It also ensures that scarce \ntreatment resources are allocated to programs with a demonstrable track \nrecord of success. The third criteria for programs seeking J-SAT \nfunding is that the treatment regimen must include regular drug \ntesting. This is necessary to ensure that some objective measure of the \nprogram's success is available. Grant recipients are also encouraged to \nprovide the widest range of aftercare services possible, including job \ntraining, education and self-help programs. These steps are necessary \nto leverage the resources devoted to solving the problem of substance \nabuse, and to give individuals involved in treatment the best possible \nchance for successful rehabilitation.\n  I am offering this legislation because substance abuse and problems \narising from it are putting a severe strain on the resources of local \njurisdictions throughout the nation. This is not a minor problem. The \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy indicates that approximately \nthree-fourths of prison inmates--and over half of those in jails or on \nprobation--are substance abusers, yet only a small percentage of \ninmates participate in treatment programs while they are incarcerated. \nThe time during which drug-using offenders are in custody or under \npost-release correctional supervision presents a unique opportunity to \nreduce drug use and crime through effective drug testing and treatment \nprograms.\n  Research indicates that programs like J-SAT can help to reduce the \nstrain on our communities by cutting drug use in half; by reducing \nother criminal activity like shoplifting, assault, and drug sales by up \nto 80 percent; and by reducing arrests for all crimes by up to 64 \npercent.\n  I would also note that jail-based treatment programs are cost \neffective. In 1994, the American Correctional Association estimated the \nannual cost of incarceration at $18,330. The Office of National Drug \nControl Policy states that treatment while in prison and under post-\nincarceration supervision can reduce recidivism by roughly 50 percent. \nThus, for every $1,800 the government invests in treatment, it saves \nmore than $9,000.

Jail-based substance abuse treatment.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 1877. A bill to remove barriers to the provision of affordable \nhousing for all Americans; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\n\n           the affordable housing barrier removal act of 1998\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, In Oregon and across America, people are \nstarting to think that ``affordable housing'' is the biggest oxymoron \nsince ``jumbo shrimp''. Decent houses have become unaffordable for many \nworking moderate-income families. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nthe ``Affordable Housing Barrier Removal Act.'' This bill encourages \nall governments to streamline regulations to help bring home ownership \nwithin the reach of middle class families who can only dream of it \ntoday.\n\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) says that \nhousing is affordable if all costs--mortgage, utilities, property taxes \nand insurance--consume no more than 30 percent of household gross \nincome. Yet in Clackamas County, Oregon, for example, the median family \nincome is $49,600, while the average cost of a house is $200,000. This \nmakes it virtually impossible for many people, especially young \nfamilies, to obtain all the benefits of home ownership.\n  While many factors contribute to real estate prices, one of the main \nthings that drives prices higher is the proliferation of government \nrules and fees. In Portland, fully 5 percent of the average home price \nof $155,400 comes directly from permit fees and so-called ``system \ndelivery charges,'' some of which may serve worthwhile purposes, but \nshould be re-examined as a total package. All of these added costs are \neventually passed onto the buyer and often keep families from buying \nhomes they could otherwise afford.\n  The federal government has a role to play in the affordable housing \ndebate. It can promote community goals of environmental protection, \naccess for people with disabilities, and better transportation \nplanning, in the context of their financial impact on home buyers.\n  This bill, the Affordable Housing Barrier Removal Act of 1998, would \ndo this by encouraging the formation of Barrier Removal Councils in \nevery local jurisdiction that receives HUD block grants for community \ndevelopment. Mr. President, back home in Oregon I have assembled a \nhousing task force to advise me on housing policies. My task force told \nme that communities need to sit down and examine the issue of \naffordable housing before the bricks are set and the mortar is poured. \nThat's why these Barrier Removal Councils are important. These councils \nwould be charged with taking the kind of big-picture approach that can \nidentify ways to lower barriers to home ownership that overlapping and \noutdated regulations cause. In other words, we need to look at the \nforest as a whole, not just one tree at a time.\n  This bill is similar to legislation I introduced last week to \nestablish a special bicameral Sunset Committee in Congress to review \nevery federal program every five years. Programs, regulations, and laws \ntend to pile up because legislatures at both the local and federal \nlevels generally work to address specific problems, one at a time, \noften forgetting to examine the cumulative effect of prior laws. There \nis a need to set up mechanisms to examine regulations affecting \naffordable housing in their totality. This bill would also call for a \nspecial national conference every two years to discuss regulations that \nmay be barriers, and creates a national clearinghouse to provide \ninformation to communities on the work being done to remove barriers in \nother parts of the country.\n  This legislation will help home buyers by improving some of the ways \nthe Federal Housing Administration--the lender for many middle-income \nfamilies--operates. It allows them to make loans to more people, by \nredefining the areas they operate in. And it simplifies the convoluted \nprocess that FHA uses to determine the down payment that a family is \nexpected to make. You should not need Bill Gates' money to afford a \nhome and you should not need his math skills to figure out how much \nyour house is going to cost.\n  Finally, Mr. President, our bill asks the federal government to take \nthe impact on home buyers into account by requiring all federal \nagencies to include a housing impact analysis, except on policies where \nthere is no impact. The Housing Impact Statement focuses the attention \nof agencies on the question ``how does this policy affect home prices'' \nevery time it tries to solve a problem by instituting a new regulation. \nIt is always important for government at every level to understand the \nconsequences of its actions. This is an effort to try to instill that \ngood government philosophy into the housing area.\n\n[[Page S2725]]\n\n  Home ownership has always been part of the American Dream. It is \neveryone's responsibility to keep it from just being a dream for \nworking families.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with Senator \nWyden, the Affordable Housing Barrier Removal Act of 1998. According to \nthe National Association of Home Builders, housing compromises 12 \npercent of the economy of the United States and the housing \nconstruction and remodeling industries employ approximately 2 million \npeople each year. However, housing costs continue to rise and housing \naffordability continues to be a challenge for many American families.\n  Unnecessary regulations contribute significantly to the costs of \nhousing. Layers of excessive and unnecessary regulation imposed by all \nlevels of government--federal, state, and local--can add 20 to 35 \npercent to the cost of a new home.\n  Mr. President, the removal of regulatory burdens is essential to \nincreasing the home ownership rate in the United States. Home ownership \nis the cornerstone of family security, stability, and prosperity. \nCongress has the responsibility to do all that it can to encourage and \npromote policies that increase homeownership.\n  Mr. President, it is for these reasons that Senator Wyden and I \nintroduce the Barriers bill today. This bipartisan bill has three major \ngoals. First, the bill require federal agencies to evaluate any new \nrule or regulations to determine if they have an impact on the cost of \nhousing. Second, the bill will encourage states and localities to bring \ntogether all the parties involved in the production of housing and \nthose who regulate them to discuss barriers and how to remove them. \nThird, the bill will remove outdated requirements in the Federal \nHousing Administration's single-family mortgage insurance program to \nmake the program more efficient.\n  In addition to the major goals of the legislation, the Barriers bill \nwill authorize the United States Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD) to become more involved in comprehensive efforts to \nencourage barrier removal activities. As the federal entity that \noversees our national housing policy, HUD must be actively involved in \nstrategies and activities to remove regulatory burdens to produce more \naffordable housing.\n  Mr. President, while there is no doubt regulations are necessary to \nprotect our workers and our environment, there must be a commonsense \napproach to relief from excessive regulatory burdens that impact other \nsectors of the economy. I look forward to the input from my other \ncolleagues and others involved in the housing industry about this \nlegislation. I believe it opens an important and timely dialogue, and I \ncommend Senator Wyden for the leadership he is showing on this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1878. A bill to amend the Immigration Nationality Act to authorize \na temporary increase in the number of skilled foreign workers admitted \nto the United States, to improve efforts to recruit United States \nworkers in lieu of foreign workers, and to enforce labor conditions \nregrading non-immigrant aliens; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n        the high-tech immigration and u.s. worker protection act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join Senator Feinstein to \nintroduce legislation to grant a temporary increase in immigration \nquotas for high tech jobs, while taking additional steps to ensure that \nmore American workers are trained for these jobs.\n  For the next decade, high tech industries will create over a million \nnew jobs in the United States. Some have called for a permanent \nincrease in the quotas, to ensure that companies have the workers they \nneed to survive in this highly competitive market.\n  The problem is obvious. A permanent increase would permanently deny \nthese good jobs to American workers, and that's not acceptable. The \nlabor market will adjust in time, as it always does, as more and more \nAmericans enter this field. It would be a mistake to tilt the balance \nunfairly against them.\n  Our immigration laws should not undercut the ability of young \nAmericans, downsized defense workers, and others to enter this dynamic \nfield.\n  This week, the General Accounting Office sent a clear warning on this \nissue, saying that the job market studies used by the industry are \nflawed, and do not prove that significant worker shortage exists.\n  Our legislation will accomplish three goals:\n  First, it provides a temporary increase in immigration quotas from \n65,000 to 90,000 visas a year for the next three years. This increase \nwill enable U.S. companies to hire the workers they need now.\n  Second, we invest in training U.S. workers. Americans want these \njobs, and they deserve the training needed to get them. Our bill \nproposes a modest $250 application fee for each foreign worker sought \nunder the immigration quota. The fee will raise approximately $100 \nmillion each year over the next three years to fund training \nopportunities for Americans.\n  Third, our bill strengthens the enforcement of the immigration laws. \nIt gives the Labor Department greater authority and resources to ensure \nthat employers pay the proper wage and meet other standards in hiring \nforeign workers. We specifically make it illegal for employers to lay \noff American workers and hire foreign workers to replace them. In other \nwords, employers should hire at home first in obtaining new workers, \nbefore importing them from abroad.\n  We believe these steps meet the immediate needs of this important \nindustry, while preserving the priority we own our own workers, and we \nurge Congress to enact them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Kennedy-Feinstein High-Tech Immigration and United States Worker \n                             Protection Act\n\n       Temporarily increases 65,000-visa immigration quota of \n     temporary foreign professional and skilled workers (``H-1B \n     visas'').\n       FY 98-2000: 90,000 visas.\n       After FY2000, return to 65,000 visas annually.\n       Creates $100 million training program funded through $250 \n     employer user fee.\n       $90 million for loans to workers to obtain training.\n       $10 million to local ``regional skills alliances'' to \n     identify local labor market needs and develop strategies.\n       Enhances Accountability and Program Integrity.\n       Authority to investigate: Provides Labor Department \n     independent ability to enforce labor laws against those who \n     break the law instead of waiting for a complaint.

Mr. President, I voted yesterday against the \nlegislation to disapprove the certification of Mexico as cooperating \nwith U.S. counter-narcotics efforts. Given the level of attention that \nhas been paid recently to continuing problems with Mexican anti-drug \nefforts, I want to make clear the reasons for my vote.\n  I am under no illusions about Mexican performance in combating drug \ntrafficking and corruption. But the question we face is whether \ndecertification would make the situation better or worse.\n  We have a long land border with Mexico. Our economies are closely \nlinked. Our relationship with Mexico is much more diverse and \nsignificant than the single issue of drugs. We need Mexico's \ncooperation on drugs, and we need it on a host of other issues as well. \nIf we were to decertify Mexico, we would kill all cooperation in the \ndrug war and spoil the atmosphere in the rest of our relationship as \nwell. We would be sending a message of a complete loss of confidence in \nMexico. I do not believe that this is a message we really want to send.\n  Fighting the drug war is no simple task. A country's efforts cannot \nbe reduced to a simple statement of ``fully cooperating'' with the \nUnited States or not. In this respect, the entire drug certification \nprocess is fatally flawed. While the senior leadership in Mexico is \ncommitted to fighting drugs, the task before them is enormous. Even the \nmost strenuous efforts by a government could not guarantee 100 percent \nsuccess against a multi-billion dollar industry. There is no black or \nwhite answer.\n  What matters most is that U.S. assistance to Mexico to help fight the \nwar on drugs serves U.S. interests. For as challenging as the situation \nis now, imagine how much worse it would be if there were no U.S. \nassistance to Mexico to combat drug trafficking at the source. We would \nbe hurting our own interests as much as Mexico's if we were to \ndecertify Mexico and dramatically reduce our counter-narcotics \nassistance.\n  Finally, we need to bear in mind that the only reason there is such a \nmassive effort by the drug lords to supply drugs is because the United \nStates provides such a massive demand. By all means, we must fight the \nsupply chain by working together with our neighbors against drug \nproduction and trafficking. But we must also continue to take our share \nof the responsibility in the United States and fight the demand for \ndrugs here at home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/27/senate-section/article/S2726-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2726-S2727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEXICO DRUG DECERTIFICATION\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate Joint \nResolution 42, the resolution of disapproval.\n  Much has already been said on this issue, and I will make my comments \nbrief.\n  The United States Government has been working with the Government of \nMexico for over a decade on fighting the flow of drugs.\n  Year after year, we have received promises, commitments, and \ndeclarations to reduce the flow of narcotics from Mexico. But we have \nnot seen the concrete actions that are required to block the flow of \ncocaine, heroin, and marijuana into the United States.\n  For example, in 1997, Mexico agreed to facilitate the extradition of \nnarcotics traffickers. In fact, no Mexican national has been extradited \nand surrendered to the United States as a result of that agreement.\n  In a recent hearing, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nheard from witnesses from the Justice Department, the Central \nIntelligence Agency, and the Drug Enforcement Administration on the \nstatus of Mexican antidrug efforts.\n  While I cannot go into detail, their testimony was not at all \noptimistic and was, in fact, extremely disturbing to me.\n  Of greatest concern is the endemic corruption that runs rampant at \nall levels throughout those Mexican institutions tasked with combating \nnarcotics trafficking.\n  The story on the front page of today's New York Times, describing \ncorruption in the ranks of the Mexican military is, if accurate, \nespecially disturbing, since the military is considered less corrupt \nthan the Federal police force.\n  While Mexican officials often speak of efforts to prevent this \ncorruption, no definitive steps have been taken to target the illicit \ndrug monies that make this corruption possible. New laws are discussed, \ndebated, in some cases even enacted, but they are not implemented.\n\n[[Page S2727]]\n\n  And while there have been a few highly publicized prosecutions of \ncorrupt officials, many more are allowed to retire or are simply \nreassigned.\n  I wonder whether criminal prosecution is selective and whether such \ndeterminations are themselves reflections of such corruption.\n  Again, actions speak louder than words.\n  I understand that the Clinton administration and other regional \ngovernments are discussing the concept of a regional approach to drug \ncooperation certification, to replace the current process.\n  I have serious doubts about replacing the current system with \nregional certification, since the almost certain result would be that \nMexico and others would be given a pass rather than being held \naccountable for their actions. Simply stated, it would make \ncertification a meaningless process of averaging an array of mediocre \nand poor performances.\n  Furthermore, before considering Mexico as a member of such a regional \ngroup, we should consider Mexico's participation in current regional \ncounternarcotics efforts. It is hardly encouraging.\n  For example, the Joint Inter-Agency Task Force located in Key West, \nFL, is one such organization. It includes representatives from all of \nthe United States armed services, as well as law enforcement agencies, \nand an equal contribution from our British and Dutch allies.\n  I urge my colleagues to visit the Task Force and hear their \nfrustrations regarding Mexico. Again, while Mexico says it is using \nevery asset to prevent the transshipment of drugs into the United \nStates, the officials there will tell you this is just not so.\n  They cite example after example of the detection and tracking of \ndrug-carrying ships and planes.\n  But when it comes to handing off these targets to the Mexican \nauthorities, there is either no response or such a limited and late \nresponse, the traffickers often escape and disappear into Mexico.\n  When we make informal suggestions that Mexico send its \nrepresentatives to the multi-national task force to correct this \nproblem, the response is that they are willing to discuss it. But, they \nhave been discussing it for several years now.\n  Mr. President, for these reasons I strongly support the resolution to \ndecertify Mexico. It is time to judge Mexico on its actions rather than \nempty promises.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/27/senate-section/article/S2726-3", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2727-S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO AFRICA: AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR U.S. NATIONAL \n                               INTERESTS\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the \nPresident's current trip to Africa and the importance of Africa to \nUnited States national interests. I highly applaud the President's \ndecision to go to Africa. The President's trip to Ghana, Botswana, \nSouth Africa, Uganda, Senegal and Rwanda comes on the heels of visits \nto the region last year by both the First Lady and the Secretary of \nState. This marks only the second time that an American President has \nundertaken an official trip to sub-Saharan Africa, and the first visit \nto any of the countries on the President's itinerary. As we have seen \nby the warm reception that the President has enjoyed so far, this first \nvisit in 20 years by an American President carries considerable \nsymbolic significance for the 650 million people in Africa. For the 270 \nmillion people of America, the President's visit will help further \nstrengthen U.S.-Africa relations and promote important national \ninterests.\n  President Clinton's trip highlights a very different Africa from the \none President Carter saw during the first Presidential visit in 1978. \nAt that time, Washington largely viewed Africa as merely another \nbattleground for U.S.-Soviet Cold War competition. Today, in many parts \nof the region nations are working to reform politically and \neconomically. More elections have occurred at all levels of government \nin the last five years than in the last two decades. The traditional \nimage of African states controlled by dictatorial strongmen is giving \nway to multiparty political systems with an increasing appreciation for \ndemocratic institutions and processes. And economically, many African \ncountries have rejected the failed policies of central planning in \nfavor of privatization of state assets and the creation of free \nmarkets.\n  Mr. President, the image that we often see of Africa in the media \nlargely is one of famine, instability, and ethnic conflict. The purpose \nof the President's trip is to refocus the international spotlight to \ninclude the emerging economic and political renaissance that is \noccurring in some countries. I applaud President Clinton's recognition \nof the importance of including Rwanda in his itinerary. In contrast to \nthe relatively positive outlook for the other countries on the \nPresident's itinerary, the outlook for Rwanda is not so clear and \nbright. Rwanda is still reeling from the aftershocks of the brutal 1994 \ngenocide that resulted in the deaths of upwards of 800,000 men, women \nand children. For the last two years, more than 120,000 accused \ngenocidaires have waited in prison for a trial. The country remains \nunder insurgent attack by the 1994 genocidaires who are now based in \nneighboring Congo.\n  Rwanda is still waiting for justice. Rwanda--and the rest of Central \nAfrica--will not be able to move forward until there is justice for the \nvictims of genocide. Justice is the critical factor that will either \nallow that country to move forward, or see it fall backwards into \nbloodshed. I support the President's proposed Great Lakes Justice \nInitiative to assist the states of the region to strengthen judicial \nsystems and the rule of law. I also urge the Administration to continue \nits efforts to ensure the effectiveness of the International War Crimes \nTribunal for Rwanda. The Tribunal was established over three years ago \nto bring to justice leaders of the 1994 genocide. To date, however, \nonly 35 persons have been indicted and the Tribunal has yet to hand \ndown its first sentence. By contrast, the Yugoslav Tribunal already has \ncases in the appeal stage. The Tribunal s effective and efficient \nfunctioning will be key to allowing the Rwandan justice system the \npolitical and legal flexibility it needs to deal with the 120,000 men \nin prison.\n  Mr. President, Rwanda is not the only troubled African nation. Some \nnations, such as Liberia, the Central African Republic, and Angola, are \nat critical crossroads and will make decisions that will have a \nsignificant impact on their political and economic futures. Others, \nsuch as Nigeria, Sudan and Cameroon, have resisted the tide of \npolitical openness and economic reform that is sweeping through their \nneighbors and have remained repressive. As the President continues \ncurrent efforts in Africa and undertakes new initiatives, it is \ncritical that the United States strongly and clearly encourages those \ncountries at the crossroads to choose the right road. At the same time, \nwe should be unambiguous in our non-acceptance of those countries that \ncontinue to choose political repression and failed economic policies.\n  One of the most critical tests that United States foreign policy \ncurrently faces in Africa is the Democratic Republic of Congo. An \nenormous country the size of the United States east of the Mississippi \nRiver, the Congo is strategically located in the heart of Africa. \nBordered by nine different countries, it is at once a Southern and \nCentral African state. Blessed with natural and human resources, this \ncountry for the last thirty years has been cursed with poor leadership \nand financial ruin. The term kleptocracy was coined for the despotic \nrule of former President Mobutu Sese Seko which saw billions of dollars \nof foreign assistance misappropriated and the national coffers drained.\n  Foreign Relations Committee staff members who traveled to Congo last \nmonth saw a country in crisis. Critical infrastructure such as health \nand transportation are in disarray. There is no justice system to speak \nof. Human rights conditions are, in the words of one international \nhuman rights worker, catastrophic. The Congolese President, Laurent \nKabila, a guerilla opposed to the former government for most of his \nadult life, has no relevant experience governing a country. The same is \ntrue for most of his cabinet. Perhaps the only positive news to report \nis that the security situation is relatively calmer for the moment than \nit has been in recent years. As discouraging a picture as this might \nbe, recent Central African history has shown that\n\n[[Page S2728]]\n\nCongo's future disposition will have a significant impact on its \nneighbors with potential consequences for much of Africa--and United \nStates national interests.\n  Mr. President, some might wonder whether the United States has any \ninterests in Africa. Since the end of the Cold War, there are those who \nhave argued that the United States should cut back on its engagements \nabroad. In regards to Africa, they argue that we should focus on \nregions of greater geopolitical and economic importance. Let me state \nclearly my belief that without a doubt the United States needs to be \nactively engaged in Africa.\n  Why? Because just as we support democracy, free trade and human \nrights in the rest of the world, so too should we continue to support \nthese goals in Africa. Moreover, the United States has strong economic \ninterests in Africa. U.S. exports to Africa last year totaled $6.2 \nbillion, more than total U.S. exports to all of the states of the \nformer Soviet Union combined. Since 1994, U.S. trade with sub-Saharan \nAfrica has grown on average at 16.9% annually, outpacing growth in \nglobal trade in 1995 and 1996. Through our engagement with Africa we \nsupport and encourage partners who cherish the same values that we do. \nBy encouraging political and economic stability we contribute to the \npreservation of our own nation s continued prosperity and security.\n  Mr. President, some among us may be disillusioned into believing that \nour interests in Africa are purely humanitarian, that Africa doesn t \nhold any strategic value for the United States. When I hear statements \nto this effect, I have to wonder whether they are living in the same \nworld as the rest of us. As we have seen with the recent Asian \nfinancial crisis, global drug trade, and even the El Nino weather \nphenomenon, Americans today are more interconnected, if not \ninterdependent, with the rest of the world than at any previous time in \nour nation's history. At this unique point in time as the sole \nsuperpower with the ability virtually to reach around the globe, the \nrest of the world has an equally unprecedented ability to touch us \nback. In such a global environment it is vital to our nation's security \nthat we exercise vigilance in the conduct of our foreign relations.\n  Mr. President, even if we could stick our head in the sand, the rest \nof our body would be exposed to all of the negative consequences that a \nneglected Africa would incur. Imagine the effects of a large region of \nthe world ignored and not encouraged to develop effective health \nsystems, where new exotic diseases are not checked but given free reign \nto develop and old ones can develop drug resistance. The Asian bird flu \nwould be nothing compared to what we might see. Imagine nations with \nminimal resources but great needs not supported to effectively maintain \ntheir natural environment, and compelled to compromise rainforests and \nnatural ecosystems vital to our planet's well-being. If we think El \nNino is bad, just wait until we meet his big brother.\n  Mr. President, we wouldn't allow this to occur in any other part of \nthe world, and we certainly can not afford to allow this to happen in \nAfrica. Protecting American interests in Africa is no simple task. The \nsubtleties and complexities that confront us in the 48 nations of sub-\nSaharan Africa require diplomatic skill and finesse. How does Rwanda \nmove to democracy whilst Hutus vastly outnumber Tutsis, and distrust \nand violence on both sides goes back generations? How do ethnic \ncommunities in Kenya share power in such a way that the rights of the \nminority are protected? How does the Congo move towards democratic \ngovernance and financial responsibility after a generation of \nmisgovernment and kleptocracy?\n  There are no easy solutions to any of these questions, but the \nanswers must be found if Africa is to advance politically and \neconomically--and U.S. national interests are to be protected--into the \nnext century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/27/senate-section/article/S2727-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SHANNON WRIGHT\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to remember and \nhonor a young Arkansas school teacher who made the ultimate sacrifice \nfor one of her students.\n  Children often think of their teachers as heros. And there is no \nbetter word than ``hero'' to describe a courageous woman named Shannon \nWright, a thirty-two year old English teacher at Westside Middle \nSchool. Shannon died in the tragic schoolyard shooting Tuesday along \nwith four students. In the hail of gunfire, she gave her life in order \nto protect an eleven-year old girl, Emma Pittman. Emma says she \nbelieves Mrs. Wright saw the bullets coming and shielded her from being \nhit. Shannon was shot twice while she tried to protect the young girl \nfrom injury.\n  In the words of Emma Pittman's mother, ``I feel she needs a hero \naward for saving our child. I want her family to know how grateful we \nare because she didn't think of herself--she thought of the children.''\n  While Shannon will forever be remembered as a hero, it will be \nextremely difficult to ease the pain her death has brought. Shannon \nWright was not only a teacher, she was a mother, a daughter, and a \nwife. She left behind her husband of twelve years, Mitchell, and her \n2\\1/2\\ year old son Zane. Her life was devoted to serving others, and \nshe was deeply loved by her family and her many friends. The loss of \nShannon Wright will be mourned not only by those whose lives she \ntouched everyday, but by the entire Jonesboro community, the state of \nArkansas, and people throughout our nation.\n  This horrible act of violence has caused incredible pain for the \npeople of Northeast Arkansas. We grieve not only for Shannon Wright, \nbut for the four girls who were killed, Natalie Brooks, Paige Herring, \nStephanie Johnson, and Brittheny Varner. It's impossible to understand \nwhy such a tragedy occurred, especially in a schoolyard. While it seems \nthat nothing good could ever come from something so terrible, Shannon \nWright's death taught her students and the rest of us an incredibly \nimportant lesson about the power of selfless action. Shannon Wright's \nselfless action saved a young girl's life.\n  Shannon Wright will always be remembered as a hero who gave her life \nto protect the children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/27/senate-section/article/S2728-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ORDER FOR STAR PRINT--SENATE REPORT 105-170\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, momentarily I believe that the minority \nleader will be in the Chamber. We have a unanimous consent agreement \nthat we want to enter into with regard to the Coverdell education \nsavings account bill. I think everybody knows it has been one we have \ngone back and forth on for a week. I think what we have come up with is \na fair process, if I can describe it while we wait on Senator Daschle.\n  Basically, it would be in order, under the unanimous consent \nagreement, that we go to the Coverdell A+ bill as has been amended with \nthe prepaid college tuition issue and the deduction for employer-\nprovided education benefits, as well as the school construction bond \nissue.\n  It would make in order, I believe it is 17 amendments, 12 that would \nbe offered by identified Senators on the Democratic side, 5 on the \nRepublican side, but all amendments are education related, all of them \nare subject to second degree and they would be debated 30 minutes each \non the first- and the second-degree amendments.\n  I think it is a fair agreement. If we were able to achieve cloture, \nwhich we might have been able to do on the next vote, we still would \nhave had 30 hours that could have been spent on it.\n  I think to have a good healthy debate on education is long overdue. \nDemocrats have some ideas; Republicans have some ideas. But the \nimportant thing is, what can we do to help the quality of education in \nAmerica, what can we do to deal with violence in schools? We saw just \nthis past week what happened in Arkansas, and it has happened in my own \nState of Mississippi, and it has happened in Kentucky. There are \ngrowing incidents of children coming to school with guns or knives. It \nis good to have a healthy discussion on both sides of the aisle and \nconsider each other's ideas.\n  I have looked down at the list of these amendments, and I see \namendments on both sides of the aisle that look attractive to me. I \nthink it is not only good, I think it is long overdue. I know it has \nbeen a long process, difficult for the leaders on both sides, but I \nthink it is a good agreement, and I would like to enter into it now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote \nscheduled for later next week be vitiated, and on Monday, April 20, \nnotwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. \n2646, the Coverdell A+ savings account bill; that it be considered \nunder the following agreement, with each amendment to be offered in the \nfirst degree subject to education second degrees, except that no \nsecond-degree amendment relative to IDEA uniform standards be in order, \nand the time on the first degree be limited to 30 minutes, except for a \ntime limit of 1 hour on the Moseley-Braun amendment, and second-degree \namendments limited to 30 minutes to be equally divided in the usual \nform.\n  The amendments are as follows: Boxer amendment regarding after-school \nprograms; Bumpers amendment regarding increased funds for Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act; Bingaman amendment regarding dropout \nprevention; Conrad amendment regarding education IRA income limits; \nDodd amendment regarding special education; Glenn amendment regarding \nstrike IRA for private school use; Kennedy amendment regarding \nteachers; Landrieu amendment regarding blue ribbon schools; Moseley-\nBraun amendment regarding school construction; Murray amendment \nregarding class size; Levin amendment regarding technical training and \nvocational education; Wellstone amendment with regard to education as \nwork for TANF, that is basically going from welfare to work; the \nHutchison amendment regarding same-sex schools; Coats amendment \nregarding increase in charitable deductions; Mack amendment regarding \nteacher testing and merit pay; Gregg amendment regarding IDEA \nflexibility; and the Gorton amendment regarding block grant.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \nabove-listed amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading, and \nfinal passage occur, all without any intervening action or debate.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on its \namendment or amendments and request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on \nthe part of the Senate.\n  Before the Chair rules, I would like to see also if Senator Daschle \nwould like to have any comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's \nconsideration. I ask the majority leader whether he anticipates we \nwould have votes on Monday, April 20, given the fact that that would be \nour first day back.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would indicate to the minority leader, as \nwe discussed yesterday and as I indicated on the floor last night, in \nview of the cooperation we have had and the fact that the Budget \nCommittee managers are going to be working on the general debate on the \nbudget and have a time agreement that they are going to try to use on \nMonday, and since we have this agreement, there would be no votes on \nMonday.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am sorry, I think I indicated April 20; I may not \nhave. In referring to the unanimous consent request, he cites the \nscheduled date for which there would be consideration of the bill as \nApril 20. I am simply asking whether--on the first page of the \nunanimous consent agreement, on top, you note that we would begin the \nvotes or begin the consideration.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes. Right.\n  Mr. President, I am sorry, I was inquiring about another issue, and I \nmisunderstood the Senator's question. In view of the time that is \nnecessary under the budget law for the budget resolution, I thought \nthat it was more important next week that we stay focused on that. \nAlso, because this does provide for second-degree amendments, I think \nSenators on both sides of the aisle would like to either adjust their \nfirst-degree amendments or prepare, thoughtfully, second-degree \namendments. So I thought the best thing for us to do would be to move \nthis and have it the pending business, and go right to it when we come \nback from the recess. I thought that the Senator----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Would it be the majority leader's intention, therefore, \nto schedule votes on that first day, or would we begin the debate and \nhave----\n  Mr. LOTT. Begin the debate, and have votes early on Tuesday, the \n21st.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The leader and I both have expressed ourselves on this \nbill so many times that I do not know that we need to elaborate \nanymore. I share the view just expressed by the majority leader that \nthis is as good as it is going to get for both sides. We can continue \nto be paralyzed and in a standoff or we can find a way with which to \ncooperate and come to some conclusion.\n  I have expressed myself about my disappointment in the way in which \nour colleagues have been constrained, but I also recognize that the \nmajority leader, as he has noted, is giving us far\n\n[[Page S2730]]\n\nmore amendments than what the Republicans are proposing. And so I \nthink, all things considered--I know my colleagues have expressed great \npersonal concern about this approach, but I also know that if we are \never going to resolve this matter, this is as good as it is going to \nget.\n  So I commend the leader for his diligence and commitment to resolving \nthese matters. I have pledged to him my cooperation to see if we can \nget to this point. We have done so. I am relieved that at long last we \nmay have a real opportunity, as he has noted, to talk about ways in \nwhich to address a national problem, a national challenge.\n  This provides a panoply of different approaches and different ideas. \nWe feel very strongly, very excited, about many of the ideas that we \nhave to offer. We will have that chance under this agreement. So I \ncertainly would not object, and I encourage my colleagues to accept it, \ndeal with it, offer amendments, and let us get on with the debate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I say again, I agree, it certainly has not \nbeen easy on either side of the aisle. Senators had issues that they \nfelt very strongly about. Many of them were not education related on \nboth sides of the aisle. There will be other opportunities to do that. \nI think this will be a fair way for us to have an equal debate on both \nsides. Some of these amendments, as I indicated, may actually wind up \nbeing accepted and we may not have to go through each one of them in a \nsecond degree. I think it is fair.\n  Before the Chair rules, I ask unanimous consent that the agreement \nmay be vitiated by the majority leader only at no later than 12:15 on \nMonday, March 30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the leader's request?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, just for the record and for \nclarification, as I understand it, there is a need to clarify or to----\n  Mr. LOTT. We had one Senator who indicated a desire to be notified \nand had been in the air. He is in his State, and I understand we can't \ntalk to him for 2\\1/2\\ hours. And for us to just mark time until then \ndidn't seem fair. I think it will be all right. I felt that after \ndiscussion with Senator Daschle, that was the only thing I could do. \nBut I think it is fair and we should move forward with it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/27/senate-section/article/S2729-1", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MARCH 30, 1998\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I have just indicated the Senate will be in \na period of morning business then for 1 hour when we come in on Monday, \nand then we will resume the budget resolution.\n  For the information of all Members, per the agreement reached during \ntoday's session, of the 50 hours under the statutory limit for the \nbudget resolution, as of Monday there will be 44 hours remaining, and \nas of the close of business on Monday there will be 34 hours remaining \non the resolution.\n  There will be no rollcall votes conducted during Monday's session. \nHowever, the managers do expect amendments to be offered during that \nday. And the next rollcall vote will occur then on Tuesday morning at a \ntime to be determined by the majority leader, after notification of the \nDemocratic leader.\n  Therefore, Members can anticipate votes on amendments to the budget \nresolution on Tuesday. As always, Members will be notified as to the \ntime of those votes. I should indicate that we will certainly find a \nway to have a vote at about 9:30 on Tuesday morning so we can get \nthings moving right along.\n  In addition, the Senate may consider Executive Calendar or \nlegislative business cleared by the Senate.\n  In regard to the balance of the week, we are expected to complete \naction on the budget resolution and the supplemental appropriations \nconference report, if available, prior to recessing for the Easter \nholidays. I do believe that we will be able to act on the supplemental \nappropriations to its final conclusion either late Tuesday night or \nWednesday, giving the conferees, hopefully, time to act on the \nconference before we go home and to complete action on the budget \nresolution. We need, again, to make Members aware now that we must do \nthose two items next week before we leave.\n  As a reminder, the next rollcall votes then will occur on Tuesday.\n  Does the Senator wish to speak further?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/03/27/senate-section/article/S2730-2", "month": "03", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MARCH 30, 1998\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
