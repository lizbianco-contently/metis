Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 699, H.R. 2863.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2863) to amend the Migratory Bird Treaty Act \n     to clarify restrictions under that Act on baiting, to \n     facilitate acquisition of migratory bird habitat, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment be agreed to. And Senator Chafee has two amendments at the \ndesk.

Mr. President, I am pleased that this package of fish and \nwildlife bills is being considered by the Senate today. It is a package \nthat combines some very popular bills with some wonderful conservation \ninitiatives approved by the Committee on Environment and Public Works. \nIt represents an effort on the part of both the Senate and the House to \nquickly move these bills in the waning days of the 105th Congress. I \nwould like to enumerate the components of this package.\n  The first item is H.R. 2863, a bill that amends the Migratory Bird \nTreaty Act with respect to offenses relating to the baiting of \nmigratory birds. This bill was reported by the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee on Friday, October 2.\n  I am including an amendment that makes two changes to the bill, as it \nwas reported out of the EPW Committee. The first change is to increase \nthe penalty under section 6(a) of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act from \n$10,000 to $15,000. This change is not intended to affect the \nclassification of the offense, which is currently a class B \nmisdemeanor. Indeed, in United States v. Clavette, the ninth circuit \nheld that the fine may be as much as $25,000 and still be considered a \nclass B misdemeanor.\n  The second change is to eliminate the higher penalty for persons who \nviolate section 3(b) of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in connection \nwith guiding, outfitting, or providing other service in exchange for \nmoney or other consideration. The intent of this provision was to \ndiscourage commercial operations from engaging in baiting in order to \nspur their business. However, the language in the reported bill was \nextremely broad. In addition, some existing laws, such as the Lacey \nAct, already provide that commercial operations may be subject to \nhigher penalties.\n  In lieu of the higher penalty for commercial operations, the \namendment that I offer today provides a higher penalty for persons who \nviolate section 3(b)(2) of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Section \n3(b)(2) prohibits the placement of bait on or adjacent to an area for \nthe purpose of causing, inducing, or allowing any person to take or \nattempt to take any migratory game bird by the aid of baiting on or \nover the baited area. This penalty would entail fines under title 28 of \nthe United States Code, or imprisonment of not more than one year, or \nboth. Baiting would thus be a class A misdemeanor. The purpose of this \nhigher penalty is to send a strong message to the public that baiting \nis a serious offense.\n  Mr. President, these changes have been discussed with Senator \nBreaux's staff, House Resources Committee staff, the administration, \nand the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and \nhave met with the approval of all interested parties. I believe that \nthis amendment improves the bill as passed by the committee.\n  The second item included in the package is S. 2317, which makes \nseveral changes to the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration \nAct of 1966. First, it removes three areas from the Refuge System that \nhave lost the habitat value that led to their being incorporated into \nthe Refuge System. Second, it changes the name of the Klamath Forest \nNational Wildlife Refuge in Oregon to the Klamath Marsh National \nWildlife Refuge. The current name leads visitors to believe that it is \na national forest, causing confusion over what activities are \npermitted. Finally, it reduces the penalty for unintentional violations \nof the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act. Currently, \nall violations of the act are class A misdemeanors, regardless of \nwhether or not it was an intentional violation. Unintentional \nviolations will now be a class B misdemeanor.\n  The third item included in the package is S. 361, sponsored by \nSenator Jeffords and approved by the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works on July 22, 1998. This item prohibits the import, export \nand trade in products that contain, or that are labeled or advertised \nas containing, rhino and tiger parts, in an effort to reduce the supply\n\n[[Page S12439]]\n\nand demand of those products in the United States. It requires a public \noutreach program in the United States to complement the prohibitions. \nLastly, it reauthorizes the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act \nthrough 2002.\n  As a related matter, I would like to note that even as Congress \nreaffirms and strengthens the laws for the conservation of rhinos and \ntigers, funding for implementation of these laws is woefully \ninadequate. This year--the Year of the Tiger--the administration \nrequested only $400,000 for implementing the Rhinoceros and Tiger \nConservation Act. The Act is authorized to be appropriated up to $10 \nmillion annually. I strongly urge the administration, for fiscal year \n2000, to request funding commensurate with the dire situation facing \nrhinos, and particularly tigers, in the wild.\n  The fourth item included in the package is S. 1677, the Wetlands and \nWildlife Enhancement Act of 1998. This bill reauthorizes the North \nAmerican Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA)--a law that has played a \ncentral role in the conservation of wetlands habitat across the \ncontinent. I introduced the bill last February, and have been joined by \n58 of my colleagues from 42 States in sponsoring S. 1677. There are 35 \nRepublican cosponsors and 23 Democrat cosponsors. This tremendous \nshowing of bipartisan support is a tribute to one of the great success \nstories in wildlife conservation.\n  The fifth item in the package includes provisions relating to \nprotection of the Chesapeake Bay, and the research of pfiesteria.\n  Mr. President, this package contains some very popular bills and very \nworthwhile conservation programs. It represents the fruits of many \nmonths of work by both the House Resources Committee and the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. In particular, I would like to \nthank Chairman Don Young and his staff, Harry Burroughs, for their \ncooperation on these bills, and in putting together this package.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the report by the \nCongressional Budget Office for the bill, H.R. 2863, as approved by the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, be printed in the Record. \nWhen the Committee filed its report on the bill, CBO had not yet \ncompleted its analysis, so it was not included. I would now like it to \nbe part of the public record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 1998.\n     Hon. John F. Chafee,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 2863, the \n     Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act of 1998.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Deborah \n     Reis (for federal costs), who can be reached at 226-2860, and \n     Hester Grippando (for revenues), who can be reached at 226-\n     2720.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James L. Blum\n                                  (For June E. O'Neill, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n\n       CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE, OCTOBER 8, 1998\n\n          H.R. 2863: Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act of 1998\n\n(As reported by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on \n                            October 5, 1998)\n\n       Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO \n     estimates that implementing H.R. 2863 would cost the U.S. \n     Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) less than $200,000 over the \n     next five years to prepare a report on migratory bird \n     conservation issues. Because sections 2 and 3 of the \n     legislation may affect receipts from criminal fines, pay-as-\n     you-go procedures would apply. We estimate that any changes \n     in receipts would be negligible, however, and would be \n     largely offset by resulting changes in direct spending from \n     the Crime Victims Fund (into which criminal fines are \n     deposited). H.R. 2863 contains no intergovernmental or \n     private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates \n     Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, \n     or tribal governments.\n       Section 2 of H.R. 2863 would codify a standard for \n     determining when someone is guilty of hunting migratory birds \n     over an area baited with bird feed. At present, there is no \n     statutory rule for deciding the issue; thus, the standard is \n     determined by the courts and differs from jurisdiction to \n     jurisdiction. In most areas of the country, courts usually \n     apply strict liability--anyone found hunting over a baited \n     field is guilty of violating federal law whether the person \n     knew that the area was baited or not. In contrast, H.R. 2863 \n     would establish a national standard, presently applied in \n     only a few states, that would make it unlawful for a person \n     to hunt over a field only if that person knows or reasonably \n     should know that the area is baited.\n       It is possible that applying a new standard regarding the \n     hunting of migratory birds, as would be required by section \n     2, could make it more difficult for some prosecutors to prove \n     that the law has been violated, resulting in fewer \n     convictions in some states. CBO estimates, however, that the \n     aggregate decrease in federal revenues from fines would be \n     insignificant because the overall conviction rate would be \n     unlikely to fall by much--these rates are already extremely \n     high in all states, regardless of which standard is applied.\n       Similarly, CBO estimates that section 3 of this \n     legislation, which would raise from $500 to $10,000 the \n     maximum criminal penalty for certain violations of the \n     Migratory Bird Treaty Act, would not cause any significant \n     increase in revenues from fines because we expect that \n     prosecutors would be very unlikely to ask for higher \n     penalties than they currently seek. (The government rarely \n     imposes the current $500 maximum fine in the more than 1,000 \n     cases it prosecutes annually.) In any case, changes in \n     revenues from enacting H.R. 2863 would result in offsetting \n     changes in direct spending from the Crime Victims Fund.\n       This estimate is based on information provided by the \n     USFWS, the Office of Management and Budget, and federal law \n     enforcement officers.\n       On May 14, 1998, CBO prepared a cost estimate for H.R. \n     2863, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Resources \n     on April 29, 1998. This estimate, for the Senate version of \n     H.R. 2863, differs from the previous one because it includes \n     the budgetary effects of two added provisions: the reporting \n     requirement contained in section 4 and the increase in \n     certain maximum penalties contained in section 3.\n       The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Deborah Reis \n     (for federal costs), who can be reached at 226-2860, and \n     Hester Grippando (for revenues), who can be reached at 226-\n     2720. This estimate was approved by Robert A. Sunshine, \n     Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendments be agreed to en bloc and the bill be read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3819 and 3820) were agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 2863) was read the third time.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I further ask unanimous consent that the Environment \nCommittee be immediately discharged from consideration of H.R. 2807, \nand the Senate proceed then to its consideration.\n  I further ask that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the \ntext of H.R. 2863 be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill be read a third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nthat any statements relating to the bill appear at this point in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2807), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 2807) entitled ``An Act to amend the Rhinoceros and \n     Tiger Conservation Act of 1994 to prohibit the sale, \n     importation, and exportation of products labeled as \n     containing substances derived from rhinoceros or tiger.'', do \n     pass with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n                 TITLE I--MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY REFORM\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nwonderful friend who has left us all too soon, Patrick Murphy of \nProvincetown, Massachusetts, who died last Friday from complication of \nAIDS.\n  The poet Yeats wrote about another young man who died too young, in \nlines that apply to Patrick Murphy, too--he was ``all life's epitome. \nWhat made us dream that he could comb grey hair?''\n  Patrick was a very special friend, and we grieve all the more today \nbecause his life was so tragically cut short. But he lived that life \nwith great energy, passion and commitment. And these priceless \nqualities won him countless friends and enormous success throughout his \nlifetime. But even more important, they won him the enduring respect \nand genuine affection of the people whose lives he touched and helped.\n  Patrick succeeded where others failed because he would never allow \nhimself to be distracted by the mean-spirited. He had a determination \nthat could overcome any obstacle or criticism. He was seldom burdened \nby a sense of reality, which made him all the more endearing and all \nthe more successful.\n  In the Patrick Murphy handbook on life, ``No you can't'' became ``Yes \nyou can.'' You can fight the bureaucracy. You can make a difference. \nYou can live with AIDS--and never let anyone tell you you can't.\n  All of us who knew Patrick knew that he never gave up and never gave \nin. He was the ``ever-ready bunny'' in the television commercial--the \none who just keeps going and going--ever-ready to fight for all the \ncauses we share.\n  I remember my own campaign in Massachusetts in 1994. Patrick had just \nleft the hospital. But that didn't stop him for a second. Before we \nknew it, he had list after list of events and phone-banks and campaign \nstops he was planning--working skillfully and tirelessly until every \nlast vote was counted and victory was won.\n  He did the same for Senator John Kerry in his reelection campaign in \n1996--and for President Clinton and Vice President Gore in their \ncampaign that year too.\n  And he did it all over again for the impressive ``For the Love of \nLife'' Foundation that he founded in 1992 and that will be his lasting \nmemorial.\n\n[[Page S12443]]\n\n  In the years to come, the Foundation will remind us again and again \nof Patrick and the power of individuals to make a difference. Ever \nsince Patrick created ``For the Love of Life'' in 1992, the Foundation \nhas brought greater hope and a higher quality of life to countless \npeople living with AIDS--in Massachusetts and across the country.\n  The Foundation was inspired by Patrick's extraordinary belief that \npeople's dreams can come true. And, the Foundation's great mission has \nbeen to grant the wishes of individuals and families living with HIV \nand AIDS.\n  ``For the Love of Life'' works closely with other AIDS organizations. \nIt provides a special extra dimension that others can't.\n  For an HIV positive father who could not afford a funeral for his \ninfant son who died of AIDS--``For the Love of Life'' made the \ndifference.\n  For a person living in a hospice in Boston--``For the Love of Life'' \nenabled him to visit his mother in Pittsburgh for one last time, to \nshare a birthday.\n  The Foundation has helped many others as well--a mother with AIDS to \nattend her daughter's wedding--a teenage girl with AIDS to have a Sweet \n16 party for her family and friends. Because of Patrick's vision and \nleadership, the dreams of countless others will come true.\n  As many have said, life is best measures not by its length but by its \ndepth--by those magical moments that make life special. Patrick made \nlife special for himself and everyone he touched. And in the years to \ncome, ``For the Love of Life'' will continue Patrick's great work by \nhelping people with AIDS to live life and love life. And for that great \ngift and lesson to all of us--we thank Patrick with all our heart.\n  Patrick, for the light you brought to dark hours and for the dignity \nyou gave to the human spirit--God bless you and sustain you. Patrick \nsaid he was always happier and healthier when he had a project. So I \nsay now, to Patrick in heaven, may you always have a project!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/13/senate-section/article/S12442-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12443-S12444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EDUCATION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to address the Senate for a few \nmoments today to call attention to some progress that has been made, as \nI understand it, in budget negotiations in the areas of education, but \nalso to indicate why I think the resolution of the President of the \nUnited States in identifying the importance of the help and assistance \nof the Federal Government for local communities and the States is \nextremely important, and why it has been very important in these last \nfew days, that these negotiations reflect the President's strong \ncommitment to education policy, and to put into some perspective why \nthis battle has been necessary over the period of recent years and why \nit is necessary now. I will mention in just a few moments some of the \nareas where I understand progress has been made. Nothing will be \nachieved until everything is settled, but, nonetheless, the areas that \nI will mention here, I think, have been generally recognized as having \nbeen fairly well agreed to, and I think it is relevant to mention those \nbecause they are important and will be important when the final omnibus \nlegislation has been achieved.\n  If you look over the recent years to see what has happened in terms \nof the education budget, you will see why this battle has been so \nimportant. If you look at the amount of the Federal budget that is \ndevoted to education, it represents only 2 percent of the total budget. \nWe are talking now of a budget of $1.7 billion. Only 2 percent of that \nbudget is education. I think most Americans would believe that it \nshould be a good deal higher.\n  What we are trying to do is to make sure that even this 2 percent is \ngoing to be preserved. If there is an opportunity, we are going to see \nsome expansion of it. We understand that we have a tight fiscal \nsituation. We are grateful for the economic policies that have brought \nus to some surplus, and we expect that to continue, although the \nsurplus for the first 5 years is reflected really in the cumulative \nsavings in our Social Security. And that is why the President is wise \nto say it is not appropriate now to have a tax cut because those funds \nwhich have been paid in and reflect themselves in the form of a surplus \nare really the hard-earned wages of workers and employers paying into \nthe Social Security trust fund, and until we resolve the challenges of \nthe Social Security trust fund, we should not, and we must not, see a \ntax cut.\n  But what we are trying to do is give education more of a priority \nwithin the total budget. That is certainly the desire of the American \npeople. What we have been faced with over the period of recent years is \nthe following: In 1996, the Republicans attempted to cut $3.7 billion \nbelow the previous year, 1995, in terms of what had actually been \nappropriated. Do we understand? In the education budget--that was in \n1996, that was resisted by the President--all those budget cuts were \nnot achieved but there were some budget cuts.\n  In 1997, the Republican proposal was to cut $1.5 billion below the \nprevious year--not add on, Mr. President, not try to find out how we \ncould possibly squeeze other aspects of our national budget in order to \nincrease our commitment to education. No. We saw the request for $1.5 \nbillion less in 1997 over the previous year; in 1998, a $2 billion cut \nbelow the President's request, and this year $2 billion below the \nPresident's request.\n  These are the facts. And so it is understandable that in the final \nwrap-up of these budget negotiations, the President of the United \nStates is going to do everything he possibly can to resist that kind of \ncut in terms of education funding.\n  Now we know, as I have said before, the amounts of money do not \nnecessarily indicate the solution to all of our problems. That is true \nin education as well. But what it does reflect is a nation's \npriorities--a nation's priorities. When you look over the record, for \n1996, $3.7 billion; 1997, $1.5 billion; 1998, $2 billion; this year, \n1999, $2 billion. That is reflected in the $420 million cut for title \nI, cutting back on the Eisenhower Teaching Program, cutting back on \nteacher technology, cutting back on the Afterschool Program, cutting \nback on the Year 2000 Program, zeroing out the Summer Jobs Program.\n  We can understand why the President and many of us--the Democratic \nleader, Senator Daschle, the Democratic leader in the House, Dick \nGephardt--are saying we are not going to have an omnibus budget unless \nit protects education. In effect, that is what is happening in \nWashington. Surely, there are other priorities, but this is one \nidentified by the President and the leaders, and the one which I \nbelieve is the overriding and overarching issue that those families \nacross our country care most about.\n  Now, we have heard that in the past few days the Reading Excellence \nAct, which is basically the Literacy Program that passed in the Senate \nvirtually unanimously, was tied up over in the House of \nRepresentatives, and when they effectively halted other kinds of \naction, that legislation was still hanging out there and would not have \nbeen approved unless put into this omnibus legislation.\n  When we understand that 40 percent of our children who are in the \nthird and fourth grades cannot read properly, and when we understand \nthat this is increasingly a problem, we are not going to be able to \nsolve it all with our Reading Excellence Act, but we are going to be \nable to help and assist teachers who are attempting to set up literacy \nprograms, who are tying into the Head Start Program, who are working \nwith volunteers who reflect the interests of many of our young people \nwho are working as volunteer teachers in the areas of literacy in our \nschools and colleges, with the Work-Study Program, which has been \nexpanded significantly in the last couple of years.\n  I am proud that Massachusetts is ranked as the second State in the \ncountry in the number of volunteers in the Work-Study Program who are \nworking with children in their communities on literacy. California is \nfirst; we are second. California better look out because we are \nincreasing the number of our colleges that will be doing it. Close to \n60 percent of all of our colleges scattered around our State of \nMassachusetts now are doing that. I believe every college ought to be \ninvolved. We ought to be challenging the young people in all of our \ncolleges to give something back to the community. This program will \nprovide that little seed\n\n[[Page S12444]]\n\nmoney to help assist those kinds of efforts in our States. That is an \nimportant program, and I understand has been agreed to.\n  We have the Afterschool Program which last year had been a $40 \nmillion program; this year, now, some $200 million. We have 5 million \nAmerican children who are under 14 years of age who are left alone \nevery afternoon in this country--5 million of them. And we wonder what \nhappens when we see these kinds of charts that reflect the spiking up \nin indexes of violent crime right after school, at 3 o'clock in the \nafternoon; 3 o'clock to about 6 o'clock in the afternoon have the \nhighest incidents. These people should be involved in afterschool \nprograms. They are working. They are working in my own city of Boston. \nNot all the city of Boston has it, but Mayor Menino is working to \nimprove these programs. This is a good $200 million program.\n  But that would not be there unless we had been battling--as in the \npast few days the President has--to have a modest program to try to \nhelp, to work through the nonprofit organizations, even some of those \nchurch-related groups, so children in this category can complete their \nhomework in the afternoon. That way, when they go back home they can \nspend some quality time with their parents rather than come home and \nhave the parents say, ``Jimmy, go upstairs and finish your homework.'' \nThis happens. This is a family issue. These are two very, very modest \nbut important programs.\n  But we have more to do, Mr. President. This important program \nreflects what has been happening in our schools across this country in \nterms of the total number of students going to the schools. We have \nseen, now, the escalation in the number of students; 53 million now are \ngoing. This number is increasing. The demography, the number of \nchildren going in, is putting additional burdens on local communities \nand States. All we are saying is let's be a partner with them. Let's be \na partner with them.\n  We have listened on the floor to those saying, ``This is not a role \nfor the Federal Government.'' You ask the parents. They want their \nchild educated. They want a well trained teacher in a modern classroom \nwith modern equipment so their child can learn. They want a \npartnership. With all due respect to our colleagues on the floor \nyesterday, talking about local control, saying, ``We ought to let the \nlocal communities make those judgments,'' the fact is, the local \ncommunity has control, now, over 93 cents of every dollar that is spent \nat the present time. Only 7 cents out of that dollar is related to \nexpenditures that are made by the Federal Government. That reflects a \nvery narrow, targeted area of child needs like the title I programs for \nthose children that come from economically deprived communities across \nthis country, whether they are urban or rural communities.\n  It has been worked out with bipartisan support, that program and the \nprograms that are related to the needs of disabled children and the \nother limited, targeted programs here. What we are saying, and what the \nPresident is saying, is this: With this escalation, we are going to \nneed more teachers. Let us develop the help and assistance so we will \nhave more teachers so these children, particularly in the most \nformative time of their lives, are going to be in smaller classes so \nthe children will have 16, 17, 18--hopefully, 17 children in the first \nthree grades. That is when the children coming out--perhaps the \nchildren coming from a Head Start Program, maybe others who are not, \nwho are coming from some kindergarten, entering first grade--that is \nwhen they are making their decisions in terms of developing their \nconfidence, developing their interests in academics. As we have heard \nfrom virtually every teacher across the country, the advantage of \nhaving that number of students is that a teacher can spend individual \nmoments every single day with that child. That is enormously important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator he now has 2 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is the issue that still remains: \nIncreasing the funding for teachers and also helping, assisting to try \nto do something about what the General Accounting Office has pointed \nout is the condition of schools all across this country. They say, to \ntry to address the old schools, to modernize the old schools, \nnationwide, it would cost $110 billion. The President's program is only \n$22 billion. Listen to the conclusion, not of Democrats, not of \nRepublicans, listen to the General Accounting Office that says:\n\n       Virtually all communities, even some of the wealthiest, are \n     wondering how to address school infrastructure needs while \n     balancing them with other community priorities.\n\n  This is a national problem. We want to make sure our children are in \nthe best classrooms with the best teachers and that they have the best \nopportunity to learn. This afternoon I will be going out with the \nPresident to the Forrest Knoll Elementary School just out in suburban \nMaryland. We are going to an event. The whole sixth grade is housed in \ntrailers. The Forrest Knoll Elementary School was originally built to \nhold 450 students. It now teaches over 700 students.\n  We could find these kinds of conditions in communities, not only in \nurban, but in rural areas. We need the best local and State efforts, \nand also Federal help and assistance. That is what we are talking about \nin terms of modernization. That is what we are talking about in terms \nof enhanced teachers. These are priorities for American families. We \nought to be able to work out a process, Republicans and Democrats \nalike, to try to address those very, very important and special needs. \nThey are the No. 1 priorities for families in this country and we ought \nto, even in these final hours, we ought to be able to work through this \nprocess to make sure we are going to give our best efforts to the \nprotection of children in our society, for their own interests and for \nour national interest.\n  It is in our national interest clearly, so America is going to be \nable to compete in a global economy and we are going to have the best \ntrained and best educated children and young people in this world. We \ncan do no less. We owe that to our country. That is a great deal of \nwhat this debate is about here in the Nation's Capitol, over the time \nwe are meeting here today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/13/senate-section/article/S12443-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12444-S12450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SECURITIES LITIGATION UNIFORM STANDARDS ACT OF 1998--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the bill (S. \n     1260), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to encourage my Senate \ncolleagues to support the conference report on S. 1260, the Securities \nLitigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998. The conference report is \nclosely modeled on the bill that the Senate passed by an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote this spring, and that the Banking Committee reported by \na vote of 14 to 4.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the conference report will also enjoy \nstrong bipartisan support. The conference report is the result of a lot \nhard work and thoughtful consideration. The House and Senate committee \nstaffs worked closely with the staff of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission to ensure the Commission's continued support for the \nlegislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter \nfrom the S.E.C. be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S12445]]\n\n\n\n\n                           Securities and Exchange Commission,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n         Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Chairman D'Amato and Senator Sarbanes: You have \n     requested our views on S. 1260, the Securities Litigation \n     Uniform Standards Act of 1998. We support this bill based on \n     important assurances in the Statement of Managers that \n     investors will be protected.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Commissioner Norman S. Johnson continues to believe that \n     this legislation is premature, at the least, for the reasons \n     stated in his May 1998 prepared statement before the House \n     Subcommittee on Finance and Hazardous Materials.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The purpose of the bill is to help ensure that securities \n     fraud class actions involving certain securities traded on \n     national markets are governed by a single set of uniform \n     standards. While preserving the right of individual investors \n     to bring securities lawsuits wherever they choose, the bill \n     generally provides that class actions can be brought only in \n     federal court where they will be governed by federal law. In \n     addition, the bill contains important legislative history \n     that will eliminate confusion in the courts about the proper \n     interpretation of the pleading standard found in the Private \n     Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and make clear that \n     the uniform national standards contained in this bill will \n     permit investors to continue to recover losses attributable \n     to reckless misconduct.\n       We commend the Committee for its careful efforts to strike \n     an appropriate balance between the rights of injured \n     investors to bring class action lawsuits and those of our \n     capital market participants who must defend against such \n     suits.\n       As you know, we expressed various concerns over earlier \n     drafts of the legislation. In particular, we stated that a \n     uniform standard for securities fraud class actions that did \n     not permit investors to recover losses for reckless \n     misconduct would jeopardize the integrity of the securities \n     markets. We appreciate your receptivity to our concerns and \n     believe that as a result of our mutual efforts and \n     constructive dialogue, this bill and the Statement of \n     Managers address our concerns. The strong statement in the \n     Statement of Managers that neither this bill nor the Reform \n     Act was intended to alter existing liability standards under \n     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 will provide important \n     assurances for investors that the uniform national standards \n     created by this bill will continue to allow them to recover \n     losses caused by reckless misconduct. The additional \n     statement clarifying that the uniform pleading requirement in \n     the Reform Act is the standard applied by the Second Circuit \n     Court of Appeals will likewise benefit investors by helping \n     to end confusion in the courts about the proper \n     interpretation of that Act. Together, these statements will \n     operate to assure that investors' rights will not be \n     compromised in the pursuit of uniformity.\n       We are grateful to you and your staffs, as well as the \n     other Members and their staffs, for working with us to \n     improve this legislation and safeguard vital investor \n     protections. We believe this bill and its Statement of \n     Managers fairly address the concerns we have raised with you \n     and will contribute to responsible and balanced reform of \n     securities class action litigation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arthur Levitt,\n       Chairman.\n     Isaac C. Hunt, Jr.,\n       Commissioner.\n     Paul R. Carey,\n       Commissioner.\n     Laura S. Unger,\n       Commissioner.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, the broadbased support that this bill \nenjoys is a tribute to Senators Domenici, Gramm, and Dodd, the chief \ncosponsors of its legislation. This bill provides a case study on how \nto get legislation done. They focused on solving a specific serious \nproblem, and built a wide base of support for the bill. The problem to \nwhich I referred is a loophole that strike lawyers have found in the \n1995 private securities litigation reform bill.\n  Mr. President, the 1995 act was enacted in the last Congress in \nresponse to a wave of harassment litigation that threatened the \nefficiency and integrity of our national stock markets, as well as the \nvalue of stock portfolios of individual investors. This threat was \nparticularly debilitating to so-called high-tech companies who \ndesperately need access to our capital markets for research, \ndevelopment and production of cutting-edge technology. These companies \nnot only help to create jobs and drive our economic growth, they create \nsubstantial wealth for their shareholders. As one witness before the \nSecurities Subcommittee testified:\n\n       The continuing specter of frivolous strike suits poses \n     still another threat to investors: the inordinate costs these \n     suits impose on corporations--and ultimately on their \n     shareholders.\n\n  Mr. President, that is a statement that bears repeating: that \nultimately the cost of strike suits are borne by shareholders, \nincluding ordinary people saving for their children's education or \nretirement. It is these people, the ordinary investor, who foot the \nbill for high-price settlements of harassment litigation.\n  Now, let me make one thing clear--we are not talking about preventing \nlegitimate litigation. Real plaintiffs with legitimate claims deserve \ntheir day in court. But we should not condone little more than a \njudicially sanctioned shakedown that only benefits strike lawyers. \nCompanies that engage in fraudulent conduct should be held fully liable \nfor their actions; however, companies should not be forced to settle \ncases that have no merit just to minimize their loses.\n  Mr. President, I want to express my gratitude to our colleagues in \nthe House, particularly Commerce Committee Chairman Bliley and \nSubcommittee Chairman Oxley, for their continued cooperation and good \nwill in a truly bicameral partnership to protect investors.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise today to offer my strong support for \nSenate passage of the conference report on S. 1260, the Securities \nLitigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998. This important bill will help \nto close a loophole that allows for the continuation of frivolous and \nabusive securities class action lawsuits, while ensuring that investors \nwill still be able to bring suits when defendants have acted \nrecklessly.\n  In 1995, the Congress enacted legislation, the Private Securities \nLitigation Reform Act, that was designed to curb the many abuses that \nhad cropped up in that system over the years. Ironically, it was the \nvery success of the 1995 act in shutting down avenues of abuse on the \nFederal level that created a new home for that abusive and frivolous \nlitigation in state courts.\n  Prior to the enactment of the 1995 Reform Act, it was extremely \nunusual for a securities fraud class action suit to be brought in a \nstate court. But by the end of 1996, it became clear from both the \nnumber of cases filed in state court and the nature of those claims, \nthat a significant shift was underfoot as some lawyers sought to evade \nthose provisions of the Reform Act that made it much more difficult to \ncoerce a settlement.\n  John Olson, the noted securities law expert, testified in February \nbefore the Subcommittee on Securities that:\n\n       In the years 1992 through 1994, only six issuers of \n     publicly traded securities were sued for fraud in state class \n     actions. In contrast, at least seventy-seven publicly traded \n     issuers were sued in state court class actions between \n     January 1, 1996 and June 30, 1997. Indeed, the increase in \n     state court filings may be even greater than indicated by \n     these dramatic statistics. Obtaining an accurate count of \n     state court class actions is extraordinarily difficult, \n     because there is no central repository of such data and \n     plaintiffs are under no obligation to provide notice of the \n     filing of such suits.\n\n  In April, 1997, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff report \nto Congress and the President found that:\n\n       Many of the state cases are filed parallel to a federal \n     court case in an apparent attempt to avoid some of the \n     procedures imposed by the reform act, particularly the stay \n     of discovery pending a motion to dismiss. This may be the \n     most significant development in securities litigation post-\n     reform act.\n\n  Even though the number of state class actions filed in 1997 was down \nfrom the high of 1996 it was still 50 percent higher than the average \nnumber filed in the 5 years prior to the Reform Act and it represented \na significant jump in the number of parallel cases filed. 1998 looks to \nmaintain those historically high levels.\n  This change in the number and nature of cases filed in State court \nhas had two measurable, negative impacts. First, for those companies \nhit with potentially frivolous or abusive state court class actions, \nall of the cost and expense that the 1995 Reform Act sought to prevent \nare once again incurred.\n  Some might question whether a state class action can carry with it \nthe same type of incentives that existed on the Federal level prior to \n1995 to settle\n\n[[Page S12446]]\n\neven frivolous suits. In fact, they can and let me provide just one \nexample of how this is so.\n  Adobe Systems, Inc., wrote to the Senate Banking Committee on April \n23, 1998, about its experience with state class action lawsuits. As \nmany of my colleagues know, one of the key components of the 1995 \nReform Act was to allow judges to rule on a motion to dismiss prior to \nthe commencement of the discovery process. Under the old system, Adobe \nhad won a motion for summary dismissal but only after months of \ndiscovery by the plaintiff that cost the company more than $2.3 million \nin legal expenses and untold time and energy by company officials to \nproduce tens of thousands of documents and numerous depositions. With \nthe 1995 act in place, those kinds of expenses are far less likely to \noccur on the federal level.\n  But in an ongoing securities class action suit filed in California \nstate court after passage of the 1995 act, Adobe has had to spend more \nthan $1 million in legal expenses and has had to produce more than \n44,000 pages of documents, all before the State judge is even able to \nentertain a motion for summary dismissal. In fact, in that April 23 \nletter to Banking Committee Chairman D'Amato, Colleen Pouliot, Adobe's \ngeneral counsel, noted that ``There are a number of California judicial \ndecisions which permit a plaintiff to obtain discovery for the very \npurpose of amending a complaint to cure its legal insufficiencies.''\n  This one example makes clear that while Adobe, which has the \nresources for a costly and lengthy legal battle, might fight a \nmeritless suit, these litigation costs provide a powerful incentive for \nmost companies to settle these suits rather than incur such expenses.\n  The second clear impact of the migration of class action suits to \nstate court is that it has caused companies to avoid using the safe \nharbor for forward looking statements that was a critical component of \nthe 1995 Reform Act.\n  In this increasingly competitive market, investors are demanding more \nand more information from company officials about where it thinkgs that \nthe company is heading.\n  The California Public Employees Pension System, one of the biggest \ninstitutional investors, in the nation stated that ``forward-looking \nstatements provide extremely valuable and relevant information to \ninvestors.'' SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt also noted in 1995, the \nimportance of such information in the marketplace:\n\n       Our capital markets are built on the foundation of full and \n     fair disclosure. . . . The more investors know and understand \n     management's future plans and views, the sounder the \n     valuation is of the company's securities and the more \n     efficient the capital allocation process.\n\n  In recent years, the Securities and Exchange Commission, in \nrecognition of this fact, sought to find ways to encourage companies to \nput such forward-looking into the marketplace. Congress, too, sought to \nencourage this and this effort ultimately culminated in the creation of \na statutory safe harbor, so that companies need not fear a lawsuit if \nthey did not meet their good-faith projections about future \nperformance.\n  Unfortunately, the simple fact is that the fear of state court \nlitigation is preventing companies from effectively using the safe \nharbor.\n  Again, the SEC's April 1997 study found that ``companies have been \nreluctant to provide significantly more forward looking disclosure than \nthey had prior to enactment of the safe harbor.'' The report went on to \ncite the fear of state court litigation as one of the principal reasons \nfor this failure.\n  Stanford Law School lecturer Michael Perino stated the case very well \nin a recent law review article:\n\n       If one or more states do not have similar safe harbors, \n     then issuers face potential state court lawsuits and \n     liability for actions that do not violate federal standards. \n     . . . for disclosures that are . . . released to market \n     participants nationwide, the state with the most plaintiff-\n     favorable rules for forward looking disclosures, rather than \n     the federal government, is likely to set the standard to \n     which corporations will conform.\n\n  If the migration of cases to state court were just a temporary \nphenomenon, then perhaps it would be appropriate for Congress to tell \nthese companies and their millions of investors to simply grin and bear \nit, that it will all be over soon. But the SEC report contains the \nwarning that this is no temporary trend: ``if state law provides \nadvantages to plaintiffs in a particular case, it is reasonable to \nexpect that plaintiffs' counsel will file suit in state court.''\n  The plain English translation of that is that any plaintiffs' lawyer \nworth his salt is going to file in state court if he feels it \nadvantageous for his case; since most state courts do not provide the \nstay of discovery or a safe harbor, we're confronted with a likelihood \nof continued state court class actions.\n  While the frustration of the objectives of the 1995 Reform Act \nprovide compelling reasons for congressional action, it is equally \nimportant to consider whether the proposition of creating a national \nstandard of liability for nationally-traded securities makes sense in \nits own right.\n  I certainly believe it does.\n  In 1996, Congress passed the National Securities Markets Improvement \nAct which established a precedent of national treatment for securities \nthat are nationally traded. In that act, Congress clearly and \nexplicitly recognized that our securities markets were national in \nscope and that requiring that the securities that trade on those \nnational markets comply with 52 separate jurisdictional requirements \nafforded little extra protection to investors and while imposing \nunnecessarily steep costs on raising capital.\n  Last July, then-SEC Commissioner Steven Wallman submitted testimony \nto the Securities Subcommittee in which he said:\n\n       . . . disparate, and shifting, state litigation procedures \n     may expose issuers to the potential for significant liability \n     that cannot be easily evaluated in advance, or assessed when \n     a statement is made. At a time when we are increasingly \n     experiencing and encouraging national and international \n     securities offerings and listing, and expending great effort \n     to rationalize and streamline our securities markets, this \n     fragmentation of investor remedies potentially imposes costs \n     that outweigh the benefits. Rather than permit or foster \n     fragmentation of our national system of securities \n     litigation, we should give due consideration to the benefits \n     flowing to investors from a uniform national approach.\n\n  At the same hearing, Keith Paul Bishop, then-California's top state \nsecurities regulator testified that:\n\n       California believes in the federal system and the primary \n     role of the states within that system. However, California \n     does not believe that federal standards are improper when \n     dealing with truly national markets. California businesses, \n     their stockholders and their employees are all hurt by \n     inordinate burdens on national markets. Our businesses must \n     compete in a world market and they will be disadvantaged if \n     they must continue to contend with 51 or more litigation \n     standards.\n\n  SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, at his reconfirmation hearing before the \nbanking committee on March 26, 1998, said that the legislation we are \ndebating today:\n\n       [a]ddresses an issue that . . . deals with a certain level \n     of irrationality. That to have two separate standards is not \n     unlike if you had, in the state of Virginia, two speed \n     limits, one for 60 miles an hour and one for 40 miles an \n     hour. I think the havoc that would create with drivers is not \n     dissimilar from the kind of disruption created by two \n     separate standards [of litigation] and I have long felt that \n     in some areas a single standard is desirable.\n\n  The message from all of these sources is clear and unequivocal: a \nuniform national standard of litigation is both sensible and \nappropriate.\n  The conference report under consideration today accomplishes that \ngoal in the narrowest, most balanced way possible.\n  Before I discuss what the legislation will do, let me point out a few \nthings that it won't do: it will not affect the ability of any state \nagency to bring any kind of enforcement action against any player in \nthe securities markets; it will not affect the ability of any \nindividual, or even a small group of individuals, to bring a suit in \nstate court against the issuer of any security, nationally traded or \nnot; it will not affect any suit, class action or otherwise, against \npenny stocks or any stock that is not traded on a national exchange; it \nwill not affect any suits based upon corporate disclosure to existing \nshareholders required by state fiduciary duty laws; and, it will not \nalter the national scienter requirement to prevent shareholders from \nbringing suits against issuers or others who act recklessly.\n  There has been a lot of talk about this last point, so let me address \nit head-on.\n\n[[Page S12447]]\n\n  It is true that in 1995, Congress wrestled with the idea of trying to \nestablish a uniform definition of recklessness; but ultimately, the \n1995 private securities litigation reform act was silent on the \nquestion of recklessness. While the act requires that plaintiffs plead \n``facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with \nthe requisite state of mind * * *,'' the 1995 act at no point attempts \nto define that state of mind. Congress left that to courts to apply, \njust as they had been applying their definition of state of mind prior \nto 1995.\n  Unfortunately, a minority of district courts have tried to read into \nsome of the legislative history of the reform act an intent to do away \nwith recklessness as an actionable standard. I believe that these \ndecisions are erroneous and cannot be supported by either the black \nletter of the statute nor by any meaningful examination of the \nlegislative history.\n  There are several definitions of recklessness that operate in our \ncourts today, and some of them are looser than others. But I agree with \nthose who believe that reckless behavior is an extreme departure from \nthe standards of ordinary care; a departure that is so blatant that the \ndanger it presents to investors is either known to the defendant or is \nso obvious that he or she must have been aware of it.\n  The notion that Congress would condone such behavior by closing off \nprivate lawsuits against those who fall within that definition is just \nludicrous.\n  And if, by some process of mischance and misunderstanding, investors \nlost their ability to bring suits based on that kind of scienter \nstandard, I would be the first, though certainly not the last, Senator \nto introduce legislation to restore that standard.\n  The Statement of Managers that accompanies the conference report on \nS. 1260 clarifies any misconception that may exist on the part of some \ncourts about congressional intent with unambiguous language:\n\n       It is the clear understanding of the Managers that Congress \n     did not, in adopting the Private Securities Litigation Reform \n     Act of 1995 [PL 104-67], intend to alter the standards of \n     liability under the Exchange Act.\n\n  Let me also address another issue that has been raised about \nrecklessness. Some have suggested that while the PSLRA did not remove \nrecklessness as a basis for liability, it was removed as a basis for \npleading a securities fraud class action. This is just plain wrong.\n  Again, the Statement of Managers accompanying this legislation is \ninstructive on this point:\n\n       It was the intent of Congress, as was expressly stated \n     during the legislative debate on the PSLRA, and particularly \n     during the debate on overriding the President's veto, that \n     the PSLRA establish a heightened uniform federal standard \n     based upon the pleading standard applied by the Second \n     Circuit Court of Appeals\n\n  The 1995 act clearly adopted the second circuit's pleading standards. \nThe Statement of Managers accompanying this conference report \ndefinitively shows that it was also our intent that the application of \nthat standard was also based upon the second circuit's application. \nWhile I agree that both this act and the 1995 act envision other courts \nfollowing the most stringent of the second circuit's cases applying the \npleading standard, we do expect other courts to look to the second \ncircuit for guidance. Under the second circuit's most stringent \napplication, the strong inference of the required state of mind may be \npled by either alleging circumstantial evidence of scienter, or by \nalleging a rational economic motive and an opportunity to achieve \nconcrete benefits through the fraud. Where motive is not apparent, the \nstrength of the circumstantial allegations must be correspondingly \ngreater.\n  Anyone who claims that either the 1995 act or S. 1260 raises the \npleading standard beyond that point is engaged in wishful thinking--\nthat kind of statement simply cannot be borne out by even the most \ncursory examination of either the statute or of the legislative \nhistory.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, Mr. President, S. 1260 is a moderate, \nbalanced and common sense approach to establishing a uniform national \nstandard of litigation that will end the practice of meritless class \naction suits being brought in state court. This conference report keeps \na very tight definition of class action and applies its standards only \nto those securities that have been previously defined in law as trading \non a national exchange.\n  That is why, on March 15, the Securities and Exchange Commission \nstated that ``we support enactment of S. 1260''; and that is why again \non October 8, the Commission again voiced its support by stating: ``we \nbelieve this bill and its Statement of Managers . . . will contribute \nto responsible and balanced reform of securities class action \nlitigation.'' And that is why the Clinton administration has also \nexpressed its support for the legislation.\n  In the final analysis, it is the millions of Americans who have \ninvested their hard-earned dollars in these nationally traded companies \nand the men and women who will hold the new jobs that will be created \nas a result of newly available resources, whom we hope will be the real \nbeneficiaries of the action that we take here today.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, dozens of our colleagues, the Clinton administration, \ndozens of Governors, State legislators, and State securities regulators \nin supporting passage of the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards \nAct of 1998.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nconference report to S.1260, the ``Securities Litigation Reform Uniform \nStandards Act of 1998'' and I want to commend the Majority Leader for \nbringing this conference report to the floor for a vote prior to the \nSenate's adjournment. Few issues are more important to the high-tech \ncommunity and the efficient operation of our capital markets than \nsecurities fraud lawsuit reform.\n  So today, I want to congratulate Senators D'Amato, Dodd, and Gramm \nfor all of their hard work on this legislation to provide one set of \nrules to govern securities fraud class actions.\n  This conference report completes the work I began more than six years \nago with Senator Sanford of North Carolina. Back in the early 1990's, \nSenator Sanford and I noticed that a small group of entrepreneurial \nplaintiffs' lawyers were abusing our securities laws and the federal \nrules related to class action lawsuits to file frivolous claims against \nhigh-technology companies in federal courts.\n  Often these lawsuits were based simply on the fact that a company's \nstock price had fallen, without any real evidence of wrongdoing by the \ncompany. Senator Sanford and I realized a long time ago that stock \nprice volatility- common in high tech stocks- simply is not stock \nfraud.\n  But, because it was so expensive and time consuming to fight these \nlawsuits, many companies settled even when they knew they were innocent \nof the charges leveled against them. The money used to pay for these \nfrivolous lawsuits could have been used for research and development or \nto create new, high-paying jobs.\n  So, we introduced a bill to make some changes to the securities fraud \nclass action system. Of course, the powerful plaintiffs' bar opposed \nour efforts, and the bill did not move very far along in the \nlegislative process.\n  After Senator Sanford left the Senate, I found a new partner--the \nsenior Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd. Senator Dodd and I \ncontinued to work hard on this issue and in 1995, with tremendous help \nfrom Chairman D'Amato and Senator Gramm, we succeeded in passing a law. \nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 passed Congress in \nan overwhelmingly bi-partisan way--over President Clinton's initial \nveto of the bill.\n  And since enactment of the 1995 law, we have seen great changes in \nthe conduct of plaintiffs' class action lawyers in federal court. \nBecause of more stringent pleading requirements, plaintiffs' lawyers no \nlonger ``race to the courthouse'' to be the first to file securities \nclass actions. Because of the new rules, we no longer have \n``professional plaintiffs''--investors who buy a few shares of stock \nand then serve as sham named plaintiffs in multiple securities class \nactions. Other rules make it difficult for plaintiffs' lawyers to file \nlawsuits to force companies into settlement rather than face the \nexpensive and time consuming ``fishing expedition'' discovery process.\n  From my perspective, it has begun to look like our new law has worked \ntoo well. Entrepreneurial trial lawyers\n\n[[Page S12448]]\n\nhave begun filing similar claims in state court to avoid the new law's \nsafeguards against frivolous and abusive lawsuits. Instead of one set \nof rules, we now have 51--one for the federal system and 50 different \nones in the states.\n  According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, this migration \nof claims from federal court to state court ``may be the most \nsignificant development in securities litigation'' since the passage of \nthe new law in 1995.\n  In fact, prior to passage of the new law in 1995, state courts rarely \nserved as the forum for securities fraud lawsuits. Now, more than 25 \npercent of all securities class actions are brought in state court. A \nrecent Price Waterhouse study found that the average number of state \ncourt class actions filed in 1996 (the first year after the new law) \ngrew 335 percent over the 1991-1995 average. In 1997, state court \nfilings were 150 percent greater than the 1991-1995 average.\n  So, there has been a tremendous increase in state securities fraud \nclass actions. In fact, trial lawyers have testified to Congress that \nthey have an obligation to file securities fraud lawsuits in state \ncourt if it provides a more attractive forum for their clients. Believe \nit or not, plaintiffs' lawyers actually admit that they are attempting \nto avoid federal law.\n  The increase in state court lawsuits also has prevented high-tech \ncompanies from taking advantage of one of the most significant reforms \nin the 1995 law--the safe harbor for forward-looking statements. Under \nthe 1995 law, companies which make predictive statements are exempt \nfrom lawsuits based on those statements if they meet certain \nrequirements. Companies are reluctant to use the safe harbor and make \npredictive statements because they fear that such statements could be \nused against them in state court. This fear stifles the free flow of \nimportant information to investors--certainly not a result we intended \nwhen we passed the new law.\n  So today, the Senate will vote to send to the President one set of \nrules for securities fraud cases. One uniform set of rules is critical \nfor our high-technology community and our capital markets.\n  Without this legislation, the productivity of the high-tech \nindustry--the fastest growing segment of our economy--will continue to \nbe hamstrung by abusive, lawyer-driven lawsuits. Rather than spend \ntheir resources on R or creating new jobs, high-tech companies will \ncontinue to be forced to spend massive sums fending off frivolous \nlawsuits. That is unacceptable to this Senator.\n  When I first worked on this issue, executives at Intel Corporation \ntold me that if they had been hit with a frivolous securities lawsuit \nearly in the company's history, they likely never would have invented \nthe microchip. We should not let that happen to the next generation of \nIntels.\n  This new law also will be important to our markets. Our capital \nmarkets are the envy of the world, and by definition are national in \nscope. Information provided by companies to the markets is directed to \ninvestors across the United States and throughout the world.\n  Under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Congress has the \nauthority to regulate in areas affecting ``interstate commerce.'' I \ncannot imagine a more classic example of what constitutes ``interstate \ncommerce'' than the purchase and sale of securities over a national \nexchange.\n  Not only does Congress have the authority to regulate in this area, \nit clearly is necessary and appropriate. Right now, in an environment \nwhere there are 50 different sets of rules, companies must take into \naccount the most onerous state liability rules and tailor their conduct \nto those rules. If the liability rules in one state make it easier for \nentrepreneurial lawyers to bring frivolous lawsuits, that affects \ncompanies and the information available to investors in all other \nstates. One uniform set of rules will eliminate that problem.\n  Mr. President, I again want to commend my colleagues for their work \non this important bill. I understand that this is a bi-partisan effort, \nwhich has the support of the SEC and the Clinton Administration. I also \nwant to thank my colleagues over in the House--Chairman Bliley, \nRepresentative Cox, and others who have worked so hard on this issue. \nThis is the culmination of a tremendous amount of work, and I think \nthat our capital markets, high-tech companies and our litigation system \nwill be better served because of it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform \nStandards Act of 1998, is intended to create a uniform national \nstandard for securities fraud class actions involving nationally-traded \nsecurities. In advocating enactment of uniform national standards for \nsuch actions, I firmly believe that the national standards must be fair \nones that adequately protect investors. I hope that Senator D'Amato, \none of the architects of the Banking Committee's substitute, would \nengage in a colloquy with me on this point.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. DODD. At a hearing on S. 1260 last October, the Securities and \nExchange Commission (SEC) voiced concern over some recent federal \ndistrict court decisions on the state of mind--or scienter--requirement \nfor pleading fraud that was adopted in the Private Securities \nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 ('95 Reform Act or PSLRA). According to \nthe SEC, some federal district courts have concluded that the 1995 \nReform Act adopted a pleading standard that was more rigorous than the \nsecond circuit's, which, at the time of enactment of the PSLRA, had the \ntoughest pleading standards in the nation. Some of these courts have \nalso suggested that the '95 Reform Act changed not only the pleading \nstandard but also the standard for proving the scienter requirement. At \nthe time we enacted the PSLRA, every federal court of appeals in the \nnation--ten in number--concluded that the scienter requirement could be \nmet by proof of recklessness.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I am sympathetic to the SEC's concerns. In acting now to \nestablish uniform national standards, it is important that we make \nclear our understanding of the standards created by the '95 Reform Act \nbecause those are the standards that will apply if S. 1260 is enacted \ninto law. My clear intent in 1995, and my understanding today, is that \nthe PSLRA did not in any way alter the scienter standard in federal \nsecurities fraud lawsuits. The '95 Reform Act requires plaintiffs, and \nI quote, ``to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong \ninference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.'' \nThe '95 Reform Act makes no attempt to alter or define that state of \nmind. In addition, it was my intent in 1995, and it is my understanding \ntoday, that the 1995 Reform Act adopted the pleading standard applied \nin the second circuit.\n  Mr. DODD. I agree with the comments of my colleague from New York. I, \ntoo, did not intend for the PSLRA to alter the state of mind \nrequirement in securities fraud lawsuits or to adopt a pleading \nstandard more stringent than that of the second circuit. In fact, I \nspecifically stated during the legislative debates preceding and \nfollowing the President's veto that the 1995 Reform Act adopted the \nsecond circuit's pleading standard. This continues to be my \nunderstanding and intent today. Ensuring that the scienter standard \nincludes reckless misconduct is critical to investor protection. \nCreating a higher scienter standard would lessen the incentives for \nissuers of securities to conduct a full inquiry into potentially \ntroublesome areas and could therefore damage the disclosure process \nthat has made our markets a model for other nations. The U.S. \nsecurities markets are the envy of the world precisely because \ninvestors at home and abroad have enormous confidence in the way our \nmarkets operate. Altering the scienter standard in the way envisioned \nby some of these district court decisions could be very damaging to \nthat confidence.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. My friend from Connecticut is correct. The federal \nsecurities laws must include a scienter requirement that adequately \nprotects investors. I was surprised and dismayed to learn that some \ndistrict court decisions had not followed the clear language of the \n1995 Reform Act, which is the basis upon which the uniform national \nstandard in today's legislation will be created.\n  Mr. DODD. It appears that these district courts have misread the \nlanguage of the 1995 Reform Act's ``Statement of\n\n[[Page S12449]]\n\nManagers.'' As I made clear in the legislative debate following the \nPresident's veto, however, the disputed language in the Statement of \nManagers was simply meant to explain that the conference committee \nomitted the Specter amendment because that amendment did not adequately \nreflect existing second circuit caselaw on the pleading standard. I can \nonly hope that when the issue reaches the federal courts of appeals, \nthese courts will undertake a more thorough review of the legislative \nhistory and correct these decisions. While I trust that the courts will \nultimately honor Congress' clear intent, should the Supreme Court \neventually find that recklessness no longer suffices to meet the \nscienter standard, it is my intent to introduce legislation that would \nexplicitly restore recklessness as the pleading and liability standard \nfor federal securities fraud lawsuits. I imagine that I would not be \nalone in this endeavor, and I ask my good friend from New York whether \nhe would join me in introducing such legislation?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I say to the Senator from Connecticut that I would be \npleased to work with him to introduce such legislation under those \ncircumstances. I agree that investors must be allowed a means to \nrecover losses caused by reckless misconduct. Should the courts deprive \ninvestors of this important protection, such legislation would be in \norder.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator from New York, the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, for his leadership on this bill and for engaging in \nthis colloquy with me. In proceeding to create uniform national \nstandards while some issues concerning the 1995 Reform Act are still \nbeing decided by the courts, we must act based on what we intended and \nunderstand the 1995 Reform Act to mean. As a sponsor of both the Senate \nbill that became the 1995 Reform Act and the bill, S. 1260, that we are \ndebating today, I am glad that we have had this opportunity to clarify \nhow the PSLRA's pleading standards will function as the uniform \nnational standards to be created in S. 1260, the Securities Litigation \nUniform Standards Act of 1998.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I opposed the securities litigation \npreemption bill when it was before the Senate. I am sorry to see that \nthe conference report now before us is no better. I continue to believe \nthat this bill is a solution in search of a problem, and that it will \ndo more harm than good.\n  Why do I call this bill a solution in search of a problem? Because \nthere has been no explosion in frivolous lawsuits filed in State court. \nThe supporters of this bill allege that class action lawsuits alleging \nsecurities fraud have migrated from Federal court to State court since \n1995. In fact, as I have pointed out previously, every study indicates \nthat the number of securities fraud class actions brought in State \ncourt increased in 1996 but then declined in 1997.\n  Why do I say this bill will do more harm than good? Because this bill \nlikely will deprive individual investors of their opportunities to \nbring their own actions in State court, separate and apart from class \nactions. Although the bill's supporters suggest that it deals only with \nclass actions, in fact the scope of the bill is much broader. The \nbill's definition of ``class action'' will pick up, against their will, \nindividuals who choose to file their own lawsuits under State law.\n  These shortcomings were not remedied in conference. Indeed, the one \nimprovement made to the bill on the Senate floor was weakened in \nconference. Senators will remember that the Senate adopted an amendment \nto this bill, offered by Senators Bryan, Johnson, Biden, and myself. \nThe amendment exempted State and local governments and their pension \nfunds from the coverage of the bill. The conference report now before \nus weakens this provision. The conference report contains the House-\npassed version, which requires that State and local governments be \nnamed plaintiffs and authorize participation in the specific suit. This \nversion offers scant protection to State and local officials. The \nGovernment Finance Officers Association, Municipal Treasurers \nAssociation, National Association of Counties, National League of \nCities wrote to us concerning this provision on September 28, 1998. \nTheir letter states, ``many smaller governments and small pension plans \nare unable to keep abreast of pending actions. Thus, any affirmative \nsteps on their part may not occur simply because they are unaware of \nthe existence of such a case.'' These organizations expressed their \nstrong support for the Senate version of this provision, only to be \nignored by the conference committee.\n  On a positive note, I am pleased that the Statement of the Conference \nCommittee makes clear that neither this bill nor the Litigation Reform \nAct of 1995 alter the scienter standard applied by the courts under the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934. Courts in every Federal circuit in the \ncountry hold that reckless conduct constitutes scienter sufficient to \nestablish a violation of section 10(b) and rule 10b-5, the principal \nantifraud provision of the 1934 act. Chairman Levitt of the SEC has \ndescribed the recklessness standard as ``critically important'' to \n``the integrity of the securities markets.''\n  For the reasons I have described, a broad coalition of State and \nlocal officials, senior citizen groups, labor unions, academics, and \nconsumer groups oppose this bill. They oppose it because it may deprive \ndefrauded investors of remedies. The headline of a column by Ben Stein \nin the USA Today newspaper of April 28, 1998, summarizes this \nopposition: ``Investors, beware: Last door to fight fraud could \nclose.'' He wrote of this bill, ``state remedies . . . would simply \nvanish, and anyone who wanted to sue would have to go into federal \ncourt, where . . . impossible standards exist.'' He warned, ``this is \nserious business for the whole investing public.'' the associations of \npublic officials I have cited are concerned about this bill because \nthey invest taxpayers' funds and public employees' pension funds in \nsecurities, and fear they will be left without remedies if they are \ndefrauded. Over two dozen law professors, including such nationally \nrecognized securities law experts as John Coffee, Joel Seligman, and \nMarc Steinberg, expressed their opposition in a letter earlier this \nyear. They oppose any legislation ``that would deny investors their \nright to sue for securities fraud under state law.'' Similarly, the New \nYork State Bar Association opposes this bill. A report prepared by the \nbar association's section on commercial and Federal litigation \nconcluded, ``the existing data does not establish a need for the \nlegislation'' and ``the proposed solution far exceeds any appropriate \nlevel of remedy for the perceived problem.'' I would also like to point \nout the opposition of the American Association of Retired Persons, the \nConsumer Federation of America, the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of \nState, County and Municipal Employees, and the United Mine Workers.\n  I urge Senators, out of caution, to vote against this conference \nreport. The recent bull market was the longest in history, and bull \nmarkets tend to conceal investment frauds. Should the decline in stock \nmarket values continue, it is likely that frauds will be uncovered. The \nlevel of participation in the stock market by America's families is at \na record level, both directly through ownership  of stocks and \nindirectly through pension funds and mutual funds. Should this bill be \nenacted, investors will find their State court remedies eliminated. In \ntoo many cases, investors will be left without any effective remedies \nat all. Such a result can only harm innocent investors, undermine \npublic confidence in the securities markets, and ultimately raise the \ncost of capital for deserving American businesses.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that an exchange of correspondence between \nChairman Levitt and Senators D'Amato, Gramm, and Dodd be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 1998.\n     Hon. Arthur Levitt,\n     Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levitt and Members of the Commission: We are \n     writing to request your views on S. 1260, the Securities \n     Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1997. As you know, our \n     staff has been working closely with the Commission to resolve \n     a number of technical issues that more properly focus the \n     scope of the legislation as introduced. We attach for your \n     review the amendments to the\n\n[[Page S12450]]\n\n     legislation that we intend to incorporate into the bill at \n     the Banking Committee mark-up.\n       On a separate but related issue, we are aware of the \n     Commission's long-standing concern with respect to the \n     potential scienter requirements under a national standard for \n     litigation. We understand that this concern arises out of \n     certain district courts' interpretation of the Private \n     Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In that regard, we \n     emphasize that our clear intent in 1995--and our \n     understanding today--was that the PSLRA did not in any way \n     alter the scienter standard in federal securities fraud \n     suits. It was our intent, as we expressly stated during the \n     legislative debate in 1995, particularly during the debate on \n     overriding the President's veto, that the PSLRA adopt the \n     pleading standard applied in the Second Circuit. Indeed, the \n     express language of the statute itself carefully provides \n     that plaintiffs must ``state with particularity facts giving \n     rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the \n     required state of mind''; the law makes no attempt to define \n     that state of mind. We intend to restate these facts about \n     the '95 Act in both the legislative history and the floor \n     debate that will accompany S. 1260, should it be favorably \n     reported by the Banking Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n     Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n       Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs.\n     Phil Gramm,\n       Chairman, Subcommittee on Securities.\n     Christopher J. Dodd,\n       Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Securities.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Securities and Exchange\n\n\n                                                   Commission,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 1998.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Securities,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Securities,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman D'Amato, Chairman Gramm, and Senator Dodd: \n     You have requested our views on S. 1260, the Securities \n     Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1997, and amendments to \n     the legislation which you intend to offer when the bill is \n     marked-up by the Banking Committee. This letter will present \n     the Commission's position on the bill and proposed \n     amendment.*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     * We understand that Commissioner Johnson will write \n     separately to express his differing views. Commissioner Carey \n     is not participating.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The purpose of the bill is to help ensure that securities \n     fraud class actions involving certain securities traded on \n     national markets are governed by a single set of uniform \n     standards. While preserving the right of individual investors \n     to bring securities lawsuits wherever they choose, the bill \n     generally provides that class actions can be brought only in \n     federal court where they will be governed by federal law.\n       As you know, when the Commission testified before the \n     Securities Subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee in \n     October 1997, we identified several concerns about S. 1260. \n     In particular, we stated that a uniform standard for \n     securities fraud class actions that did not permit investors \n     to recover losses attributable to reckless misconduct would \n     jeopardize the integrity of the securities markets. In light \n     of this profound concern, we were gratified by the language \n     in your letter of today agreeing to restate in S. 1260's \n     legislative history, and in the expected debate on the Senate \n     floor, that the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of \n     1995 did not, and was not intended to, alter the well-\n     recognized and critically important scienter standard.\n       Our October 1997 testimony also pointed out that S. 1260 \n     could be interpreted to preempt certain state corporate \n     governance claims, a consequence that we believed was neither \n     intended nor desirable. In addition, we expressed concern \n     that S. 1260's definition of class action appeared to be \n     unnecessarily broad. We are grateful for your responsiveness \n     to these concerns and believe that the amendments you propose \n     to offer at the Banking Committee mark-up, as attached to \n     your letter, will successfully resolve these issues.\n       The ongoing dialogue between our staffs has been \n     constructive. The result of this dialogue, we believe, is an \n     improved bill with legislative history that makes clear, by \n     reference to the legislative debate in 1995, that Congress \n     did not alter in any way the recklessness standard when it \n     enacted the Reform Act. This will help to diminish confusion \n     in the courts about the proper interpretation of that Act and \n     add important assurances that the uniform standards provided \n     by S. 1260 will contain this vital investor protection.\n       We support enactment of S. 1260 with these changes and with \n     this important legislative history.\n       We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the \n     legislation, and of course remain committed to working with \n     the Committee as S. 1260 moves through the legislative \n     process.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arthur Levitt,\n       Chairman,\n     Isaac C. Hunt, Jr.,\n       Commissioner.\n     Laura S. Unger,\n       Commissioner.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconference report be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating to the conference report appear \nat this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Presiding \nOfficer for his work in disposing of the conference report on S. 1260, \nthe securities litigation legislation. I appreciate very much that at \nlong last this legislation is now going to become law. This is a bill \nthat is widely supported on both sides of the aisle.\n  A number of Senators have had a lot of opportunities to take some \nresponsibility for the fact that this passed. I want to cite one \nSenator, in particular, who deserves great credit. That is the Senator \nfrom California, Senator Boxer. She has been a persistent advocate and \none who has been extraordinarily engaged in this matter now for some \ntime. I talked with her again this morning because she was calling \nabout the status of the legislation. I was able to report that it was \nmy expectation we would be able to finish our consideration of the bill \ntoday, and thanks to the agreement we have been able to reach on both \nsides of the aisle with Senators who have been as involved as the \nSenator from Wyoming has, we have now reached this point.\n  I congratulate all who have had a part to play in our success, and \nparticularly the Senator from California, for her persistence, for her \nleadership, and the effort she has made to bring us to this point.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Sellers of Wilberforce, Ohio--who has \nrecently completed his term as president of Kiwanis International.\n  Mr. Sellers is the first African-American to serve as Kiwanis \nInternational President. For 32 years, he was a member of the Kiwanis \nClub in Xenia, Ohio. In 1990, he was elected to the Kiwanis \nInternational Board of Trustees. He served as Vice President and \nTreasurer before becoming President.\n  All Ohioans are proud of Mr. Sellers' outstanding stewardship of one \nof the largest service clubs in the world. But we also know that his \nservice to our community extends beyond his work with the Kiwanis \norganization. He has served as President of the Xenia Board of \nEducation and President of the Ohio School Boards Association. And he \nhas done great work on many other public-service boards in Ohio.\n  Walter Sellers has dedicated his life to improving the lives of the \npeople of Ohio, especially in the field of education. We are all \nextremely grateful for his efforts--and I ask my colleagues to join me \nin wishing him all the best in his next endeavors.\n  Mr. President, on a personal note, I have known Walt Sellers for \nmany, many years as a community leader in my home county of Greene \nCounty. I also have known Walt for the great work he has done at \nCentral State. I know when I served on the Board of Trustees at Central \nState in the late\n\n[[Page S12451]]\n\n1970s, Walter was there to help guide. So he has been a great asset to \nthat wonderful institution as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/13/senate-section/article/S12450-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STAFF TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JOHN GLENN\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as my colleagues well know, my \ndistinguished colleague from Ohio, John Glenn, is busily preparing for \nhis extraordinary and inspirational return to space. As our best wishes \nare with him and his wife Annie as they begin the next chapter in their \nwonderful lives, I would like to take a moment to read a fine tribute \nto Senator Glenn by those who also dedicated their lives to public \nservice--as members of John Glenn's staff. I am honored to read the \nfollowing letter addressed to him:\n\n                                                  October 9, 1998.\n     The Hon.

Some of us have been on your staff since 1975 and many \n     more have served well beyond the average tenure. Beyond our \n     professional careers, you and Annie have made us feel \n     welcome. You generously shared your time with us as our \n     families and children have grown. Your commitment to family \n     is evident in your 55 years of marriage to Annie and that \n     example must have contributed to the eight office marriages \n     in which both spouses first met as staff members.\n       We have always been proud to assist a public servant who is \n     held in such high regard. We witnessed that admiration and \n     respect firsthand as we accompanied you in your travels \n     throughout the country and around the world and when we see \n     the many people who come to your offices to conduct business.\n       Your patriotic service in war and peace, in space and in \n     the Senate is an inspiration to us. While you remind us that \n     there may be no cure for the common  birthday, you have \n     proven time and again that with determination and hard \n     work dreams do come true.\n       Thank you for helping our dreams come true, too.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a landmark \nreport released a week ago about asthma, and about how well we as a \nNation are dealing with it. The report, called ``Asthma in America'', \nfrankly concludes that we are doing a poor job. Asthma is a disease \nthat we know how to treat and that we know how to manage. But every \nyear, thousands of Americans die from asthma--and millions more have to \nbe rushed to hospitals to treat emergency asthma symptoms. Let me \nrepeat--we have people dying from asthma--even though we know how to \ntreat this disease. This really is something that we as a nation must \naddress.\n  Mr. President, there's been enough public attention about asthma that \nI would hope we all know the basics by now. But let me restate some \nbasic facts. Asthma is a chronic lung disease caused by inflammation of \nthe lower airways. During an asthma attack, these airways narrow--\nmaking it difficult and sometimes impossible to breathe.\n  Nearly 15 million Americans have asthma--and 5 million of them are \nchildren. for some reason, the prevalence of asthma is rising--in the \nlast two decades, the number of asthma cases have doubled.\n  The good news for the 15 million Americans with asthma is that we \nknow a lot about how to treat and manage the disease. We know how to \nhandle asthma attacks once they occur. The most common way, of course, \nis to use one of the types of asthma inhalers, inhalers such as the one \nI carry with me just about every day. Millions of Americans use this \ntype of inhaler. Importantly, we now know a lot about how to prevent \nasthma attacks. Through drug therapy and through avoiding many well-\nknown triggers that cause asthma attacks, we know enough to make sure \nthese attacks and other complications from asthma are rare indeed. In \nfact, our knowledge is comprehensive enough that the National \nInstitutes of Health have set some ambitious--but reachable--goals \nfor asthma treatment. For example, one of the NIH goals is zero missed \ndays of school or work. Given what we know, we should be able to reach \nthis and the other goals NIH has set. At a minimum, we should be able \nto come close.\n\n  But the bad news for Americans with asthma is that we are not \nmanaging this disease well--and we are not coming anywhere close to \nmeeting the NIH goals. This is the bad news that was spelled out very \nclearly in the Asthma in America report. Let me go over a few of the \nfindings from the report.\n  The NIH goal is that Americans with asthma miss zero days of work or \nschool. But the report tells us that 49 percent of children with asthma \nand 25 percent of adults with asthma missed school or work because of \nthe disease last year.\n  The NIH goal is that the sleep of people with asthma should not be \ndisrupted by difficulty to breathe. But the report tells us that almost \none in three asthma patients awaken with breathing problems at least \nonce a week.\n  The NIH goal is that we have only a small need for emergency room \nvisits or hospitalizations due to asthma attacks. But the report tells \nus that nearly six million Americans were hospitalized, treated in \nemergency rooms, or required other urgent care for asthma in the last \nyear. One out of every three children with asthma--about 1.5 million of \nthem--had to go to an emergency room because of asthma.\n  The NIH goal is that individuals with asthma should be able to \nmaintain normal activity levels. But the Asthma in America survey shows \nthat 48 percent of asthma patients say that asthma limits their ability \nto participate in sports and recreational activities, and 36 percent \nhave difficulty maintaining their usual levels of physical activity.\n  Mr. President, all of this is simply unacceptable. If we know how to \ndo better, we must do better. As a nation, we need to seriously \nevaluate why these shortcomings in the treatment of asthma remain--\ndespite the fact that we do know better. All of us--policymakers; \ndoctors; health insurance companies and HMOs; people with asthma and \nparents of children with asthma--all of us need to look at this report \nand try to figure out what's going wrong.\n  The report released Tuesday should be viewed as a wake-up call. We \nknew there were some problems with how well we deal with asthma, but I \ndon't think anybody realized it was this bad. We must and can do \nbetter.\n  For example, Asthma in America suggests that one of the reasons we \nare not meeting the national goals for asthma is lack of knowledge \namong patients. Many of the survey participants were not able to state \nwhat the underlying cause of asthma is, how asthma medication should be \nused, and how to prevent asthma attacks from occurring. It is clear \nthat we should be doing a better job of educating patients, their \nfamilies and health care providers about the importance of properly \nmanaging asthma.\n  As a United States Senator, as an American with asthma, and as the \nfather whose children have had asthma, I intend to look at this issue \nto see what I can do personally and what the federal government can do \nto address the shortcomings in asthma treatment this\n\n[[Page S12452]]\n\nreport reveals. We only have a day or two left in the 105th Congress. \nBut if we need legislation--if we need greater resources to deal with \nthis problem--I will do everything I can to make sure the 106th \nCongress addresses this issue and does what is necessary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/13/senate-section/article/S12451-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           STRENGTHENING ABUSE AND NEGLECT COURTS ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nhelp protect America's abused children. The bill is called the \nStrengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act of 1998. I am very proud to \nbe joined in this effort by Senators Rockefeller, Landrieu, and Chafee. \nI realize that time is running very short in this Congress, so my \ncosponsors and I will look to move this legislation during the next \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, last year Congress passed a historic piece of \nlegislation called the Adoption and Safe Families Act. The purpose of \nthat bill was to encourage safe and permanent family placements for \nabused and neglected children--and to decrease the amount of time they \nhave to stay in the foster care system.\n  One of the requirements of that new law is more timely decisionmaking \nby the courts with regard to adoption and other permanent placements \nfor children. The time-lines instituted by the Adoption and Safe \nFamilies Act, however, have increased the pressure on already \noverburdened courts that deal with abused and neglected children.\n  If we provide assistance to the courts--so that administrative \nefficiency and effectiveness are improved--the goals of last year's \nimportant legislation will be more readily achieved. Improved courts \nwill help more children find permanent homes more quickly.\n  That is the purpose of the bill I am introducing today. While \nacknowledging that abuse and neglect courts are already committed to \nquality administration of justice, this bill would further strengthen \nthe efficiency and effectiveness of the courts in the following five \nareas:\n  (1) Grants to State courts and local courts to automate data \ncollection and tracking of proceedings in abuse and neglect courts. \nThis would improve administrative efficiency and help evaluate overall \nperformance--and it would also develop computer systems that can be \nreplicated in other jurisdictions.\n  (2) Grants to reduce pending backlogs of abuse and neglect cases. \nThese grants will go to courts in order to reduce and hopefully \neliminate the backlog of cases awaiting disposition. The courts are \ngiven the flexibility to determine what method to use to reduce their \nbacklog, but suggestions include establishing night court sessions, \nhiring additional court personnel or extending the courts operating \nhours.\n  (3) Development of ``good practice'' standards for agency attorneys. \nThis would improve the quality of representation for children in the \nabuse and neglect system to ensure that their best interests are \nconsidered.\n  (4) Improved training (and cross-trainings) for judges, abuse and \nneglect attorneys, and court personnel. In this, as in so many areas, \nit's crucial that people with a special task receive special training. \nThis bill would partially reimburse States for training of judges, \njudicial personnel, agency attorney's and attorneys representing \nchildren and parents in abuse and neglect proceedings. It would also \nhelp fund cross-training between court and agency.\n  (5) Technical assistance for the development of and education on \n``good practice'' standards for attorneys practicing in abuse and \nneglect proceedings. The bill authorizes technical assistance funding \nto support abuse and neglect courts in the implementation of the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act.\n  (5) Expansion of the Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) Program \ninto underserved areas. The CASA Program has proven to be effective in \nensuring that children in the foster care system are protected and \nreceive appropriate services. This bill would help CASA expand its \nprograms in the 15 largest urban areas and develop multi-jurisdictional \nprograms in under-served rural areas, so that more children receive the \nbenefit of their services.\n  When we passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act last year, I said \nthat the bill is a good start, but that Congress will have to do more \nto make sure that every child has the opportunity to live in a safe, \nstable, loving and permanent home. One of the essential ingredients in \nthis process is an efficiently operating court system. After all, \nthat's where a lot of delays occur--for children who need permanent \nhomes. The courts have been neglected throughout the years and while \nother areas of child welfare have been emphasized and funded, the \ncourts have been left out of the process almost entirely.\n  It is my hope that with the introduction of this bill, we will start \nto change that syndrome--and make sure that courts will finally receive \nthe funding and training they need to make a positive difference in the \nlives of some of America's most at-risk young people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is reminded of the 5-minute rule.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at this desk on the floor of the Senate, I \nam surrounded by Indiana--the senior Senator from Indiana on my left, \nthe junior Senator from Indiana on my right. Together, they have come \nto reflect the character of their sober, peaceful, and productive \nsection of middle America. So close are the two Senators to one \nanother, almost alone among Members of this body, they share offices in \nthe State of Indiana, they share a strong and calm temperament, and \nthey share a commitment to the people they represent and to the people \nof the United States.\n  When this Congress adjourns in a few short hours, however, we will be \nlosing one of those Senators, Dan Coats. Dan Coats has grown in wisdom \nand in the respect that his fellow Senators have for him in each of the \n10 years during which he has served in the Senate--10 years that seem \nto me, in retrospect, to be all too short. With Dan Coats, what you see \nis what you get, a man who lives and defends and projects solid \nAmerican values, a love of family, a love of country, a love of God, a \nman who works hard, a man whose convictions are strong and unshakeable \nbut who combines with those convictions a willingness to listen to \nviews different from his own and to reach accommodations on matters of \npolicy when those accommodations do not shake his solid philosophical \nfoundation.\n  During the course of his 10 years in the Senate, Dan Coats has become \na good friend. I do not believe I can say that he is my closest friend \nin the Senate, nor I his. I can say, however, that I will greatly miss \nhis calm good humor, his ability to get to the central point of any \ndebate over policy or political philosophy, his rich dedication to the \nConstitution of the United States, to this body, and to the friends he \nhas made in this body.\n  We are only 100 men and women in the Senate, Mr. President. We see a \ngreat deal of one another, and we see ourselves and our colleagues \nunder great stress and under high pressures. As a consequence, it is \nvery difficult for any of us to hide the vital features of our \ncharacter or our personality from one another. Dan Coats, I must say, \nhas never attempted to hide anything about his character or about his \npersonality, and with me and with all of us it has worn well. He is the \nkind of individual whom you like and respect more and more with each \npassing day, and it is for just that reason that even if this Congress \nends up by accomplishing many of the purposes that each of us as \nindividuals set out to accomplish at the beginning of this Congress, we \nwill still go home with an empty heart, knowing that those of us who \nreturn in January will return without the daily advice, counsel, and \nfriendship of a magnificent U.S. Senator, Dan Coats of Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/13/senate-section/article/S12452-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12452-S12454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CHILD NUTRITION REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there is an old saying that ``where there \nis a will, there is a way.'' That is very true of this Congress.\n  Congress can work together when it wants to get a job done, when \nMembers focus on resolving issues rather than sound bites for the \nnightly news. I was pleased for example, to have worked with Senators \nBennett, Hatch, Dodd,\n\n[[Page S12453]]\n\nand many other on complex computer issues in the Y2K readiness bill, \nwhich we were able to pass without objection in the Senate.\n  It is unfortunate that sometimes when Congress quietly and \neffectively gets its job done, there is little press interest. So, for \na moment I want to draw attention to the child nutrition bill, which \nCongress passed by working together.\n  I want to pull everyone's attention away from the maelstrom to thank \nMembers of Congress on both sides of the aisle and their staffs for a \njob well done on the child nutrition bill.\n  At conference with the House, I asked that this child nutrition bill \nbe named in honor of Congressman Bill Goodling. The motion was \nimmediately and unanimously accepted. For years he has worked to \nimprove these programs. This will be his last reauthorization effort \nand we will miss his touch and his leadership the next time around.\n  I want to also thank Lynn Selmser who has been Chairman Goodling's \nchief nutrition advisor for years. She has worked hard on these issues \nand deserves a great deal of credit.\n  The Democratic conferees, Congressman Martinez of California and \nCongressman Bill Clay of Missouri, and their staffs, greatly \ncontributed to this effort and kept the interests of children front and \ncenter.\n  On the Senate side we worked together as a team. That is an even \ngreater compliment than normal considering all the other issues facing \nthe country.\n  Of course, Chairman Lugar set the bipartisan course and carefully \nincluded all of us in the process. He has extended to me every courtesy \nand is a great chairman who is tough but fair to all Members. His chief \ncounsel, Dave Johnson, has done, as he has always done in the past, an \noutstanding job from a legal and policy standpoint.\n  I switched places with my good friend Senator Harkin a couple years \nago. I took his job as ranking member on the nutrition subcommittee and \nhe took mine as ranking member on the full Agriculture Committee. \nSenator Harkin is a fighter for children and these programs and Iowa \nshould be proud of his accomplishments.\n  Mark Halverson, his chief counsel on the committee, has been his \nnutrition advisor for years and handles these matter with great skill.\n  Senator McConnell is chairman of the nutrition subcommittee and we \nhave worked together for years to help improve and strengthen these \nprograms. I was pleased that the Kentucky and Iowa child care pilot \nprojects were made permanent by this bill. Dave Hovermale has done a \nsuperb job on these issues.\n  The third Republican Conferee, Senator Cochran, is also the Chairman \nof the Agriculture Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. That \nis a lot of clout and it was well used to strengthen these child \nnutrition programs. I want to compliment Senator Cochran's agriculture \nstaff person, Hunt Shipman, who has worked on these issues for years \nand has done a tremendous job. Senator Cochran, with my full support \nwhen I was chairman, helped to create the School Food Service \nManagement Institute. I am pleased that this bill increases funding for \nthat Institute and makes it permanent.\n  I want to also thank Ed Barron of my staff who has advised me on \nnutrition issues and legislation for almost twelve years. I know that \nSenators on both sides of the aisle seek his advice on nutrition \nlegislation.\n  I also want to thank Michelle Barrett, who is on my staff, for \nhelping out regarding these nutrition issues.\n  USDA Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services Under Secretary Shirley \nWatkins has done a marvelous job in promoting child nutrition and \ngetting these programs and Department of Agriculture moving forward. \nThe President made a marvelous choice in sending her name to the \nSenate. I greatly appreciate her leadership and dedication. Her deputy, \nJulie Paradis, distinguished herself for years as a lead nutrition \nstaff person for the House Agriculture Committee. She has done a \nwonderful job at USDA and I greatly enjoy working with her. USDA's \n``Chairman's Hunger Initiative for Learning and Development'' contains \nimportant recommendations to the Congress and the country and was \nhelpful in this legislative process.\n  Also, I have appreciated the valuable input provided by the American \nSchool Food Service Association and their counsel Marshall Matz. Their \nLegislative Issue Papers and careful analysis of these matters makes \nour job easier.\n  The Food Research and Action Center helps galvanize grassroots \nsupports for these nutrition efforts. Their excellent report, ``Schools \nOut, Let's Eat,'' on the Child and Adult Care Food Program presented \nexcellent examples and information.\n  I appreciate the efforts of my fellow Vermonter Dr. Dick Narkewitz \nwho was chair of a major WIC advisory panel this year. I have always \nvalued his advice and counsel on WIC and other infant health issues.\n  I also want to mention the valuable assistance of the National \nAssociation of WIC Directors and their executive director Doug \nGreenaway. They have always made solid recommendations to the Congress.\n  The Food and Nutrition Service is an extremely well run agency and \nhas very dedicated, professional and intelligent staff who do an \noutstanding job for this nation. Simple stated, FNS is top-notch.\n  Also, Joe Richardson and Jean Jones of the CRS have provided Congress \nwith extremely helpful information and advice over the year--24 hours a \nday if needed. I know that Members on both sides of the aisle have the \nhighest regard for them.\n  Also, working with Chairman Lugar on nutrition issues is Danny \nSpellacy who is a rising star within the ranks.\n  Every four or five years the Congress takes a very careful look at \nits child nutrition programs. These programs are important to America's \nchildren and thus are important to America's future. Many teachers tell \nme they were surprised to learn how many children come to school \nhungry. There could be many reasons for this: extreme poverty, a \ndysfunctional family, child abuse or other nightmares heaped on young \nchildren.\n  Ed Barron's mother, Dorothy Barron, works for the Florida City \nElementary School in Florida City, Florida. This school is in the last \ntown before you hit Key Largo. She advises that many of the students \ncome to school hungry. The school meals programs are essential for \nthese children to be able to concentrate on learning.\n  Without school breakfast and lunch programs, many children would \nnever stand a chance because they would just get hungrier during the \nschool day. This bill will improve these programs and make it easier \nfor school food services to provide lunches and breakfasts. The bill \nalso includes a provision from a bill introduced by Senator Johnson \nwhich would authorize a study of the benefits of providing \n``universal'' breakfasts to grade school children.\n  The idea, and it is a good one, is to test how offering breakfasts to \nall children affects academic performance, test scores, truancy, \ntardiness and other matters. Preliminary studies have shown positive \neffects. While this bill does not provide mandatory funding for this \nstudy as was in the Senate bill, it does authorize such funding.\n  The WIC program is another great idea and program which is continued \nby the bill. Congress has rallied behind this program for a very good \nreason. Research shows that enhanced nutritional assistance for \npregnant women greatly increases the health of newborn children. \nIndeed, participation in WIC was shown to greatly reduce the incidence \nof newborns placed in neonatal intensive care.\n  WIC not only improves the health of those children but greatly \nreduces federal costs associated with Medicaid payments for that \nintensive care. The Congress has worked together to fund the WIC \nprogram and to improve its operation. Chairman Cochran and the ranking \nMember, Senator Bumpers, of the Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee \nare to be commended for their continuous support for these programs.\n  I am very proud to have worked with my colleagues to use cost \ncontainment to put well over one million additional pregnant women, \ninfants and children on the program each year at no extra cost to \ntaxpayers. We did this through an extremely simple idea--the government \nwas required to buy infant formula at the lowest cost possible, not at \nretail cost. This saves over $1.5 billion\n\n[[Page S12454]]\n\nper year. This reauthorization bill continues and strengthens that cost \ncontainment language.\n  The WIC Farmers' Market Program is also continued and expanded in \nthis bill. Mary Carlson was president of the National Association of \nFarmers' Market Nutrition Programs this year and helped me on this \nreauthorization effort. I appreciate that she flew down from Vermont to \nWashington to help with some of the discussions with staff. We were \nable to include some of her suggestions in this bill. Also, on the \nappropriations front, it does appear that Congress will provide $15 \nmillion for the WIC Farmers' Market program this year. On the national \nlevel, this new funding level will allow more states to participate in \nthis highly successful program.\n  I am very proud that the WIC Farmers' Market Program, called Farm-to-\nFamily in Vermont, got its start in legislation that I introduced in \nthe late 1980s. The program promotes consumption of fresh produce among \nlow income families participating in WIC, helps farmers, helps \ncommunities set up farmers' markets, and helps teach families how to \nbest use fresh fruits and vegetables. Fruits, vegetables, and other \nfarm products provide a healthy supplement to the dairy products, \njuices, and fortified cereals included in the WIC package.\n  In addition to being strongly liked by participating families, \nfarmers also like this program. A USDA study showed that WIC recipients \ncontinue to buy at farmer's markets long after they stopped getting WIC \nbenefits. In Vermont, more than 200 farmers currently participate in \nthe WIC Farmers' Market Program.\n  A participating farmer in New Hampshire said that ``the program \nenabled us to keep farming. Without it we would have been forced to \nstop.'' A Massachusetts farmer said: ``it made it possible for our \nsmall town farmers' market to get off the ground during its first \nyear.''\n  Mary Carlson has advised me that this program has had a significant \nrole in helping Vermont communities set up farmers' markets. In \nVermont, nearly 5,000 families participate in the program at over 30 \nfarmers' markets. This program leverages a very modest federal \ninvestment and helps farmers, farmers' markets and families throughout \nthe nation.\n  This bill also expands the reach of a nutrition program that is very \nimportant for homeless children living in emergency shelters. I hosted \na hearing on this matter in 1994 and His Eminence Anthony Cardinal \nBevilaqua of Philadelphia testified about the need for this program. It \nprovides food for young children living in homeless shelters and has \nbeen of great help to agencies and communities facing homelessness \namong children. The bill blends the food program for homeless children \ninto the child care food program. I anticipate that this will mean that \nall current shelters will be able to continue to participate and that \nadditional children could be served.\n  I take a great personal interest in this program and urge the \nDepartment to provide its benefits to as many needy children as \npossible. His Eminence sent me a letter and survey results regarding \nthis program late last year.\n  I will request a report from USDA on how this provision is \nimplemented during the next year and will contact sponsors including \nthe Archdiocese of Philadelphia to make sure the program continues to \noperate effectively. I appreciate the interest of USDA in this program.\n  The reauthorization bill also expands after-school child care \nprograms allowing parents to find and keep jobs. These programs are \nbecoming more and more important in Vermont and around the nation and I \nam very pleased that this bill provides additional funding and makes \nsignificant improvements in this area.\n  The bill also expands the summer food service program by making it \neasier for sponsors to serve more children. Robert Dostis, with the \nVermont Campaign to End Childhood Hunger, has done a wonderful job in \nVermont promoting this program as well as the school breakfast program. \nTheir ``Report on Childhood Hunger in Vermont'' brought these child \nnutrition issues to life. The bill expands the ability of churches and \nother nonprofit organizations to offer summer food service program \nmeals to more children.\n\n  Jo Busha, head of Vermont's child nutrition programs, has been \nrecognized for her tremendous efforts in getting more schools to offer \na breakfast program. I salute her and Robert Dostis for their work on \nbehalf of Vermont's children.\n  I know that the Vermont School Food Service Association will be \npleased that this bill will reduce red tape and burdensome school lunch \nrules. The bill lets them get their job done.\n  The bill continues a WIC breast feeding promotion program to \nencourage breast feeding instead of the use of infant formula. Working \nwith Senator Harkin, we were able to include the program in the 1989 \nreauthorization of child nutrition programs.\n  The bill also continues a program requested by former Majority Leader \nRobert Dole. This program helps assist children with disabilities to \nparticipate in the school lunch program and is a very good idea. I \nalways appreciated Senator Dole's counsel on these issues.\n  The reauthorization bill also continues funding for the national \ninformation clearinghouse which provides local communities and states \nwith information about gleaning, food sources, and programs that help \ncommunities and families help themselves. This clearinghouse has worked \nout very well and I want to commend World Hunger Year for the \ntremendous job they have done with this program. I know that my good \nfriend Chairman Ben Gilman has been a long time friend of World Hunger \nYear and that he, and many others, appreciate what they have done over \nthe years.\n  The bill also extends federal funding for local programs which \nintegrate nutrition and farming education into the regular school \ncurricula. This program is scored as a mandatory program and I \ncertainly hope that USDA actually funds it. I have suggested more than \nonce that USDA consider the Foodworks: Common Roots program in New York \nand Vermont. They have been commended in newspaper accounts and by the \nlocal principals as a great example of schools integrating the teaching \nof nutrition and farming into the regular school curricula. For \nexample, students would design and plant a garden with seeds for food \ngrown in colonial days. Young children would use simple math to plot \nout where to place seeds while advanced classes might mathematically \ndescribe the spiral of corn kernels on the cob.\n  Children could be taught about historic farming techniques and how \nthey are relevant today. The hands on gardening experience brings \nlearning to life an helps make math, science and history more \ninteresting.\n  I introduced a child nutrition bill last year--the Child Nutrition \nInitiatives Act, S. 1556--that contained a number of proposals that are \nincluded in this bill. Most important--in light of recent efforts to \nencourage work--are the after-school, and the child care, food \nprograms. Adequate after-school care for school-age children is \ncritical to permit parents to work. More schools should be able to \noffer after-school food programs.\n  I also cosponsored Senator Lugar's child nutrition reauthorization \nbill. I hope that some time in the future we can provide assured, \nmandatory funding for the WIC farmers' market program as I proposed in \nmy bill. By specifying exact annual caps we could assure funding for \nyears while, at the same time, exercise complete control over the size \nof the program. This approach follows a recommendation of the National \nAssociation of Farmers' Market Nutrition Programs.\n  I had also hoped that this reauthorization would provide additional \nfinancial support to help cover transportation costs for every rural \nareas--75 cents per child, per day--for the summer food service \nprogram. S. 1556 also would have helped create more summer food service \nprograms, by providing grants to cover one-time costs associated with \nsetting up a summer food service program.\n  I will work in the future to include some of these ideas into the \nnext reauthorization bill. I now look forward to the President signing \nthis important bill into law.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/13/senate-section/article/S12452-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12455]]\n                   RETIREMENT OF SENATOR DALE BUMPERS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have been honored to have the \nopportunity to hear Senator Bumpers share his perspective on public \nservice and his personal odyssey. His story is the story of the South--\ndepression, hardship, tough economic times, small businesses, and the \nson of a shopkeeper. I, too, am the son of a storekeeper and can \nunderstand and identify the qualities that have shaped Senator Bumpers' \nlife.\n  I have had the opportunity to personally observe his service in this \nbody for just 2 years, but in that short time I have been able to \nappreciate his many excellent qualities. He does indeed reflect the \ncharacter of the people of Arkansas. He is part of that State; he comes \nfrom its people; and, he shares its values. As an attorney who has \ntried many cases, I have had the pleasure to see him work on the floor \nof the Senate. He is articulate, able, well prepared, logical, and \npersuasive. He states his case very effectively. I can just imagine him \nbefore a jury in Arkansas as he boils down complex issues to their \nessence and appeals to their sense of values. I can see just why people \nrefer to him as an outstanding lawyer. Many denigrate that profession, \nand I have been a strong critic of some of the abuses of the legal \nprofession, but the skills possessed by the Senator from Arkansas are \nthose skills that make a lawyer most valuable. He cuts straight to the \nheart of the matter in words that are comprehensible by all.\n  Again, I am pleased to have served with the distinguished senior \nSenator from Arkansas and I wish him well in his future service. He has \nconducted himself with high standards and has not done anything to \nbring discredit on this body. He has stood courageously, alone if \nnecessary, for the values that he believed in. There is no doubt, I say \nto the children and grandchildren of the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas, that your father and grandfather has been an able and noble \npractitioner in this great deliberative body of the greatest nation in \nthe history of the world.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/13/senate-section/article/S12455-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hanrahan, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas passed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate.\n\n       H.R. 2349.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the populations of all but 1 species of rhinoceros, and \n     the tiger, have significantly declined in recent years and \n     continue to decline;\n       (2) these species of rhinoceros and tiger are listed as \n     endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) and listed on Appendix I of the \n     Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of \n     Wild Fauna and Flora, signed on March 3, 1973 (27 UST 1087; \n     TIAS 8249) (referred to in this title as ``CITES'');\n       (3) the Parties to CITES have adopted several resolutions--\n       (A) relating to the conservation of tigers (Conf. 9.13 \n     (Rev.)) and rhinoceroses (Conf. 9.14), urging Parties to \n     CITES to implement legislation to reduce illegal trade in \n     parts and products of the species; and\n       (B) relating to trade in readily recognizable parts and \n     products of the species (Conf. 9.6), and trade in traditional \n     medicines (Conf. 10.19), recommending that Parties ensure \n     that their legislation controls trade in those parts and \n     derivatives, and in medicines purporting to contain them;\n       (4) a primary cause of the decline in the populations of \n     tiger and most rhinoceros species is the poaching of the \n     species for use of their parts and products in traditional \n     medicines;\n       (5) there are insufficient legal mechanisms enabling the \n     United States Fish and Wildlife Service to interdict products \n     that are labeled or advertised as containing substances \n     derived from rhinoceros or tiger species and prosecute the \n     merchandisers for sale or display of those products; and\n       (6) legislation is required to ensure that--\n       (A) products containing, or labeled or advertised as \n     containing, rhinoceros parts or tiger parts are prohibited \n     from importation into, or exportation from, the United \n     States; and\n       (B) efforts are made to educate persons regarding \n     alternatives for traditional medicine products, the \n     illegality of products containing, or labeled or advertised \n     as containing, rhinoceros parts and tiger parts, and the need \n     to conserve rhinoceros and tiger species generally.\n\n     SEC. 403.
