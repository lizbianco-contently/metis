If cloture is not invoked, the Senate can be expected to resume \ndebate on the Massiah-Jackson nomination and then, at approximately 4 \np.m. today, the Senate can be expected to begin debate on the \nnomination of Margaret Morrow, of California, to be U.S. district \njudge.\n  I want to emphasize that even though we are going back to debate on \nMassiah-Jackson, that does not mean we will stay on that nomination all \nthe way until 4 o'clock.

Additional votes can be expected to occur during today's session of \nthe Senate.\n  As a reminder to all Senators, at 10 a.m. this morning a vote will \noccur on the cloture motion and we probably will have a vote late this \nafternoon on the Morrow nomination. It appears at this time that would \noccur probably around 6 o'clock, even though we have not advised \neverybody that that is our intent, or gotten an absolute commitment, \nbut I believe there will probably be a vote about 6 o'clock on the \nMorrow nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Who seeks the floor? Who yields time? The \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I have 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time between now and 10 o'clock is evenly \ndivided.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it is my intention to open the debate, then yield to \nSenator Mack, then Senator Thurmond, and then Senator Kennedy for the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Members of this distinguished body to vote \nno on cloture. I do so because I believe that by voting for cloture \ntoday we could do enormous harm.\n  The technique involved here, somatic cell nuclear transfer, creates \nwhat are called stem cells, which can be used for creation of tissue \nwhich has the same DNA as the person whose tissue it is. Therefore they \nare used as important adjuncts in cancer research; they offer\n\n[[Page S600]]\n\nimportant opportunities to overcome rejection of tissue in third-degree \nburns; to solve major problems inherent in juvenile diabetes; for \nosteoporosis; for Alzheimers; for Parkinsons disease; and for a host of \nother diseases.\n  Mr. President, there is no need to rush to judgment. No one, I \nbelieve, in this body, supports human cloning. There is a scientific \nmoratorium on human cloning. The FDA has exercised jurisdiction to \nprevent it.\n  There is no need to rush to judgment. This bill is less than a week \nold. There has been no hearing on it. There are no definitions of \ncritical terms in this bill.\n  Let me quote what the American Cancer Society has said in a letter \ndated February 9:\n\n       The American Cancer Society urges you to oppose S. 1601, \n     legislation that would prohibit the use of somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer. The American Cancer Society agrees with the \n     public that human cloning should not proceed at this time. \n     However, the legislation as drafted would have the perhaps \n     unintended effect of restricting critical scientific \n     research. The language could hamper or punish scientists who \n     contribute to our growing knowledge about cancer.\n\n  Last evening I had printed in the Record a huge volume of letters \nfrom virtually every single patient group, 27 Nobel prize winners, and \nindustry groups--all saying go slow, use caution.\n  I urge this body to vote no on cloture.\n  If I may, now, I yield 3 minutes of my time to the distinguished \nSenator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the distinguished Senator from California for \nyielding this time. I have prepared remarks that I have gone over with \nmy staff that cover things like it is obvious that there is no medical \nor ethical justification for human cloning. We all understand that. We \nalso know there have been no hearings. We know as well that we have \ninformation from 27 Nobel laureates who say we should not pass this \nlegislation. We have letters from 71 patient groups and scientific \norganizations that say we should not do this.\n  But let me say to my colleagues that I stand here this morning to \nmake a special appeal. My father died of cancer. My mother died of \ncancer. My brother died of cancer. I was diagnosed with cancer. My wife \nwas diagnosed with cancer. Our daughter was diagnosed with cancer.\n  I say to my colleagues, I appeal to you, don't get drawn into this \ndebate that we should pass this legislation because we want to stand up \nand make a statement that we are against cloning. We are all against \nhuman cloning. We are all against human cloning. What I am asking you \nto do is to vote no on cloture so we will have an opportunity to hear \nfrom those patient groups that want to represent people like myself, \nrepresent families that have been affected like my family has been \naffected. Let us hear from the scientific community that tells us \nwhether this is the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do. I don't \nmake a suggestion here that this is an easy decision to be made. It is \na very difficult one. But that's all the more reason that you should \nvote against cloture and allow the process to take place--to have \ninput, to have discussion, to have understanding. Then we then will be \nin a position to try to make a decision about what is the right thing \nto do. We just say let the process work. Let there be input.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote no on cloture and to support moving \nthe process forward.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from California for yielding.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished Senator for his comments. \nIndeed, they were very, very moving. I can share my family story, \nalthough it is not as dramatic, Senator, as yours --I lost my husband \nto cancer, I lost my mother, my father, my in-law's. So I, in a sense, \nshare this with the Senator. I know in their last days how important \nresearch is to patients and how willing they are to try new things. \nLife is critically important.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  If I may, I allot 3 minutes of my time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue of \ngreat international concern. Since February 1997, when Scottish \nscientists succeeded in cloning an adult sheep, the world has been \nconsumed with the issue of cloning. There are great social and ethical \nimplications of the potential application of this procedure to totally \nreproduce human beings. Obviously, there is no acceptable justification \nfor replicating another human being, and the bill before the Senate, S. \n1601, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act, would ensure that such a \nprocedure would never take place in this country. However, I am \nconcerned that this bill may be written so broadly that it will \nrestrict future promising research which could lead to improved \ntreatment or even a cure for many serious illnesses. The Juvenile \nDiabetes Foundation informs me that this bill would prohibit promising \nstem cell research that could make it possible to produce pancreatic \nbeta cells that could then be transplanted into a person with diabetes. \nAs a consequence, many of the horrible complications of this disease, \nincluding kidney failure, blindness, amputation, increased risk of \nheart disease and stroke, and premature death, could be eliminated. \nLikewise, I am informed by other representatives of the medical \ncommunity that this bill could prohibit research into treatment of the \nfollowing diseases and ailments: leukemia; sickle cell anemia; \nAlzheimers disease; Parkinson's disease; multiple sclerosis; spinal \ncord injuries; liver disease; severe burns; muscular dystrophy; \narthritis; and heart disease.\n  Mr. President, there have been no committee hearings on S. 1601 and, \ntherefore, no opportunity for the medical community to fully explain \nthe implications of this legislation. My daughter, Julie, suffers from \ndiabetes, and I do not want her, or others like her, to be denied the \npotential life saving benefits of research that this bill could \nrestrict. But without the appropriate committee hearings, we do not \nfully understand what these benefits may be. This is far too important \nan issue for us to rush this bill to the floor without committee \nhearings. While we can all agree that to replicate a human being is \nimmoral, we need to investigate this issue more thoroughly so that we \ndo not deny our citizens and our loved ones of any possible life saving \nresearch. For this reason, I will not support cloture on the motion to \nproceed to S. 1601, and I strongly recommend that this bill be sent to \ncommittee so that the appropriate hearings can be held.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, how much time is left on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 12 minutes and \n30 seconds and the Senator from California has 3 minutes and 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on cloture so that we may proceed to \ndebate an issue which generates many profound ethical and moral \nquestions, ones which demand our immediate attention.\n  Let me be quite clear. This bill does not stop existing scientific \nresearch. I am as concerned as anyone here about the need for research \non a whole range of diseases, things that can be perhaps cured or at \nleast dealt with by stem cell research, by many other techniques that \nare now in progress today. Our bill does not stop any of that research.\n  Let's be quite clear, our bill does not stop any of that promising \nresearch now underway. The measure places a very narrow ban on the use \nof somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a human embryo. That is what \nwe are talking about. Everybody said, ``We agree we shouldn't be \ncreating a human embryo by cloning,'' and that is what this bill does.\n  Over the past week, we have had a lot of distortion and, \nunfortunately, inflamed rhetoric by some of the big special interests, \nthe likes of which I have not seen in my many years of public service. \nWe have asked our opponents on numerous occasions, we have sat down \nwith them, Senator Frist, Senator Gregg, our staffs and I sat down\n\n[[Page S601]]\n\nand said, ``OK, if we all agree we shouldn't be creating a human embryo \nby cloning, how do you want to tighten it up?''\n  They are not willing to come forward because there are some rogue \nscientists, maybe some big drug companies, big biotech companies, who \nwant to create human embryos by cloning. They think that would be a \ngreat way to be more profitable, to do some research on cloned human \nembryos. I think that is where we need to draw the line.\n  People say we want to have hearings. We have had hearings on the \nwhole issue last year. We have debated it, and it comes down to the \nsimple point: Do you want to say no to creating human embryos by \ncloning, by somatic cell nuclear transfer, or do you want to say, as my \ncolleague from California would in her bill, ``Oh, it's fine to create \nthose human embryos by somatic cell nuclear transfer, so long as you \ndestroy them, so long as you kill those test tube babies before they \nare implanted''?\n  There are a couple problems, very practical problems. Once you start \ncreating those cloned human embryos, it is a very simple procedure to \nimplant them. Implantation of embryos is going along in fertility \nresearch now, and it would be impossible to police, to make sure they \ndidn't start implanting them.\n  But even if the objectives of the bill of my California colleague \nwere carried out, it would mean that you would be creating human \nembryos by cloning, researching with them, working with them and \ndestroying them. Do we want to step over that ethical line? I say no.\n  It is not going to be any clearer 3 months from now, 6 months from \nnow than it is now. What is going to be different is that in 3 or 6 \nmonths, the rogue scientist in Chicago or others may well start the \nprocess of cloning human embryos by somatic cell nuclear transfer. That \nis why we say it is important to move forward on this bill.\n  If we bring this bill to the floor, we are happy to listen to and ask \nfor specific suggestions from those who are concerned about legitimate \nresearch, but we have been advised time and time again that there is no \nlegitimate research being done now in the biotech industry that uses \nsomatic cell nuclear transfer to clone and create a human embryo as \npart of the research on any of these diseases.\n  We have heard from patient groups, people who are very much \nconcerned, as we all are, about cancer, about juvenile diabetes, cystic \nfibrosis, Alzheimer's--the whole range of diseases. We can deal with \nthose diseases. We can deal with the research without cloning a human \nembryo.\n  The approach of my colleagues from California and Massachusetts would \nlead us down the slippery slope that would allow the creation of masses \nof human embryos as if they were assembly line products, not human \nlife. How would the Federal Government police the implantation of these \nhuman embryos?\n  By allowing the creation of cloned test tube babies so long as they \nare not implanted, our opponents' bill calls for the creation, \nmanipulation and destruction of human embryos for research purposes.\n  I have a letter that I will enter into the Record from Professor Joel \nBrind, Professor of Human Biology and Endocrinology at Baruch College, \nThe City University of New York. He addresses the question of stem cell \nresearch. I quote from a portion of it:\n\n       Industry opponents also correctly point out that S. 1601 \n     would ban the production of human embryos for research or \n     other purposes entirely unrelated to the aim of cloning a \n     human being. And well it should . . . In fact, it is in this \n     area of research and treatment, to wit, the generation of \n     stem cells, from which replacement tissues or organs could be \n     produced for transplantation into the patient from whom the \n     somatic cell originally came, which is most important to the \n     biotech industry, for obvious reasons. For reasons just as \n     obvious to anyone with any moral sense, such practices must \n     be outlawed, for otherwise, our society would permit the \n     generation of human beings purely for the purpose of \n     producing spare parts for others, and thence to be destroyed. \n     Some may call this a ``slippery slope''--I believe ``sheer \n     cliff'' would be more accurate.\n\n  Mr. President, I will add one other thing. He said:\n\n       . . . S. 1601 would, in fact, place real restrictions on \n     stem cell research. Stem cell researchers would have to \n     continue to work with somatic cell nuclear transfer \n     technology in animal systems, in order to learn how to \n     transcend the need for producing zygotes first. However, this \n     is no different from restricting cancer research by \n     prohibiting the injection of cancer cells into human beings \n     (instead of rats) and then testing potential anticancer drugs \n     on them. As a civilized society, we do have to live with \n     meaningful ethical constraints or we end up with the likes of \n     the Tuskegee experiment.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   Baruch College,\n\n\n                               Department of Natural Sciences,\n\n                                  New York, NY, February 10, 1998.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sir: This letter is written in support of S. 1601, \n     which is designed to ban the ``cloning'' of human beings. I \n     have placed the word ``cloning'' in quotes, because, as \n     claimed by opponents in the biotech industry, the bill would \n     technically ban more than cloning, which, precisely defined, \n     would be limited to use of somatic cells genetically \n     identical to an existing human being (including an embryo or \n     fetus). In other words, the bill closes a gaping loophole--to \n     wit, the use of cells whose DNA has been modified \n     artificially, or use of a fertilized nucleus--that would \n     exist in the legislation, were it to be limited to cloning in \n     its precise, technical sense. That is precisely why S. 1601 \n     is a good bill, because it adequately defines a `bright line' \n     in the establishment of appropriate standards for stem cell \n     research.\n       This `bright line' drawn by S. 1601 is the line between the \n     generation of a human zygote--i.e., a totipotent one-celled \n     embryo; the equivalent of a complete human body at the time \n     of conception--by the in vivo or in vitro union of haploid \n     sperm and haploid egg, and the generation of a human zygote \n     by the artificial means known as somatic cell transfer \n     (`haploid' means half the normal human complement of 46 \n     nuclear chromosomes [DNA], or 23. Only sperm and egg are \n     haploid, while all other body cells--a.k.a. somatic cells--\n     have 46 nuclear chromosomes. `Totipotent' means that the one-\n     celled embryo [zygote] is capable of giving rise to a \n     completely differentiated human body, i.e., fully formed \n     human being). In somatic cell transfer, a zygote is \n     artificially produced by the introduction of a diploid (i.e., \n     containing a full set of 46 chromosomes) nucleus from a body \n     cell or a zygote, into an egg from which the nucleus has been \n     removed. Thus, the bill clearly prohibits the generation of a \n     human embryo by the artificial means of somatic cell \n     transfer, whether the procedure may be strictly defined as \n     cloning or not. (Note: It may be argued that in vitro \n     fertilization is also artificial, however it is the \n     artificial assistance of a natural process. A good analogy \n     would be the difference between growing ordinary tomatoes in \n     a greenhouse--artificial assistance--and growing genetically \n     engineered tomatoes--artificially produced individuals.)\n       Industry opponents also correctly point out that S. 1601 \n     would ban the production of human embryos for research or \n     other purposes entirely unrelated to the aim of cloning a \n     human being. And well it should, for the production of a \n     zygote is the production of a human being, which would then \n     be destroyed after use in research, or to generate spare \n     parts for the treatment of patients suffering from a variety \n     of ills. In fact, it is this area of research and treatment, \n     to wit, the generation of stem cells, from which replacement \n     tissues or organs could be produced for transplantation into \n     the patient from whom the somatic cell originally came, which \n     is most important to the biotech industry, for obvious \n     reasons. For reasons just as obvious to anyone with any moral \n     sense, such practices must be outlawed, for otherwise, our \n     society would permit the generation of human beings purely \n     for the purpose of producing spare parts for others, and \n     thence to be destroyed. Some may call this a `slippery \n     slope'--I believe `sheer cliff' would be more accurate.\n       What then? Does S. 1601 stop the field of stem cell \n     research, with all its potential for life-saving and life-\n     extending treatment, in its tracks? In a word, no. In fact \n     one form of stem cell transplantation--bone marrow \n     transplatation--has already been in wide use for years. Stem \n     cells are body cells which are primitive and \n     undifferentiated, and capable of giving rise to a variety of \n     differentiated cell types and/or tissues and/or organs. For \n     example, in a bone marrow transplant, the transplanted cells \n     give rise, in the recipient's body, to the whole host of \n     different types of white blood cells, red blood cells and \n     platelets. Stem cells are thus `pluripotent'--capable of \n     forming many different types of cells, but not an entire \n     human being, as would a totipotent cell or zygote. Of course \n     the most precise way to obtain stem cells, especially if they \n     are to be modified in order to correct a genetic defect, is \n     to first generate a whole embryo--such as by somatic cell \n     transfer--and then let it develop into a multicellular \n     embryo, and finally harvest the desired stem cells and throw \n     the rest away. Therefore S. 1601 would in fact place real \n     restrictions on stem cell research. Stem cell researchers \n     would have to continue to work with somatic cell nuclear \n     transfer\n\n[[Page S602]]\n\n     technology in animal systems, in order to learn how to \n     transcend the need for producing zygotes first. However this \n     is no different from restricting cancer research by \n     prohibiting the injection of cancer cells into human beings \n     (instead of rats) and then testing potential anti-cancer \n     drugs on them. As a civilized society, we do have to live \n     with meaningful ethical constraints, or we end up with the \n     likes of the Tuskegee experiment.\n       Biotech industry opponents also point out that one form of \n     somatic cell nuclear transfer has already been used \n     successfully in the treatment of infertility. In particular, \n     a zygote produced the natural way--from the union of sperm \n     and egg--is used to supply a diploid nucleus for transfer \n     into a normal egg from which the nucleus has been removed. \n     Who would need such a treatment?--a woman who has a genetic \n     defect in her mitochondrial, rather than in her nuclear DNA. \n     The mitochondria are the energy-producing parts of a cell, \n     and we all inherit them from our mothers (from the non-\n     nuclear part of the egg). If the mitochondrial DNA is \n     defective the zygote will not be viable, even if the nuclear \n     DNA is fine. Hence, transfer of the viable nucleus into a \n     denucleated egg from a normal donor will result in a viable \n     zygote. Fine, except that the offspring thus produced now has \n     two biological mothers, both having provided genetic material \n     essential for the offspring's survival. The legal nightmares \n     following the use of this technology are easily envisioned, \n     and the fact that it has already been done underscores the \n     need for enacting the present legislation without delay.\n       I also wish to comment on alternative legislation which \n     proposes to allow cloning or artificial production of human \n     embryos, provided they are destroyed and not permitted to be \n     born or even implanted into a woman's uterus. Such \n     legislation is worse than no legislation at all. Permitting \n     the destruction of innocent human life is abhorrent enough--\n     but to mandate it?\n       Finally I report the essence of a conversation I had \n     earlier today with some colleagues, concerning the matter at \n     hand. They said that the banning of this technology would \n     only result in its pursuit beyond the borders of the United \n     States. I replied by asking them to name any foundation \n     document or scripture for any civilization ever in history, \n     in which was inscribed as a principle any version of ``If you \n     can't beat'em, join `em''? I implore you in the strongest \n     possible terms to resist at every turn this product of \n     corrupt mentality.\n       Please feel free to contact me at any time if I may be of \n     any further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Joel Brind, Ph.D.,\n                       Professor, Human Biology and Endocrinology.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you. Mr. President, I very much regret the fact \nthat the Senator from Missouri has chosen to mischaracterize both my \nposition and my bill. I hope we will have a chance in committee to iron \nthat out. But at this time, I yield the remainder of my time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 3 minutes \nand 13 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. President, as the Senator from California has pointed out, we \nhave someone who doesn't describe our position accurately and then \ndiffers with the position. And that is just what has happened here on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  First of all, the committee which deals with these issues on public \nhealth has not had 1 day, 1 hour, 1 minute of hearings on this \nlegislation. The distinguished Senator, Senator Bond, has said, \n``Couldn't we sit down and discuss these measures?'' All we are saying \nis that a no vote gives us an opportunity to sit down in the committee \nand hear from the research organizations and the ethicists to try and \ndraft legislation that is in the interest of the patients of this \ncountry.\n  We have challenged those who support this legislation to mention one \nmajor research or patient group that supports their position. All we \nhear is about special interest groups that are going to benefit from \nthis program.\n  Do we consider the cancer society a special interest group? Do we \nconsider the American Heart Association, the Parkinsons Action Network \nand the Alzheimers Aid Society special interest groups? If they are \nspecial interest groups, we are proud to stand with them. They know \nwhat is at risk. And those who support this legislation have not been \nable to bring to the floor of the U.S. Senate reputable researchers who \nbelieve that research towards alleviating human suffering will not be \ncurtailed by this legislation.\n  This has been pointed out effectively by the Senator from Florida and \nthe Senator from South Carolina. This is not a partisan issue. We all \nwant to have the best in terms of research for our families, for the \nAmerican people and for the world.\n  We are effectively cutting off opportunities to advance biomedical \nresearch if we impose cloture today. Let's give the committees the \nopportunity for full, open, informed, balanced judgment and then come \nback to the floor of the U.S. Senate and have a debate on this issue. \nDon't cut off one of the great opportunities for research in this \ncountry by voting for cloture today. I reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to support the underlying bill and \nhope that we will be able to proceed with a discussion of the bill \ntoday. No longer can we divorce science from ethical consideration. \nScience moves too fast today. We see it, with what has resulted from \nDolly with this cloning procedure. Science and ethics must march hand \nin hand.\n  What does this bill do? No. 1: It prevents cloning of a human being. \nIt stops people, like Dr. Seed, who have proposed cloning human \nindividuals dead in their tracks.\n  No. 2: It creates a commission, 25 people, bipartisan, broadly \nrepresentative of the American people, ethicists on board, the very \nbest scientists on board, social scientists on board and lay people on \nboard. That commission will consider new technology, will consider \ncloning, will consider the next potential great advance that is out \nthere with that ethical, theological and scientific environment.\n\n  What does this bill do? This bill does not stop any current research \nbeing done in in vitro fertilization, in stem cells, in \ntransplantation. And I challenge any scientist, because the scientific \ncommunity and the private industry and all say, ``No, we can't stop \nscience,'' we need to involve that ethical decisionmaking today--I do \nchallenge any scientist who reads the wording in the bill to send me a \npeer-reviewed study that is banned by the wording of this bill. Read \nthe bill.\n  Do we eliminate all embryo research? No, only a single technique, \nthat balance we have achieved between hope and the potential \nopportunities for a technique versus the ethical consideration and the \nscience we have achieved by looking at a single technique.\n  We don't eliminate all embryo research, just a single technique when \napplied to the procedure when it clones a human embryo. That is the \nonly area.\n  Do we eliminate all of this technique? Do we eliminate all of this \nsomatic cell nuclear transfer? Absolutely not. The Dolly experiments \ncontinue. The animal research continues in somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer.\n  The only thing we eliminate is the future application when this \ntechnique is used only in the circumstance to create a live cloned \nhuman embryo. All animal research continues today. This is an untested \nprocedure. It may be harmful. It has not been proven to be safe today. \nShouldn't we be looking at it in animal models instead of taking it to \nthe human population? That is what this bill does. Slow down. Let's do \nthat animal research before creating live cloned human embryos.\n  It is a tough issue. I don't want to slow down science and the \nprogress of science, but I do think that we, as a society, absolutely \nmust recognize that not all science can proceed ahead without \nconsideration by the American people, without consideration of the \nethical implications. All of the hopes that have been mentioned in \nterms of curing disease projected into the future, I have those same \nhopes, but I also recognize that we can't go totally on uncharted \ncourses. Science has been abused in the past. We can look back at \nHitler and what Hitler did in the name of science. We have to take \nthese ethical considerations and put them hand in hand in the progress \nof science.\n  Let me close and simply say, the commission is vital to this \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S603]]\n\n We have to have a forum that is not on the Senate floor, that is not \njust in the scientific communities, to address these issues. That is \nwhat this commission achieves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today, I rise to state my unequivocal \nsupport for a federal ban on human cloning. However, I am uncomfortable \nwith the hurried pace with which this issue is being considered in the \nSenate.\n  The issue before us is both extremely complex and consequential. \nRegulating the very cutting edge of medical science will impact our \nfights against nearly every category of disease, including cancer, \nheart disease, blindness, Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases to name \nbut a few.\n  The United States must maintain its preeminent position as the \ninternational leader in biotechnological research, but do so while \nadhering to the highest moral and ethical standards. Any prohibition of \ncloning needs to be very carefully constructed and tested by public \nhearing to assure that both of these goals might be fulfilled.\n  The Food and Drug Administration has claimed authority to regulate \nthis technology now, eliminating the need for immediate legislative \naction. Knowing this, and with lives at stake, I believe all Senators \nshould have the opportunity to benefit from a thorough public \nexamination of this proposal.\n  For these reasons, I will not support cloture on the motion to \nconsider S. 1601 in hopes that this matter will be further evaluated at \nthe committee level.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks on the \nmatter of human cloning.\n  I believe that as the Senate debates this issue that is so \nfundamental to the meaning and the essence of what it means to be a \nperson we must consider very carefully the moral implications \nassociated with the issue of human cloning.\n  Certainly there is no moral prohibition, nor could one effectively be \nargued, against the cloning of plants or even animals--there is \nsomething fundamentally different. Also, no one is arguing against \ntissue research or other important research. The issue today is \nstrictly limited to the use of technologically feasible methods to \ncreate and manipulate new life through a process of human cloning. And \nbeyond that, the issue is whether or not it is morally permissible to \nclone human beings.\n  This issue demands the public attention because it implicitly \nrevolves around the meaning of human dignity and the inalienable rights \nthat belong to every person.\n  But before discussing this in particular I think it is necessary to \nengage in a discussion on an even more fundamental level.\n  What is even more fundamental in this discussion is the question of \nthe place occupied by the birth of a new child in our society.\n\n  First it is worth noting that there is a symmetrical quality to the \ncurrent debate in our culture. And although the underlying \nphilosophical premise is the same, the outcomes are radically \ndifferent. I believe it is one of the tragedies of our times that in \nthe midst of a culture which has allowed over 35 million abortions to \nbe performed over the last twenty-five years, we now desire to create \nhuman life by our own hands. On the one hand, we deny God's creation, \non the other, we seek to create life in our own image and deny God yet \nagain. This is tragic on both counts.\n  I personally believe, and 2,000 years of Western tradition support \nthis belief, that the birth of any child is an unmerited gift from God \nto a man and woman. Some in recent years, have given us a notion of a \nchild as an object merely for the fulfillment of a man and woman's \npersonal desire. It should be reasserted though that a child is not and \ncan never be an object merely for the fulfillment of a man and woman's \npersonal desire. A child is a precious and unmerited gift from God. God \nalone gives human life--but human cloning usurps that role. And I do \nnot believe that we can ever do that.\n  The creation of new life outside of man and woman is a gross \ndistortion of the moral natural law.\n  Human cloning distorts the relationship between man and woman by \nnegating the necessity of either one in the creation of new life and \nconsequently also usurps the role of God in the creation of new life. \nFundamentally, it alters the view of the child to the world in such a \nway that the child is seen as something which can fulfill the needs of \nan individual physically, emotionally or spiritually. This is an \nincorrect view and is a gross violation of our duty to protect the \nhuman dignity of each and every person. It reduces a child to a means \nto an end and denies them the dignity they deserve to be treated not as \na means but as an end in and of themselves.\n  And this notion is precisely where the disagreement on this issue \nexists between the Administration and the cloning bill before us today.\n  Some will argue that the issue simply needs to be studied before any \nresearch begins--a notion which does not rest on the supposition of a \nchild as a gift. This is wrong. There is no research that can ever \njustify the willful technological manipulation and creation of human \nlife through the process of human cloning for the furtherance of \nscience--or even for the preservation of humanity.\n  The White House doesn't want a permanent ban--they want a limited \nmoratorium. This indicates that they believe there may be a use for \nthis technology as it relates to the issue of human cloning. But no \nsuch use exists. The act of cloning a human being for the purposes of \nstudy, or for the purpose of bringing new life into the world is \nintrinsically evil and should be absolutely prohibited.\n  Also, there is another dimension to this debate which is fraught with \nproblems and that is the rationale that will develop should cloning be \nallowed.\n  But what few have mentioned in this discourse is that implicit in the \nrush to begin cloning human beings is the eugenic rationale that will \nultimately develop in support of it. Already, there are stories--what I \nwould call horror stories--of people asking for specific genetic \nattributes when deciding to participate in in vitro fertilization. And \nwhen we are able to shop for a baby in the same way that we shop for a \ncar; by whimsically creating new life based solely on our own personal \nconvenience and satisfying our own personal desire, we effectively say: \n``God we do not need You anymore, we can do this ourselves.''\n  And that is just wrong.\n  Mr. President, it would be a serious mistake and an abdication of our \nduty as responsible legislators to allow the devaluation of human life \nthat would take place if we allowed for human cloning. There should be \nno human cloning. Period.\n  Mr. President, as we continue to debate this issue I would urge my \ncolleagues to examine the role of our government in this debate and to \nthen reach the only conclusion possible: that human cloning seriously \nthreatens the dignity of human beings and it is our responsibility to \nabsolutely prohibit human cloning and in so doing decisively end debate \non this issue once and for all.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to offer some comments on the \ncloning legislation that we are now debating.\n  I think that this has been an important debate, one which should \ncontinue. It is a debate that involves many difficult, troublesome \nissues. I come to this debate as a concerned pro-life Senator, who also \nhas profound questions about the scientific implications of this bill.\n  I can tell you that scientists from my home state of Utah are \nfollowing these discussions very closely.\n  I am proud that researchers at the University of Utah and the \nHuntsman Cancer Center are at the cutting edge of science. It was \nscientists at Myriad Genetics of Salt Lake City who were co-discoverers \nof a gene--the BRCA 1 gene--that causes some types of breast cancer.\n  Let me share with you a letter that I received from Dr. Ray White, \nthe Director of the Huntsman Center. I ask for unanimous consent that \nthe text of this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the letter was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S604]]\n\n\n\n\n                                    Huntsman Cancer Institute,\n\n                             Salt Lake City, UT, February 5, 1998.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: It has been brought to my attention \n     that there is now pending legislation from the Senate \n     leadership that would make it a criminal offense to utilize \n     somatic cell nuclear transfer technology. The intent of the \n     legislation is to prevent the cloning of humans. I agree \n     completely and whole-heartedly with this intention. It would \n     be a travesty and tragic ethical transgression to create \n     cloned human individuals. However, this technology is the \n     basis for a broad range of studies in biomedical research and \n     a ban would halt research in many areas that promise major \n     benefits for mankind.\n       For example, injection of fetal brain cells is thought to \n     possibly provide benefits to individuals suffering from \n     Parkinson's disease. Obtaining such cells from fetal \n     materials can create its own ethical dilemmas. It would be \n     far better to be able to reprogram the patient's own cells \n     for this purpose. Nuclear transfer technology might well \n     provide ways to accomplish this desired goal without raising \n     such ethical issues.\n       It is important and possible to create legislation that \n     will achieve the desired goal of preventing human cloning. I \n     urge you to please consider carefully the downstream negative \n     consequences of an overly broad legislative stroke. By all \n     means, let us outlaw human cloning. But let us not eliminate \n     promising pathways of research that could relieve human \n     suffering.\n       Thank you very much for your attention.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Raymond L. White,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with Dr. White that we should try to find a way to \nban cloning of human beings but do so in a way that allows, to the \nextent ethically proper, valuable research to continue.\n  In these type of debates many of us value the opinion of my good \nfriend and colleague from Tennessee, Senator Frist. As a physician he \nbrings a unique perspective to issues of science and medicine. He is \nalso a co-sponsor of S. 1601, the bill pending before this body.\n  Let me also share with you a letter I sent to Senator Frist on this \nbill. It is a short letter which I ask unanimous consent to insert in \nthe Record at this point:\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 1998.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bill: I am following the debate on the human cloning \n     bill very closely. My interest is twofold: As Chairman of the \n     Judiciary Committee, I have a special responsibility for \n     considering any legislation such as S. 1601 that creates new \n     criminal penalties. In addition, my long-standing interest in \n     biomedical research and ethics compels me to understand a \n     bill which has such far ranging public health consequences.\n       As you know, throughout my career, I have always taken a \n     strong pro-family and pro-life stance, especially those \n     relating to abortion and human reproduction. I have also \n     spent considerable efforts to see that the United States \n     remains the world's leader in biomedical research so that our \n     citizens may continue to benefit from revolutionary \n     breakthroughs in science. I know that you share my belief \n     that we have a responsibility to facilitate the advance of \n     medical science in a manner that to the greatest extent \n     possible respects the religious and ethical concerns of a \n     diverse population.\n       I believe that there is widespread agreement that the \n     cloning of human beings is undesirable and should be stopped. \n     However, in achieving this end we must take care not to cut \n     off--unwisely and unnecessarily--vitally important avenues of \n     research. Dr. Raymond L. White, Director of the Huntsman \n     Cancer Institute at the University of Utah, has voiced his \n     concern about this matter: ``It is important and possible to \n     create legislation that will achieve the desired goal of \n     preventing human cloning. I urge you to please consider \n     carefully the downstream negative consequences of an overly \n     broad legislative stroke. By all means, let us outlaw human \n     cloning. But let us not eliminate promising pathways of \n     research that could relieve human suffering.''\n       I am committed to legislation that prevents human cloning \n     but allows vital research to continue into areas such as \n     Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, diabetes, and many \n     cancers. You raised a number of cogent points during our \n     debate on Thursday. To better understand the operation of S. \n     1601, I would appreciate it if you can provide your thoughts \n     on the following:\n       1. S. 1601 does not define the term ``embryo''. Do you \n     believe that the initially created single cell product of \n     somatic cell nuclear transfer is an ``embryo''? Is there \n     consensus among scientists on this?\n       2. What is the intent of S. 1601 with respect to allowing, \n     or disallowing, the creation of a one cell entity through \n     somatic cell nuclear transfer to be cultured in vitro to \n     produce tissue intended to treat, cure, diagnose, or mitigate \n     diseases or other conditions? Specifically, what types of \n     research and development activities would be permitted or \n     precluded?\n       3. S. 1601 does not define the term ``somatic cell.'' Do \n     you consider fertilized eggs of the type used in \n     mitochondrial or cytoplasmic therapy ``somatic cells''? How \n     are such therapies treated under your interpretation of S. \n     1601?\n       4. What research and development activities does S. 1601 \n     preclude or regulate that are currently beyond the \n     jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration under \n     current law, including its 1993 and 1997 jurisdictional \n     statements (58 Fed. Reg. 53248; 62 Fed. Reg. 9721)?\n       These questions involve novel and difficult issues. I am \n     certain that other tough questions will surface during the \n     course of this debate. It is because of your expertise in \n     these areas that I seek your guidance. Accordingly, I would \n     greatly appreciate it if you could detail your reasoning in \n     responding to these inquiries. It would be most helpful if I \n     could learn your views prior to the cloture vote on Tuesday.\n           Warmest personal regards,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I think that these are some of the important questions and \nthe type of questions on which we need to have consensus before we \nenact legislation:\n  -- What are the current capabilities of cloning, in animals and \nhumans? Should we be focusing on banning a technology, or technologies, \nor the results of a technology.\n  -- What should be the status of the asexually-produced totipotent \ncells? What is the correct definition of an embryo? For example, is it \nthe definition used in the Report of the National Bioethics Advisory \nCommission--that it is ``the developing organism from the time of \nfertilization until significant differentiation has occurred, when the \norganism becomes known as a fetus''? Would that definition preclude \nhuman somatic cell transfer technology?\n  -- What current authority does the government have with respect to \ntechniques which might lead to cloning human beings and human tissue?\n  -- Although there is virtual unanimity that cloning of human beings \nshould be banned at this time, what is the appropriate type of penalty \nfor any attempt at such an act? Should it be a criminal penalty? If so, \nwhat type? Are the criminal penalties instituted in S. 1601 the \nappropriate means of preventing cloned humans?\n  -- How does the language of this bill affect the ability to do \nfurther research on whether banning somatic cell nuclear transfer \ntechnology would affect the ability of a woman with unviable eggs to \nconceive children?\n  -- Precisely what types of research could--and could not--be \nconducted under this bill?\n  These are important issues that deserve our full attention.\n  All of us have family, friends and loved ones afflicted by some \nterrible disease.\n  When we think about this bill we need to think about people like \nNancy and Ronald Reagan as they battle against Alzheimers.\n  We need to think about Mohammed Ali's battle against Parkinsons.\n  We need to be sure that in locking off human cloning that we don't do \nso in a way that throws away the key to many other diseases.\n  Over the past few days, we have heard very compelling, heartfelt \ndebate about this issue.\n  Some have expressed the belief that asexually-produced totipotent \ncells are, in fact, an embryo, fully deserving of the protections we \naccord to a human life.\n  Others have averred that these cells are not yet a human embryo, but \nrather should be viewed as a very promising tool which science should \nbe allowed to explore as we continue our quest to cure such devastating \ndiseases as diabetes, cancer and AIDS.\n  Both sides hold very strong moral convictions. There are extremely \nimportant implications for both.\n  This body must explore these fundamental questions. We must consider \nthe views of our scientific experts, ethicists, religious leaders, \nethicists, and men and women of medicine.\n  Let me also add I am very troubled that this bill should have been \nconsidered in Committee where many of the fundamental issues we have \nbeen debating can be explored in more depth, especially since S. 1601 \namends Title 18 of the U.S. Code.\n\n[[Page S605]]\n\n  This is obviously an important debate, one which must be continued, \nand therefore I will vote ``yes'' on the motion to invoke cloture.\n  As we attempt to advance the public health, we must do so in a way \nthat protects human life. I think we must work to craft legislation \nthat achieves both of these goals.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I intend to vote for cloture on the motion \nto proceed to Senator Frist's bill this morning because I believe it is \nimperative that we move the debate on human cloning forward. The \nlightening pace of scientific and medical advances, while holding \nimmeasurable promise, often leaves society unprepared to answer the \nmoral and ethical questions that follow. The technology used to clone \n``Dolly'' the now famous Scottish sheep, somatic cell nuclear transfer, \nclearly should not be used to clone a human child; this is neither a \nmoral nor medically ethical procedure. Yet it is clear that the scope \nof possibility for this new technology has not been fully explored. It \nmay hold the potential to develop new lifesaving therapies for diseases \nthat have historically plagued mankind. Can we close the door on new \nopportunities to heal cancer patients, those afflicted with Alzheimers, \nor burn victims?\n  Few of us in this body have background in science, medicine, or \nmedical ethics. Yet we are being asked to make decisions that have \ntremendous consequences for the lives of every American. We are being \nasked to examine some of our fundamental beliefs about life and the \nethical use of science. We must be exceedingly cautious before \nlegislating in an area we admittedly know little about.\n  I commend Senator Frist for his leadership in bringing this issue \nbefore the Senate. I hope that we can reach consensus; that prohibiting \nthe use of somatic cell nuclear technology to produce a human child and \npromoting responsible biomedical research are not mutually exclusive \ngoals. But we cannot do so unless we thoughtfully debate the issue; we \ncannot ignore it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in February 1997, scientists in Scotland \nwere successful in producing a cloned sheep, named ``Dolly.'' This \nincredible event shocked the world and led to the realization that, at \nsome point, cloning human beings might also be on the horizon. Shortly \nafter the announcement about Dolly, my concern about the ethical and \nmoral implications of cloning human beings led me to cosponsor Senator \nBond's bill, S. 368, that would prohibit the use of Federal funds for \nresearch on human cloning. I believe that, with the notable exception \nof Dr. Richard Seed, who has announced to the world his intention of \ncloning a human being, there is broad agreement that cloning humans is \nunacceptable on many grounds.\n  But, the successful cloning of ``Dolly'' has prompted scientists to \nponder other potential uses of somatic cell nuclear technology, the \ntechnique used to create Dolly. Scientists believe that research using \nthis technique might hold promise for a whole host of devastating human \ndiseases. For this reason many in the scientific community are urging \nCongress to move cautiously in this area, lest overly broad legislation \nhave unintended consequences. Care in its crafting is, therefore, \nimperative.\n  Given the concerns raised by the scientific community and patient \ngroups, it is therefore prudent that we proceed with caution and only \nafter thorough consideration of the ramifications that may follow if we \nwere to enact S. 1601, the bill before us today. This bill has received \nnot one hour of hearing before the appropriate committee. Who can say \nwith any comfort what the impact may be on important research aimed at \ndread diseases? Doesn't important and potentially far reaching \nlegislation such as this at least warrant hearings before we proceed? \nThis legislation could have unintended and detrimental consequences.\n  Let us now get down to hard work and take the time necessary to \ndetermine how to go about banning the cloning of human beings in a \nclear and precise way that will avoid the unwanted consequence of also \nbanning important research intended to alleviate the pain and suffering \nof victims of Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and many types of \ndreadful cancers.\n  I will vote against invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to S. \n1601, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act. While I wish to register \nstrong opposition to cloning a human being, I also believe that \nbringing this recently-introduced legislation to the Senate floor for \nconsideration without hearings by the appropriate Senate committee, \nincluding testimony from expert witnesses is a mistake.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senators Bond and Frist \nare to be commended in introducing the underlying legislation to ban \nhuman cloning and the creation of human embryos. Congress must make \nunmistakably clear that human life is too precious and valuable to be \ncheapened by a medical procedure which replicates human beings.\n  Millions of Americans believe that human cloning is inconsistent with \nthe moral responsibility that is incumbent upon modern medical \ntechnology. Put simply, so-called medical ``advances'' are not advances \nat all unless the dignity and sanctity of all human life are preserved. \nIt is meaningful, I think, that the Senate's only physician has \nsponsored this bill. I appreciate Senator Frist's willingness to offer \nhis medical expertise to the American people by setting the record \nstraight about the travesty of human cloning.\n  Mr. President, the overwhelming consensus among professionals in the \nmedical industry confirms that human cloning is unethical and immoral. \nNIH Director Harold Vamus stated that he personally agrees with \nnumerous polls evidencing the public's opinion that cloning human \nbeings is ``repugnant.''\n  Indeed, Mr. President, the American people are outraged by the hubris \nof a fringe element of the medical community wishing to pursue human \ncloning--and they are demanding action. In fact, some states have \nalready introduced similar legislation to the one before us that would \nban human cloning.\n  Perhaps this debate over human cloning was inevitable because, for \ntoo long, our society has failed to stand on the principle that all \nlife has value. Nowhere has the lack of respect for human life been \nmore evident than in the Supreme Court's tragic Roe v. Wade decision in \n1973--the infamous case; which established that unborn children are \nexpendable for reasons of convenience and social policy. Roe v. Wade \npresaged an era where science, technology and medicine are no longer \nconfined to work within the moral boundaries erased by that ill-fated \ndecision made twenty-five years ago.\n  I'm sure most Americans were alarmed, as I was, when the Chicago \nphysicist, Richard Seed, expressed his reasoning for wanting to clone a \nhuman being. Mr. Seed, states that he believes mankind should reach the \nlevel of supremacy as our Creator. Mark my words, a society that \npermits modern medicine to sacrifice human dignity for the sole purpose \nof such self-glorification will not survive its own arrogance.\n  Those having doubts need only to consult their history books. \nEvidence of this can be seen throughout the course of history. It is \ninstructive to read the book of Genesis and the account about a group \nfrom Babylon who became so enamored by technology that they believed \nthey could build a structure, the infamous Tower of Babel, that would \nreach into heaven. The Lord punished the arrogance of this civilization \nand disrupted their foolish work.\n  Some may say this is a story of irrelevance, but I believe it serves \nas a reminder of the ramifications to come if modern medicine is \nallowed to exceed beyond the moral boundaries and human limitations set \nby God. We should not be in the business of taking away life or \ncreating life unnaturally.\n  So, Mr. President, it is extremely important that the Senate pass \nthis legislation to outlaw human cloning. In doing so, the Senate will \nheed the American people's belief that this objectionable procedure is \na dangerous precedent and a morally abhorrent use of medical \ntechnology.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1601, a bill that \nwould end the cloning of human beings. I urge my colleagues to support \nand cosponsor this legislation.\n  Many opponents of the bill will label its supporters as anti-\ntechnology, anti-science--seeking to return to the dark\n\n[[Page S606]]\n\ndays of ages past. Such opponents have conveniently seized on a notion \nthat to ban this emerging technological procedure is to despise all \nscience and progress.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. Just 80 days ago, two of the \nprimary sponsors of this bill--Senators Frist and Gregg--and I \ncompleted three years of intense work on the FDA Modernization Act, \nwhose sole purpose was to advance the health of patients by supporting \nand promoting the extraordinary, life-saving work of high-technology \nbiotech companies and drug firms. It is too convenient--indeed, it is \ndishonest--for opponents to charge supporters of this cloning bill with \nbeing anti-science, anti-patient.\n  Indeed, we who believe human life to be one of the greatest gifts \nfrom our Creator, do not fear the development of science and technology \nthat protects and improves that life. We know only too well of the \nadvances in medicine and vaccines that have dramatically reduced infant \ndeaths. We have held hearings in which extraordinary PET technology can \nreveal the workings of the prenatal and postnatal brain. We have \nconstituent companies whose fetal bladder stents now save the lives of \nwomen and their children, when death used to be a certainty.\n  But to admire, promote, and legislate on behalf of patient-friendly \ntechnology, and scientific achievement does not require that we \nsacrifice all principle or that we abandon caution in the face of \nserious questions about a particular technology.\n  Few will disagree that cloning presents this country with one of the \nmost disturbing and tantalizing scientific developments in recent time.\n  At once, it presents us with the opportunity to duplicate, \ntriplicate, infinitely replicate the best that the world has to offer; \nand it presents the threat of too much of a good thing--the loss of \nindividuality and the end of the security and utility inherent in \ndiversity. Indeed, the child is now created in our own image and not \nGod's. It becomes a product of the will and not the receipt of gift. \nWho can predict the emotional, the psychological, or the spiritual \nconsequences of such a technolgy?\n  Cloning technology, so new to the human experience, indeed considered \njust ten or fifteen years ago to be practically and scientifically \nunachievable, has received only scant attention from the most \ndistinguished, thoughtful, and expert-laden institutions in our \nsociety. Even today, cloning of humans is still considered only a \nremote possibility by means as yet untested and only barely imaginable.\n  Because it differs so dramatically from in vitro fertilization and \nother methods of reproduction, we can scarcely begin to set forth some \nof the practical consequences: a reduction in genetic diversity, long \nconsidered essential to the species; an increase in deformities in the \nchild. The possibilities are numerous and unexplored.\n  Proponents of cloning argue that in the face of these possibilities, \ncaution is required. But while cloning proponents call for caution that \nprotects experimentation, the better course is caution that protects \nthe developing human embryos that are inevitably created by such \ntechnology.\n  How in good conscience can we wait for the practical and ethical \ncomplications of cloning to develop--to wait for Dr. Richard Seed to \nuse methods that unavoidably involve the destruction of living human \nembryos?\n  Perhaps in the meantime research on animal cloning will result in the \ncloning technology that can be used to develop human cell lines or \ntissue that is not derived from a developing human embryo or does not \nresult first in the creation of such an embryo. Again, until that day, \ncaution is required--caution in defense of life.\n  S. 1601 ensures that the least among us receive our full recognition \nand protection as members of human society. I urge passage of S. 1601.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to make it absolutely clear: I \noppose the cloning of human beings. But, I am voting against cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to the cloning bill because the bill and the \nissues the bill raises are not that simple.\n  I am voting against cloture because there has not been sufficient \ndiscussion; there have not been sufficient hearings; there has not been \nsufficient consideration of what is a very complicated scientific \nissue. Legislation is supposed to be the end result of a process; not \nthe beginning of it. This bill, Mr. President, is far too premature.\n  Yes, hearings were held last year after it was announced that Dolly \nthe sheep was a clone. But, those were generic hearings on the issue of \ncloning. And, the bill before us is not--I repeat, not--a result of \nthose hearings. This was a bill that was introduced a week ago, has \nnever been the subject of a hearing, and has never been considered by a \ncommittee.\n  Are the definitions adequate? Or, are they over broad? In the name of \npreventing the cloning of a human being, are we hindering medical \nresearch that might help in the battle against cancer and other \ndiseases? Or, in the name of allowing scientific research, are we \nopening the door to rogue scientists who will then find it easier to \nclone a human?\n  These are all very legitimate questions that need answers. In the \nend, there may be significant differences over what the answers should \nbe. But, the problem here today, Mr. President, is that we are not \nready to be debating answers to these policy questions because we have \nnot had a thorough discussion of the questions and the implications.\n  With the pace of scientific advancement--scientific knowledge is now \ndoubling about every five years--more and more of these extremely \ncomplicated bioethical issues are likely to come before the Congress in \nyears to come. Let's not set a precedent here today that we will deal \nwith them willy-nilly--by simply taking a position and voting without \nhaving given thoughtful consideration to the issues involved.\n  We need to act to ban the cloning of humans. But, before we act, we \nneed more hearings and more discussion on how best to accomplish that. \nTherefore, I am voting against cloture on the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to suggest that we should not \nbe rushing to consider a bill that may do far more than ban human \ncloning permanently. The Lott-Bond cloning bill was only introduced \nlast Tuesday and has been available for review for a very short period \nof time. The identical bill that was introduced by Senator Bond was \nreferred to the Judiciary Committee and yet we have had no Judiciary \ncommittee hearings on this topic to examine exactly what this bill \ndoes. Is the bill really written to accomplish its goal of banning the \nduplication of humans via this new technology? Or does it go much \nfurther than its stated goal? I don't think that many of us here on the \nfloor of the Senate (myself included) are well equipped to make that \ndetermination without hearing from experts in the field including \nscientists, bioethicists, theologians and others qualified to give us \nadvice on this very important matter.\n  It is also not clear as to why we are rushing to consider this bill \ngiven that the FDA has already announced that it has authority over \nthis area. In fact I have a letter here in my hand from the FDA that \nexplains that before any human cloning would be allowed to proceed, FDA \nwould need proof that the technology was safe. FDA will prohibit any \nsponsor of a clinical study from developing this technology if ``it is \nlikely to expose human subjects to unreasonable and significant risk of \nillness or injury'' or ``the clinical investigator was not qualified by \nreason of their scientific training and experience to conduct the \ninvestigation.'' The letter goes on to say that ``In the case of \nattempts to create a human being using cloning technology, there are \nmajor unresolved safety questions. Until those questions are \nappropriately addressed, the Agency would not permit any such \ninvestigation to proceed.''\n  The National Bioethics Advisory Committee recommended a five year \nmoratorium on the use of this technology to create a human being. Due \nto the time limit that they were under, the committee was unable to \nfocus on the issues beyond safety. They concluded that, at this time, \nthe technology was unsafe for use for the purpose of cloning a human \nbeing. They did not address the many ethical issues involved with the \nuse of this technology. The committee believed that these issues were \ntoo complex to be dealt with in such a short period of\n\n[[Page S607]]\n\ntime. Therefore, it is still necessary to allow time for discussion \nabout the ethical use or need for a specific ban on the use of this \ntechnology.\n  To date, we have excluded Patient groups, physicians, scientists and \nother interested parties from the discussion of how this particular \nbill should be drafted. Yet it is these very patients whose future hope \nfor cures may be cut off by a bill if it is improperly drafted.\n  I find it extremely troubling that we are rushing to consider a bill \nthat every patient advocacy group, doctor, or scientist that has \ncontacted my office has either urged us not to pass or has asked us to \nconsider in a more deliberative manner. Organizations such as: The \nAmerican Heart Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation \nInternational, the American Association for Cancer Research, the \nAmerican Society for Human Genetics, the American Academy of Allergy, \nAsthma and Immunology, the Association of American Medical Colleges, \nthe American Pediatric Society, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the \nNational Osteoporosis Foundation, the Parkinson's Action Network, the \nAIDS Action Council, the American Academy of Pediatrics and 27 Science \nNobel Laureates. These organizations and individuals are dedicated to \nfinding cures for diseases. They are not advocates for unethical \nresearch. They are mainstream organizations committed to finding cures \nfor such diseases as heart disease, strokes, spinal cord injuries, \nbirth defects, asthma, diabetes, cancer, osteoporosis. These are \ndiseases that afflict millions of Americans. Biomedical research may be \nsome patients with these illnesses only hope.\n\n  For some, new technologies as yet undeveloped may be their only hope. \nFor instance, some of my colleagues may have heard the story of Travis \nRoy. Travis is now a 21 yr old college student at Boston University. \nTravis grew up in Maine and was an avid ice hockey player. \nUnfortunately for Travis during his first collegiate hockey game 3 \nyears ago, 11 seconds in to the game, he collided with the wall and \nsuffered a spinal chord injury that has left him paralyzed with only a \nsmall amount of movement in his right hand. Travis has written a book \nabout his experiences and his fight for recovery. For people like \nTravis that have had their spinal chords severely injured they look to \nnew research that might help them regenerate their damaged tissue. As \nTravis so agonizingly stated recently: ``All I want to be able to do is \nto hug my mother.''\n  Researchers hope that they may be able to generate what are known as \n``stem cells,'' that is cells that can give rise to lots of other \ncells, using the technology that the Lott-Bond cloning bill seeks to \nban. With continuing research, those cells might be used to repair \ninjured spinal cords or damaged livers or kidneys or hearts.\n  Stem cell research could provide: cardiac muscle cells to treat heart \nattack victims and degenerative heart disease; skin cells to treat burn \nvictims; neural cells for treating those suffering from \nneurodegenerative diseases; blood cells to treat cancer anemia and \nimmunodeficiencies; neural cells to treat Parkinson's Huntington's and \nALS. The generation of stem cell lines using an unfertilized egg as a \nhost is far removed from the act of creating embryos for research or \ncreating a fetus for organ parts. In fact, it is the exact opposite \ngiving an avenue for therapies that involve the culturing of single \ncells from adult cells. Some of these therapies would actually result \nin fetal tissue no longer being necessary for the treatment of many \nneurodegenerative diseases. Others might give hope to parents that \nconceive children that have genetic diseases, so that they are not \nfaced with the agonizing choice between terminating a pregnancy or \ngiving birth to a severely disabled child.\n  I think that many of us do not really know what the full scope for \nthis technology really is. It is possible that this technology may be \nused in a life enhancing, life promoting manner.\n\n  We should have a full hearings process with opportunities to hear \nfrom specialists in medical genetics, researchers at NIH and other \ninstitutions. We should listen to what the medical community has to say \non treatment options. We should also hear from patient advocacy groups \nand all others that may have expertise in this area or be affected by \nthe legislation at hand. Likewise, the area of assistive reproductive \ntechnology has become incredibly complex and we should listen to \nbioethicists and religious leaders and their opinions which we surely \nvalue. Again, I wonder why we are rushing here. What about the \ncommittee hearing process is the Republican leadership afraid of that?\n  Some may argue that the announcement by the Chicago Physicist, \nRichard Seed of his intention to start cloning necessitates a rapid \nresponse. However, Dr. Seed has no training in medical procedures nor \nin biology. He does not have a lab for this purpose. He does not have \nthe venture capital and in fact his home was recently foreclosed by the \nBank. Thus to suggest that he will be cloning anything soon, seems \noutlandish at best. By the FDA's stated criteria of an investigator \nneeding to demonstrate expertise, Dr. Seed would clearly fail and thus \nwould be prohibited by FDA from proceeding.\n  One person's far-fetched claims should not propel us into passing \nlegislation that has not been adequately reviewed. As J. Benjamin \nYounger, Executive Director of the American Society for Reproductive \nMedicine has said: ``We must work together to ensure that in our effort \nto make human cloning illegal, we do not sentence millions of people to \nneedless suffering because research and progress into their illness \ncannot proceed.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 seconds. I have too \nmuch respect for my friend and colleague from Tennessee to let the \ncomparison with Hitler and science be used on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate in reference to our position on this particular issue without \ncomment.\n  Our position has been embraced by virtually every major research \ngroup in this country. This vote isn't about a ban on the cloning of \nhuman beings. We have agreed on that principle. This vote is about \npreserving opportunities for major advances in biomedical research in \nthis country. I hope the Senate will vote ``no'' on cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri controls 20 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield that time to myself.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, the misinformation about this bill has \nour opponents saying that human cloning bans will hurt research. Show \nme one mainstream scientist who is currently creating cloned human \nembryos to fight these ailments. It is not happening. It should never \nhappen.\n  Science has given us partial-birth abortions and Dr. Kevorkian's \nassisted suicide. We should say no to these scientific advances and no \nto the cloning of human embryos. If you vote against cloture, you are \nsaying yes to human cloning.\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer some initial \ncomments on the President's proposed budget for fiscal year 1999. As \nwith any budget, there will be occasion to discuss and debate the many \nindividual provisions it contains. I have already heard some legitimate \nconcerns voiced about some of the provisions from both sides of the \naisle, and I very much look forward to working with my colleagues on \nthe Budget Committee to fashion what I hope will be the second \nconsecutive bipartisan budget agreement.\n  Despite the many issues surrounding individual provisions, though, we \nhave to acknowledge what a historic moment this is. The President's \nbudget is historic. For the first time in 30 years, a President has \nsubmitted a unified budget that actually balances. That is an \nachievement worth noting and noting again. While many of us believe we \nhave a way to go before we can talk about having a genuine balance, it \nis fitting to pause for a moment to acknowledge the tremendous progress \nthat has been made.\n  The President's proposal also marks the end of one budget era and, I \nthink, really the beginning of a transition period that may require \nchanging some of our budget rules, and I will have more to say on that \nsubject in the coming weeks. It is also worth remembering how far we \nhave come and how we reached this important benchmark. First and \nforemost was the 1993 deficit reduction package. That was one of the \ntoughest votes I think many of us have ever taken in this legislative \nbody. It wasn't pleasant and it wasn't supposed to be pleasant. As we \nhave found, there just is no painless solution to the deficit, and we \nhad to take a different kind of step. In fact, Mr. President, it was \nthe very toughness of that 1993 package that told me it was worth \nsupporting. Let me also say that last year's bipartisan budget \nagreement also contributed to the effort. I repeat my admiration for \nthe work done by the chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from \nNew Mexico, Mr. Domenici, and also the ranking member, the Senator from \nNew Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, who worked so hard to make that agreement \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I wish that agreement had gone further. As I have \nnoted on other occasions, I really wish we had refrained from enacting \nthat fiscally irresponsible tax package last year. If we had, the \nunified budget would have actually reach balance earlier. Nevertheless, \nboth of those efforts helped bring us to where we are today and all \nconcerned deserve praise.\n\n[[Page S609]]\n\n  Mr. President, in addition to the notable accomplishment of \nsubmitting a balanced unified budget, the President also cautioned \nCongress not to spend the unified budget surplus that is projected, but \ninstead to use those funds to protect Social Security. I think this is \none of the better statements we have had in a long time with regard to \nnot only fiscal responsibility, but also our responsibility to future \ngenerations that hope to obtain the benefits of the Social Security for \nwhich they have already been paying.\n  The President's admonition in this regard may have been just as \nimportant as his achievement in proposing a balanced unified budget. \nThe President is absolutely right in urging that any unified budget \nsurpluses not be spent. But while I strongly agree with his sentiment, \nI approach this issue from a little different perspective. Again, there \nare many of us who do not view the unified budget as the appropriate \nmeasure of our Nation's budget. In particular, I want to acknowledge \ntwo of my colleagues on the Budget Committee, the Senator from South \nCarolina, Mr. Hollings and the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, \nfor their consistent warnings on this issue of how we calculate and \ndetermine and speak about what is really a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, the unified budget is not the budget which should \nguide our policy decisions. The projected surpluses in the unified \nbudget are not real. In fact, far from surpluses, what we really have \nare continuing on-budget deficits masked, in part, by Social Security \nrevenues. Now, this distinction is absolutely critical. The very word \n``surplus'' connotes that there is some extra amount of money or bonus \naround. One definition of the word surplus is, ``something more than, \nor in excess of, what is needed or required.''\n  Mr. President, the projected unified budget is not more than or in \nexcess of what is needed or required. Those funds are required. Those \nfunds are spoken for. In this regard, I take just slight exception to \nthe President's characterization that we should use the surplus to \nprotect Social Security. Some could infer from his comments that the \nPresident has chosen, from various alternatives, the best or most \nprudent option for using surplus funds. I am afraid people will look at \nit that way and, certainly, from the perspective of the unified budget, \nit is arguably the best and most prudent option, if we really had \nsurpluses. But, Mr. President, those of us who see the unified budget \nas merely an accounting convenience do not believe this is an \nalternative or an option. To repeat, Mr. President, those revenues are \nalready spoken for. They were raised by Social Security for future use.\n  Mr. President, we have various trust funds in our budget, but Social \nSecurity is unlike most other trust funds, and it is unlike the others \nin this respect: It is by law ``off budget.''\n  It was taken off budget for this very reason; namely, the decision by \nCongress to forward fund Social Security by raising additional revenues \nin the near term to ensure the long-term solvency of the program.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to choose their use of the \nword ``surplus'' very carefully. The problem with the use of the word, \nor the overuse of the word, is that it encourages a way of thinking \nwhich may jeopardize not only the work that we have accomplished over \nthe past 5 years but also the additional work that must be done to put \nour Nation on a firm financial footing.\n  The use of this term improperly encourages the kind of ``business as \nusual'' policies that promise immediate gratification while putting off \ntough budget-cutting decisions until later.\n  Mr. President, it is kind of like buying an expensive Valentine's Day \ngift for your sweetheart and then charging it to her credit card.\n  That is not the way to do business. That is hardly an honest approach \nto budgeting either.\n  Mr. President, the challenge before us now is to move quickly toward \neliminating the on-budget deficit, balancing the budget without using \nSocial Security trust funds, and in so doing to begin the very \nimportant process of bringing down and paying down our national debt.\n  Mr. President, we have to play it straight with the American people. \nWe need to give them an honest balanced budget.\n  I very much hope this body will act to put us on that path this year, \nand I very much look forward to working with other members of the \nBudget Committee to ensure that we really do reach an honest balanced \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nCollins, to discuss the unprecedented and historic storm in the State \nof Maine several weeks ago.\n  Mr. President, every once in a while--maybe only once every 100 years \nor more--an event happens that truly tests the strength of a people and \nthe depth of their spirit. It is an event that strips away comforts and \nsecurity and pretense and reveals for all to see the true nature of \nthose whose lives it has in its grip. In my home State--the State of \nMaine--that event began on January 5 and is now known as the Great Ice \nStorm of 1998.\n  As shown here in this photograph, you can see the ice that covers the \nstreets with the trees over the car. It wasn't just one area of the \nState. This really replicated almost the entire State in terms of the \ndevastation of this storm.\n  As you would imagine, we are no strangers to a little winter weather. \nBut this storm was like nothing anyone had ever seen before. By the \ntime five days of sleet and freezing rain had worked their misery on \nthe state, Maine was under a sheet of ice more than two inches thick, \nand Mainers suddenly found themselves without power, without heat, and \nfacing a life more closely resembling one from 1898 than 1998.\n  The State was devastated by this unprecedented storm and many areas \nwere described as resembling a ``war zone.'' At its peak, the storm \nknocked out electrical power to an estimated 80 percent of Maine's \nhouseholds--and a week later, about 137,000 people were still without \npower. Schools and local governments ground to a halt. Over the weekend \nas the storm finally abated, over 3,000 people sought refuge in 197 \nshelters and two days later there were still over 2,000 Mainers staying \nin 111 shelters across the State. And in the end, all of Maine's 16 \ncounties were declared federal disaster areas.\n  As you can see here, another sign that shows the kind of pleas that \nwere made by residents all across this State, saying, ``Power, please. \nOur transformer was taken away on Thursday.'' People lost their power \nfor up to 2 and 3 weeks.\n  The Chairman of the historical committee of the American \nMeteorological Association, who also happens to be an associate \nprofessor of science, technology and society at Colby College in \nWaterville, MA, summed it up best: ``So far this century there has been \nnothing like it . . . It will probably make the meteorological \ntextbooks--as one of the biggest storms ever.''\n\n[[Page S610]]\n\n  I traveled Maine extensively in the wake of the ice storm, and I was \noverwhelmed by the extent of the destruction, as we see here another \nphoto of all the downed poles. That is exactly what happened all across \nthe State. You can see the condition of the road. But it was a total \ndestruction of the forests, the pole lines, as well as the telephone \npoles across the State. Three-quarters of the State, as I said, was \naffected by it.\n  Trees and branches felled, power lines snaked across ice-encrusted \nstreets and major utility structures crumpled as if made of tin-foil. \nIn fact about 50 such structures, an eight-mile stretch carrying the \nmajor electrical line into Washington County--the easternmost county in \nMaine and the United States--were destroyed.\n  The owner of that line, Bangor Hydro, needed 170 utility poles and \n144,000 feet of 115,000 volt transmission line just to repair the eight \nmiles of downed lines that left 10,000 Washington and Hancock County \nresidents without power. Central Maine Power, the other major power \ncompany in the state, estimated that 2 to 3 million feet of power lines \nfell--2,000 utility poles had to be replaced as well as 5,250 \ntransformers.\n  Between 1,200 and 2,000 National Guard soldiers were called to active \nduty, and 200 Army and Air National Guard personnel helped clear the \nroads. Central Maine Power had crews of more than 2,500 line and tree-\ntrimming workers on the job. And Maine hosted line crews from Maryland, \nMassachusetts, North Carolina, Florida, Pennsylvania; New Jersey; \nConnecticut; Washington, D.C.; New Hampshire; and New Brunswick, \nCanada.\n  Broken trees and broken power lines littered the Maine landscape as \nfar as the eye could see. But I discovered one thing in my travels that \nwas never broken--one thing that may have been stronger after the storm \nthan before--and that is the spirit of Maine's people. That is why I am \nspeaking here today, Mr. President. Mainers faced the tremendous \nchallenges this storm presented with resolve and a caring spirit which \nis truly remarkable and which makes me very proud to call Maine home.\n  Everywhere I went I heard stories of neighbors helping neighbors: \npeople inviting strangers into their homes so that they might be warm, \nlending a hand with fallen trees so that they might be cleared and \nsharing advice so that no one would feel alone. Rising from the \ndevastation left in the storm's wake was a tide of generosity and \ngiving emblematic of Maine people, and it was deeply heartening to know \nthat such compassion is alive and well in America.\n  Paul Field Sr. and his son, both of Bridgton, worked tirelessly and \nvirtually without sleep for 10 days cutting branches, clearing roads, \nfighting fires, draining pipes, helping neighbors and moving generators \nto where they were most critically needed.\n  And Paul was not alone. In the Town of Albion, farmer Peter Door \ntrucked a portable generator from farm to farm and slept in his truck \nwhile dairy farmers milked their cows. In Fairfield, Town Manager Terry \nYork was moved to tears when talking to the Bangor Daily News about the \nvolunteers who helped residents through the crisis.\n  Out of state crews found Mainers' attitudes remarkable. One member of \na Massachusetts crew that put in two weeks of 16 hour days restoring \npower to the towns of Otis and Mariaville said, ``When I left there, I \nwas proud to be a lineman. My hat goes off to the people of Maine. \nThey're really a special breed.'' The same lineman said he never heard \nan angry word, even though many residents had gone over a week without \npower and heat. In fact, people offered the linemen food and even \nhosted a public spaghetti dinner for the crews.\n  Indeed, throughout the state, people took strangers into their homes, \nbrought food to elderly residents unable to get out, looked after the \nhomes of those who were away, and cooked meals at local shelters. \nMaine's potato growers gave away truckloads of potatoes to those in \nneed of food, radio stations fielded calls from residents sharing vital \ninformation and advice, and television stations banded together to \nraise over $115,000 for Red Cross relief efforts.\n  My deepest gratitude goes to all those who made life a little easier \nfor others during this most trying of times. In particular I want to \nrecognize and extend my profound gratitude to the outstanding Red Cross \nofficials and the over 1,800 volunteers who did an incredible job of \norganizing shelters and delivering vital emergency services, as well as \nthe dedicated men and women of the National Guard who did not hesitate \nfor a moment to provide assistance. Also the outstanding employees of \nthe Maine Emergency Management Agency who deserve recognition for their \ntimely and professional response to the disaster.\n  Again, you see what linemen crews did here in working on these downed \npower lines, as I said, and which was pervasive all over the State on \nmiles and miles and miles of line.\n  I also want to extend my sincere appreciation to the men and women on \nutility crews from Maine and from throughout the country who toiled day \nand night to clear roads and rebuild a crippled power grid. These \ndedicated individuals worked incredible hours and in terrible weather \nconditions to bring the state back on line. They are truly unsung \nheroes and I thank them for their tireless work.\n  Indeed, to give you some idea of the magnitude of the effort, in one \ninstance Air Force cargo planes made 13 trips between North Carolina \nand Maine to bring 50 fresh crews and 47 bucket trucks to lend a hand. \nIt took 5,000 people to carry out the logistics at an estimated cost of \nthis single operation of $1 million.\n  In Augusta, local Public Works employees logged, on average, an 80 \nhour week, with some as high as 102 hours. The Maine Department of \nTransportation spent $600,000 in overtime in one week and in that same \ntime they used 54,000 cubic yards of sand and 5,000 tons of salt to the \ntune of another $600,000.\n  And the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers worked with \nmy office to coordinate their volunteer efforts to help reattach \ndamaged entrance service cables on residences throughout the state so \nthat the power company could re-energize the homes. (In one weekend, \nLocal 567 helped put 75 houses back in shape so the power could come on \nand families who had done so long without heat could once again be \nwarm.)\n  Those dedicated IBEW workers provided help where it was most needed, \nand I applaud these dedicated teams of electricians who donated their \ntime, supplies, and skills to make vital repairs across the state. \nIndeed, it was an honor for me to spend time in the field with some of \nthese unsung heroes to let them know how much I appreciate and admire \ntheir selfless efforts.\n  Finally, I want to thank all the volunteers who--in the face of their \nown difficulties--took the time to help others affected by this \nunprecedented storm. (We may never know their names or their faces, but \nwe know what they have done and we are very, very grateful.)\n  It is a credit to Maine people that we coped as well as we did and \nmade speedy progress in recovering and rebuilding. Everyone pulled \ntogether from Governor King to town officials to the Brotherhood of \nElectrical workers. But it was clear that we still needed help. We are \nan independent people and proud to solve our own problems, but this \ntime even we couldn't do it alone. That is why the federal government's \nresponse to this disaster was and is so important.\n  The Vice President's personal tour of Maine in the wake of the \ndisaster spoke to the magnitude of the challenge we were facing. I \nappreciate the Vice President's visit and the President's prompt \ndeclaration of 16 Maine counties as federal disaster areas.\n  This declaration opened the door to a variety of assistance, and it \nis estimated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency that about 300 \nMaine towns and non-profit organizations will seek public assistance \nfrom the agency. I am pleased that FEMA has established field offices \nin Maine to assist Mainers who are still trying to put their lives back \ntogether and I expect they will remain in the state for some time.\n  Because the fact is, the repercussions of this storm will be felt \nlong after the ice melts and the first blossoms of spring make their \nway north. Dairy farm losses continue to mount and state agricultural \nofficials may not know for months the full impact of the storm on the \nindustry. Utilities are estimating that their costs will top $70 to\n\n[[Page S611]]\n\n80 million. The State of Maine estimates that they need the release of \n$12 million in LIHEAP funds to help those who normally don't use the \nfunds but will sign up this year, and to defray the costs of buying \ngenerators for those eligible.\n  Small businesses across the state have been reeling from lost \nbusiness--as of last week the Small Business Administration has taken \n450 applications for low-interest loans from individuals and \nbusinesses, and awarded loans of $173,000. And overall, FEMA has \nconsidered 20,869 applications for individual and family grants, 10,085 \napplications for disaster housing, 9,849 applications for SBA home and \nproperty loans and 4,410 applications for SBA business loans.\n  This tremendous need for assistance must be met, and that is why I \nwill continue my efforts in conjunction with my colleague from Maine, \nto ensure that Maine people have rapid and efficient access to the \nassistance that will become available over the days and weeks ahead.\n  Mr. President, we are working with the other States who were hit by \nthe storm--Vermont, New Hampshire and New York--on a supplemental \nfunding package to help our states recover from the devastation of the \nice storm. The fact remains that we still must obtain an emergency \nrelease of LIHEAP funds, we still must acquire supplemental assistance \nto help prevent Maine's ratepayers from having to foot all of the \nutility bill, estimated to be $80 million; and the U.S. Forest Service \nestimates that it will cost $28 million to clean up the more than 7 \nmillion acres of working Maine forest which has suffered moderate to \nsevere damage; for making our farmers and our small businesses whole \nagain and for the additional costs our states have identified that they \ncannot cover.\n  My colleagues from the Northeast and I and my Maine congressional \ndelegation have started working with the Appropriations Committee to \nassure that supplemental funding to meet the needs of our States can be \nincluded in the first supplemental funding bill which the committee \nwill begin work on early next month.\n  As many of my colleagues know, we have faced the challenges posed by \ndisasters in their own States. They recognize how important this \nadditional assistance is to their States, and I hope that we can get \nthis assistance as quickly as possible in order to ensure a quick and \nfull recovery from the impact of this historic disaster.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from Maine, \nMs. Collins, yield just for a unanimous consent request?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on the completion of the \nremarks by Senator Collins, Senator Cleland be recognized for 5 \nminutes, that I be recognized then for 20 minutes, and that my \ncolleague, Senator Rockefeller, be recognized for 10 minutes to speak \nout of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I again thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Maine, to describe just some of what the people of \nMaine have experienced in recent weeks, namely, the worst natural \ndisaster in our State's history. The ``Ice Storm of the Century,'' as \nwe refer to it in Maine, began innocently enough with a light rain on \nWednesday, January 7. By the time it let up 4 days later, however, the \nstorm had encased the State in a layer of ice up to 10 inches thick and \nleft well over $100 million in damages in its wake.\n  When all we need to do to restore power is to flip a switch in our \nfuse boxes, it is very easy to take for granted just how essential \npower is to every aspect of our lives. Electricity allows us to cook \nour meals, heat our homes, and communicate with our neighbors and our \nfriends. From the second we wake up in the morning, usually from the \nbuzz of an electric alarm clock, power plays an integral role in our \ndaily lives. Think for a moment of everything that you are able to do \ntoday so far because of power. Then just imagine how you would cope \nwithout power for 10 days or even longer as many Maine residents had to \ndo. This ice storm was the single most devastating natural disaster to \nhit Maine in recorded history. Over 800,000--that is approximately 7 \nout of 10--of our residents lost power for at least some part of the \nstorm, some for as long as 2 weeks or even longer.\n  As you can see from these pictures, Mr. President, power lines, \ntelephone poles and trees were snapped in two by the massive onslaught \nof ice. This is a picture that appeared in the Bangor Daily News of \npower lines and of poles, telephone poles, and as you can see the tops \nof them have been sheared off by the massive weight of the ice.\n  Mr. President, I grew up in northern Maine. I am very used to mighty \nwinter storms but never, never in my life, have I experienced a storm \nlike this one. As I looked out from the window of my home in Bangor, \nlimbs from my favorite maple tree in the front yard came crashing down \non my roof and against the picture window in my living room. \nTransformers lit up the night with blue sparks as ice brought them \ntumbling down as well. And I was much more fortunate than many Maine \nresidents. Many businesses were forced to close due to the lack of \npower. People took to placing signs in the snow with arrows pointing to \ntheir homes reading ``No Phone No Power.'' Even the National Weather \nService located in Gray, ME, lost power for over a week and had to rely \non a not-so-reliable generator to track the latest weather developments \nand to help keep Mainers safe and informed.\n  These pictures of a twig and a tiny blade of grass covered with 2 \ninches of ice were taken on the lawn adjacent to the National Weather \nService office. As you can see, telephone poles were snapped in two, \ntrees were coated by ice.\n  Mr. President, this is literally a blade of grass. We have a closeup \nthat I am going to show you next on this.\n  This shows you just how amazing the ice was from this storm. A single \nblade of grass is photographed here encased with ice.\n  Adding insult to injury, on Saturday, January 25, just as Mainers had \nbegun to return to life as usual, a second ice storm hit, knocking out \npower to 165,000 Mainers and crippling the electric grid in a region \nthat had managed to come through the first storm relatively unscathed.\n  By all accounts, the worst of natural disasters brought out the best \nin Mainers. Volunteers flocked to shelters to lend a hand and to help \nserve meals. The State's television stations joined forces to raise \nmoney for the Red Cross, and our radio stations and newspapers provided \npractical tips and encouragement to help keep up the spirits of Mainers \nduring our worst natural disaster. Heartwarming stories of people with \nlittle or nothing giving all that they could were commonplace during \nthis tragedy. For 10 straight days, for example, one man opened his \nhome to his neighbors every single night, housing the elderly and \ninfants in his town and helping to remove the heavy branches from roads \nand from his neighbors' driveways.\n  On a personal note, when I ran out of wood after my fourth day \nwithout power, a neighbor quickly came to the rescue to help keep my \npipes from freezing. Acts of kindness like this one exhibited by my \nneighbor were repeated over and over again in countless communities \nthroughout the State. One in particular touched me deeply.\n  When I was visiting the Red Cross shelter in Bangor at the Air \nNational Guard base, I talked with an elderly woman in a wheelchair who \nhad been forced to leave her home because of the storm. She was \nobviously a victim of a stroke and was unable to move much of her right \nside. In addition, it was obvious that she was a person of very modest \nmeans. Nevertheless, she said to me, ``Could you help me by reaching \ninto my pocketbook. I have $2 there that I would like to donate to the \nRed Cross.''\n  Mr. President, that is the kind of spirit, of generosity and kindness \nthat characterizes Maine people. Even in\n\n[[Page S612]]\n\nher dire situation, this woman was able to think of people less \nfortunate than herself. That spirit of kindness and generosity helped \nus to survive the ``Ice Storm of the Century.''\n  Unfortunately, while kindness and good will and generosity and a \nsense of community helped us to get through the worst of the storm, \nthey alone cannot complete the recovery.\n  Mainers experienced serious financial and property losses as a result \nof the storm. Early estimates put the damages to homes, businesses, \nutilities and public property at well over $100 million, and it is \nstill growing. The estimated cost of repairs to Maine's power grid \nalone is a staggering $70 million, and that is money the ratepayers of \nMaine will have to bear unless there is assistance forthcoming from the \nFederal Government.\n  However, simply attaching a dollar amount to the damage fails to \nprovide a true picture of the devastation experienced by virtually the \nentire State of Maine. To give you a more vivid idea of the destruction \nof the ice storm of 1998, I want to share some statistics with my \ncolleagues.\n  During this ice storm, 7 out of 10 Mainers lost power, some for as \nlong as 14 days; schools across the southern and central portion of the \nState closed for many days, some for over 2 weeks; all of Maine's 16 \ncounties were declared Federal disaster areas; at just one hospital in \ncentral Maine, more than 80 people were treated for carbon monoxide \npoisoning, 4 people, unfortunately, died of carbon monoxide poisoning; \nthousands of families were forced into more than 100 emergency shelters \nacross the State, hundreds of thousands of others spent the night with \ntheir families, with family members, neighbors or friends; more than 11 \nmillion acres of Maine's forest lands--that is more than half of the \nState's total--were damaged by the storm. Of this total more than 3 \nmillion acres are classified as severely damaged; 1,200 utility crews \nfrom as far away as Nova Scotia to North Carolina were sent to Maine to \nhelp restore power lines. We are very grateful for that assistance; our \ntelephone company, Bell Atlantic, dispatched 625 fieldworkers, several \nof whom were on loan from other States; in a remarkable development, \nthe Department of Defense actually airlifted bucket trucks and power \ncrews to help us with the repairs; manufacturers of electric parts from \nas far away as Alabama worked overtime for 10 days to help meet our \npower company's needs; 3 million feet of electrical cable were \nirreparably damaged and nearly 3,000 utility poles had to be replaced. \nThink of how sturdy a utility pole is. We lost 3,000 of them during \nthis storm.\n\n  Even after the debris has been removed and our electric \ninfrastructure has been repaired, much of Maine's natural resources \nbased economy will take years to recover. Dairy farmers, maple syrup \nproducers, apple growers, and our forestry industry were particularly \nhard hit. In addition, because of the countless downed trees and limbs, \nsome of the 11 million acres of damaged forest lands will remain \nvulnerable to fire and to insect attacks for years to come. Neighbors, \nGovernment agencies and nonprofit organizations rallied to the support \nof the hundreds of thousands of Mainers displaced by the ice storm, but \nit will take a strong commitment from the Federal Government for \nMainers to truly complete the process of putting their homes, their \nbases and their communities back together.\n  Vice President Gore's tour of the hardest-hit areas and the prompt \nassistance of FEMA, HUD and SBA demonstrate the Federal Government's \nconcern for Mainers and their commitment to recovery efforts. But \nadditional help is needed. So as we enjoy the comfortable spring-like \ntemperatures in Washington, DC, I urge my colleagues not to forget the \nMainers buried in ice and snow. I hope that my colleagues will remember \nthese statistics and the photographs that the senior Senator from Maine \nand I have shown you today in the coming weeks as we join with other \nmembers of the Maine delegation in asking for my colleagues' assistance \nthrough a supplemental appropriation for disaster relief.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S609-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S612-S617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to speak today in support of \nthe reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation and \nEfficiency Act, better known as ISTEA. More importantly, I am here \ntoday to add my voice to that of the distinguished senior Senator from \nWest Virginia, who has made an eloquent and persuasive case for \nbringing this legislation to the floor for consideration at the \nearliest possible opportunity.\n  That I believe was the commitment the Senate made to the American \npeople prior to our early adjournment last year. In the last several \ndays, I paid close attention to that said by my colleagues, many of \nwhom in the Senate have commented on this matter. I would like to make \njust a few observations.\n  One of the most striking aspects of the debate which is apparently \ndelaying the Senate's consideration of ISTEA is that it is taking place \nat all. It is not all that uncommon, I suppose, based on my limited \ntime here, that we argue how to utilize supposedly dedicated trust fund \nmoneys. I am here today to say that these trust fund dollars, whether \nfor Social Security or transportation, are not ours to allocate as we \nsee fit. They are collected from the American people based on specific \nusage, and we have been entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring \nthat in the case of transportation the taxpayers' gas tax dollars are \nused for our great country's critical infrastructure needs.\n  Unlike the Senator from West Virginia, I am not an expert on the \nRoman Republic and the Roman Empire, but I am a student of history, and \nI believe that ancient Rome was one the world's earliest and most \nsuccessful civilizations. Some scholars would say it was good \ngovernment that allowed the empire to survive as long as it did.\n  Others believe that it was the strength of the Roman army. In my \nopinion, one of the most enduring legacies of the Empire, carried on in \nour American civilization today, is the practice of building roads to \nfacilitate commerce and defense. America's transportation system is the \nenvy of the world and so is the commerce it facilitates. I'll add that \nthe Roman Empire was once the envy of the world too. Where is it now? \nWith apologies to Gibbon, maybe their government failed to pass its \ntransportation funding in a timely fashion.\n  By delaying the reauthorization of this multibillion-dollar ISTEA \nfunding we put at jeopardy not only commerce and defense but the very \nlives and livelihoods of those who send us here. Recently I was \ncontacted by a Georgia hospital on a different matter, but it did \nconcern a road project in Georgia. They made the case for the need for \na particular transportation corridor and stressed the difficulty their \nemergency service vehicles were having in this area. When we put off, \nday after day, action on this legislation, we impede, and sometimes, \nstop action on projects which may be critical to an area's economy, or \nvital for highway safety.\n  Many Senators, Democrat and Republican, North and South, East and \nWest, have all made the case that we need to take up ISTEA legislation, \nand I respectfully join those colleagues in urging prompt action. We \nmust take up this legislation now. That was the promise that was made \nto the American people.\n  When we make commitments, Mr. President, we must stick to them. We \nsimply cannot be a body of continuing resolutions. That is not good \ngovernment and it does not serve the people well. I know the leadership \nhas heard about this a great deal the last 2 weeks, but I must \nrespectfully request that we take up this legislation now; let's bring \nthis matter to the floor now.\n  Mr. President, ISTEA legislation is important to our largest cities \nand our smallest communities alike. It's about jobs, safety, commerce, \ndefense, and it's about the future. It's too important to put off until \nan uncertain future date. We have a responsibility to act now. Let us \ndo the work required of us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I yield any remaining time to \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S613]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, Senator \nMax Cleland, for his fine statement urging action on the ISTEA bill \nnow.\n  Mr. President, bad roads are killers. In 1996, nearly 42,000 people \nlost their lives in traffic accidents on America's highways; in 1996, \n355 of those fatalities occurred in West Virginia. The Federal Highway \nAdministration (FHWA) maintains that poor road designs and conditions \nare a contributing factor in at least 30 percent of those fatal \ncrashes. That works out to more than 12,000 Americans--over 100 West \nVirginians--whose lives could be saved each year by an investment in \nbetter, safer roads. These fatalities are not just numbers. They are \nlives, precious lives lost because we are not spending the money that \nis needed to make our highways safe.\n  And roadway fatalities are on the rise, having risen in each of the \npast 5 years. Highway crashes are now the fifth highest cause of all \ndeaths and the leading cause of death for young people between the ages \nof 6 and 27.\n  This national problem can be blamed, at least in part, on the \ndeplorable and deteriorating condition of our Nation's highways and \nbridges. Of the 950,215 road-miles eligible for Federal funds, the \nFederal Highway Administration, in its biennial Performance and \nConditions Report, found that 28 percent of the pavement mileage is \npoor or mediocre in condition, meaning it needs immediate repair to \nremain passable. The FHWA also reports that the country has 181,748 \nbridges, in other words, 31 percent of all bridges over 20 feet in \nlength, that are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. The \nreport estimates that nationwide investments must average $54.8 billion \nannually just to maintain current road and bridge conditions over the \nnext 20 years, $74 billion annually to improve the highway network. \nCurrently, all levels of government, Federal, State, and local \ncombined, are investing only $34.8 billion annually. That means we are \nnot even coming close to making the investments necessary to maintain \nour vital highway infrastructure.\n  Fortunately, this trend can be reversed. Well designed and maintained \nroads will increase our safety by reducing vehicle deaths and injuries. \nThey also save Americans the anguish of losing a loved one.\n  The Federal Highway Administration has conducted extensive research \non the lifesaving improvements that can be made to our highways and \nbridges. According to Federal Highway Administration research: Widening \na road lane by 1 foot can lower crash rates by 12 percent. Widening a \nroad lane by 2 feet can lower accident rates by 23 percent.\n  The construction of medians for traffic separation can reduce fatal \ncrash rates by 73 percent. This is information from the Federal Highway \nAdministration. The term ``fatal crash rate'' means the number of fatal \ncrashes per 100 million vehicle miles traveled. Shoulder widening can \nlower fatal crash rates by 22 percent, and one of the lives that is \nsaved may be yours, yours--and roadway alignment improvements can lower \nfatal crash rates by 66 percent. These are huge figures.\n  Widening or modifying a bridge reduces fatal crash rates by 49 \npercent, and constructing a new bridge when the current one is \ndeficient can reduce fatal crash rates by 86 percent.\n  I well remember, and shall never forget, the fatal collapse of the \nSilver Bridge at Point Pleasant, WV, in 1967, in which collapse 46 \npeople plunged to their deaths in the cold waters of the Ohio, the Ohio \nRiver; 46 people plunged to their deaths in 1967, 31 years ago, when \nthe Silver Bridge at Point Pleasant collapsed.\n  So, constructing new bridges when the current bridges are deficient \ncan reduce fatal crash rates by 86 percent. Upgrading bridge ratings \ncan cut fatal crash rates by 75 percent.\n  In addition, the number of lanes on a road has an impact on safety. \nNational statistics show that four-lane divided highways are \nsubstantially safer than other roads. Four-lane divided highways are \nsubstantially safer than other roads.\n  May I say to my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller, that when I was in the legislature in West Virginia in \n1947, 51 years ago, West Virginia had a total of 4 miles--West Virginia \nhad a total of 4 miles of divided four-lane highway; 51 years ago. Four \nmiles. That was it for the entire State. And today there are almost 900 \nmiles of divided, four-lane highways.\n  National statistics show that four-lane divided highways are \nsubstantially safer than other roads. In 1995, 77 percent of all fatal \ncrashes--get that, 3 out of 4--77 percent of all fatal crashes occurred \non two-lane roads, while only 5 percent of those crashes took place on \nfour-lane divided highways.\n  Of course, making the types of improvements I just outlined will cost \nmoney. But making that investment will reap human dividends. According \nto the Department of Transportation's 1996 Annual Report on Highway \nSafety Improvement Programs, every $100 million invested in roadway \nsafety improvements will result in 144--12 dozen--144 fewer traffic \nfatalities.\n  And now, Mr. President, we arrive at the crux of the matter. The U.S. \nSenate is sitting idle. Not exactly sitting idle. There are other \nmatters that are being considered and they are not unimportant. But \ninsofar as doing something about the highway conditions of the country \nis concerned, the United States is sitting idle--the U.S. Senate and \nHouse are sitting idle when Congress should be working to finish the \nISTEA bill, a bill which was brought up last October and debated, or at \nleast it was before the Senate for about 21 days and then it was taken \ndown and a short-term, stop-gap highway authorization measure was \nenacted, which will expire at midnight--midnight, when the clock \nstrikes 12, midnight, on May 1, just 43--43--days away. Mr. President, \nthere is a time bomb ticking here. Congress has 43 session days. Let's \ntalk about the Senate. The Senate has 43 session days remaining, and \nthat includes today; 43 session days remaining until midnight May 1. So \n43 days includes today and includes May 1. The clock is ticking, and \nthe time bomb is ticking.\n\n  Roadway safety depends on the uninterrupted flow of Federal highway \nfunds, and yet the Senate is literally inviting a shutdown of our State \nand Federal highway programs by delaying action on ISTEA II. Forty-\nthree days, 43 session days when the Senate will be in session, not \nincluding Saturdays and Sundays and holidays.\n  Senators don't have to just take my word for that. Let's see what the \nlaw says. The short-term highway bill that the Senate passed and the \nHouse passed and was signed into law by President Clinton on December 1 \nof last year, let's see what that law says. That is the short-term \nhighway authorization bill by which the time was extended 6 months, the \nauthorization for highway programs, spending on highway programs.\n  Let's see what Public Law 105-130, the Surface Transportation \nExtension Act of 1997 says, in part. Hear it:\n\n       A State shall not obligate any funds for any Federal-aid \n     highway program project after May 1, 1998.\n\n  There it is. That's the law, and further obligating by State road \nsystems or transit systems after midnight on May 1 will be illegal. \nFurther obligating funds for highway programs after midnight on May 1 \nwill be against the law. Let's read it again. This is the law:\n\n       A State shall not obligate any funds for any Federal-aid \n     highway program project after May 1, 1998.\n\n  Now, I hope that the Governors and the mayors and the highway \nagencies out there across the country will consider that language that \nI just read. You must know that after midnight May 1 of this year, you, \nthe highway agencies of this country, will not be permitted to obligate \nfurther funding for Federal aid highway programs. And that is just 43 \ndays away, including today. ``Time Bomb Ticking.'' That's it.\n  So if we postpone debate on ISTEA II until after finishing the fiscal \nyear 1999 budget resolution--that is what some of the budgeteers in the \nSenate are importuning the Senate majority leader to do--delay, delay, \ndon't take up the 6-year full-term extension of the highway \nauthorization legislation, don't do that until the budget resolution is \ntaken up.\n  Well, if we postpone debate on ISTEA II until after finishing the \nfiscal year\n\n[[Page S614]]\n\n1999 budget resolution, the earliest then that the Senate will take up \nthe highway bill will be late April, after the spring recess, and that \nassumes that we meet the April 15 statutory deadline for the budget, \nwhich we are not accustomed to doing.\n  But let us assume that miraculously--I still believe in miracles, but \nnot here on this floor--let us assume that miraculously we meet the \ndeadline and turn to ISTEA II first thing on April 20, that would leave \nless than 2 weeks before the May 1 funding deadline, after which States \nwill be prohibited by law from obligating any Federal highway funds. If \nwe wait until after the budget to consider ISTEA II, we are virtually \nguaranteeing--guaranteeing--that Federal highway funds will be cut \noff--will be cut off.\n  That is why the highway bill cannot wait. That is why it should not \nwait. Given the needs that exist on our Nation's highways and the \nsafety risk which current conditions pose, we cannot afford to delay \nlifesaving highway projects. The Senate must turn to the ISTEA bill \nnow. The time bomb is ticking--tick, tick, tick, tick. Time for action \nis now.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 1 minute 3 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield that to my distinguished colleague, and that will \ngive him more than 11 minutes, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank my esteemed senior colleague \nfrom West Virginia. The junior Senator doesn't believe he will need 11 \nminutes, but I am grateful to have that opportunity. As needs to be \nsaid, Senator Byrd has been remarkable in his fight for roads and \ninfrastructure, and not just for roads for West Virginia, but also as a \nfighter for roads for Arkansas and every other state in this country.\n  My senior colleague and I--I having been Governor for 8 years, my \nsenior colleague having worked on this problem for many, many years--we \nare intimately acquainted with the nature of what four-lane highways \nand federally qualified roads, like route 33 and route 250, can mean. \nSo this is not a minor issue to us.\n  I am here on the floor to ask therefore why it is that the Senate \nstill isn't acting on the highway bill. Why is it? I pick up the Record \nof yesterday. It is not enormously thick. There is not a lot on our \ncalendar. My senior colleague talked about the Senate sitting idly by. \nWe have cast a handful of votes since reconvening. We had one vote \ntoday. It may be our last one for the day. We had a couple votes \nyesterday. They were not votes, Mr. President, that required enormous \namounts of debate. We had time laid out for debate, but they were on \nindividual judges about whom people already felt one way or another.\n  One has a sense that we are filling time. I don't say that in a \npartisan way, I say that in just a sort of generally frustrated way. In \nmy 13 years in the U.S. Senate, this feels like the slowest start to a \nyear in which we have so many things that we need to accomplish.\n  So the excuse of not moving on the reauthorization of the Intermodal \nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act--an incredible name, I agree, but \nincredibly important legislation it is--simply escapes me. Why wouldn't \nwe be doing it?\n  I can remember when I was Governor working with my senior colleague, \nSenator Byrd, and Senator Randolph on an amendment in this area to help \nWest Virginia and other states obtain the matching money they needed to \napply for.\n  The people of my State, the people of all the States where roads are \nneeded and construction needs to be finished, where bridges need to be \ncompleted, are facing a cut-off of funds that carries no logic to it, \nas far as I can understand. If there is a formula problem, and there \nalways is because that is the way we classically operate in the Senate, \nwe should set a deadline to resolve the problem. We need to face up to \na real deadline--my senior colleague is making this point, Mr. \nPresident--because waiting longer doesn't just put off the day when we \neven start to try to deal with these and the other outstanding issues.\n  But we can resolve those issues. The Senate has resolved far more \ncontentious issues than these. So I don't have any doubt about that. I \ndo have a very strong sense of the damage that failure to act on the \nhighway bill will do to the State that my senior colleague and I \nrepresent. It happens to be a State which has almost no flat land. I \nthink about 4 percent of our land is flat.\n  I am very familiar with the Presiding Officer's State, because my \nuncle was Governor of Arkansas and my first cousin now is Lieutenant \nGovernor, as the Presiding Officer and I have discussed. I know the \nOzarks are a part of Arkansas. It is very difficult there. There are \nalso lots of mountains. West Virginia is mostly mountains. It is the \noldest mountain system in the world. The Appalachian Mountains are the \noldest mountains in the world. They have been worn down over the \ncenturies, but they are very formidable and still blanket the greatest \npart of our State.\n  So I would say to my senior colleague, I can remember the last year I \nwas Governor, it cost, for about a mile of interstate or a mile of \nAppalachian corridor highway, about $17 million to build a mile. That \nwas back in 1984. I have to assume that we are talking now $25 million \nto $30 million per mile--per mile.\n  Completing and upgrading our roads is a terribly urgent situation for \nWest Virginia. We have Corridor H which we have to finish. Some people \ncomplain that my senior colleague puts so much emphasis on Corridor H. \nI would say that we in West Virginia are very grateful that Senator \nByrd is doing just that because it is the only way we are going to get \nthis critical road finished.\n  If I can just explain the importance of roads like Corridor H and \nreflect on the urgent need for this ISTEA reauthorization, is to remind \npeople listening that you still really can't get from the east coast \ninto the central part of West Virginia or any part of West Virginia \neasily.\n  You know, trucks are not willing to drive on two-lane highways. We \nwish that they could, but they do not. And we have a very difficult \naviation situation which some of us are also working on very hard. We \nhave an ample amount of rivers and barges, but even there, Senator Byrd \nand some of my colleagues in the House have to work very, very hard to \nmodernize the lock system, many of which were built, 50, 60, 70 years \nago.\n  So transportation for us is not what it is, let us say, for some \nother States which are relatively flat or have very warm climates so \nthat roads last far longer. We not only constantly have to repair our \nexisting roads, but we also have not even completed our basic road \nsystem. And that is terribly disadvantageous.\n  You can track the economy of West Virginia, how well certain places \nare doing, and others are not doing, based upon how close they are to a \nfour-lane highway. That is not unique to West Virginia, but it is West \nVirginia at this moment for which I speak and this Senator speaks. And, \ntherefore, I feel very strongly about this situation.\n  Roads supply jobs. Why can't we look at it that way? I can remember \nwhen we were building what we call the turnpike in West Virginia, which \nwas meant originally to be a four-lane highway and ended up to be a \ntwo-lane highway. How that happened is a mystery which has been \nshrouded in the history of West Virginia for many years of speculation. \nBut the point is, building that highway involved going through some of \nthe worst, steepest part of the beautiful, gorgeously beautiful \nsouthern mountains. And that was an enormous project. I mean, it is not \nlike building roads in many other parts of the country--you have to \nbuild huge abutments of towering concrete walls as you cut into the \nside of mountains. The work involves phenomenal engineering feats. It \nis like building the Panama Canal to put an Appalachia corridor or \ninterstate in most parts of West Virginia.\n  The construction jobs that stem from roads are tremendously important \nto us. The Nation's unemployment is low. But in West Virginia, our rate \nis approximately twice the Nation's unemployment. Every job is \nimportant to us. There is not a single job in West Virginia that \nanybody takes for granted. There is not a single job in West\n\n[[Page S615]]\n\nVirginia, the potential for a job, that people do not clamor for, try \nfor.\n  Toyota recently moved some of their production to West Virginia. And \nthey are going to make half of all of their engines in North America \nand Canada in West Virginia. They had a need for 300 workers, and they \ngot applications from 25,000 people. What does that tell you? Obviously \nsome were from Ohio, some from Kentucky, some perhaps from Virginia, \nbut we want the work.\n  We want the work, we want the roads, and we want the roads so then we \ncan further create the jobs. In fact, to make the point, Toyota would \nnot be in West Virginia if it were not for Interstate 64. They openly \ndeclare themselves to locate their plants close to where Interstate 64 \nis whether it be Kentucky, West Virginia or wherever.\n  So the economic need for turning our attention to the ISTEA \nreauthorization bill is obvious and clear-cut to my constituency. Our \nStates wait to know whether they can go ahead with their infrastructure \nplans. They watch us approve a couple of judges and work on a couple \nthings. We had a vote on a cloning bill this morning. It wasn't \ncloning, it was what leads up to cloning. Maybe we will get around to \nanother vote this afternoon; maybe we will not.\n  But, good grief, this highway bill has to be done, Mr. President. It \nhas to be done. This is the people's will. We made them a promise with \nthe 6-month extension. And we are not keeping that promise. And there \nis no reason not to. It is a bill which does good. And again, there may \nbe argument about the formula, but however it comes out, it is going to \ndo every single State an enormous benefit.\n  And I have to say one last time that our State will \nbenefit enormously from this legislation and needs this legislation to \npass. We have not finished our road system. We do not have the \nprosperity that we deserve in West Virginia for which our people have \nstruggled for a hundred years or more. Coal is diminishing. Only 6 \npercent of our work force is involved in coal.\n\n  We need to have manufacturing and we need to expand our intellectual \nand technological activity. We need to have all kinds of things. We \ncannot rely on coal and steel as much as we used to.\n  So I make the point that Corridor H has to be finished. It is \nabsolutely a requirement for the State. Corridor D needs to be \nfinished. As my senior colleague knows better than anybody, that has \nbeen nearly finished except for a few miles, but those miles are \nenormously expensive miles, and they have been languishing now for 2 \ndecades or more. And that is what connects the western part of our \nState with Ohio and the rest of the Nation.\n  West Virginia is enclosed by enormous States: Pennsylvania, Ohio, \nKentucky, Virginia, and Maryland. People cannot get out or cannot get \nin unless they can drive out or in or fly out or in. And they cannot \nfly out or in easily, so they have to drive. You cannot canoe down the \nOhio River and up the Little Kanawha. You have to be able to drive.\n  So I simply say, in lending my very, very strong support to Senator \nByrd's efforts, and as somebody who was a Governor for 8 years and \nunderstands the economic significance of our infrastructure, that there \nis no reason to go on with this uncertainty. There is simply no excuse. \nI join my senior colleague, and praise him for all he has done in \ncarrying the fight over the years and carrying it almost single-\nhandedly. I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Byrd and join with \nSenator Dorgan, who was speaking earlier, and others, so that we can \nget immediate consideration of ISTEA. It is the right thing for the \nNation. It will benefit our State and the Presiding Officer's State. \nAnd we have no reason at all not to be doing the people's business in \nthis critical area.\n  I thank my senior colleague, and I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, is any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has just expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 3 \nminutes, after which I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished \nSenator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, may proceed for not to exceed 15 \nminutes. I do not see any other Senator seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, Senator \nRockefeller, former Governor from West Virginia, who served 2 terms as \nGovernor. I thank him for joining in urging that the ISTEA bill be \ncalled up at this time. And he made the point that partisanship isn't \ninvolved here. There is no partisanship in this.\n  Both sides of the aisle--there are Senators on both sides of the \naisle who want ISTEA, the ISTEA bill to be called up. And there are \nSenators on both sides of the aisle who are supporting the amendment, \nthe Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment, which would provide for the \nmoneys that are in the trust fund, the moneys that the American people \nhave paid at the gas pump, the 4.3-cent gas tax, for example. That is \ndoing nothing now except building up surpluses in the trust fund.\n  There are Senators on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and \nDemocrats, who want to see those moneys that are spent by the American \npeople out there in the form of gas taxes, who want to see those spent \nfor highways to improve highways and mass transit programs. As of now, \nthey are just building surpluses; they are not being spent for \nanything.\n  There are those in this Senate who are importuning the distinguished \nmajority leader not to call up this highway bill right now because they \nwant to wait until after the budget resolution is adopted so that these \nmoneys in the trust fund can be spent for social programs, and so on, \nthat the administration and some Senators, of course, want to spend \nthose moneys on. But the American people believe, because they have \nbeen told, that the moneys in the trust fund should be spent for \nhighway improvements and transit improvements.\n\n  I have not said much on the West Virginia angle of this, but I intend \nto. But that is what the amendment which Senator Gramm and Senator \nBaucus and Senator Warner and I and 50 other Senators, making a total \nof 54 Senators, are urging, that that ISTEA bill be brought up, urging \nthat the money in the highway trust fund be spent for highways to \nimprove the highways and to improve transit programs.\n  So that money is there. And, as I say, there are some on the Budget \nCommittee, not all, some on the Budget Committee who are importuning \nthe leader, the majority leader, not to bring up ISTEA now--keep it, \nwait, wait until after the budget resolution is brought up. And those \nparticular Senators, in my judgment, do not want to see those gas tax \nmoneys spent on highways. They want to spend them on other programs.\n  So, Mr. President, I again urge that the leadership keep its \ncommitment to the Senate and call up this highway bill. I can \nunderstand the pressures on the majority leader. I have been majority \nleader. And I can understand the pressures that are on the majority \nleader from other Senators. And, as I say, I have a feeling that the \nmajority leader, if he did not have those pressures, would have the \nISTEA bill brought up now. I have a feeling--I certainly have a hope--\nthat he would support the amendment that 53 of my colleagues are \nsupporting.\n  Mr. President, I again thank my distinguished colleague from West \nVirginia, especially for his reference to Corridor H and Corridor D and \nother corridors in West Virginia.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. THOMAS). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there is a small vocal group in West \nVirginia that opposes Corridor H. But there was a poll taken in West \nVirginia within the last 2 weeks, I believe, that showed that 80 \npercent--79 percent of West Virginians support the completion of \nCorridor H inside West Virginia. Only about 6 percent--6 percent--of \nthe people are very opposed, and that is the highly vocal group over \nthere that has been opposing Corridor H. Of course, they have some \npeople over in some of the adjoining States who add their voices to the \nsmall 6 percent in West Virginia who are opposed to completing Corridor \nH. About 8 or 9 percent, as I understand it, from the poll do not take \nany position one way or another. But 79 percent take a strong position\n\n[[Page S616]]\n\nfor the completion of Corridor H inside West Virginia.\n  So my colleague mentioned Corridor H. And I hope that eventually in \nmy lifetime we can see Corridor H completed inside West Virginia. It \nhas been promised to the people of West Virginia for 33 years. And the \nAppalachian highway system has been promised to the 13 States in \nAppalachia for 33 years. It is 78 percent complete in the region, 74 \npercent in West Virginia.\n  The time bomb is ticking. I hope that we can get that bill up and let \nthe Senate work its will on these amendments, my amendment included.\n  Mr. President, I again thank the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Rockefeller. I thank the Chair and thank my colleague \nfrom Texas for his patience.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our dear colleague from West \nVirginia. It has been a great honor for me to work with him on this. I \nbelieve we are going to win on this amendment. We have 54 cosponsors. \nWe probably have 25 other Members of the Senate who are ready to vote \nfor the bill. We gain strength every day.\n  There is only one thing that is stopping us from passing a new \nhighway bill that can begin providing money to build highways all \nacross America on May the 2nd. And that one thing is that we have been \nunable to bring the highway bill up so that we can offer the amendment, \nour amendment, by forcing the Government to live up to the commitment \nit has made to the American people when it puts on a gasoline pump that \nabout a third of the cost of a gallon of gasoline is taxes. But the \ngood news is, those taxes go to build roads. What we are trying to do \nis to force the Government to do what it tells people it is doing, and \nthat is, spend the money on roads.\n  We now know that between 25 and 30 cents out of every dollar \ncollected in gasoline taxes has been going to fund everything except \nhighways. And so what our amendment is trying to do is to require truth \nin Government by saying that gasoline taxes have to, in an orderly, \nfiscally responsible manner, be spent on highways.\n  This is a big deal. This is a very big deal in every State in the \nUnion. What it means in my State, what it means in West Virginia, what \nit means in every State in the Union is roughly a 25 percent increase \nin the amount of money that is available to build roads beginning on \nMay the 2nd.\n  We are not talking about doing something that is going to be felt in \nyour State in the sweet bye and bye. This is something that on May the \n2nd we can begin to see States letting contracts, putting people to \nwork, pouring concrete, pressing asphalt, improving the quality of our \nroads and highways, saving lives, creating jobs, reducing the amount of \ntime that we all spend in traffic, improving the environment in the \ncountry. You could list 100 things that are positive for America that \nwill occur, beginning on May 2, if we can pass this amendment and pass \nthe highway bill.\n  Now, Senator Byrd and I have spoken virtually every day for the last \n2 or 3 weeks, and we have made a series of points that no one who \nopposes the amendment has come down to try to argue against. Those \npoints are basically the following: Gasoline taxes have historically \nbeen devoted to road construction; the American people are led to \nbelieve this by every sign on every gasoline pump in America. They are \npaying lots of taxes, but the good news is it is a user fee for roads. \nAnd yet that is not the case today nor has it been the case through the \n1990s. Money has been collected in gasoline taxes and spent on other \nthings.\n  Second, we have established very clearly that this amendment does not \nbust the budget. Nothing in this amendment raises the total level of \nspending. What this amendment does is it requires that the money \ncollected for road construction be spent for road construction and \nnothing else.\n  In fact, one of our colleagues, in arguing against the amendment, \nposed the question to Senator Byrd and to me, ``If you spend this money \non highways, that means we are not going to be able to spend it on the \nother things we want to spend the money on.''\n  I think it can be argued in two ways. The first argument is that we \nhave a desperate need for highways in America--31,000 miles of roads in \nmy State are substandard. We have thousands of bridges that have been \ncertified as not being safe. We are basically now at a point in Texas \nthat half of the money we have for roads goes to just maintain the \nroads we have. The expected life of a road is between 30 and 40 years, \ndepending on where it is built. We built our great farm-to-market roads \nin Texas in the 1930s and 1940s. We have long since exceeded the life \nof those roads. Our busiest roads in Texas, our interstates, were built \nin the 1960s. They are heavily used, some beyond 100 percent capacity, \nand they are reaching the end of their economic life.\n  What do we spend on in Government that is more critical than national \nsecurity and roads? But as strong as that argument is, that is not the \nstrongest argument.\n  Our colleagues stand up and say, if the money you collect for \nhighways is really spent on highways--we plan to spend this money on \nother things. I think, quite frankly, that there is an argument in \nterms of basic honesty in dealing with the electorate that we have on \nour side, and that is that we have a revenue source dedicated to the \nhighway trust fund. So not only is there a great need for roads, but \nthe money was collected for that purpose and for that purpose only. The \nidea that we are going to collect potentially $90 billion for highway \nconstruction and simply stand by and watch the Government spending it \non everything except highways is, I believe, outrageous and \nunacceptable. Quite frankly, I believe that is going to end this year--\nend this year.\n  Some people have raised questions about the priorities of the bill. \nWe have answered each and every one of those questions about the amount \nthat goes to the States, the amount held by the Secretary. Questions \nhave been raised about the Appalachian program, started in 1965, as a \npercentage of money spent on highways. We are actually in our amendment \nasking for less than the President requested, the same amount, for all \npractical purposes, requested by the House.\n  Questions are raised about border infrastructure and international \ntrade corridors. We actually have less money in our amendment than the \nbill that came out of committee, but there is one big difference. We \nmake it possible that Congress might actually fund it, whereas the \ncommittee bill, in a sleight of hand, appears to provide the money but \nreally doesn't provide the money.\n  In short, we have answered each and every one of the criticisms that \nhave been raised in this initiative. It is the right thing. It is what \nwe tell people we are doing. It does not violate the Budget Act. It \ndoes not raise the total level of spending, and it doesn't create any \nnew priorities. It simply sets out an orderly fashion of fulfilling \nobligations we have made in the past.\n  Now, we are getting down to the moment of truth. The highway bill is \ngoing to expire on May 1. So roadbuilding equipment that is currently \nin the process of building highways and roads and interstates all over \nAmerica, come May 1, they will cut those machines off. Come May 1, \npeople are going to be forced to walk off the job because we have not \nprovided money for highways. It is not that we don't have the money, \nSenator Byrd. We have the money. It is being collected every time \nany American goes to the filling station and pumps gas. But they are \ngoing to stop building roads all over America on May 1 because we are \nnot allowed to vote on a highway bill to allow the expenditure of money \nthat is being collected specifically to build roads, even though we are \ncollecting more money for road construction in the gasoline tax than \never in history. Despite the fact that the surplus grows every single \nsecond, we have the terrible prospect of highway construction stopping \nall over America on May 1.\n\n  There is only one solution to this problem--bring up the highway \nbill. We debated it last year. It got bogged down in other issues. I \nwish we could have broken the deadlock last year. It is bad public \npolicy that it happened. But the point is this is not last year. This \nis this year. We have an opportunity right now to bring this bill up. I \ncan assure you, we are not going to let any issue that has nothing to \ndo\n\n[[Page S617]]\n\nwith highways derail this bill this year. There are a lot of legitimate \nissues that need to be debated. We need to bring this bill up and we \nneed to bring it up as soon as we get back from the recess next week.\n  I feel an obligation to people in my State. I feel an obligation to \nthe State where we pay in gasoline taxes on a per capita basis as much \nas any State in the Union. It is not uncommon for people in my State to \ndrive in their cars and trucks 50 miles one way to work, to drive 30 \nmiles to take their children to school. People in my State need \nhighways. They pay for them by paying the gasoline tax.\n  I want to urge our leadership to work with us to bring this bill up. \nThis is not a budget issue. We are not talking about busting the \nbudget. We are not talking about setting the total level of spending. \nWe are talking about requiring money to be spent for the purpose that \nit was collected and not on other things. But if there are those who \nwant to talk about this within the context of the budget, Senator Byrd \nand I are not so busy that we don't have time to sit down and talk. I \nbelieve that the day we come back, week after next, that the situation \nwith highways is going to be getting so desperate that we will have to \ndo something. I think we ought to bring up the highway bill. I think it \nwould be bad for us to be forced to try to deal with this issue as an \namendment on another bill. That is not the way I want to do it. I know \nthe Senator from West Virginia doesn't want to do it that way. We need \nto act and we need to do it very quickly. We are running out of time.\n  I want to conclude by simply urging those who would like to commingle \nthis issue with the budget, if they want to sit down with Senator Byrd, \nwith me, with Senator Warner, with Senator Baucus, to talk about how \nthis might fit into a budget that would be written later, we are \nwilling to sit down and talk about it. It is not a budget issue. Quite \nfrankly, I believe those who oppose us want to make it a budget issue \nso that they can say to people, look, don't vote for these highways \nbecause if you do that, then you can't spend all this money on other \nthings, money requested by the President, money sought by other \ninterests, money expenditures that are supported by Members of \nCongress.\n  There is one fundamental difference. Nobody is saying that child care \nis not important or food stamps aren't important, or funds for the IMF \naren't important, or paying dues at the United Nations are not \nimportant, or that foreign aid is not important. But there is one \nfundamental difference. None of those expenditures has a dedicated \nrevenue source. None of those expenditures has a tax that working \nAmericans pay for the purpose of funding them. Americans do pay a \ngasoline tax to build roads. So our claim is stronger. We have \ncommitted to people we are going to do this. I believe time is running \nout here. I think we have been very patient. I think we have tried to \nwork with everybody. We have been willing to sit down and talk to \nanyone. You don't get 54 cosponsors by accident. You do it by answering \na lot of questions, by convincing a lot of people. I don't think anyone \nhas asked Senator Byrd or asked me to sit down with them to explain \nthis amendment, what it does, how it will affect their State, how it \nwill affect anything they are concerned about. But we are going to \nreach a point here when we come back after the recess where we have to \nquit explaining and start acting.\n  I urge those who would like to commingle this with the budget, while \nI really believe that is a ruse to beat our amendment--they are trying \nto convince people that our demand that we spend money for the purpose \nwe tell people we are going to spend it when we collect it is somehow \non a par with proposals made to spend money to just simply increase the \nlevel of expenditure. There is no comparison between the two. But if \nsomebody wants to talk to us about the budget as it relates to our \namendment, we are willing, any time, day or night, to sit down and talk \nto them. What we are not willing to do is to sit here and let May 1 \ncome and let highway construction stop all over the country. We are not \nwilling to do that, and we need to get on with the task of passing the \nhighway bill and, I believe, passing this amendment.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Senator Byrd, for his leadership. We \nhave done a lot of work on this. I would like to believe the number of \ncosponsors, the progress we have made, is somewhat due to our \npersuasiveness. But I think, really, it is not our persuasiveness; it \nis the strength of the case we are making. This is the right thing to \ndo. It is clearly the right thing to do. I think if the American people \nreally understood what this debate was about, if they really understood \nthat the critics of what we are doing are saying, ``Don't spend the \nmoney for the purpose you select it is because we want to spend it on \nother things,'' they would be outraged about it. I think that is one of \nthe reasons that people don't come over and debate us on this subject.\n  I am glad to be on a side of an issue where we are right. I can \nassure you, it is much easier to argue something if the facts are on \nyour side. Now, often here, great cases are made when the facts don't \ncomport, but when they are on your side, it is easy. And they are on \nour side on this issue.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I want to thank the distinguished senior Senator from \nTexas. He worked inside the Finance Committee to offer an amendment \nwhich was adopted in the committee transferring the 4.3-cent gas tax to \nthe trust fund, to the highway trust fund, where it would be spent on \nhighways and mass transit programs. So he got it that far. So the money \nis in the trust fund, and I compliment him.\n  Now he has joined with me and 52 other Senators--in addition to the \ntwo of us, he has joined with me and 52 other Senators, Mr. Baucus and \nMr. Warner, in particular--who are initial cosponsors of this \nlegislation. He has joined with us in attempting to authorize, to have \nthe Congress authorize, the expenditure of the moneys in the trust \nfund, the 4.3-cent gas tax, to authorize the expenditure of those funds \nfor highways and for mass transit programs.\n  That is what they were intended to be used for. He has stood like a \nstout Irish oak on his side of the aisle in urging that the ISTEA bill \nbe brought up and in urging support of this amendment upon which we are \nboth allied and working. I thank him for that. I thank him for his \nsteadfastness; he has stood like a Rock of Gibraltar. We will continue \nto work in the effort to implore the bringing up of this highway bill. \nI thank him very much.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. Let \nme just conclude by saying that the American people cry out for \nbipartisanship. This is the only real bipartisan effort of this \nCongress. We have 54 cosponsors on this bill; they are roughly divided, \nDemocrats and Republicans. This is not a partisan issue. I hope we can \nmove ahead and I believe we will. I want to thank the Senator from West \nVirginia. It has been a great honor for me to work with him. I believe \nwe are going to be successful, in large part, because this is the right \nthing to do. But as Edmund Burke once said, ``All that is necessary for \nevil to triumph in the world is for good men to do nothing.''\n  We intend to do something to make this happen--however much work it \ntakes. We have carried this ball all the way down to the goal line, and \nwe are not about to fumble it or call time-out right now.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S612-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S617-S620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator \nseeking recognition, this may be a good time for me to report briefly \non the travels that I undertook from December 30 to January 13, when I \nvisited the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague and found that this agency \nis moving forward with prosecutions on war crimes against humanity, \narising out of the activities in Bosnia.\n  It is my sense that after the first conviction, which has been \nobtained,\n\n[[Page S618]]\n\nthe tribunal is on its way to establishing a very, very important \ninternational precedent. For the past decade-plus, many of us, \nincluding Senator Dodd, Congressman Jim Leach, myself, and others, have \nbeen working to try to bring an international criminal court into \nexistence. It is my sense that if the War Crimes Tribunal is \nsuccessful, we may have the most important institutional change in \ninternational relations in this century, if we can bring the rule of \nlaw into the international arena.\n  I think it is very important that the outstanding indictments be \nserved. In talking to the military leaders and NATO in Bosnia, I have \nbeen informed that we have the capacity to do so if the instructions \nare given. Up until the present time, the rule has been to serve them \nwith warrants of arrest if our military groups come into contact with \nthose under indictment, but they are not to make an effort to search \nthem out. It is a delicate matter and has to be handled with discretion \nand with regard to not losing lives in the process of making the \narrests. But, I think that ultimately those warrants of arrest do have \nto be served.\n  We stopped in Bosnia and saw the activities there. Mindful of the \nPresident's recent request for an open-ended stay in Bosnia, we \ndiscussed with the military leaders and with some of the soldiers their \nsense as to what was going to happen there.\n  The Congress has legislated to bring an end to the funding as of June \n30, 1998, with certain exceptions relating to a Presidential extension. \nBut, it seems to me that it is necessary to have some idea as to how \nlong we are going to be there. Those enmities and hatreds go back \nhundreds of years, and it is necessary, in my judgment, for us to have \nsome idea as to how long we are going to stay there and how long it \nwill take to accomplish that mission if we are, in fact, to remain \nthere.\n  The U.S. contingents are still much larger than any others. We have \nsome 8,000 personnel--substantially larger than the French, British, \nRussians, or others--and there ought to be more of a burden sharing \nthan is present now if the United States is to stay there.\n  We traveled on to the Mideast where we had an opportunity to meet \nwith Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, Syrian President Assad, Egyptian \nPresident Mubarak, King Hussein of Jordan, and other leaders. And, it \nis my sense that the Israeli-Syrian tract could be very close to \nresolution.\n  Before going, on December 17, I met with President Clinton, told him \nof my itinerary, and urged him to become personally involved in the \nSyrian negotiations as he had been in the past. The parties were very \nclose to a resolution of the dispute between Israel and Syria before \nthe assassination of Prime Minister Rabin. The President was personally \ninvolved in those negotiations. I believe that with an activist hand by \nthe President, there could be a successful resolution there. It can't \nbe said with certainty, but the parties were very close before Prime \nMinister Rabin was assassinated.\n  I had an opportunity to talk to Prime Minister Netanyahu and \nPresident Assad in August and November of 1996. At that time it seemed \nto me that the parties were far apart, with Prime Minister Netanyahu \nsaying he wanted to negotiate for peace but would do so only if there \nwas a clean slate and he had a new mandate. President Assad of Syria, \non the other hand, said he, too, wanted to negotiate but would do so \nonly if they would begin where the negotiations left off with Prime \nMinister Rabin.\n  While the words were very similar, when I had a chance to talk to \nPrime Minister Netanyahu and President Assad last month, the music, it \nseemed to me, was a little bit different. Syria had a new set of \nproblems with their economy, and Netanyahu faces a new set of problems. \nI think activist intervention by the President could well bring the \nIsraeli-Syrian tract to a conclusion. It is certainly worth a try.\n  As to the Palestinian-Israeli tract, it is much more complicated. \nBut, here again I have urged the President to bring Mr. Netanyahu and \nMr. Arafat into the same room, at the same time, to hear their \ncomplaints and to try to bring a resolution to those very serious \nproblems.\n  Part of the mission on this trip was to explore persecution against \nChristians and other religious groups. Our travels took us to Egypt, \nEthiopia, Eritrea, and Saudi Arabia. The details are spelled out in a \nwritten report, which I shall file as well. But, it seems to me that \nthe United States ought to take a stand on the legislation which has \nbeen introduced by Congressman Frank Wolf in the House and by myself in \nthe Senate which would articulate the principles of religious freedom \nand impose sanctions on foreign governments which tolerate or encourage \nthis kind of persecution.\n  In Saudi Arabia, in talking to Prince Turki, I heard again that the \nKoran calls for the death penalty if someone changes from Islam to \nChristianity. I heard the same in Egypt, and found, in fact, that those \nwho have converted from Islam to Christianity had been imprisoned. We \nheard many complaints talking to people who had been victims of \npersecution in Saudi Arabia and in Egypt. It is my hope that this issue \nwill come to the Senate floor. I know it is on the majority leader's \nlist to be considered by the Senate sometime between now and the \nspring.\n  This is just a brief statement of some of the highlights.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the full text of the \nreport, which incorporates two op-ed pieces that have been published in \nthe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Harrisburg Patriot-News, be printed \nin the Record as well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Report on Foreign Travel\n\n       In accordance with my practice of reporting on foreign \n     travel, this floor statement summarizes a trip which I took \n     from December 30, l997 through January 13, l998 to fourteen \n     countries in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. My trip had \n     several purposes: to evaluate the work of the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in The \n     Hague in prosecuting indicted war criminals and in laying \n     down the precedent for the establishment of a permanent \n     international criminal court, to evaluate the President's \n     request for an open-ended extension of time for the U.S. \n     military participation in United Nations Stabilization Force \n     operations in Bosnia, to assess the progress of the Middle \n     East peace process, and to gather information in support of \n     my legislation to strengthen U.S. policy against countries \n     that persecute religious minorities.\n\n\n                    INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL\n\n       The first phase of my trip involved a review of the \n     progress of the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in The Hague. This was my third \n     trip to that body in as many years, and its good work \n     reaffirmed my belief that the tribunal could well set the \n     stage for the creation of a permanent International Criminal \n     Court, which would do much to deter future crimes against \n     humanity.\n       In The Hague, I met with the Tribunal's Chief Prosecutor, \n     Louise Arbour, and several American members of her staff, to \n     discuss pending prosecutions arising from war crimes in the \n     former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The prosecutors were much more \n     optimistic than they had been on my two previous visits in \n     1996. One assistant prosecutor, Ms. Patricia Sellers, \n     declared there had been more progress in international law in \n     the last four years than in the intervening 520 years \n     following the first conviction of a war criminal in 1474.\n       The most tangible of the tribunal's successes was the \n     recent conviction, on eleven counts after a one-year trial, \n     of Dusko Tadic, charged with crimes against humanity under \n     the statutes of the International Tribunal and cruel \n     treatment of civilians as defined by the Geneva Convention of \n     1949.\n       While the Tadic case is a start, it is important to note \n     that only 19 of the 79 defendants under indictment are in \n     custody. Most of the remaining defendants are at large in \n     Serb-controlled portions of the former Yugoslavia.\n       On a later stop in Sarajevo, I saw that the multi-national \n     force in Bosnia faces a complicated task in taking some of \n     these major defendants, like Radovan Karadic and Ratko \n     Mladic, into custody. The current instruction is to arrest \n     indictees if observed, but not to hunt them down. Our \n     military commanders told me in Sarajevo that they have the \n     trained personnel to take them into custody if provided \n     sufficient intelligence information on their whereabouts.\n       Some of the Congressional opposition to staying in Bosnia \n     could be overcome with a strategy to hunt down war criminals \n     as part of the SFOR mission, but this would present its own \n     set of problems. Our experience in Somalia was bitter when we \n     sustained extensive casualties in our unsuccessful effort to \n     take Mohammad Aidid into custody. Consideration should be \n     given to an arrest strategy if it could be accomplished with \n     minimal difficulty.\n       A vastly preferable course to SFOR apprehension would be \n     for Serbia to honor its commitments under the Dayton \n     Agreement\n\n[[Page S619]]\n\n     to cooperate in apprehending the Tribunal's indictees. After \n     discussing this matter with the Supreme Allied Commander, \n     Europe, General Wesley Clark in The Hague, I requested and \n     obtained a meeting with Slobodan Milosevic, President of the \n     Yugoslavian Federation, who had been labeled a war criminal \n     by Secretary of State Larry Eagleburger in December 1992. \n     Fifteen minutes out of Belgrade on a special flight, I was \n     told Milosevic had suddenly caught the flu.\n       In my testy substitute meeting in Belgrade with Yugoslavian \n     Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovich, I pressed Yugoslavia to \n     turn over several defendants in his country and to help \n     apprehend Karadic and Mladic. I was not surprised by his \n     refusal. While in Belgrade I heardthat many there are worried \n     about the Tribunal's recently adopted procedure to obtain \n     sealed indictments. Some ranking Serbian or Yugoslavian of \n     officials may travel to a jurisdiction where an arrest \n     warrant, based on a sealed indictment from the War Crimes \n     Tribunal, could be served with a one-way ticket to custody at \n     The Hague.\n       Later stops on my trip validated the importance of the \n     International Tribunal's example to maintaining international \n     stability. In Ethiopia, Yemen and Eritrea, I heard \n     considerable interest in the tribunal's work on Rwanda war \n     crimes. The U.S. Ambassador to Ethiopia expressed concern \n     about the slow progress of the tribunal on the Rwanda \n     indictments. Yemeni Foreign Minister Al-Iryani expressed \n     satisfaction that 23 individuals are in custody on charges of \n     war crimes in Rwanda.\n       Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Weldensae told me that \n     successful prosecutions against Rwanda defendants would help \n     bring peace to that country which still suffers from \n     massacres. Yemeni President Salih cautioned against the \n     tribunal's handling of the Rwanda prosecutions without a \n     better understanding of African problems. But the his Foreign \n     Minister struck a positive chord, saying the Rwanda tribunal \n     ``will absolutely deter'' future atrocities and that it would \n     set a ``very good precedent that no one should get away from \n     war crimes.''\n       From my review of the tribunal's progress, it is clear that \n     it faces many hurdles: the body has only one courtroom (with \n     a second under construction), and is frequently undercut by \n     France and Yugoslavia in carrying out its work. The \n     tribunal's budget has been increased, but still will have \n     grossly insufficient resources to carry out its vital \n     mandate. Only resources, perseverance and strong \n     international backing will enable the War Crimes Tribunal to \n     make a success of its unique opportunity to extend the rule \n     of law against international criminals.\n\n\n                                 BOSNIA\n\n       The second phase of my trip involved evaluating the \n     President's recent decision to stay to stay in Bosnia \n     indefinitely in the face of the Defense Appropriations Act \n     cutting off funding for our military operations there on June \n     30, l998. Clearly, Congress and the President may be on a \n     collision course on this matter. Evaluating our policy in \n     Bosnia took me to Sarajevo, Belgrade and Italy to meet in the \n     field with our troops and with military leaders from the U.S. \n     and NATO Commands.\n       In Sarajevo, I asked our troops to estimate how long we \n     would need to stay there to avoid the resumption of bloodshed \n     which would happen if they left on Congress's schedule. A \n     frequent answer was a generation, given the intensity and \n     longevity of the religious and ethnic hatreds between the \n     Muslims, Croats and Serbs. Command Sergeant Major Selmer \n     Hyde, a Pittsburgh native, pointed out that Muslims in \n     Sarajevo choose to walk up a high hill adjacent to the city \n     over a winding dirt trail rather than using a new macadam \n     road traveled by Serbs and Croats.\n       There was considerable Congressional opposition to \n     President Clinton's deployment of U.S. troops for one year in \n     early l996 as part of a multi-national force, and even more \n     skepticism when he extended their stay by 18 months shortly \n     after the 1996 Presidential election. In articulating the \n     three U.S. objectives for an indefinite stay in Bosnia, the \n     President twice refers to European security and once to the \n     rule of international law. While obviously important, those \n     reasons do not measure up to ``vital'' U.S. national \n     interests as defined by the historic Senate debate involving \n     Senators Nunn, Warner, Moynihan, myself and others on the \n     Congressional resolution to authorize the use of force in the \n     Gulf War in January 1991.\n       There is no doubt about the potential dire consequences if \n     the fighting resumes among the Muslims, Serbs and Croats. The \n     battle may spill into Macedonia. Germany and other European \n     countries would likely be flooded with refugees. The entire \n     region would be de-stabilized.\n       But there is significant question as to how far can U.S. \n     military resources be stretched on the current $268 billion \n     defense budget. In the mid-1980s, those appropriations \n     approximated $300 billion, which would exceed $400 billion in \n     1998 dollars. The top U.S. military brass in Bosnia and NATO \n     had no response to my questions on priorities in deciding how \n     to spend among Bosnia, Korea, Iran, Iraq and the world's \n     other hot spots.\n       The other nations insist on U.S. leadership. The U.S. has \n     about 8000 soldiers in the Bosnia force, compared to \n     approximately 2500 Germans, 5100 British, 3200 French, and \n     1400 Russians. Most of those nations are AWOL when it comes \n     to supporting the U.S. on tough sanctions against Iraq or on \n     our efforts to isolate Iran, and France has chosen not to let \n     its officers testify in front of the International Criminal \n     Tribunal in The Hague. This is particularly outrageous given \n     that General Shinseki's multi-national staff told me \n     that successful prosecution of tribunal inductees forms a \n     lynchpin of future Bosnian stability.\n       In the field, our Bosnian troops express mixed sentiments \n     on our continuing role there. While there is pride on \n     preserving the peace and noting some improvements, most say \n     we will have to be there for decades.\n       Doing our part does not mean doing more than other major \n     European nations. This is not the Cold War where the U.S. \n     squared off against the USSR and our dominant role in NATO \n     protected our vital national interests. Obviously, Bosnian \n     stability is of much greater concern to the European nations \n     than it is to the U.S.\n       If we are to stay, we should (1) get greater commitments \n     from the other major powers--Great Britain, France, Germany, \n     Italy, etc; (2) secure agreement from those nations to share \n     on stabilizing the other world hot spots; (3) obtain real \n     cooperation from the Serbs, Muslims and Croats on taking into \n     custody defendants under indictment by the War Crimes \n     Tribunal; and (4) set a time-table on benchmarks for progress \n     which would permit a reduction and, ultimately, a withdrawal \n     of U.S. personnel in Bosnia.\n       Congress is prepared to be cooperative, but there are \n     important issues and interests which must be addressed to our \n     satisfaction. The Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, on \n     which I serve, should not and will not issue a blank check on \n     Bosnia.\n\n\n                           MIDDLE EAST PEACE\n\n       The third phase of my trip involved assessing Middle East \n     regional stability and the progress of the peace process. \n     Toward this end, l met in Israel with Prime Minister \n     Netanyahu and various members of the Knesset, in Syria with \n     President Assad and Foreign Minister Shara, in Jordan with \n     King Hussein and Crown Prince Hassan, on the West Bank with \n     Palestinian Authority Chairman Arafat and Minister of \n     Education Hanan Ashrawi, in Eritrea with Foreign Minister \n     Weldensae, in Yemen with President Salih and Foreign Minister \n     al-lryani, in Saudi Arabia with Saudi Intelligence Director \n     Prince Turki and U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Rayburn and \n     in Egypt with President Mubarak.\n       Before I left I had a talk with President Clinton and urged \n     him to become more involved in the Mideast peace process, \n     particularly on the Israeli-Syrian track. After meeting with \n     Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Assad, I am convinced \n     that if the President of the United States became personally \n     involved on that track, there could be some real movement.\n       In talking to President Assad and Prime Minister Netanyahu \n     on trips to the area in August and November, 1996, President \n     Assad's position was that he's not going to resume \n     negotiations unless Israel agrees to start off where Prime \n     Minister Rabin left off, and Prime Minister Netanyahu \n     contended that he had a different mandate from the Israeli \n     electorate. This time, I noticed the same words, but somewhat \n     of a difference in tone. I firmly believe that progress could \n     be made on this track with direct Presidential involvement.\n       On the question of the Golan, I raised with President Assad \n     the issue of submitting the return of the Golan to an Israeli \n     referendum as part of any agreement with Israel. While \n     initially President Assad considered this a matter purely for \n     Israeli domestic consumption, after we talked for a while, he \n     acknowledged that it could form a part of a future \n     arrangement. If the sticking point of the status of Golan \n     were decided directly by the Israeli electorate referendum, \n     this would allow Prime Minister Netanyahu to negotiate with \n     Syria, notwithstanding his ``mandate.''\n       As I did in the past, I also raised with President Assad \n     the issue of Israeli MIAs and I was told that the Syrians \n     have made continuing efforts. I had raised that in the past, \n     and they say they have not been able to find anything to this \n     point. I raised a number of other MIA issues; I've been asked \n     by the U.S. Embassy not to discuss those issues in detail, \n     but I did raise them all. I was assured that work is being \n     done on them.\n       By contrast with the Israeli-Syrian track, the Israeli-\n     Palestinian peace talks are much more difficult. There are a \n     lot of people in the region who contend that Prime Minister \n     Netanyahu has not kept his promises on the Israeli-\n     Palestinian process. Prime Minister Netanyahu insists that he \n     has kept his promises. I believe that bringing both sides \n     together in this atmosphere is going to take a lot of work. I \n     was glad to see the President bring both Prime Minister \n     Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat to meet with him in Washington \n     last week, but I wish that more could have been attained by \n     way of tangible progress during their visits. I feel that a \n     similar Oval Office dialogue between Prime Minister Netanyahu \n     and President Assad would prove more fruitful because the \n     Israeli-Syrian track appears not as intractable.\n       As ever, Islamic fundamentalist terrorism represents the \n     greatest threat to regional security in the Middle East, and, \n     in light of this, my visit to Saudi Arabia was especially \n     instructive. I visited thousands of U.S. airmen living in \n     tents at the remote Prince Sultan Air Base, to which our \n     forces were sent\n\n[[Page S620]]\n\n     following the terrorist attack on Khobar Towers in Dhahran in \n     June 1996. Their living quarters made the Allenwood Federal \n     Prison in Pennsylvania look palatial.\n       I had met with FBI Director Louis Freeh before departing, \n     and discussed, among other issues, the level of Saudi \n     cooperation with our counter-terrorism effort. In Riyadh, I \n     met with Saudi Intelligence Director Prince Turki, and \n     strongly objected to the Saudis' refusal to honor their \n     commitment to allow the FBI to question suspects in the \n     Khobar Towers bombing. Prince Turki replied that Saudi \n     national sovereignty entitled his government to handle the \n     matter as it chose. This is particularly irksome, given the \n     sacrifices that our troops are making in the region to \n     provide the Saudi government protection from Iraq.\n\n\n                     FOREIGN RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION\n\n       The fourth phase of my trip involved gathering information \n     on foreign religious persecution. Worldwide persecution of \n     religious minorities, focused particularly on Christians in \n     Muslim countries China and Tibet, led last year to the \n     introduction of the Specter-Wolf bill which would create a \n     U.S. office to monitor such persecution and impose trade \n     sanctions on countries which systematically persecute any \n     religious group.\n       Toward the goal of fact-finding, I met with religious \n     leaders and governmental officials in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, \n     Ethiopia, and Eritrea and Yemen. I had wanted to visit Sudan \n     to investigate persecution of Christians by the \n     fundamentalist Islamic Sudanese government, but was told by \n     the State Department that Sudan was unsafe for American \n     delegations. I did meet with the Sudanese government-in-exile \n     in neighboring Eritrea, and discussed reports of Sudanese \n     persecution with His Holiness Abuna Paulos, the Patriarch of \n     the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and with the leadership of the \n     Ethiopian Supreme Islamic Council in Addis Ababa.\n       My fact-finding corroborated the widespread reports of \n     bias, mistreatment and even persecution of religious \n     minorities in the Middle East and Africa.\n       Egyptian President Mubarak and Saudi Arabian Intelligence \n     Director Prince Turki told me that public intolerance toward \n     non-Muslim religions springs from the Koran. Conversion from \n     Islam to Christianity or any other religion carries the death \n     penalty under Muslim laws that are based on teachings of the \n     Koran.\n       I heard conflicting statements in Saudi Arabia about \n     whether the death penalty is actually imposed on conversion. \n     One U.S. citizen living in Riyadh told me of a videotaped \n     beheading by Saudi authorities of a Filipino Christian, but \n     there was some question as to whether this individual was put \n     to death solely because of his faith. There appeared to be \n     more substance to a claim of religious motivation for the \n     execution of a Christian charged only with robbery, since \n     that punishment far exceeded the usual penalty for that \n     crime.\n       Aside from the issue of capital punishment, there is no \n     doubt that the religious police in Saudi Arabia are very \n     repressive against Christians. A Mormon U.S. citizen reported \n     a Saudi investigation seventeen years ago arising from prayer \n     meetings in a private home. A dossier, he said, has been \n     maintained by Saudi authorities on participants resulting in \n     a recent deportation of a Mormon found in possession of a \n     religious video.\n       Other U.S. citizens in Riyadh told of Christmas decorations \n     being torn down in hospitals, seizures of personal bibles by \n     Saudi customs officials and prohibition of displaying a \n     Christmas tree in the window of a private home if it could be \n     seen from outside. Another Christian from India told of a \n     Sunday School being ransacked by Saudi religious police with \n     the arrest and detention of a pastor, his wife and \nthree children.\n\n       American soldiers of Jewish faith feel particularly at risk \n     in Saudi Arabia. They change their ``dog tags'' to eliminate \n     any reference to their religion during their tours there. \n     When a rabbi from the Chaplain Corps recently visited U.S. \n     military posts in Saudi Arabia, many Jewish soldiers declined \n     to meet with him.\n       The Saudi answer on the religious questions was identical \n     to their rationale on refusing to allow the FBI to \n     interrogate the Khobar Towers suspects. The only difference \n     was that source of their obstinacy was the Koran instead of \n     national sovereignty. Nevertheless, l believe the Saudi \n     attitude on religious bias can be changed at least to some \n     extent in the face of sufficient U.S. and world persuasion \n     and pressure.\n       On September 12, 1997, Prince Sultan reportedly made a \n     commitment to the Pope that Christians would be permitted to \n     pray together in the solitude of their homes. Even that \n     remains to be seen. Prince Turki claimed that Saudi policy \n     did not preclude people from bringing bibles for their own \n     personal use through customs; but, he said, zealous customs \n     bureaucrats often act on their own in confiscating these \n     items.\n       From my discussions with foreign leaders and with religious \n     minorities, it was clear that just the introduction of the \n     Specter-Wolf bill has had an effect on foreign repressive \n     practices. My friend, the Special Advisor to President \n     Mubarak, Osama el-Baz, came to see me in my Senate office \n     before my trip to ask that Egypt not be included among \n     countries which persecuted Christians. Also, fifty-three \n     Egyptian Christians recently publicized a letter saying, in \n     effect, the U.S. should mind its own business even though \n     they acknowledged that ``there are certain annoyances that \n     [Christians] in Egypt suffer from.''\n       Egyptian evangelicals were not as restrained. They cited \n     cases of eight and nine months in jail for Muslims who sought \n     conversion to Christianity. One scholar produced statistics \n     showing 1624 people were killed by religious violence in \n     Egypt from l990 through 1992 including the deaths of 133 \n     Christians. Evangelicals in both Egypt and Ethiopia also \n     complained about the long time it took to secure official \n     permission to build churches, a snag that, in effect, stymied \n     their religious activity.\n       Since the State Department advised against visiting Sudan, \n     we sought information on that country's practices in the \n     neighboring countries of Eritrea and Ethiopia. Eritrean \n     Christians confirmed claims of Sudanese children being sold \n     into slavery. They attributed it to profiteering by the \n     militia as part of the booty of war. One Eritrean Christian \n     commented on Sudanese governmental action in closing churches \n     in 1997.\n       Our Christian, Jewish and Moslem interlocutors in Saudi \n     Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia and Eritrea were particularly pleased \n     that the U.S. Congress was considering the issue. An Egyptian \n     Muslim almost withdrew his objection to the Specter-Wolf bill \n     when he heard it applied to other nations and had no \n     sanctions against Egypt on U.S. foreign aid. Archbishop \n     Silvano Tomasi, Vatican Ambassador to Ethiopia, complimented \n     the proposed legislation for raising the level of dialogue, \n     adding that, if it were enacted with a ``little bite,'' then \n     so much the better.\n       By raising the profile of the religious persecution issue \n     in the current discourse of foreign policy, Congress has been \n     able to make some progress on advancing the cause of \n     religious freedom abroad. Still, many problems remain. For \n     this reason, Congressman Wolf and I will continue to pursue \n     our bill toward the goal of putting teeth in our country's \n     longstanding policy against foreign religious persecution.\n\n\n                  MAGNETIC LEVITATION TRAIN TECHNOLOGY\n\n       On my way back to Washington, I stopped in Lathen, Germany, \n     to announce the completion of an agreement to bring German \n     high-speed magnetic levitation (``maglev'') train technology \n     to Pennsylvania. I took a demonstration ride on the maglev \n     train, which is capable of speeds as high as 310 miles per \n     hour.\n       This is something I have been working on in the area of \n     Transportation Appropriations for a long time. The maglev \n     train ride would improve the quality of life of all \n     Pennsylvanians who feel they spend too much time in traffic \n     or at congested airports. This technology would also bring \n     Pennsylvania's steel industry roaring into the 21st Century \n     because the maglev train uses steel guideways over hundreds \n     of miles.\n       The train went a little over 250 miles per hour and it was \n     exhilarating to be in a kind of mass transit which goes so \n     fast, a little like Buck Rogers. It would be tremendous for \n     Pennsylvania and a tremendous boon to the economy of every \n     stop along the line from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, such as \n     Lancaster, Harrisburg, Lewiston, State College, Altoona, \n     Johnstown, and Greensburg. People could go from Philadelphia \n     to Pittsburgh in one and a half hours non-stop, \n     revolutionizing our transportation system. I look forward to \n     continuing to support this economical, forward-looking \n     technology in the future.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I rise today to make a few, brief \nobservations about the President's budget.\n  Let me say I welcome the fact that President Clinton has come up with \na budget that may finally be balanced in the next fiscal year, although \nI do not agree with the outlines of his plan. The good news is that if \nthe economy stays as strong as expected, we may soon enjoy a unified \nbudget surplus for the first time since 1969.\n  However, Mr. President, again, after a thorough examination of \nPresident Clinton's budget, I must say this is not at all a responsible \nand honest proposal. Here is why:\n  First, President Clinton claims it is his fiscal policies that have \nreduced the federal deficit and brought the budget to the edge of \nbalance. That would be stretching the truth. The productivity of the \nAmerican people has brought us to this point, in spite of what Congress \nhas done or the President's tax-and-spend habits. The truth is, the \nPresident has only been willing to balance the budget, if he is allowed\n\n[[Page S621]]\n\nto use all increases in revenues, plus even higher taxes, to match his \nappetite for spending on expanded programs, new programs, and new \nentitlements.\n  In 1992, candidate Bill Clinton promised he would balance the budget \nif he were elected. When President Clinton arrived at the White House \nin 1993, he abandoned that promise at the front door. The first budget \nhe proposed called for the largest tax increase in history and \nincreased federal spending of more than a trillion dollars in just five \nyears, a jump of 20 percent.\n  In 1995, the President again promised America he could balance the \nbudget, first in ten years, then nine, then eight, and finally, seven. \nHe made a similar balanced-budget promise in 1996. Finally, after \nspending all of the $225 billion revenue windfall ``miraculously'' \ndiscovered by the CBO, President Clinton and the Congressional \nleadership agreed last year to achieve a balanced budget in six years.\n  Mr. President, it is the American economy that produced this \nunprecedented revenue windfall for the federal government, and the \nunexpected dollars have come directly from working Americans--taxes \npaid by corporations, individuals, consumers, and investors. Washington \ndid not do any heavy lifting: the people did. Yet, Washington takes all \nthe credit.\n\n  Second, the Clinton Administration claims that this budget will \nproduce surpluses ``as far as the eye can see.'' Sure, as long as you \nare looking through rose-colored glasses. Such claims are explicitly \nintended to mislead the American people. Mr. President, this projected \nsurplus is only a surplus under a unified budget. Without borrowing \nfrom the Social Security trust funds, the real federal deficit could \nreach $600 billion over five years. The total deficit will reach a \ntrillion in the next decade. This means we will see deficits, not \nsurpluses, as far as the eye can see.\n  In fact, the CBO estimates the possible budget surplus could easily \nturn into a $100 billion deficit. I asked Dr. O'Neill last week what \nthe odds were we would achieve a budget surplus versus ending up with a \ndeficit, and she said it was 50/50. This uncertainty requires us to \nexercise fiscal discipline, not to run off and approve another $123 \nbillion in spending as the President has proposed--money from a surplus \nwe have not seen yet and a tobacco settlement that is only a proposal.\n  I need to stress that a unified balanced budget is an unacceptable \nprospect if it is achieved at the expense of responsible governing. The \ntruth is that the President's budget continues the tax-and-spend \npolicies that have been the hallmark of this Administration. Again, \nafter setting spending limits that in 1997 grew the government three \ntimes faster than inflation, or the incomes of working Americans, the \nPresident wants to blow those spending caps with another $123 billion \nincrease in federal spending. The ink is barely dry on last year's \nbudget agreement, which gave working Americans, or at least a few of \nthem, $90 billion in tax relief, and now the President proposes wiping \nout that tax cut with $115 billion in new taxes--or increases in \nexisting taxes, permits, or fees.\n  The most untruthful thing about this budget is President Clinton's \nrhetoric that the era of big government is over. OMB director Raines \ntestified in the Senate Budget Committee last week that by any \nstandard, big government was indeed over. A $100 billion government 35 \nyears ago is now 18 times larger, at $1.8 trillion. Who is kidding who?\n  If he does not get those new taxes through Congress, the President \nwants to borrow from the Social Security Trust Fund. Mr. President, the \nCongress must not permit the President to finance his spending \nprograms, his big-government solutions, by borrowing from Social \nSecurity.\n  If you count what Senator Gramm calls ``hidden spending'' of $42 \nbillion, actual spending under the President's budget would reach \n$1.775 trillion, a 6.4 percent increase, and a Washington record. And \nit continues to grow from there. In 2003, the President is asking for \n$1.945 trillion in federal spending. Total federal spending for the \nnext five years would reach $9.2 trillion. Annual government spending \nwas $1.4 trillion when Mr. Clinton became president.\n  In five years, the President has already increased government \nspending by 27 percent. Is there any sign of leaner government? No. The \ntruth is that the government is growing bigger and bigger and bigger.\n  Nor does this budget do anything to eliminate wasteful and \nunnecessary Federal programs. It does nothing to make the government \nmore accountable and efficient. It actually increases civilian \nnondefense employment by 9,200. This is big, central government by any \nstandard.\n  Mr. President, as I said on the floor the other day, if this is a \nrace to prove who can be the most ``compassionate'' with the taxpayers' \ndollars, it is a race nobody is going to win, and one the taxpayers \nmost certainly will lose. The truth is simple: you cannot buy \ncompassion.\n  Third, the President claims that he will not bust the spending caps \nset up by last year's budget agreement. Again, this is not true. \nPresident Clinton has not only violated the spirit of the budget deal, \nhe has also in effect broken the statutory spending caps established \nunder the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  Secretary Rubin assured us last week that the President would be \nbound by the budget agreement we reached last year. But by the \nPresident's own estimates, his budget does not meet the statutory caps \non discretionary spending by actually reducing that spending.\n  The offsets proposed in the budget are highly questionable. To stay \nwithin the caps called for by last year's Balanced Budget Act, the \nPresident anticipates the use of $60 billion in tax increases to offset \ndiscretionary spending.\n  By doing so, without amending the law, the budget in effect violates \nthe two separate enforcement measures set up by the 1990 Budget \nEnforcement Act, and it violates the spirit of last year's budget deal.\n  Mr. President, we broke the 1993 statutory spending caps last year, \nand we must never repeat that mistake. The current spending caps must \nstay in place.\n  Fourth, President Clinton claims that his budget will save Social \nSecurity. Again, the President is not being truthful to the American \npeople. On the contrary, his budget does nothing to address our long-\nterm financial imbalances.\n  And his call for increased spending would use all of any surplus, \nleaving nothing for Social Security. In fact, under the unified budget, \nthe President will borrow another trillion dollars from the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund by the year 2012.\n  The President's Medicare proposal in this budget does more harm than \ngood. Although the President has proposed putting the projected budget \nsurplus into the Social Security trust funds, he has no specific plan \nof how to save Social Security.\n  Simply throwing money into the system without real reform will not \npreserve it. President Clinton's own Social Security Commissioner, \nKenneth Apfel, recently said the President's proposal to bail out \nSocial Security could not alone come close to solving the system's \nimpending deficit. It may only extend the fund for two to five years.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed with this budget and troubled \nby its untruthfulness to the American people.\n  Although our short-term fiscal condition has improved in recent \nyears, thanks to what Chairman Greenspan called an ``exceptionally \nhealthy'' economy, our long-term fiscal imbalances still impose a \nthreat to our future.\n  Washington's bills remain astronomic. We have a $5.5 trillion \nnational debt, at least $14 trillion in unfunded liabilities for Social \nSecurity and Medicare, and more than $5 trillion worth of government \ncontingencies. These risks will shatter our economy if we fail to take \naction now.\n  If the President will not step up and take the lead in ensuring \nfiscal responsibility, then Congress must. We must continue to cut \ngovernment spending, shrink the size of the government, and reform \nSocial Security and Medicare to save them.\n  Mr. President, in the next few months, I intend to work with my \ncolleagues and the Administration to exercise the fiscal discipline \nnecessary to ensure the federal budget will be balanced--and stay \nbalanced--without\n\n[[Page S622]]\n\nnew taxes, without new spending, and without borrowing from the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund.\n  That is the responsible thing to do. That is the honest thing to do. \nAnd, Mr. President, that is the right thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

No. 1 is on international trade, and \nthe second one will be on the Massiah-Jackson nomination that is before \nthe Senate.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the submission of S.

MASSIAH-JACKSON, OF PENNSYLVANIA, TO BE U.S. \n        DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the nomination.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments on the \nnomination of Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson to the Federal District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n\n  Recent resistance to her nomination has moved beyond individual \nopponents to wide-spread, bipartisan opposition. We've heard about \nopposition from the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association.\n  Additional opposition comes from a Philadelphia lodge of the \nFraternal Order of Police, as well as the Fraternal Order of Police, \nNational Legislative Program. The F.O.P. has written letters to the \nSenate and the President voicing their concerns over the safety and \nwelfare of the Philadelphia police force if Judge Massiah-Jackson is \nconfirmed. They fear her established record of being extremely lenient \non criminals and her insensitivity to victims of crime will ``pose a \ndirect threat'' against police. Also, the National Association of \nPolice Organizations, which represents more than 4,000 police unions \nand associations and over 220,000 sworn law enforcement officers, \nopposes the confirmation of Judge Massiah-Jackson.\n  If this isn't a strong indication of the problems this nominee's \nconfirmation would cause, I don't know what is.\n  The Northampton County District Attorney has also written a letter to \nthe Senate detailing twelve separate instances illustrating the \nimproper conduct of Judge Massiah-Jackson. The facts on which the \nletter is based were compiled from internal memorandums, court \ntranscripts and other documents from the office of the Philadelphia \nDistrict Attorney's Office. The most egregious example disclosed by the \nletter was a 1988 acquittal of a man charged with possession of two and \na half pounds of cocaine. The acquittal was the second by Judge \nMassiah-Jackson of alleged drug dealers arrested by the same police \nofficers. In open court she told these arresting officers, who were \nworking undercover, to turn around and told the drug dealers and other \nspectators to ``take a good look at the undercover officers and watch \nyourselves.'' The incident was reported in a Philadelphia newspaper \nand, as has been mentioned, the Judiciary Committee has also received \nthe signed statements of Detective Sergeant Daniel Rodriguez and \nDetective Terrance Jones, the officers involved. This conduct not only \nsignificantly reduced the crime fighting effectiveness of the officers, \nbut more importantly, they believed it put their lives in serious \nperil. This is not the type of conduct expected from a Judge, nor can \nit be tolerated.\n  In addition to this letter, the members of the Judiciary Committee \nalso received a letter from Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne \nAbraham, who stands in opposition to this nomination. The opinion of \nMrs. Abraham, who by the way is a Democrat, is particularly relevant \nsince she campaigned with and served on the bench at the same time as \nJudge Massiah-Jackson. Mrs. Abraham concludes that, ``the nominee's \nrecord presents multiple instances of a deeply ingrained and pervasive \nbias against prosecutors and law enforcement officers and, by \nextension, an insensitivity to victims of crime. Moreover, the \nnominee's judicial demeanor and courtroom conduct, in my judgment, \nundermines respect for the rule of law and, instead, tends to bring the \nlaw into disrepute.'' She further notes that, ``this nominee's judicial \nservice is replete with instances of demonstrated leniency towards \ncriminals, an adversarial attitude towards police, and disrespect and a \nhostile attitude towards prosecutors unmatched by any other present or \nformer jurist with whom I am familiar.''\n  These are not the biased opinions of racist or sexist opponents, as \nsome have irresponsibly charged. They are the informed opinions of \nrespected district attorneys and law enforcement officers with personal \nknowledge of the nominee. In fact, District Attorney Abraham has \npublicly said she ``firmly believes the next appointee to the U.S. \nDistrict Court here should be an African-American woman. But that \nappointee should be one of the many eminently well-qualified African-\nAmerican women lawyers in the area, and not Massiah-Jackson.''\n  Despite these fact-based opinions, supporters of the nominee have \nrepeatedly insisted that she should not be judged on a few cases, and \nthat her overall record can be characterized as fair to law enforcement \nand crime victims. They also point out that sentencing statistics show \nshe is right in line with other judges. I must say these arguments are \nmisleading, as demonstrated by the statistics provided to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  In reality, Judge Massiah-Jackson deviated from state sentencing \nguidelines, in favor of criminals, more than twice as often as other \njudges according to statistics compiled by the Pennsylvania Commission \non Sentencing. From 1985 till 1991, Judge Massiah-Jackson sentenced \nbelow the Pennsylvania guidelines 27.5 percent of the time. Other \nPennsylvania judges sentenced below the guidelines in only 12.2 percent \nof the cases. This record cannot be characterized as fair to victims or \nlaw enforcement, and is not in line with other judges. We've also heard \nthe argument that district attorneys regularly disagree with judges. \nWell, Mr. President, in the seventeen years I've been voting on \njudicial nominees, I don't ever recall such local, public opposition as \nwe've seen in this case. This is truly unprecedented.\n  We in the Senate can no longer overlook and excuse a record that is \nclearly against the interests of law enforcement personnel and victims \nof crime, or professional conduct which is below the dignity of a \njudge. No person, of any race or any gender, should be able to serve on \nthe federal bench if she or he demonstrates a bias against police and \nprosecutors, is soft on crime and shows a lack of proper judicial \ntemperament. For these reasons, I will oppose the confirmation of this \nnominee and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S622-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S622-S624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ISTEA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to visit for just a minute the \nissue about the highway bill and roads.\n  I would say to the Senator from Indiana, the Presiding Officer, that \nwhen I was in high school in a small town in North Dakota, I was \nagitating pretty hard to get a car. The way my dad warded me off from \nthis desire to purchase a car was he said I'll let you buy a car \nbecause I have one spotted for you. But he insisted that I would have \nto restore it.\n  Sure enough, my father, who delivered gasoline to rural users, family \nfarmers, with his rural delivery gasoline truck, had been out on a farm \nand he saw a 1924 Ford Model T in a granary. It had been sitting in \nthat granary for many, many years. He said, you know the fellow who \nused to own that farm and put that Model T in there, he lives out of \nState. You should write him a note and see if he would want to sell you \nthat Model T. So I did, and the fellow wrote back and said he would be \nglad to sell me his 1924 Model T Ford. He sold it to me for $25 and \nsent me the original key and original owner's manual.\n  I went out to look at this car I just bought and the rats had eaten \nout all the seat cushions and all the wiring\n\n[[Page S623]]\n\nand all there was was a metal shell with the engine, and no tires, of \ncourse. And so I was the proud owner of a 1924 Model T Ford. That's the \ncar my dad got me for my social life. It wasn't much of a social life \nfor long while, because it takes a long time to restore a Model T Ford. \nAs a matter of fact, I didn't know much about it. I was told, by the \nway, the reason the owner drove it to the granary and put it in that \ngranary for a long, long time was the Model T's are like the old red \nwagon you used to pull when you were a kid. If you turn the wheel in \nfront too far, they would tip over. It's called jackknife. A lot of \npeople don't remember that. But the Model T would jackknife if you \nturned the wheel too sharp. I was told, the fellow who owned it had \nbeen in town drinking and driving home from the bar he thought he saw \nsome chickens in the road so he thought he'd take a sharp left turn and \nhe jackknifed the Model T and it pinned him beneath the Model T and \nhurt him a little bit. He survived, but he parked the Model T in the \ngranary and never drove it again. He was pretty upset, I guess.\n  Then I bought it. Then I had a 1924 Model T Ford to restore and drive \non modern roads, which was really quite an interesting thing to do. It \ndidn't improve my social life, but nonetheless I had a car, an old car \non new roads.\n  One of the interesting things about automobiles in our society is \nthat we have not only seen dramatic changes in our automobiles from the \nfirst Model T I purchased as a young kid, but the infrastructure that \nwe use and that we need for those automobiles and for transportation \nhas also changed dramatically.\n  I am told that a new automobile in this country, manufactured here \ntoday, has more computer power in the automobile than existed in the \nlunar lander that put the first American on the Moon. There were \nbreathtaking changes in manufacturing techniques and the production of \nconsumer products, especially in automobiles. But we also have to \nunderstand that, as a society, that no matter how much we change these \nconsumer products in ways that are really wonderful, we also must \ninvest in infrastructure. So we have, over the years, consistently, \nRepublicans and Democrats, everyone, worked together, from county \ncommissioners to U.S. Senators and mayors and Governors, to decide we \nneed a first-class road system. We have, in part, become a world-class \neconomy because we have a first-class infrastructure and a first-class \ntransportation system.\n  We have before us in the U.S. Congress the need to pass a new highway \nbill. It is not a partisan issue. I don't come to the floor to blame \nanybody for anything. I come to the floor, as have some Republicans and \nsome Democrats, and say it is time now to put the highway bill on the \nfloor and let people who want to offer amendments offer the amendments \nand pass a highway bill so that those people out there who are running \nthe highway programs in the State governments, and those people in the \ncounty commission offices and in the townships and the cities, will \nunderstand how much money is available to build and to repair roads and \nbridges. This plan must be passed by the Congress to allow all of those \nfolks to understand what they can and cannot do; how much is available.\n\n  This morning I stopped to put some gas in my car on the way to work. \nI not only paid for the gasoline, I also paid a tax. That tax is going \nto go from that station that I stopped at to the Government coffers and \nwill be put in a trust fund, and it is going to be used in one way or \nanother, I expect, to build a road or repair a bridge. That's the \npurpose of the gas tax that we have imposed, in order to provide for \nthis infrastructure investment.\n  We have a responsibility now to do last year's work. Some say, ``Gee, \nwe didn't get it done last year. That is somebody else's fault.'' Or \nthey point a number of different ways. ``But now we must wait for next \nyear's budget in order to bring the highway bill to the floor.''\n  We don't need to delay last year's work to deal with next year's \nbudget. It doesn't make any sense to me. Those people who have come to \nthe floor of the Senate on a bipartisan basis and said this Congress is \nmoving at a Model T speed here--this is really glacial speed, at least \nas we have taken off from the blocks. Let us bring something to the \nfloor that we must do and must do soon. Let all those who have \namendments to it offer those amendments, have a debate on the \namendments, and vote so we can do our business.\n  Some say if we do it the other body will not do it anyway. The other \nbody has signaled that it does not intend to take up a highway bill \nuntil the budget is complete this spring.\n  I was on a television program with the chairman of the committee in \nthe other body that deals with this issue. He said that the Speaker has \nindicated he doesn't want this to come up until after the budget \nprocess. I respectfully say to the Speaker, ``That may be your desire, \nbut I don't think that's what the American people desire.'' It's \ncertainly not what I desire. I hope at least those of us in the Senate \ncould pass the bill and send it over to the House and then say to them \nthe American people want this done. Let's put some pressure on them. \nThe best way to apply pressure to get something done is to do our work. \nOur job at this point is to bring the bill to the floor and begin to \ndeal with this bill.\n  I have traveled in various parts of the world at various times. One \nof the interesting things that distinguishes a Third World country or a \ndeveloping country from a developed country or an industrialized \ncountry is its infrastructure. I have been in hotels, the best hotel in \na town, and turned on the tap and have gotten rust and water together \nbecause their infrastructure was terrible. And I have driven from that \ntown in a Jeep, going only 25 or 30 miles an hour because the roads, \nthe main roads, the best roads, are full of holes and ruts that will \ntear up a car's underside if you go faster than that. We all understand \nthat many of those countries have not had the opportunity or the \nresources to develop their infrastructure.\n  In some ways, the inability to develop the infrastructure predicts \nthat they will not become a developed country; that they will remain a \ncountry that is a Third World country. We distinguish ourselves and \nhave become an enormously successful country over a couple of hundred \nyears by our desire to build in this country, to build and create. Part \nof that building and creating is to invest in infrastructure. And part \nof that is to invest in the best road and highway system anywhere.\n  We face some daunting tasks now with respect to bridges and some of \nour roads in this country. They are in desperate need of repair. We \nhave been putting money in a trust fund with which to do that. Yet, in \nmany cases the trust fund hasn't been used because they want to build \nup that money to use it as an offset to make the deficit look different \nthan it should have looked. Or others have other ideas on what to do \nwith the money. The point is, we have a responsibility, all of us \nserving now, to deal with the infrastructure needs of our country now. \nI implore the majority leader and others to consider, as they develop \nthe agenda for this Senate, that, beginning tomorrow or the day after \ntomorrow or next Monday, decide that high on the agenda, at the top of \nthe list, will be for us to do what we must and should do: Pass a \nhighway program that invests in this country's infrastructure.\n\n  Mr. President, I indicated that this is not an issue of partisanship. \nIt is, interestingly enough, every time you get a highway bill to the \nfloor, it is a debate between a group of States that think the formula \nby which we divide the highway moneys is a terrible formula and others \nwho think the formula is a wonderful formula. It depends on who gets \nand who gives. My State, I just would say with respect to the formula, \nas you might think, gets more back than it sends in for the highway \nprogram. So some States would look at my State and say: ``Well, your \nState is a receiving State or a recipient State or a beneficiary'' and \nmy State, somebody else's State, they would say, ``is a donor State. We \nare upset about that.''\n  Without getting into a debate about the formula, I would just say \nthis. We are a State that is 10 times the size of Massachusetts, in \nNorth Dakota. You can put 10 States the size of Massachusetts inside \nthe borders of North Dakota. Yet we have only 640,000 citizens. Those \n640,000 citizens cannot by themselves pay sufficient gas taxes locally\n\n[[Page S624]]\n\nto maintain the roads and bridges necessary in our State, in order to \nmake it a national road system. We cannot do it.\n  In fact, if you measure the burden another way, we in North Dakota \nrank among the highest in the country in per-person payments of Federal \ngas tax. Our burden ranks among the highest in the country. But others \nwant to segregate it out and say, ``Well, you are a recipient State and \nthat is not right.''\n  I say, but we in North Dakota pay for the Coast Guard.\n  We don't mind doing that. I am a taxpayer. My constituents are \ntaxpayers. We pay for the Coast Guard. We don't really have any coast \nto guard. North Dakota is landlocked. We don't mind really doing that. \nThat is the way these things should be done on a national basis.\n  When it comes to investing in highway programs, we feel also that \nthere ought to be a national program to make sure that our country is a \ncountry that is not divided by those areas that have good roads and \nthose that don't, because some can afford it and some can't.\n  Roads and infrastructure represent a national need and a national \npriority, and the satisfaction of that need and priority makes this a \nbetter and a stronger country. I hope that the discussions on the floor \nof the Senate by Senator Byrd, Senator Gramm and Senator Baucus and so \nmany others who are urging that we be allowed on this agenda to \nconsider very, very soon the highway reauthorization bill, I hope those \nurgings will be heard and that we will very soon be on that particular \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, with that, I see a colleague is on the floor.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk a little bit about a \nparochial issue that is peculiar to Wyoming, but it is one that is \ntroublesome. It has to do with the Jackson Hole Airport. I am rising to \nexpress my frustration regarding the Federal Aviation Administration \n(FAA) and its lack of action with respect to an environmental \nassessment (EA) regarding safety issues at the Jackson Hole Airport.\n  Let me explain why the issue is so important to us in Wyoming. \nJackson Hole is the busiest airport in Wyoming. It is the only \ncommercial service airport in the country that is located within a \nnational park, Grand Teton National Park. As a consequence, of course, \nthe FAA and the Park Service are very careful about making safety or \nother improvements at this facility. And they should be. As chairman of \nthe Senate subcommittee on national parks, I agree that all of the \nproposals for changes at the Jackson Hole Airport ought to be carefully \nexamined. You won't find a bigger advocate for our national parks in \nthe U.S. Senate than me. However, there are some significant safety \nissues that must be addressed quickly.\n  Between 1984 and 1992, the airport had more ``runway excursions,'' \nwhich is a nice way of saying they ran off the end of the runway, than \nany other airport in the country. This includes a broad range of \naircraft, from general aviation and small commuters, to large aircraft \nsuch as 757s.\n  Since 1992, there have been seven additional runway ``incidents'' \nthat have occurred.\n  In response to these problems, the Jackson Hole Airport board began \nan environmental assessment in 1992. All the interested parties, \nincluding the Park Service and the FAA were at the table. In fact, in \n1993, I wrote Transportation Secretary Pena asking for interagency \ncooperation on this important issue, including the National Park \nService, the Interior Department, the FAA, and the Department of \nTransportation. I wrote that letter in order to avoid the kind of \nsituation that we have now.\n  In April of 1997, the airport board finally completed the assessment, \nafter 5 years, and submitted it to the FAA. The results of the \nenvironmental assessment appeared to be very reasonable.\n  It would bring the runways into compliance with current FAA runway \nstandards. That makes sense.\n  It would improve safety without increasing the length of the runways, \nwhich is very important. There is opposition by some to making the \nrunways longer because they are in the park. And there is some \nopposition to making them longer because that could accommodate bigger \nairplanes, and some people are not anxious to see that happen.\n  It would not result in any significant noise increase. In fact, I am \ntold that the newer airplanes are less intrusive with noise perhaps \nthan the older ones.\n  If, in fact, these statements are correct--and they appear to be--\nthen why is the proposal being delayed? The FAA has been unresponsive \nand uncooperative with my office on this matter.\n  In December of 1997, 8 months after the completion of the study, the \nFAA still had not acted on the environment assessment. I wrote the \nagency asking it to expedite its consideration of this matter and I ask \nunanimous consent to have it printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter is ordered to be printed in the \nREcord, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 4, 1997.\n     Jane F. Garvey,\n     Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Administrator Garvey: We write to request that you \n     expedite action on the Final Environmental Assessment (EA) \n     submitted by the Jackson Hole Airport Board in April of this \n     year. Prompt action by the Federal Aviation Administration \n     (FAA) is vital to maintaining safe air travel to and from \n     Jackson Hole Airport.\n       As you may know, the Jackson Hole Airport enplanes more \n     passengers than any other in our State and provides an \n     essential transportation link to the northwest area of \n     Wyoming. In addition, between 1984 and 1992, the Jackson Hole \n     Airport had more ``runway excursions'' than any other air \n     carrier airport in the United States. Both you and Secretary \n     of Transportation Slater have emphatically stated that safety \n     is the top priority of this administration. We agree that the \n     traveling public's safety is vital and consequently ask that \n     you expedite the consideration of this plan.\n       In the fall of 1993, the Wyoming Congressional Delegation \n     requested inter-agency cooperation in the preparation of an \n     Environmental Assessment of Master Plan Alternatives to \n     enhance the safety and efficiency of the Jackson Hole \n     Airport. The Delegation was assured by then Secretary of \n     Transportation Federico Pena that the FAA would work toward \n     the development of a responsible and ``timely'' airport plan. \n     We are asking you to keep that commitment, particularly \n     because seven months have passed since the Final EA was sent \n     to the FAA for review.\n       The EA describes a preferred alternative designed to \n     contain these runway excursions on pavement without actually \n     extending the runway or expanding Airport boundaries. Unless \n     action is taken quickly, runway safety improvements in the \n     preferred alternative will be delayed until 1999. In fact, \n     since the environmental assessment process began in 1992, \n     seven additional runway accidents have occurred.\n       The concern the delegation expressed over four years ago \n     remains: that timely action to be taken so that runway safety \n     improvements at the Jackson Hole Airport will not be unduly \n     delayed. If the FAA's record of decision on the Final EA will \n     not be issued by January 1, 1998, we request that you inform \n     us as to the reasons for the delay and when a decision should \n     be expected.\n           Sincerely,\n     Craig Thomas,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Michael Enzi,\n\n[[Page S625]]\n\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Barbara Cubin,\n     Member of Congress.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I still have not received an answer to my letter from the \nFAA. The letter was sent in early December of 1997. All the letter \nasked was for a date by which we could expect a decision. I didn't ask \nfor a decision, I didn't urge a certain outcome, just the date.\n  I called the FAA Administrator several weeks ago and though she said \nshe would check into it I have heard nothing from her or her staff. For \nan agency that claims safety as its No. 1 priority, these delays are \nhard to understand.\n  This assessment is not an effort to expand the airport. There won't \nbe longer runways, bigger airplanes or more flights. It is about \nsafety, safety for everyone flying in and out of this airport. Time is \nof the essence--there is a short construction period, as you might \nimagine, in Jackson Hole, WY. The FAA needs to come to a decision \nquickly or these safety improvements will be delayed for yet another \nyear.\n  Mr. President, I guess I have to admit that I am simply expressing my \nfrustration with this situation. The FAA's primary responsibility is \nsafety. The Jackson Hole Airport presents an opportunity to deal with \nan important safety issue and we've received no response from the FAA. \nI, therefore, intend to be rather critical of the FAA until it decides \nto act and comes to a conclusion. This process has gone long enough. \nThe FAA needs to move forward now.\n  I typically am not anxious to come to the floor of the Senate and \ngrumble about a federal agency, but I think this is something that \nneeds to be grumbled about, and therefore I am here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S624-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S625-S628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INDEPENDENT COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI.

I therefore \n     respectfully request that you conduct a formal inquiry of \n     Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to determine whether he \n     should be removed or disciplined for repeated failures to \n     report and avoid conflicts of interest pursuant to the powers \n     vested in the Attorney General by the Ethics in Government \n     Act (``The Act''), 28 U.S.C. Sec. 591, et seq.\n       Recent events involving the Independent Counsel's probe are \n     further evidence of Mr. Starr's entanglements that cast a \n     cloud over his ability to conduct an investigation \n     objectively. Over the course of his entire investigation, Mr. \n     Starr, in his continuing work as a partner at the law firm of \n     Kirkland & Ellis and as Independent Counsel, has embraced \n     (and been embraced by) persons and interests that seek to \n     undermine the President as part of their political agenda. He \n     has continually turned a blind eye to his own conflicts of \n     interest at his law firm, to the conflicts engendered by the \n     actions of his clients, and to benefactors that seek to \n     discredit the President for partisan political gain. A person \n     of Mr. Starr's numerous conflicts of interest cannot carry \n     out the even-handed and fair-minded, independent \n     investigation contemplated by the Act. Moreover, the evidence \n     that has surfaced thus far regarding the expansion of Mr. \n     Starr's jurisdiction into these matters raises serious \n     concerns about the OIC's collusion with the Paula Jones legal \n     team in an effort to unfairly and illegally trap the \n     President.\n       This possible misconduct demands an immediate investigation \n     by the Department to determine if Mr. Starr remains \n     sufficiently ``independent'' to continue to serve in his \n     current position.\n\n\n   i. the ethics in government act requires the attorney general to \n       investigate alleged misconduct of the independent counsel\n\n       The Independent Counsel statute provides the Attorney \n     General with jurisdiction to investigate alleged misconduct, \n     conflict of interest and other improprieties that would \n     render an Independent Counsel unfit to remain in office. \n     Specifically, under the statute, the Attorney General may \n     remove an Independent Counsel ``for good cause, physical \n     disability, or other condition that substantially impairs the \n     performance of such independent counsel's duties.'' 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 596. The Supreme Court has suggested that a finding of \n     ``misconduct'' would most assuredly constitute ``good cause'' \n     under Section 596, and that ``good cause'' may impose no \n     greater threshold than that required to remove officers of \n     ``independent agencies.'' Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, \n     692, n. 32 (1988).\n       The Attorney General's removal authority and the \n     concomitant authority to investigate the independent counsel \n     to determine if there are grounds for removal are essential \n     to the continuing constitutional vitality of the Act. Indeed, \n     the Supreme Court's holding that the Act did not violate \n     separation of powers principles rested largely on the power \n     reserved to the Attorney General to remove the independent \n     counsel for ``good cause.'' Specifically, the court found \n     that the Attorney General's removal power rendered the \n     independent counsel an ``inferior officer,'' as required by \n     the Constitution, 487 U.S. at 671, and that such authority \n     ensured that undue powers had not been transferred to the \n     judicial branch under the Act. 487 U.S. at 656. Thus, \n     Morrison teaches that not only is the Attorney General \n     authorized to determine whether there are reasons to remove \n     the independent counsel, but that the Attorney General is \n     constitutionally obliged to do so.\n       In addition, the Act expressly obligates the Independent \n     Counsel to follow, to the fullest extent possible, the \n     standards of conduct prescribed by the Department of Justice. \n     See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 594(f) (An Independent Counsel ``shall, \n     except to the extent that to do so would be inconsistent with \n     the purposes of this chapter, comply with the written and \n     other established policies of the Department of Justice \n     respecting enforcement of the criminal laws''). Accordingly, \n     independent of your removal authority, the Department's \n     Office of Professional Responsibility (``OPR'') has \n     jurisdiction to investigate allegations of misconduct by the \n     Independent Counsel and his staff or potential conflicts of \n     interest that would disqualify him from serving as \n     independent counsel. See Department of Justice Manual (``DOJ \n     Manual''), Section 1-2112 (Supp. 1990) (Office of \n     Professional Responsibility ``oversees investigation of \n     allegations of misconduct by Department employees''). Against \n     the backdrop of this clear constitutional and statutory \n     mandate, I request that you initiate a formal inquiry into \n     the following matters.\n\n\n   II. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: MR. STARR HAS CONSISTENTLY IGNORED THE \n    CONFLICTS RELATED TO HIS WORK, HIS CLIENTS, AND HIS BENEFACTORS\n\n       Mr. Starr's decision not to devote his full attention to \n     his obligations as Independent Counsel in a matter involving \n     the President of the United States has made inevitable the \n     ensuing appearances of impropriety and actual conflicts of \n     interest. His own ethics consultant, Samuel Dash, formerly \n     Chief Counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee, noted that \n     Starr's decision to continue representing private clients \n     while investigating the President has ``an odor to it.'' \n     ``How Independent is the Counsel,'' The New Yorker, April 22, \n     1996. The seriousness of these conflicts (and the odor) is \n     evident by the direct involvement that his clients and others \n     to whom he is financially dependent have assumed in Mr. \n     Starr's investigation.\n       The Act makes clear that during an Independent Counsel's \n     Tenure, neither the counsel, nor any person in a law firm \n     that the counsel is associated with ``may represent in any \n     matter any person involved in any investigation or \n     prosecution under this chapter.'' 28 U.S.C. Sec. 594(j)(l)(i) \n     and (ii). Mr. Starr, however, has violated both the spirit \n     and letter of the statute through his own work and work of \n     his law firm, as well as the actions of his clients and \n     future benefactors.\n\n A. The Expansion of the Investigation Into Matters In The Paula Jones \n Case Places Mr. Staff In Violation Of the Act's Conflict of Interest \n                               Provisions\n\n       Mr. Starr, as a partner at the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis \n     and just prior to his appointment as Independent Counsel, \n     actually provided legal advice in connection with the Paula \n     Jones litigation. ``Mr. Starr's Conflicts,'' New York Times, \n     March 31, 1996. While the fact that he has been involved with \n     that litigation prior to becoming Independent Counsel \n     certainly gave his appointment the appearance of impropriety \n     in violation of the spirit of the Act, now that his \n     investigation has fully inserted itself into the Paula Jones \n     matter, concerns about his former representation certainly \n     are magnified and call into question his role as an \n     ``independent'' counsel in Paula Jones-related matters.\n       Of far greater gravity are the press reports and other \n     information suggesting past and present representation by \n     Kirkland & Ellis of other individuals connected to the Paula \n     Jones civil litigation. See ``More Subpoenas and Angry Talk \n     in Starr's Probe,'' Chicago Tribune, January 31, 1998; \n     ``Starr Furor Lands at Firm's Door,'' Legal Times, February \n     9, 1998. Mr. Starr's potential breach of his duty to inform \n     you of any association between his firm and persons involved \n     in the Paula Jones matter, as well as the possible breach of \n     the Act's statutory conflict of interest standards, should be \n     the subject of investigation. Evidence that is discovered as \n     the result of the current subpoena directed to Kirkland & \n     Ellis for Paula Jones-related documents will undoubtedly shed \n     light on whether Mr. Starr is in violation of the conflict of \n     interest standards under the Act.\n\n[[Page S626]]\n\n     Chicago Tribune, January 31, 1998. Kirkland & Ellis's \n     reported opposition to the subpoena is a significant \n     indication of a violation of the Act. ``Chicago lawyer's role \n     in Jones suite examined,'' Chicago Tribune, February 11, \n     1998. The firm's internal investigation apparently uncovered \n     work done by one of its partners on Jones-related matters. \n     This discovery subsequently was confirmed by one of Ms. \n     Jones' former lawyers. Id. If, in fact, Mr. Starr failed \n     to report the association of his law firm and such a \n     conflict exists, that would undoubtably be grounds for his \n     removal.\n       Mr. Starr, unfortunately, has failed in the past to report \n     such direct conflicts of interest. While he was investigating \n     the Resolution Trust Corporation and its supervision of \n     Madison Guaranty, Kirkland & Ellis was being sued by the RTC \n     for misconduct. ``Who Judges Prosecutor's Ethics? He does,'' \n     Newsday, January 30, 1998. Despite his membership on the \n     firm's management committee, Mr. Starr professed ignorance of \n     the suit in which the RTC sued Kirkland & Ellis for one \n     million dollars. The New Yorker, P. 63. Mr. Starr's lip-\n     service to his ethical obligations without any apparent \n     willingness to address the conflict of interest issues that \n     have arisen demands that the Attorney General conduct an \n     investigation to determine whether he should be removed.\n\n   B. Mr. Starr's Client, The Bradley Foundation, Has Been Active In \n Efforts To Discredit The President In Matters Directly Affecting The \n                             Investigation\n\n       The ties of Mr. Starr and his firm to persons and interest \n     groups adverse to the President are not limited to the Paula \n     Jones case. Indeed, in addition to his own personal \n     involvement with the Paula Jones case, Mr. Starr represented \n     the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation in an effort to uphold \n     Wisconsin's experimental school-choice program after he was \n     appointed Independent Counsel. The New Yorker, April 22, \n     1996, p. 59. Mr. Starr's position in that case was in direct \n     opposition to the Administration. In addition to retaining \n     Mr. Starr, the Bradley Foundation gives money to the \n     President's ``most virulent critics,'' including the American \n     Spectator, a publication obsessed with impugning the \n     character of the President and First Lady, as well as the \n     Landmark Legal Foundation and National Empowerment \n     Television. Id.\n       The Bradley Foundation acknowledged freely that Mr. Starr's \n     role was based in significant part on his long-standing \n     ideological beliefs. Id. At 60. One noted ethics expert \n     concluded that it was ``unwise for Starr to take Bradley \n     money, given Bradley's funding of beneficiaries who are \n     ideological enemies of the president he is investigating.'' \n     ``Gov. Hires Ken Starr To Defend Plan,'' The National Law \n     Journal, December 18, 1995, p. A5. In these instances where \n     his private client is engaged in a highly politicized, \n     personalized and acrimonious public policy debate with the \n     President, Mr. Starr cannot possibly operate as an impartial \n     investigator. This is particularly true when his private \n     client is funding efforts devoted to publicizing Mr. Starr's \n     investigation and related matters in an attempt to discredit \n     the President and his political agenda.\n\n  C. Mr. Scaife, Mr. Starr's Benefactor At Pepperdine, Has Funded The \n   ``Arkansas Project''--A Clandestine Effort To Attack The President\n\n       The question whether Mr. Starr labors under a conflict of \n     interest in light of his ongoing relationship with Pepperdine \n     University and Richard Scaife, a well-documented political \n     opponent of the President's, was prompted by reports that \n     Mr. Scaife has underwritten the faculty position that \n     waits for Mr. Starr at Pepperdine University upon the \n     expiration of his tenure as Independent Counsel. \n     Washington Post, ``Starr Warriors,'' February 3, 1989. \n     According to recent media reports, Mr. Scaife and his tax-\n     exempt foundations are at the center of a secretive \n     operation, coordinated with the American Spectator, called \n     the ``Arkansas Project.'' See New York Observer, ``Richard \n     Scaife Paid for Dirt on Clinton in Arkansas Project,'' \n     February 4, 1998.\n       The ``Arkansas Project'' reportedly involved Mr. Scaife \n     funneling more than $2.4 million from his tax-exempt \n     501(c)(3) foundations to the American Spectator over the last \n     four years ``to pay former F.B.I. agents and private \n     detectives to unearth negative material on the Clintons and \n     their associates.'' Id. Indeed, the project apparently paid \n     former state trooper L.D. Brown--the source of a number of \n     allegations against the President investigated by the Office \n     of Independent Counsel--as a ``researcher.'' Id. Mr. Starr's \n     apparent failure to inquire into the financial motivations \n     that may have prompted these allegations makes his \n     investigation a ``patsy'' for the Arkansas Project, if not \n     actually complicit in its goal to undermine the President.\n       Even more troubling, David Hale, Mr. Starr's alleged chief \n     witness against the President, is linked to Mr. Scaife. The \n     Arkansas Project was apparently run by Stephen Boynton, a \n     Virginia lawyer and close friend of David Hale, the convicted \n     felon that Mr. Starr considers his prize witness against the \n     President. Recently, after his office argued to reduce Mr. \n     Hale's 28 month sentence to time served, abated his $10,000 \n     fine and asked the court to vacate the order that Mr. Hale \n     provide restitution of $2 million for defrauding the Small \n     Business Administration. Mr. Starr praised Mr. Hale saying \n     ``This [investigation] would be over if everyone had been as \n     cooperative as David Hale, had told the truth.'' Federal News \n     Service, February 6, 1998. Mr. Hale's previous record, \n     however, involved lying to a federal judge at his sentencing. \n     ``The Real Blood Sport: the Whitewater Scandal Machine,'' \n     Washington Monthly, May 1, 1996. Fortunately for Mr. Hale, \n     his personal attorney is Theodore Olson, a board member of \n     the American Spectator Education Foundation, Inc., and former \n     law partner of Mr. Starr. Id.\n       The only conclusion is that Mr. Starr is inextricably \n     intertwined with persons whose primary objective appears to \n     be to discredit the President. While these allegations have \n     previously been brought to the Department's attention, Mr. \n     Starr's relationship with Mr. Scaife and others in the \n     Arkansas Project combined with the information about the \n     extent of Mr. Scaife's extraordinary expenditure of resources \n     (in apparent violation of federal tax law) to discredit the \n     President in parallel with Mr. Starr's investigation \n     seriously undermine any contention that Mr. Starr is without \n     a conflict of interest.\n\n\n  iii. evidence of oic collusion with paula jones legal team warrants \n                            further inquiry\n\n       The sequence of events leading up to the President's \n     deposition and certain media accounts raises serious concerns \n     that the OIC coordinated its investigation with the Paula \n     Jones legal team and, in fact, may have played a role in the \n     preparation of questions for the President's deposition. \n     Such collusion, even if indirect, would constitute \n     misconduct of the highest order and provides grounds for \n     Mr. Starr's removal.\n       As you may be aware, press reports indicated that on \n     January 12, 1998, Ms. Tripp contacted the OIC and provided \n     them with tapes of conversations that she had unlawfully \n     captured between herself and Ms. Lewinsky, Time, February 9, \n     1998. Then, the next day, January 13, the OIC equipped Ms. \n     Tripp with a wire and taped a conversation between herself \n     and Ms. Lewinsky. On January 16, Ms. Tripp again lured Ms. \n     Lewinsky into a meeting with her. At that time, she was \n     approached by FBI agents and OIC prosecutors. Id. According \n     to press reports, she was held for several hours, threatened \n     with prosecution and offered immunity if she agreed to a \n     debriefing at that time. Id. According to her current \n     attorney, the immunity offer was contingent upon her \n     agreement not to contact her attorney in the Paula Jones \n     matter, Frank Carter. Time, February 16, 1998. That same day, \n     the Special Division (the court empowered to appoint an \n     independent counsel) expanded Mr. Starr's jurisdictional \n     mandate to cover the allegations related to Ms. Lewinsky.\n       Simply, the timing of events leading up to the President's \n     deposition provides substantial reason to be concerned about \n     possible coordination between the OIC and the Paula Jones \n     team. But there is more. According to media reports, Ms. \n     Tripp briefed the Jones legal team not only on the \n     conversations that she recorded, but also on the OIC-directed \n     monitoring of her conversation with Ms. Lewinsky. Wall Street \n     Journal, February 9, 1998. This draws the OIC one step closer \n     to the Jones civil litigation efforts. Moreover, the OIC's \n     delay in seeking approval to expand its jurisdiction further \n     heightens concerns over the OIC's coordination with the \n     plaintiffs in the Paula Jones matter. Specifically, in \n     seeking immediate approval of his expanded jurisdiction, Mr. \n     Starr apparently expressed concern that impending press \n     reports would scuttle his efforts to obtain evidence against \n     Mr. Vernon Jordan and perhaps the President. See Washington \n     Post, January 31, 1998. But it appears that Mr. Starr knew \n     about the impending press coverage well before he brought the \n     new allegations to your attention. His delay may be \n     suggestive of an effort to maintain the secrecy of the new \n     allegations until after the deposition of the President.\n       The alleged entanglement of the OIC with persons or \n     organizations singularly devoted to the demise of the \n     President implicate bedrock constitutional principles of due \n     process and fair play. Indeed, ``[f]undamental fairness is a \n     core component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \n     Amendment.'' United States v. Barger, 931 F.2nd 359 (6th Cir. \n     1991); United States v. Brown, 635 F.2d 1207, 1212 (6th Cir. \n     1980). Any collusion between the OIC and the Paula Jones \n     legal team, for example, casts serious doubt on the propriety \n     of any investigation into the President's alleged statements \n     regarding Ms. Lewinsky during his civil deposition. \n     Specifically, the government may not, consistent with due \n     process, deliberately use a judicial proceeding for ``the \n     primary purpose of obtaining testimony from [a witness] in \n     order to prosecute him late for perjury.'' United States v. \n     Chen, 933 F.Supp 1264, 1268 (D.N.J. 1986).\n       There is little doubt that a primary purpose of the \n     deposition questions regarding Ms. Lewinsky was to trick the \n     President. In fact, press reports make clear that ``the goal \n     of the Jones' team was to catch Mr. Clinton in a lie . . . \n     Their detailed questions went well beyond simply whether \n     there was a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and into \n     other matters that could be independently verified.'' Wall \n     Street Journal, February 9, 1998. Given that, as noted above, \n     Linda Tripp was feeding information to the Paula Jones' \n     lawyers about her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky, including \n     the conversation recorded by the FBI, see Wall Street \n     Journal, February 9, 1998, there is reason to suspect that \n     the OIC may have assisted or played a role in the formation \n     of questions asked by\n\n[[Page S627]]\n\n     Ms. Jones lawyers regarding Ms. Lewinsky. In addition, the \n     evidence suggests that Mr. Starr deliberately delayed seeking \n     your approval to expand his jurisdiction for improper \n     purposes. Specifically, the delay appears to have been a \n     calculated effort to conceal his expanded authority from the \n     President prior to the deposition. Such conduct raises the \n     specter that an unlawful ``trap'' may have been laid against \n     the President.\n       In a similar vein, if the OIC was in fact assisting the \n     Paula Jones legal team in any capacity, such conduct may also \n     be inconsistent with the due process protections that \n     preclude the government from using civil discovery to obtain \n     information for a contemplated criminal action. See e.g. \n     United States v. Nebel, 856 F. Supp. 392 (M.D. Tenn. 1993). \n     In light of fundamental constitutional concerns implicated by \n     the Independent Counsel's conduct, justice demands that you \n     initiate an inquiry to ensure that the Independent Counsel's \n     investigation has comported with basic rules of fairness and \n     decency. The President, as do others in this investigation, \n     deserves the same protections that shield all other Americans \n     from arbitrary and unlawful government conduct. Indeed, \n     particularly where, as here, a prosecutor has been given \n     virtually unfettered authority to investigate almost every \n     dimension of a person's life, we must be particularly \n     vigilant in guarding against abuses of that authority. You \n     thus have both a statutory and constitutional obligation to \n     determine whether the Independent Counsel has acted properly \n     in investigating the President.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Robert G. Torricelli,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I want to make myself clear at the \noutset. I rise today with no portfolio for President Clinton. I do not \npretend to know the details of either the Whitewater case or matters \npertaining to Paula Jones, with a series of other legal issues now, \ninvolving the Office of Independent Counsel, the Justice Department and \nPresident Clinton's private attorneys. Those issues are not my purpose \ntoday.\n  Like most Americans, I have watched events of recent weeks with some \ncuriosity and with a deep sense of regret. I rise today for a different \npurpose. I want to talk about justice--not the justice of the \nindividual in these cases but the administration of justice by the \nGovernment itself. I do so from the perspective of a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, recognizing that under the Ethics in Government \nAct it is the responsibility of the Attorney General to investigate \nalleged misconduct, conflicts of interest and other improprieties of \nthe Office of Independent Counsel. This institution, through the \nJudiciary Committee, has a responsibility of oversight, both of the \nOffice of Independent Counsel and the Attorney General herself as she \nimplements the act.\n  My purpose, then, in this capacity, is to review a series of legal \nand ethical issues that pose a challenge to the integrity of the Office \nof Independent Counsel and whether or not it is being administered and \nthe responsibility of the Attorney General to oversee its activities.\n  Within recent days, we have learned details of a series of deliberate \nleaks of grand jury material--not on a few occasions, not on one or two \nitems, but virtually volumes of material impugning the character of \nindividuals--that may undermine aspects of the investigation. Some of \nthese leaks have been characterized as unfortunate. Some, perhaps, \ninevitable, as part of the process. They may be these things. But they \nare also something else. They represent a Federal felony. It is against \nthe law. In this case, a potential violation of the law by members of \nthe Justice Department or in their employment themselves.\n  David Kendall, President Clinton's lawyer, has detailed some of these \nleaks in a 15-page correspondence, virtually identifying volumes of \nmaterial where some of the most reputable publications in America--\nincluding the New York Times, the Washington Post --indicate that this \nmaterial comes from ``sources in Starr's office;'' ``Starr's \ninvestigators expect;'' ``sources familiar with the probe''--hardly \nmasking the Government prosecutor's contravention of Federal statutes, \npunishable both by fines and jail terms, for leaking grand jury \nmaterial.\n  I believe that the standard for such abuse was set by former Attorney \nGeneral Thornburgh who, in the matter of Congressman Gray and the \nleaking of grand jury material, required that his associates, those \nfamiliar with grand jury material, were not simply investigated but \npolygraphed, with a clear or implied threat that any failure to comply \nor to pass the polygraph would mean their immediate dismissal.\n  Indeed, as much of America has heard about the grand jury leaks, it \nhas tended to mask several other perhaps more serious ethical problems \nthat must also be addressed by the Attorney General and are outlined in \nmy correspondence being sent to the Attorney General on this date.\n  Just prior to his appointment as independent counsel, Mr. Starr was \nretained by the Independent Women's Forum to write an amicus brief in \nthe matter of the civil complaint being brought by Paula Jones. The \nIndependent Women's Forum is funded by a Richard Scaife of \nPennsylvania. In the furtherance of these responsibilities it is not \nclear how much or whether, indeed, Mr. Starr was compensated, but it is \nclear that his firm and he were engaged in this activity, including \nresearching a brief, contacting those attorneys, then representing \nPaula Jones. They were actively engaged.\n  Reports as recent as 3 months ago indicate that individuals at Mr. \nStarr's firm with whom Mr. Starr is still associated have continued to \nassist Paula Jones in her legal defense team. This morning in the \nChicago Tribune it is further alleged by that publication that Mr. \nStarr's firm--where this financial relationship continues between Mr. \nStarr and his partners--has continued to provide assistance to Paula \nJones' defense team, even while the investigation of President Clinton \nunder the authority of the Attorney General was expanded to include \nmatters relating to the civil complaint by Paula Jones.\n\n  Mr. President, the Office of Professional Responsibility, under the \ndirection of Attorney General Reno, needs to review these serious \nlapses of ethical conduct and these transparent conflicts of interest. \nIt is left with little or no choice. If there is to be any confidence \nin the administration of the Office of Independent Counsel, and if the \nAmerican people are to believe the result of this investigation and \nwhatever recommendations result, the Office of Professional \nResponsibility will need to definitively establish whether, indeed, \nthere are conflicts of interest, as are being alleged.\n  Indeed, I know of no authority in the canons of ethics of the \nprofession, the operating procedures and rules of ethics of the Justice \nDepartment, that would permit an attorney in any capacity, no less an \nOffice of Independent Counsel, investigating any American, no less the \nPresident of the United States, to operate with ethical standards that \nallow he or his associates within a single case dealing with the same \nlitigants to do work for such clearly conflicting interests.\n  Third, while serving as independent counsel for the Government, Mr. \nStarr's law firm has received and continues to receive retainers and \nlegal payments from corporations, including Philip Morris and Brown & \nWilliamson, potentially of millions of dollars, that not only have an \ninterest but an extraordinary financial interest in the defeat of \nPresident Clinton's initiatives and whose interests are directly \nimpacted by his political viability.\n  Mr. Starr's continuing to draw income, a year ago in excess of $1 \nmillion in personal compensation, while in the employment of the U.S. \nGovernment to investigate matters relating to President Clinton, is not \nonly unsound judgment but as clear a conflict of interest between those \nof the private attorneys, the private parties that he has sworn to \ndefend and the interests of the U.S. Government that he has similarly \nsworn to pursue. Both cannot be his master.\n  Attorney General Reno is left with the question of what other \ninterests have continued to pay compensation to Mr. Starr, what other \nclients and what kind of judgment has been exercised.\n  Making this all the more urgent, indeed feeding suspicion, is a \nfourth point that in some ways may be the most troubling. Richard \nScaife, who earlier in this affair was funding research into the Paula \nJones case, appears again as a part of Mr. Starr's performance of his \nresponsibilities. Mr. Scaife has provided $600,000 per year, \napproximately $2.5 million, to fund something that is known as the \nArkansas project. The Arkansas project is a tax free 501(c)3 \norganization under the Tax Code of the United States. It indeed has \nfunded this money through the American Spectator magazine.\n\n[[Page S628]]\n\n  The purpose, apparently as outlined in an article in the New York \nObserver, written by Joe Conason last week, has resulted in the \nestablishment of a relationship with David Hale, the principal witness \nused by Mr. Starr against President Clinton, in the Whitewater case and \na State trooper, former State Arkansas Trooper L.D. Brown. It appears \nthat the American Spectator established a relationship of unknown \nfinancial or other reward to secure the cooperation of each individual \nin the writing of the articles.\n  The changing of the testimony of these witnesses, critical to Mr. \nStarr's work, and when those changes occurred and their relationship \nwith the Arkansas project, becomes an important matter for the Justice \nDepartment. It would appear on its face that is at least reason to \nexplore whether the improper use of tax-free foundation funding through \nthis publication with the intention of influencing potential Federal \nwitnesses did not constitute Federal witness tampering. It is, however, \nan issue that must immediately be established.\n  As a part of this aspect of the case requiring investigation, as Mr. \nHale's legal representation by one Theodore Olson, who seemed to have \nguided Mr. Hale in his testimony in the Whitewater affair, who is also \nthe counsel to the American Spectator funded by Mr. Scaife, who was \nalso a former law partner of Mr. Starr.\n\n  Mr. President, sometimes facts that are coincidental can paint a \npicture of conspiracy where it does not exist. There are coincidences, \nsometimes, of extraordinary scale. But the Attorney General would need \nto admit that there are events in this case that are peculiar indeed--\nMr. Scaife's funding of the American Spectator and its impact on \nFederal witnesses; Mr. Scaife's potential funding of Mr. Starr as a \nprivate attorney in the Paula Jones case; Mr. Scaife's funding of \nemployment for Mr. Starr at Pepperdine University, where he was offered \nand initially accepted a teaching position in the law department.\n  Coincidence? Perhaps. But as our former colleague, Senator Cohen once \nobserved on this floor, ``The appearance of justice is as important as \njustice itself.''\n  There are, in the coming weeks, important judgments to be made about \nthe administration of justice with relation to the President of the \nUnited States. Those decisions will profoundly impact policy and the \nguidance of the U.S. Government. I have no knowledge and, therefore, no \nrecommendation on the matters of how the case should be pursued. I am \nnot here to distinguish falsehood from truth. I am here in the interest \nof justice.\n  It would appear on the facts that there is something terribly \ntroubling about the administration of the Office of the Independent \nCounsel. So in my correspondence of this day, I have asked Attorney \nGeneral Reno to have the Office of Professional Responsibility inquire \nas to whether indeed there are conflicts of interest in the Paula Jones \ncase and, indeed, whether it is factual that Mr. Starr was once engaged \nas a private litigant in that matter. If so, the result is clear--he \nmust recuse himself and professional prosecutors must pursue the \nmatter. Similarly, to establish whether funds, through the American \nSpectator, were improperly used with a result of tampering of \nwitnesses. Finally, to conclude whether or not the operation of a \nprivate law practice, including the solicitation of clients and their \nfunding, has compromised the operations of Mr. Starr in his pursuit of \nthe various cases before his office.\n  Mr. President, Members of this institution and of the respective \nparties have at various times praised or criticized the Attorney \nGeneral in the performance of her responsibilities. Perhaps the fact \nthat she has been criticized from all quarters for so many decisions is \nthe best testament of her native integrity. Janet Reno is as capable an \nAttorney General as the United States has ever been fortunate enough to \nhave in that office. I leave these judgments with her, knowing of her \nhigh integrity, her understanding of the importance of these cases, the \nprofound impact on the administration of the U.S. Government and of \njustice itself, knowing that she will do with them what is right and \nproper.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S625-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S628-S635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF FREDERICA A. MASSIAH-JACKSON, OF PENNSYLVANIA, TO BE U.S. \n        DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the nomination.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to continue the discussion on the \njudge of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Judge Massiah-Jackson. \nWithin the past 24 hours, I and Senator Specter have been talking to \nthe majority leader, to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to \nthose who are in opposition to her nomination in an attempt to resolve \na lot of issues. And what Senator Specter and I have referred to, to \ncomplete this process of consideration in what we believe is the only \nfair way to do so, is to have an additional hearing for her to be able \nto respond to the information that has been presented so publicly now \nto the Congress and the Senate with respect to her nomination.\n  The majority leader is intending to come down in the next 15, 20 \nminutes to make a statement, which I fully support, and I know Senator \nSpecter supports, which will, in a sense, move this nomination aside \nfor now and have this nominee be given the opportunity to appear before \nthe Judiciary Committee and answer this new information, or respond to \nthe questions of members of the Judiciary Committee.\n  That is all I have been asking for since the leader scheduled this \nnomination. I am hopeful that after we go out on recess next week, \nthere will be scheduled a Judiciary Committee meeting for people who \nhave provided the information to present that information formally to \nthe committee, be questioned by committee members, and then for Judge \nMassiah-Jackson to have the opportunity to answer the charges that have \nbeen leveled against her.\n  That will complete, in my mind, the process of fair consideration.\n  Her nomination will remain here on the floor. It will remain on the \nExecutive Calendar, and subsequent to the hearing, the majority leader \nwill call the nomination up for a vote at that time.\n  That is, again, all I have been requesting from the leader--is to \ngive this process time to play out, fairness dictating the order of the \nday, and then give the Senate the opportunity to pass judgment as to \nwhether we believe that she should be a judge in the Eastern District \nof Pennsylvania.\n  So I see this as a very favorable resolution of what I have been \nasking for in the past 24 hours.\n  I thank the majority leader for his patience. This has been somewhat \nof a difficult ordeal having to juggle all the different sides on this \nissue.\n  I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his willingness \nto hold another hearing. He knows that he has not been formally \nrequested to do so by the Senate but has volunteered to make the \ncommittee available to further give Judge Massiah-Jackson the \nopportunity to respond to this new information that has been provided.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Missouri has more to say on \nthis nomination. He is ready to go. So I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to continue to explain the basis \nfor my opposition to the nomination of Frederica Massiah-Jackson to be \na U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  Although I have already spent time on the floor detailing this \nnominee's record, I think it is important and valuable to spend the \ntime necessary to demonstrate the serious flaws of this\n\n[[Page S629]]\n\nnominee and to also highlight the caliber of the nominees that we are \nreceiving from the President of the United States.\n  There are a number of categories into which my objections to this \nnomination might fall.\n  One would be a disrespect for the court and its environment, perhaps \nmost clearly typified by the willingness of this nominee to use \nprofanity in the courtroom.\n  No. 2, a contempt for prosecutors and police officers that is \nevidenced in the way she has treated them and handled them as they have \nappeared in court and the way in which she has handled evidence \nassembled by those officers.\n  Those are two major problems that I have with this particular \nnominee.\n  No. 3, the concept of leniency in sentencing; the effort made by this \nnominee as a judge in the State of Pennsylvania to reduce the sentences \nwhich were given to those who had been convicted of crimes is notable. \nIt has, as a matter of fact, even caught the attention of the appellate \ncourts at which time those sentences have been reversed.\n  These are among the most important factors that lead me to the \nconclusion that Judge Massiah-Jackson should not be confirmed as a \nUnited States district court judge.\n  She should not be considered for a lifetime responsibility in \nadministering justice in the United States of America; that in the \nevent that the President refuses to withdraw this nomination, which he \nshould do, that the Senate of the United States of America should \nreject this nomination.\n  Let me just go through some of these points in order to establish a \nfactual basis for these conclusions supporting the categories which I \nhave mentioned.\n  First is the contempt for prosecutors and police officers that Judge \nMassiah-Jackson has evidenced in the conduct of her responsibilities as \na judge in Pennsylvania.\n  In the case of Commonwealth v. Ruiz, Judge Massiah-Jackson acquitted \na man accused of possessing $400,000 worth of cocaine because she did \nnot believe the testimony of two undercover police officers, Detective-\nSergeant Daniel Rodriguez and Detective Terrance Jones. It was the \nsecond time she had acquitted alleged drug dealers nabbed by the same \nofficers. The first time, the two undercover officers testified that \nthey found two bundles of heroin on a table right next to the \ndefendant's hand. The judge not only refused to believe this testimony, \nshe went one step further. As the officers were leaving the courtroom, \nthe judge reportedly told spectators in the court: ``Take a good look \nat these guys [the undercover officers] and be careful out there.''\n  This identification by the judge was reported in the Philadelphia \nInquirer.\n  Detective-Sergeant Daniel Rodriguez confirmed this outrageous \ncourtroom incident in a signed letter to the U.S. Senate. The \ndetective-sergeant had the following comments regarding the incident, \nand I quote:\n\n       I thought, ``I hope I don't ever have to make buys from \n     anyone in this courtroom.'' They would know me, but I \n     wouldn't know them. What the judge said jeopardized our \n     ability to make buys. And it put us in physical danger.\n\n  I really believe that this officer sincerely wrote that letter and \nthat he intended for the letter to say exactly what it said and that he \nfelt the sense of physical danger that was occasioned by the special \nidentification that the judge had made of him and another police \nofficer.\n  Detective Terrance Jones, the other undercover officer that was \nidentified by Judge Massiah-Jackson in open court, according to the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer, also confirmed the facts in a signed statement \nto the committee staff. He stated that the comments ``jeopardized our \nlives.'' Detective Jones also notes:\n\n       As a law enforcement officer who happens to be African \n     American I am appalled that self-interest groups and the \n     media are trying to make the Massiah-Jackson controversy into \n     a racial issue. This is not about race. This is about the \n     best candidate for the position of Federal judge.\n\n  Let me go to another case, the case of Commonwealth v. Hicks. In this \ncase, in an action that led to a reversal by the appellate court, Judge \nMassiah-Jackson dismissed charges against the defendant on her own \nmotion.\n  Although the prosecution was prepared to proceed, the defense was not \nready because it was missing a witness--a police officer who was \nscheduled to testify for the defense apparently had not received the \nsubpoena. The defense requested a continuance to clear up the mixup \nconcerning the subpoena. The commonwealth stated that it had issued the \nsubpoena. The defense did not allege any wrongdoing or failure to act \non the part of the commonwealth. Nonetheless, without any evidence or \nprompting from defense counsel, Judge Massiah-Jackson decided she \nsimply did not believe that the commonwealth's attorney subpoenaed the \nnecessary witness. Judge Massiah-Jackson held the commonwealth liable \nfor the defense's lack of preparation for its own unpreparedness, and \nJudge Massiah-Jackson, on the motion of the court, dismissed the case \nwithout even the suggestion from the defense that the case should be \ndismissed. The facts ultimately revealed that the subpoena had been \nissued, but the officer was on vacation and had not received it. It was \nnot the fault of the commonwealth. Judge Massiah-Jackson's decision was \nreversed on appeal as an abuse of discretion. The appellate court \nconcluded that, ``Having carefully reviewed the record, we are unable \nto determine the basis for the trial court's decision to discharge the \ndefendant. Indeed the trial court was unable to justify its decision by \ncitation to rule or law.''\n\n  There is a lot of discussion about whether we need to send this \nnomination back for additional information and for hearings before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  This particular case, for instance, was discussed at the hearing. \nWhen asked by a Senator if she had any comment or explanation of the \nsituation, Judge Massiah-Jackson just replied, ``No, Senator, I \ndon't.''\n  It occurs to me that it is not necessary to reconvene the committee \nand to move this matter back from the floor of the Senate asking that \nthere be opportunities for explanations for cases like that when those \nopportunities were available then.\n  Commonwealth v. Hannibal is a case that is demonstrative of this \nparticular nominee's lack of judicial temperament.\n  In court, in response to prosecutor's attempt to be afforded an \nopportunity to be heard, the following exchange took place on the \nrecord:\n\n       The Court. Please keep quiet, Ms. McDermott.\n       Ms. McDermott for the Commonwealth: Will I be afforded----\n       The Court. Ms. McDermott, will you shut your f***ing mouth.\n\n  That is from the transcript of June 25, 1985, at page 17.\n  Judge Massiah-Jackson was formally admonished by the Judicial Inquiry \nand Review Board for using intemperate language in the courtroom. This \nincident, incidentally, was also discussed by the committee with the \njudge, and the conduct was admitted.\n  In the case of Commonwealth v. Burgos and Commonwealth v. Rivera, \nduring a sentencing proceeding, the prosecutor told Judge Massiah-\nJackson that she had forgotten to inform one of the defendants of the \nconsequences of failing to file a timely appeal. Of course, such a \nfailure would prejudice the commonwealth on appeal. Judge Massiah-\nJackson responded to this legal argument with profanity, stating, ``I \ndon't give a [expletive deleted].'' This incident was discussed at the \ncommittee hearing, and the conduct was also admitted.\n  District Attorney Morganelli of Northampton County, PA, has suggested \nthat the reason there are not more instances of foul language on the \nrecord is that Judge Massiah-Jackson's principal court reporter \nroutinely ``sanitized the record.''\n  It does not appear to be a coincidence that both of these profane \noutbursts were directed at prosecutors. Instead, Judge Massiah-\nJackson's foul language appears to be part and parcel of her hostility \nto law enforcement.\n  Let me move to the issue of the leniency in sentencing which has been \ncharacteristic, I believe, of this judge's record. In the case of \nCommonwealth v. Freeman, the defendant shot and wounded a Mr. Fuller in \nthe chest because Mr. Fuller had laughed at him. Judge Massiah-Jackson \nconvicted the defendant of misdemeanor instead of felony aggravated \nassault. She sentenced him to do 2 to 23 months and\n\n[[Page S630]]\n\nthen immediately paroled him so that he did not have to serve jail \ntime. The felony charge would have had a mandatory 5- to 10-year prison \nterm. Judge Massiah-Jackson explained her decision stating, ``The \nvictim had been drinking before being shot,'' and the defendant ``had \nnot been involved in any other crime since the incident.''\n  Here we have an individual who shoots another individual, and this \njudge not only makes it a misdemeanor so that the sentence can be \nreduced from a minimum of 5 to 10 years to 2 to 23 months, but then \nparoles immediately the individual so that no jail time is served after \nthe conviction. The judge explains this behavior saying that the person \nwho had been shot had been drinking as if somehow, I guess, if you are \ndrinking you are eligible to be shot; and that the defendant ``had not \nbeen involved in any other crime since the incident.''\n  This case was not discussed at the hearing. No appeal was taken from \nthis case.\n  In the case of Commonwealth v. Burgos, during a raid on the \ndefendant's house, police seized more than 2 pounds of cocaine along \nwith evidence that the house was a distribution center.\n  The defendant, Mouin Burgos, was convicted. Judge Massiah-Jackson \nsentenced the defendant to only 1 year's probation.\n  Then District Attorney Ronald Castille criticized Judge Massiah-\nJackson's sentence as ``defying logic'' and being ``totally bizarre.'' \nHe commented, ``This judge just sits in her ivory tower * * * She ought \nto walk along the streets some night and get a dose of what is really \ngoing on out there. She should have sentenced these people to what they \ndeserve.''\n  This case was discussed at the hearing, and Senators and the judge \nhad an opportunity to explain their positions. No appeal was taken from \nthis case.\n  In the case of Commonwealth v. Williams, a first-degree robbery, \nunreported sentencing reversal case, I would like to provide just one \nmore example of Judge Massiah-Jackson's leniency in sentencing, an \nexample that I think is also relevant to whether we should have another \nhearing on this nominee.\n  In the case of Commonwealth v. Williams, the defendant robbed a 47-\nyear old woman on the street at the point of a razor. The defendant \nused the razor to slash the woman's neck and arms and took her purse. \nThe defendant had to undergo surgery to repair the slashed tendons in \nher hand and was forced to wear a splintering device that pulled her \nthumb back to her wrist. The defendant pled guilty to first-degree \nrobbery. Under the Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines, that offense \ncarries a range of 4 to 7 years, with a mitigated range of 3\\1/4\\ to 5 \nyears. Despite these sentencing ranges, Judge Massiah-Jackson sentenced \nthe defendant to a mere 11\\1/2\\ to 23 months. In order to do so, Judge \nMassiah-Jackson not only had to deviate substantially below the \nguidelines range but also had to ignore a mandatory weapons enhancement \nthat raises the minimum sentence 1 to 2 years. The Commonwealth did \nappeal this meager sentence, and Judge Massiah-Jackson was reversed for \nher sentencing errors.\n  Now, this decision is important not only because it demonstrates her \nleniency in sentencing but also because of what it says about the \nequity of giving Ms. Massiah-Jackson an additional hearing. We have \nheard a lot about Judge Massiah-Jackson's right to be heard and have \nbeen given the impression that she has been the victim of sandbagging \nby her opponents. It is true that there is information that was not \navailable at the time of the committee's hearing. This sentencing case, \nfor example, was not addressed at the hearing. But why wasn't it \naddressed at the hearing? That is no one's fault but Judge Massiah-\nJackson.\n  The committee's standard questionnaire asks every candidate to list \nany judicial decisions which were reversed on appeal. Judge Massiah-\nJackson failed to list this case. Indeed, she testified that she had \nnever been reversed on a sentencing appeal. So if this case wasn't \ndebated or discussed at the hearing, it wasn't debated or discussed \nbecause at the hearing she had failed to disclose this when the \ncommittee had requested that she disclose it, and when asked \nadditionally if there were cases like this upon which she had been \nreversed she informed the committee that she had not been reversed on \nsentencing appeal when in fact this case represented such a reversal.\n  Now, it seems ironic to me that when we finally find out about the \nexistence of those things which she said did not exist, she should be \naccorded a second hearing now to explain that which she failed to \ndisclose. I think that is a serious problem. This is not only a \nfailure-to-disclose problem but this is the disclosure of something \nwhich was specifically denied in the hearing.\n  I make this point to make clear that this is not just a simple matter \nof giving someone a right to confront new allegations. She had the \nopportunity to respond to the allegations in this setting by providing \nthe evidence in the first instance, or the case or the notification \nthat she had been reversed on appeal, and in the second instance by not \ndenying that she had ever been reversed on appeal. It strikes me that \nwe are creating a troubling precedent by affording nominees a second \nhearing at least in part to explain materials that were requested prior \nto the first hearing.\n  Let me move on to the case of Commonwealth v. Smith. This is leniency \nnot just in sentencing but a predisposition on the part of this judge \nto suppress evidence and to do so improperly.\n  Judge Massiah-Jackson has also demonstrated leniency in improperly \nsuppressing evidence. The case that perhaps most dramatically \nillustrates this point is Commonwealth v. Smith, a case discussed by \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Chamber yesterday. It is \na case that I also mentioned.\n  In this tragic case, the victim, a 13-year-old boy, was raped at \nknifepoint in some bushes near a hospital. Eventually, the young boy \nmanaged to run away from his assailant nude and bleeding. Two nurses at \nthe hospital saw him, and he told them what had happened, pointing out \nthe bushes where he was attacked. The two nurses called the hospital \nsecurity guards. They saw the defendant in the case emerge from the \nbushes with his clothing disheveled and then saw him walk quickly away. \nThe women yelled out for the man to stop, and the police arrived on the \nscene and apprehended the defendant.\n\n  The defendant denied raping the boy, but the police searched him and \nfound a knife matching the description of that used in the rape. At \nthat point the police arrested the defendant. Shockingly, Judge \nMassiah-Jackson ruled that the police lacked probable cause to arrest \nthe defendant and suppressed all evidence, including the identification \nof the defendant by the two nurses.\n  Now, not surprisingly, the appellate court, when confronted with this \ndubious judgment, reversed Judge Massiah-Jackson.\n  So the situation is this, that Massiah-Jackson, lenient in \nsuppressing evidence, was reversed by the appellate court. It has been \npointed out, and I would thank Senator Specter for having so pointed \nout, that after a remand to the trial court the defendant was acquitted \nin a new trial before a different judge. But what seems to have \nreceived less attention is that all this occurred after Judge Massiah-\nJackson was reversed by the appellate court. Unlike the second judge \nwho conducted a full trial, Judge Massiah-Jackson threw out the \nevidence on the ground that the police lacked even probable cause to \narrest the defendant despite his proximity to the crime scene and the \nvictim, and the other facts that are attendant thereto, including the \nidentification by the individuals who were there at the time of his \narrest. It is, of course, one thing to acquit someone after a trial but \nthe notion that the police officers did not even have probable cause to \narrest the defendant is just shocking, and the appellate court agreed.\n  And the litany, incidentally, of illustrations regarding leniency in \nsentencing could go on. Last year there were 50 separate cases that \nwere singled out just as exemplary of this leniency, but that was just \nlast year. And organizations, law enforcement organizations, \norganizations that serve the culture by providing the safety and \nsecurity for persons and their property which defines a civilized \nculture, have come out saying this individual should not be\n\n[[Page S631]]\n\nconfirmed as a U.S. district court judge.\n  The Philadelphia Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police announced its \nopposition to the confirmation of Massiah-Jackson on January 13 of this \nyear. And just yesterday I had the privilege of attending a press \nconference in which Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police President \nRichard Costello made his opposition to this nominee unmistakably \nclear. The National Fraternal Order of Police announced its opposition \non January 20. In coming out against this nominee, here is what the \nNational President of the Fraternal Order of Police, Gilbert Gallegos, \nstated: ``Judge Massiah-Jackson has no business sitting on any bench, \nlet alone a Federal bench.''\n  After describing the incident in which Judge Massiah-Jackson pointed \nout undercover police officers in open court, Mr. Gallegos stated, ``I \ncannot adequately express my outrage.'' The National Fraternal Order of \nPolice President concluded, ``To confirm Judge Massiah-Jackson would be \nan affront to every law enforcement officer and prosecutor in the \nNation, all of whom have a herculean task of fighting crime. We \nshouldn't have to have [both] the judges and the criminals against \nus.''\n  I note the presence of the majority leader in the Chamber, Mr. \nPresident, and I would gladly yield to the majority leader with the \nunderstanding that at the conclusion of his remarks my right to speak \nin the Chamber be retained.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have had the opportunity now to discuss \nthis nomination with Senators on both sides of the aisle and those who \ndid support her and certainly those who are opposed to this nomination. \nI think that we should not go forward to a vote at this time since \nthere are very serious allegations out there. I am convinced they are \ntrue; I am convinced this nomination should not go forward; and I would \nurge at this point the President withdraw this nomination because \nclearly this nominee has very serious problems, conduct on the bench \nthat is certainly inappropriate and a number of concerns about the \nnominee's attitude toward prosecutors and toward law enforcement. \nClearly this is the type of nomination that should not be confirmed. \nBut so that some of these articles, some of the cases, some of the \nsuggestions that are now in the public arena can be properly looked \ninto, I thought the best thing to do at this time would be to not go \nforward with a vote and allow time for the committee to have a hearing \non the problems that have been identified. I don't think it can be \ndisposed of in the near future.\n  Having said that, I understand the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee will be conducting an additional hearing on the nominee \nsometime when we return from the recess we are about to go into at the \nclose of business on Thursday or Friday. So we can see what that \nhearing turns up. But I think that no further action can be taken at \nthis time. I thank all Senators for their consideration and will yield \nthe floor to the Senator from Missouri. I appreciate him yielding me \nthis time. And I know that the Senators from Pennsylvania will both \nseek recognition so that they can comment on the present status of this \nnominee.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe the Senator from Missouri still has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak in response to the majority leader for up to 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri does have the floor.\n  Does the Senator from Missouri object to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I had hoped to offer to the Senator from \nPennsylvania an opportunity to make brief remarks, and that is the \nreason I placed the quorum call, for an opportunity to make that offer.\n  The nomination of Frederica Massiah-Jackson is a nomination which I \nthink should call us each to a very serious consideration of our \nresponsibilities here in the U.S. Senate. Judges who are appointed for \nlife, who really do not answer to the voters, do not answer to the \nadministration or the executive branch, have a very high degree of \npower in the culture and we should be very careful about the \nindividuals that we endow with the authority of becoming Federal \njudges. The National Association of Police Organizations understands \nthat and the National Association of Police Organizations announced its \nopposition on January 22, to this nominee.\n  Further, there is opposition from the local law enforcement community \nin Philadelphia, opposition from individuals that one would not expect \nto ordinarily oppose a nominee except in extraordinary situations: \nLynne Abraham, who is the district attorney in the Philadelphia area--a \nDemocrat, someone you would expect to be aligned with the President and \nhis nominations--at great political cost, with substantial display of \nputting the benefit of the community in Philadelphia above party \nloyalty, came out against the nomination of Frederica Massiah-Jackson \nin a letter to Senator Specter, at least that is my information, on \nJanuary 8. She wrote:\n\n       My position on this nominee goes well beyond mere \n     differences of opinion, or judicial philosophy. Instead, this \n     nominee's record presents multiple instances of deeply \n     ingrained and pervasive bias against prosecutors and law \n     enforcement officers--and, by extension, an insensitivity to \n     victims of crime. Moreover, the nominee's judicial demeanor \n     and courtroom conduct, in my judgment, undermines respect for \n     the rule of law and, instead, tends to bring the law into \n     disrepute.\n       This nominee's judicial service is replete with instances \n     of demonstrated leniency towards criminals, an adversarial \n     attitude towards police and disrespect toward prosecutors \n     unmatched by any other present or former jurist with whom I \n     am familiar.\n\n  That is a very serious charge from the prosecutor, someone of the \nsame party as the President who nominates this judge. I quote again:\n\n       This nominee's judicial service is replete with [full of] \n     instances of demonstrated leniency toward criminals, an \n     adversarial attitude toward police and disrespect toward \n     prosecutors unmatched by any other present or former jurist \n     with whom I am familiar.\n\n  The words ``full of'' were my amplification. Her text did not include \nthat.\n  Other local law enforcement officials who feel that this is a \nnomination which should not go forward--the Northampton County District \nAttorney, John Morganelli, another Democrat, announced his all-out \nopposition to this nomination on January 6, 1998. Mr. Morganelli \nprovided members of the committee with a letter detailing the numerous \nincidents of unprofessional conduct that have marked Judge Massiah-\nJackson's tenure on the State trial bench. The concluding paragraphs of \nthat letter are worth quoting at length:\n\n       [The] record is one of an unusually adversarial attitude \n     toward the prosecution and police. Much personal animosity \n     towards prosecutors and police in general. Other portions of \n     her record indicate a tendency to be lenient with respect to \n     criminal defendants.\n\n  I continue with his letter:\n\n       This judge sat as a fact finder in the vast majority of her \n     cases because criminal defendants almost always felt it \n     advantageous to  waive  their  right  to  a  jury  trial  in \n     order to present their case directly to the judge. * * * In \n     addition, she has shown a lack of judicial temperament with \n     respect to vulgar language from the bench on the record and \n     much of it off the record. Also, as indicated above, Judge \n     Massiah-Jackson has attempted to meddle with the appellate \n     process in Pennsylvania by contacting appellate courts and \n     improperly attempting to influence appellate decisions. Her \n     comments,\n\n[[Page S632]]\n\n     conduct, record and lack of judicial temperament by itself \n     should call into question her stature to serve as a Federal \n     Judge.\n       Numerous District Attorneys and police organizations in the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania oppose this nomination as a slap \n     in the face to the law enforcement community.\n\n  That is the conclusion of District Attorney Morganelli's letter, \nopposing the confirmation of this judge.\n  In addition, the Executive Committee of the State of Pennsylvania's \nDistrict Attorneys Association has unanimously voted to officially \noppose the nomination. On January 8 the Executive Committee of the \nPennsylvania District Attorneys Association, in a unanimous vote, \nofficially opposed the nomination. The President of the association \nwrote a letter on January 26, expressing the association's opposition.\n  I would just comment it is not usual for prosecuting attorneys, or \nfor district attorneys, or for police organizations to attack judges, \nespecially judges who are sitting as judges in their jurisdictions, the \nsame judges they have to go before on a regular basis in seeking to \neffect justice in the society, to make sure we have the right law \nenforcement, the right prosecution, the right conviction and the right \ndetention of those who have been deemed guilty of a crime. It is not \ncomfortable, it is not easy, it is not expected. It is, I think, fair \nto describe it as rare, that someone would, as a prosecutor, or that \nthe association of prosecutors, or that the police, or the associations \nof police, would come forward and make statements that say not only is \nthis the worst judge I have ever seen but this is the worst judge of \nwhich I have any awareness. These are individuals who have a \nsubstantial awareness of the judicial system as a result of their broad \nexperience in the system.\n  If my recollection serves me correctly, the district attorney in \nPhiladelphia, Lynne Abraham, is a former judge herself. She has an \nability to know what the circumstances of the judge's responsibilities \nare. And when she comes forward to say that this judge is a judge that \nis so out of touch with the balance necessary to accord fairness in the \nsystem by being so predisposed to the defendant's position and \nantithetical to the prosecutor's position, and antagonistic to the \nposition of the Commonwealth as opposed to that of the individual who \nis seeking to be declared innocent of the charges, she just indicates \nthat we can do better. And I think that is really the case that we have \nhere.\n  The pool of legal talent in Pennsylvania is not shallow. We have \ntalked about Philadelphia lawyers all across the country for a long \ntime, because Philadelphia is known as a center for individuals who \nknow how to work with the law and to do it effectively, who know what \ntheir responsibilities are and to make sure that those responsibilities \ncan be carried out in the best interests of their clients. And I \nbelieve that there are those in that community who could well serve \nthis President as nominees and could well serve this country as \nnominees. And I believe it is the responsibility of the U.S. Senate, \nwhen you have a nominee who is not of the caliber and quality that is \nappropriate for membership on the Federal bench, for the Senate to \nstand up and say so. And I believe that is our responsibility here.\n  I don't believe that the Founding Fathers of this great country put \nthe U.S. Senate in the stream that leads to the Federal judiciary so \nthat it could act in a way which is a rubberstamp, so that it could \nsay, well, in spite of the fact that this individual is an affront to \nthe judicial system, disrespects it with profanity, disrespects its \nparticipants by profaning them and their conduct, is so lenient with \ncriminals that it causes major questions, has to be reversed on \ncriminal appeals and, when asked about it, denies ever being reversed \nuntil the appeals are found--I don't think we have to have that kind of \nperson. I don't think we are here to pass that kind of person through \nto a lifetime tenure, to a system which will, really, give her great \nlatitude in imposing upon the people of this country the authority of \nthe United States in demanding or commanding adherence to the law. I \nreally think that we can do better. And I think we ought to do better.\n  It is not hard for us to do that. Surely we have cooperated 90, 95 \npercent--I don't know--of the time, that these cases go through. Most \nof them never even get debated. This case was--they insisted that we \ndebate. When I was last at a committee meeting I thought we should not \nmove this case to the floor for debate. There was an outcry, a \nsubstantial, significant outcry, insisting that we move this case to \nthe floor for debate. Now that we have moved it to the floor for debate \nthere is a substantial outcry to move it back to the committee.\n  I think the real fact of the matter is we know, we know enough about \nthis case to say this is not an individual that we want to welcome into \nthe lifetime tenure of the Federal judge. It does not mean the \nindividual cannot have merit, cannot do different things, is banished \nfrom any other responsibilities. It is simply someone who is not suited \nto be endowed with the authority of a Federal judge, a serious \nresponsibility in this society and culture.\n  I suppose we can let this individual go back for additional committee \nhearings or additional deliberations. But in my view that is a mistake. \nAnd, in my view there are times when the Senate should simply act as \nthe Constitution calls upon it to act, that is to either provide the \nadvice and consent which is appropriate and constitute the nominee as a \nmember of the judiciary or deny the advice and consent and move on \nbecause America can and should do better.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I just want to thank the majority \nleader, again, for his willingness to cooperate with both Senator \nSpecter and me in our request that Judge Massiah-Jackson's nomination \nnot be voted on here in the next few days but that the process be able \nto be worked out and worked through, a hearing to be held. I know \nSenator Specter, who cannot be here right now, fully supports this \nprocess that we now have begun to get her a hearing in the Judiciary \nCommittee. And then I hope very promptly to bring her back to the floor \nof the U.S. Senate for a vote.\n  I would not like to see this nomination hang out for a long period of \ntime after the hearing. I don't think that would be fair, again, to her \nor to the process, or to the President who I know, in having \nconversations with the White House, they would like to see this matter \nbe dealt with in an expeditious fashion after the hearing takes place. \nA hearing will not be able to take place until the week after next \nbecause we are not in session next week. So I am hopeful we can bring \nthis judge up for a final vote here in the U.S. Senate within a 3-week \nperiod of time, maybe a 4-week period of time. I think that would be \nappropriate for her and I think appropriate for the Senate at some \npoint to pass judgment on this nominee. I think it is important when \nthe President puts a nominee up who has had, certainly, the amount of \nattention that this nominee has had, that the Senate, all Members, get \nan opportunity to express their opinion as to whether this nominee has \nthe credentials and qualifications and qualities necessary to serve on \nthe Federal judiciary.\n  With that, I again thank the majority leader and thank my colleagues \nfor allowing this procedure. There are things that could have been \ndone. I talked to several of my colleagues about those things that \ncould be done. The Senator from Missouri and others would have liked to \nvote today. In fact they could force a vote today. It is within the \nright of any Senator on this nomination to offer a tabling motion, \nwhich would bring the debate to a stop and cause a vote. They have \nagreed to not do that and I appreciate that very much.\n  They could have derailed this effort. But their indulgence in \nallowing what two home State Senators believe is a fair process, their \nindulgence in allowing what we believe to be a fair process, in \nacquiescing to those desires, is noble indeed and very much \nappreciated. So I thank the Senators from Alabama, Missouri, and others \nwho have expressed a willingness to expedite consideration of this \nnominee, for their willingness to withhold and allow the process to \nwork out just a few more weeks. And then take the nominee back to the \nfloor.\n\n[[Page S633]]\n\n  There will be no vote in committee. She will not be recommitted to \ncommittee. There will be no action necessary by the committee. Her \nnomination will remain on the floor of the U.S. Senate and will be \neligible to be recalled by the leader at his discretion, which is our \nunderstanding, subsequent to the hearing in the Judiciary Committee.\n\n  So that is the state of play, if you will, of this nomination, and it \nis one I find wholly acceptable at this point. I know my colleague, \nSenator Specter, does also.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe nomination of Frederica Massiah-Jackson for the United States \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. I opposed this \nnominee in Committee, and nothing has changed in the interim to make me \nany more likely to support her.\n  I believe that the President is entitled to some deference in his \nchoice of judges for the Federal Bench, and I try to give his nominees \nthe benefit of the doubt. However, because of Judge Massiah-Jackson's \njudicial temperament and record of leniency toward criminal defendants, \nI cannot support her nomination.\n  Judicial temperament is an essential quality for judges. They must be \nprofessional, civil, and fair. To earn esteem and honor, they must \nexhibit dignity and be respectful of those who appear before them.\n  Unfortunately, Judge Massiah-Jackson has shown a lack of judicial \ntemperament while serving on the Pennsylvania trial court. She has used \nprofane language from the Bench, which I will not repeat here. There is \nsimply no excuse for a judge to use profanity in court.\n  Also, we have received numerous letters from bipartisan professionals \nto the effect that she is hostile and unfair toward prosecutors and \npolice officers. The Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association, which \nunanimously voted to oppose her nomination, wrote that she has ``an \nanti-police, anti-prosecution bias'' and that her actions as a trial \njudge ``at times . . . have bordered on the outrageous.'' The Attorney \nGeneral of Pennsylvania, Michael Fisher, has weighed in against her. \nThe National Fraternal Order of Police wrote that she ``has made a \ncareer of dismissing out of hand testimony by police officers, treating \nthem as second-class citizens.'' The Philadelphia FOP echoed this \ncriticism, saying that her actions ``make it appear she is on a crusade \nagainst public safety.'' The Philadelphia District Attorney, Lynne \nAbraham, whose office prosecutes criminal cases within Philadelphia \nwhere Judge Massiah-Jackson has served as a judge, was resolute. She \nwrote that the ``nominee's record represents multiple instances of a \ndeeply ingrained and pervasive bias against prosecutors and law \nenforcement officers, and by extension, an insensitivity to victims of \ncrime. The nominee's judicial demeanor and courtroom conduct . . . \nundermine respect for the rule of law and . . . tend to bring the law \ninto disrepute.'' She then compared this judge to others stating, \n``This nominee's judicial service is replete with instances of \ndemonstrated leniency toward criminals, an adversarial attitude towards \npolice, and disrespect and a hostile attitude towards prosecutors \nunmatched by any other present or former jurist with whom I am \nfamiliar.''\n  An example of the judge's hostility toward police that has created \nmuch attention is an incident where she pointed out two undercover \nnarcotics agents and told those in her courtroom to take a good look at \nthe officers and, quote, ``watch yourselves.'' This story was published \nin a Pennsylvania newspaper, and I asked her about it in writing during \nthe hearing process, which gave her plenty of time to reflect on the \nmatter. She responded, ``I have read the 1988 article and it is \ninaccurate. I would not and did not make any such statement to the \nspectators.'' However, the two undercover agents that the article \nreferred to later signed statements saying she had singled them out and \nreferred to them in this manner.\n  She has also made public comments about crime that warrant concern. \nAlthough she informed me in response to a written question that she is \nnot opposed to imposing the death penalty, she was very critical of the \ndeath penalty in a 1994 speech. Quoting Justice Harry Blackman, she \nsaid, ``the death penalty experiment has failed.'' She added, ``It is \nnot a deterrent to criminal behavior.'' Later in the speech she said, \n``Locking folks up is a belated and expensive response to a social \ncrisis.''\n  It is very unusual for us to receive opposition to a nominee for the \nFederal Court from prosecutors and professionals as we have here. I \ncommend the prosecutors and police who have taken this bold stand. They \nhave brought a great deal of attention to a nominee who is simply not \nfit to serve on the Federal court.\n  The public opposition to this nominee from prosecutors and police, in \naddition to the information we had at the time she was considered in \nCommittee, should be more than enough for Senators to oppose her. It \nshould not even be necessary to consider cases and statistics that have \nbeen brought to our attention in the past few weeks.\n  Let me close by referring again to the letter from the Fraternal \nOrder of Police. I quote, ``To confirm Judge Messiah-Jackson would be \nan affront to every law enforcement officer and prosecutor in the \nNation. . . . We shouldn't have to have the judges and the criminals \nagainst us.''\n  Mr. President, I agree. I will stand with prosecutors and police on \nthis nomination.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \ncopy of the letters that I quoted in my statement.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Pennsylvania District\n\n\n                                        Attorneys Association,\n\n                                 Harrisburg, PA, January 26, 1998.\n     Sen. Orin Hatch,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee: As \n     President of the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association, \n     I am writing to express the Association's opposition to the \n     nomination of Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson for a position \n     as a Federal Judge in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n       As you may know, recently the Executive Board of the \n     Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association which speaks on \n     behalf of all 67 elected District Attorneys in Pennsylvania \n     voted unanimously to oppose the aforesaid nomination. We \n     recently met with Senator Arlen Specter and Senator Rick \n     Santorum of Pennsylvania in person to convey the sentiment of \n     District Attorneys in Pennsylvania.\n       A review of Judge Massiah-Jackson's record during her \n     tenure as a Criminal Court Judge clearly shows that she has \n     exhibited an anti-police, anti-prosecution bias as a Criminal \n     Court Judge. At times, her actions as a Common Pleas Judge in \n     Philadelphia have bordered on the outrageous. She has used \n     profanity in her courtroom, embarrassed and exposed police \n     officers in her courtroom and has even interfered in the \n     appellate process by attempting to ``recommend'' to an \n     appellate court that a Commonwealth appeal of one of her \n     decisions be quashed. Given the prevalence of federal habeas \n     corpus appellate practice, especially as it related to \n     capital convictions obtained from state courts, the prospect \n     of seating a member to the Federal Judiciary with a record \n     like Ms. Massiah-Jackson's should give those involved in the \n     confirmation process pause and concern.\n       Therefore, I strongly urge all members of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee and all members of the United States \n     Senate to oppose this particular nomination.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Michael D. Marino,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\n\n\n                                   Office of Attorney General,\n\n                                 Harrisburg, Pa, January 29, 1998.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n     RE: Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I wish to express my opposition to \n     President Clinton's nomination of Judge Frederica Massiah-\n     Jackson to serve on the United States District Court for the \n     Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n       I am writing on Judge Massiah-Jackson's nomination after \n     spending considerable time reviewing her record on the Court \n     of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. Due to the importance \n     of this nomination and because of the seriousness of the \n     allegations raised with respect to Judge Massiah-Jackson's \n     record, I have delayed taking a public position until I had \n     the opportunity to review all available data. This review has \n     also included discussions with members of my staff and other \n     prosecutors who have personally appeared before Judge \n     Massiah-Jackson. To a person, these prosecutors have \n     expressed concern about the Judge's demeanor, her temperament \n     and the manner in which she disposes of cases. I have also \n     reviewed sentencing statistics and discussed Judge\n\n[[Page S634]]\n\n     Massiah-Jackson's sentencing practices with these \n     prosecutors. This review and these discussions have revealed \n     a record of leniency in sentencing criminal defendants, a \n     bias against police and prosecutors and an insensitivity to \n     the plight of victims.\n       The major criticisms about Judge Massiah-Jackson come from \n     the period of time she was assigned to the Court's Criminal \n     Division. In recent years, she has been assigned to the Civil \n     Division. U.S. District Court judges have a civil and \n     criminal court caseload. The Office of Attorney General and I \n     represent the Commonwealth in the U.S. District Court in \n     civil and criminal cases.\n       As Attorney General, I supervise a large office which \n     includes 180 lawyers and 266 criminal agents. My prosecutors \n     and agents are often cross-designated in federal court and \n     also work jointly with police officers, agents and \n     prosecutors from other federal, state and local agencies. My \n     Office's cases are sometimes prosecuted in federal court, \n     notably when they are developed in conjunction with a federal \n     task force. A federal judiciary that properly safeguards \n     individual rights and liberties while respecting the \n     dedication and commitment of the law enforcement community is \n     essential to our efforts on behalf of the people of the \n     Commonwealth.\n       Based on my review of Judge Massiah-Jackson's criminal \n     court record and the antipathy she has displayed toward \n     police, prosecutors and victims, I must respectfully ask you \n     to oppose her nomination when it is voted on by the United \n     States Senate and to ask your colleagues to do likewise.\n       My hope would be that the President will quickly nominate \n     someone who will bring the needed diversity to the United \n     States District Court for the Eastern District of \n     Pennsylvania, but a person with a record that shows a more \n     balanced perspective than this nominee.\n       Thank you for your consideration of my position.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                D. Michael Fisher,\n     Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n\n                                 National Legislative Program,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, 27 January 1998.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I am writing on behalf of the more \n     than 270,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police to urge \n     that you withdraw your support for the nomination of Judge \n     Frederica Massiah-Jackson to the Federal judiciary.\n       Senator Specter, Judge Massiah-Jackson has no business \n     sitting on any bench, let alone a Federal bench. Frankly, I \n     have difficulty reconciling why you would offer her \n     nomination any of your support. She routinely demonstrates \n     that she lacks any sense of judicial propriety and \n     temperament. Her manners and language in the court room are \n     ugly. Her record of sympathy and leniency toward criminals, \n     even violent criminals, is extreme. Most objectionably, Judge \n     Massiah-Jackson consistently parades her anti-police bias by \n     using her power and authority as a judge to belittle, harass, \n     and threaten the law enforcement officers who appear in her \n     court. Her contempt for prosecutors appearing before her is \n     so rancorous, that a broad grassroots effort has been led by \n     members of her own political party to oppose her elevation to \n     the Federal judiciary.\n       In 1994, a man appeared before Judge Massiah-Jackson \n     charged with numerous offenses. He had struck a pedestrian \n     with his car, left her lying in the gutter, and then pummeled \n     into unconsciousness a relative of the victim who attempted \n     to prevent his fleeing the scene. She described the behavior \n     of this man, who had a prior record of 19 arrests and eight \n     convictions, as ``Not really criminal. He had merely been \n     involved in a car accident.'' The man was sentenced to two \n     years probation.\n       To add insult to injury, a few years earlier this same man, \n     who then was out on bail for another offense, appeared before \n     Judge Massiah-Jackson. His counsel asserted that a particular \n     police officer was harassing him with ``unnecessary'' traffic \n     stops. Despite the lack on any evidence, Judge Massiah-\n     Jackson offered to have the court file a complaint against \n     the officer on the defendant's behalf! She concluded, without \n     any discernable reason other than her contempt for law \n     enforcement officers, that this officer was masterminding a \n     plot to threaten and harass the man and his family! Senator \n     Specter, she threatened in open court to appear as a fact \n     witness against this officer in the event the defendant, his \n     family, or friends came to any harm. What kind of a judge is \n     this?\n       On one occasion, Senator, Judge Massiah-Jackson acquitted a \n     criminal of drug possession by simply refusing to believe the \n     testimony of undercover narcotics investigators. After \n     dismissing the charges, she urged spectators in her court to \n     ``take a good look at the undercover officers and watch \n     yourselves.'' I cannot adequately express my outrage, sir. \n     She deliberately jeopardized the lives of these officers. Is \n     this the type of judge we want sitting on the Federal bench?\n       This is surely the most offensive and egregious example of \n     her conduct, but hardly an uncommon one for Judge Massiah-\n     Jackson, who has made a career of dismissing out of hand \n     testimony by police officers, treating them as second-class \n     citizens barely worthy of even her contempt. Frankly, I am \n     amazed she has served on any bench at all.\n       I urge you to ensure that all judicial nominees are \n     properly screened, so that the likes of Judge Massiah-Jackson \n     do not find their way to the Senate floor again. And I \n     strongly urge you to withdraw your support of her nomination \n     and cast your vote against her confirmation on 28 January. To \n     confirm Judge Massiah-Jackson would be an affront to every \n     law enforcement officer and prosecutor in the nation, all of \n     whom have the herculean task of fighting crime. We shouldn't \n     have to have the judges and the criminals against us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Gilbert G. Gallegos,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n\n                                     Philadelphia Lodge No. 5,\n\n                               Philadelphia, PA, January 13, 1998.\n     Hon. Richard (Rick) Santorum,\n     U.S. Senator, Philadelphia, PA.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: The Fraternal Order of Police, in an \n     effort to protect and properly serve its members, has a keen \n     interest in all Jurists whose appointment could affect the \n     safety and welfare of its Police.\n       To this end, the Fraternal Order of Police is opposed to \n     the nomination of Judge Frederica Massiah Jackson to the \n     United States District Court for the Eastern District of \n     Pennsylvania.\n       The reasons for this determination by the F.O.P. is that \n     Judge Jackson has an established record of being extremely \n     lenient on criminals; insensitive to the victims of crime; \n     and has posed a direct threat against Police.\n       Judge Jackson's bizarre rulings, coupled with her \n     challenging and adversarial attitude toward Police and \n     prosecutors, make it appear she is on a crusade against \n     public safety.\n       The Police have a hard enough time dealing with the felons \n     on the street. They don't need to be worrying about the \n     people in positions of authority placing them in more danger. \n     Yet, that is exactly what Judge Jackson did to several \n     Narcotic Officers in open Court.\n       It is an insult to the entire Judicial System and the \n     community it services when a Jurist of this caliber would \n     even be considered for an appointment to a position that \n     could negatively affect public safety.\n       Must one be reminded that--Crime is out of control. \n     Innocent people are being attacked and slaughtered on our \n     streets. Drugs are in every neighborhood. Our citizens are \n     fleeing the City in great numbers. Our residents are living \n     in fear everyday. Our City is in decay.\n       We must stop the violence; we must stop the insanity!\n       The appointment of Judge Massiah Jackson to the U.S. Court \n     would be directly counter-productive to this effort. We need \n     a Federal Judge who has proven to be tough on crime. One who \n     is a highly regarded professional in the field of law. We \n     must have a Judge who can help bring new hope to those in \n     despair.\n       In closing, Philadelphia has many Judges who can fill the \n     requirements needed for this position. Unfortunately, Judge \n     Massiah Jackson is not one of them.\n       Respectfully submitted,\n     Richard B. Costello,\n       President.\n     Michael G. Lutz,\n       Past President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   District Attorney's Office,\n\n                                Philadelphia, PA, January 8, 1998.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: On December 9, 1997, you phoned my \n     office seeking my position on the nomination of Judge \n     Frederica Massiah-Jackson as a Judge for the United States \n     District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. When \n     we spoke, I told you that, in my thirty years of public \n     service, including almost sixteen years as a Judge and over \n     six years as Philadelphia's District Attorney, never before \n     had my United States Senator solicited my position on any of \n     the many prior Federal District or Circuit Court nominees who \n     had sought confirmation. I further related that it had been \n     my general policy to refrain from speaking out on Federal \n     judicial nominations.\n       Immediately after our brief phone conversation, you wrote \n     and faxed me a letter seeking my written concurrence in a \n     quoted paragraph regarding my general policy. I have \n     deliberately deferred responding because, instead of offering \n     a perfunctory response, I thought it prudent, under the \n     present circumstances, to re-evaluate my general policy, to \n     see if there were compelling reasons to deviate from it. I \n     have concluded that this nomination presents such reasons.\n       Between the time of our conversation and today, I have \n     carefully reviewed sentencing statistics, verdicts, courtroom \n     testimony, newspaper and other print media reports, together \n     with a number of other pieces of anecdotal evidence, \n     including office memoranda. After having done so, I have \n     concluded that I must stand opposed to this nomination.\n       This decision is a difficult one because I campaigned with \n     and served on the bench at the same time as Judge Massiah-\n     Jackson. I firmly believe in the rule of law and the \n     independence of the judiciary, and I would never oppose a \n     nomination merely because of a personal disagreement with \n     some decisions or remarks that a judge might make in the heat \n     of courtroom arguments.\n       My position on this nomination goes well beyond mere \n     differences of opinion, or judicial philosophy. Instead, this \n     nominee's\n\n[[Page S635]]\n\n     record presents multiple instances of a deeply ingrained and \n     pervasive bias against prosecutors and law enforcement \n     officers--and, by extension, an insensitivity to victims of \n     crime. Moreover, the nominee's judicial demeanor and \n     courtroom conduct, in my judgment, undermines respect for the \n     rule of law and, instead, tends to bring the law into \n     disrepute.\n       This nominee's judicial service is replete with instances \n     of demonstrated leniency towards criminals, an adversarial \n     attitude towards police, and disrespect and a hostile \n     attitude towards prosecutors unmatched by any other present \n     or former jurist with whom I am familiar.\n       I must, however, make this point perfectly clear: I believe \n     firmly that the next member of the Eastern District judiciary \n     should be an African-American woman. The under-representation \n     of minorities on our federal bench has been permitted to \n     exist for far too long. Fortunately, the Philadelphia area is \n     blessed with many eminently well-qualified African-American \n     women lawyers, in academia, public service, private practice, \n     and on the bench. Had any one of these been selected, she \n     would already be presiding on our Federal District Court \n     bench.\n       I trust that this letter satisfies your inquiry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lynne Abraham,\n                                                District Attorney.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry. Is there time set aside for \nmorning business now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not. However, the Senator may, by \nunanimous consent, request permission to proceed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 15 minutes \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S628-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S635-S638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NUCLEAR ISSUES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, over the last few months, I have been \nspeaking out regularly on a wide range of nuclear issues that confront \nour country and the world, issues that have not been carefully \naddressed to optimize the positive impacts of these technologies and to \nminimize their associated risks.\n  As I began this statement, I noted that nuclear issues are not \nexactly the ones that most of us focus on to hear cheers of public \nsupport. Nuclear issues typically have been relegated to back burners \nor only to attacks that wildly inflate their risks.\n  Based on strong encouragement that I have received from people like \nSenator Nunn, John Deutch, Allan Bromley, Edward Teller and others, I \nintend to continue to speak and to seek national dialog on a wide range \nof nuclear issues. In fact, I will invite each of my Senate colleagues \nto participate in a nuclear issues caucus focused on issues ranging \nfrom nuclear power and waste to nuclear stockpiles.\n  My goal is that out of this dialog and out of a rebirth of critical \nthinking on the roles of nuclear technology, we can craft policies that \nbetter meet the needs of the Nation and better utilize the power of \nnuclear technologies. Let me give you the flavor of some of these \nissues that I assert need careful reexamination.\n  First, in 1997, the United States decided to halt research into \nreprocessing mixed oxides, or commonly called MOX fuel, in the hope \nthat it would curtail other countries' pursuit of these technologies. \nOther countries proceeded to follow their own best interests and \ntechnical judgments.\n  Today, many other countries are reprocessing and using MOX fuel, \nmixed oxide fuel. Now the United States is unable to use these \ntechnologies to meet nonproliferation needs and has largely been left \nout of the international nuclear fuels cycle.\n  I contend we made a mistake then. The reason we made the decision is \nfalse. We said it is so that no others will do this and create some \nrisks. Others have assessed that there are no risks, or few, and they \nhave proceeded.\n  Let me move on to another example.\n  Today, we regulate radiation to extremely low levels based on what we \nhave chosen to call in this country the ``linear-no-threshold'' model \nof radiation effects. That model, basically, asserts that the least bit \nof radiation exposure increases the risk of cancer, but scientific \nevidence does not support that assumption. As a result, the United \nStates spends billions of dollars each year cleaning up sites to levels \nwithin 5 percent of natural background radiation, even though natural \nbackground radiation varies by large amounts; in fact, by over three \ntimes just in the United States and much larger amounts if we look \noutside the Nation.\n  On another issue, today, nuclear energy provides 20 percent of the \nelectricity of our Nation. In 1996, nuclear energy reduced U.S. \ngreenhouse gas emissions from electric utilities by 25 percent. Does \nthat sound interesting to anyone? Nuclear electrically generated power \nreduced U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent. That means that we \nproduce that electricity clean in terms of global warming emissions, \nand we did this without imposing taxes or other costly limitations on \nthe use of carbon-based energy forms, some of the suggestions that are \nbeing made now about taxing those energy sources that do create \ngreenhouse gases to minimize their impact by using less.\n  On another issue, today, we focus on the creation of bilateral \naccords with Russia to size our nuclear stockpile, and we expend much \nenergy debating the pros and cons of START II versus START III. \nInstead, I believe that the United States should move away from sizing \nits nuclear stockpile in accordance with bilateral accords with Russia. \nInstead, within the limitations of existing treaties, the United States \nshould move to a ``threat-based stockpile,'' driven by the minimal \nstockpile size that meets credible threat evaluations.\n  That is just another issue in the nuclear field that we ought to be \naddressing and debating and thinking about and listening to some \nexperts on.\n  Today, many of the weapons in our stockpile and in the stockpile of \nRussia are on hair-trigger alert. I believe that both nations should \nconsider de-alerting their nuclear stockpiles and even consider \neliminating the ground-based leg of the nuclear triad. And I know this \nmay not be doable, and the discussion may reveal that it is not \nprudent. But it should be talked about.\n\n  Today, both the United States and Russia are dismantling weapons, but \nboth nations are storing the classified components, the so-called pits \nfrom the weapons, that would enable either nation to quickly rebuild \nits arsenals. We are in serious need of a fast-paced program to convert \nclassified weapon components into unclassified shapes that are quickly \nplaced under international verification. Then that material should be \ntransformed into MOX--which I discussed earlier--MOX fuel for use in \ncivilian reactors, again with due haste.\n  There are some who have prejudged this and will instantly say, no. I \nam suggesting the time is now to have a thorough discussion of these \nkinds of issues, because we made some mistakes 15, 20 and 25 years ago \nwhen we made some of the decisions that now guide our course in this \nvery, very difficult area that I just spoke of with reference to \nnuclear arsenal components.\n  Today, high-level nuclear waste is stored in 41 States. Much of that \nis spent civilian reactor fuel that is saturating the storage capacity \nat many sites. The United States should move to interim storage of \nspent nuclear fuel while continuing to actively pursue permanent \nrepository. In the years before that repository is sealed, there will \nbe time to study alternatives to permanently burying the spent fuel \nwith its large remaining energy potential. One of those alternatives \nfor study should be a serious review of accelerator transmutation of \nwaste technology.\n  Today, another issue, irradiation of food products is rarely used. \nNevertheless, there is convincing evidence of its benefits in \ncurtailing foodborne illnesses. I commend the recent acceptance of \nirradiation for beef products by the Food and Drug Administration. It \nwas a long time in coming, but it is finally here.\n  Today, few low-level nuclear waste disposal facilities are operating \nin this country, jeopardizing many operations that rely on routine use \nof low-level radioactive materials. For example, the\n\n[[Page S636]]\n\nFederal Government continues its efforts to block the efforts of the \nState of California to build a low-level nuclear waste disposal \nfacility at Ward Valley, CA.\n  Today, joint programs with Russia are underway to protect Russian \nfissile materials and shift the activities of former Soviet weapons and \ntheir scientists into commercial projects. These programs should be \nexpanded, not reduced. The President suggests that some should be \nreduced. I believe they should be expanded.\n  These and other issues will all benefit from a careful reexamination \nof past policies relating to nuclear technologies. While some may \ncontinue to lament that the nuclear genie is out of the proverbial \nbottle, I am ready to focus on harnessing that genie as effectively and \nas fully as possible so that our citizens may gain the largest possible \nbenefit from nuclear technologies.\n  I have a more detailed statement that analyzes these issues and \nothers. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record, not \nas if read, but merely as an adjunct to the speech which I have just \ngiven.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Statement\n\n                     (By Senator Pete V. Domenici)\n\n       Over the last few months, I have been speaking out \n     regularly on a wide range of nuclear issues that confront our \n     nation--issues that have not been carefully addressed to \n     optimize the positive impacts of these technologies and to \n     minimize their associated risks.\n       As I began these statements, I noted that nuclear issues \n     are not exactly the ones that most of us focus on to hear \n     cheers of public support. Nuclear issues typically have been \n     relegated to back burners, or only to attacks that wildly \n     inflate their risks.\n       Based on the strong encouragement I've received from people \n     like Senator Nunn, John Deutch, Allan Bromley, and Edward \n     Teller, I intend to continue to seek national dialogue on a \n     wide range of nuclear issues. In fact, I will invite each of \n     my Senate Colleagues to participate in a Nuclear Issues \n     Caucus, focused on issues ranging from nuclear power and \n     waste to nuclear stockpile. My goal is that out of this \n     Caucus, and out of a rebirth of critical thinking on the \n     roles of nuclear technology, we can craft policies that \n     better meet the needs of the nation and better utilize the \n     power of nuclear technologies.\n       Strategic national issues are always hard to discuss. In no \n     area has this been more evident during these last few decades \n     than in development of public policy involving energy, \n     growth, and the role of nuclear technologies.\n       But as we leave the 20th Century, arguably the American \n     Century, and head for a new millennium, we truly need to \n     confront these strategic issues with careful logic and sound \n     science.\n       We live in the dominant economic, military, and cultural \n     entity in the world. Our principles of government and \n     economics are increasingly becoming the principles of the \n     world.\n       There are no secrets to our success, and there is no \n     guarantee that, in the coming century, we will be the \n     principal beneficiary of the seeds we have sown. There is \n     competition in the world and serious strategic issues facing \n     the United States cannot be overlooked.\n       The United States--like the rest of the industrialized \n     world--is aging rapidly as our birth rates decline. Between \n     1995 and the year 2030, the number of people in the United \n     States over age 65 will double from 34 million to 68 million. \n     Just to maintain our standard of living, we need dramatic \n     increases in productivity as a larger fraction of our \n     population drops out of the workforce.\n       By 2030, 30 percent of the population of the industrialized \n     nations will be over 60. The rest of the world--the countries \n     that today are ``under-industrialized''--will have only 16 \n     percent of their population over age 60 and will be ready to \n     boom.\n       As those nations build economies modeled after ours, there \n     will be intense competition for the resources that underpin \n     modern economies.\n       When it comes to energy, we have a serious, strategic \n     problem. The United States currently consumer 25 percent of \n     the world's energy production. However, developing countries \n     are on track to increase their energy consumption by 48 \n     percent between 1992 and 2010.\n       The United States currently produces and imports raw energy \n     resources worth over $150 billion per year. Approximately $50 \n     billion of that is imported oil or natural gas. We then \n     process that material into energy feedstocks such as \n     gasoline. Those feedstocks--the energy we consume in our \n     cars, factories, and electric plants--are worth $505 billion \n     per year.\n       We debate defense policy every year, as we should. But we \n     don't debate energy policy, even though it costs twice as \n     much as our defense, other countries' consumption is growing \n     dramatically, and energy shortages are likely to be a prime \n     driver of future military challenges.\n       Even when we've discussed energy independence in my quarter \n     century of Senate service, we've largely ignored public \n     debate on nuclear policies.\n       At the same time, the anti-nuclear movement has conducted \n     their campaign in a way that has been tremendously appealing \n     to mass media. Scientists, used to the peer-reviewed ways of \n     scientific discourse, were unprepared to counter. They lost \n     the debate.\n       Serious discussion about the role of nuclear energy in \n     world stability, energy independence, and national security \n     retreated into academia or classified sessions.\n       Today, it is extraordinarily difficult to conduct a debate \n     on nuclear issues. Usually, the only thing produced is nasty \n     political fallout.\n       My goal today is to share with you my perspective on \n     several aspects of our nuclear policy. I am counting on you \n     to join with me to encourage a careful, scientifically based, \n     re-examination of nuclear issues in the United States.\n       I am going to tell you that we made some bad decisions in \n     the past that we have to change. Then I will tell you about \n     some decisions we need to make now.\n       First, we need to recognize that the premises underpinning \n     some of our nuclear policy decisions are wrong. In 1977, \n     President Carter halted all U.S. efforts to reprocess spent \n     nuclear fuel and develop mixed-oxide fuel (MOX) for our \n     civilian reactors on the grounds that the plutonium was \n     separated during reprocessing. He feared that the separated \n     plutonium could be diverted and eventually transformed into \n     bombs. He argued that the United States should halt its \n     reprocessing program as an example to other countries in the \n     hope that they would follow suit.\n       The premise of the decision was wrong. Other countries do \n     not follow the example of the United States if we make a \n     decision that other countries view as economically or \n     technically unsound. France, Great Britain, Japan, and Russia \n     all now have MOX fuel programs.\n       This failure to address an incorrect premise has harmed our \n     efforts to deal with spent nuclear fuel and the disposition \n     of excess weapons material, as well as our ability to \n     influence international reactor issues.\n       I'll cite another example of a bad decision. We regulate \n     exposure to low levels of radiation using a so-called \n     ``linear no-threshold'' model, the premise of which is that \n     there is no ``safe'' level of exposure.\n       Our model forces us to regulate radiation to levels \n     approaching a few percent of natural background despite the \n     fact that natural background can vary by a factor of three \n     just within the United States.\n       On the other hand, many scientists think that living cells, \n     after millions of years of exposure to naturally occurring \n     radiation, have adapted such that low levels of radiation \n     cause very little if any harm. In fact, there are some \n     studies that suggest exactly the opposite is true--that low \n     doses of radiation may even improve health.\n       The truth is important. We spend over $5 billion each year \n     to clean contaminated DOE sites to levels below 5 percent of \n     background.\n       In this year's Energy and Water Appropriations Act, we \n     initiated a ten year program to understand how radiation \n     affects genomes and cells so that we can really understand \n     how radiation affects living organisms. For the first time, \n     we will develop radiation protection standards that are based \n     on actual risk.\n       Let me cite another bad decision. You may recall that \n     earlier this year, Hudson Foods recalled 25 million pounds of \n     beef, some of which was contaminated by E. Coli. The \n     Administration proposed tougher penalties and mandatory \n     recalls that cost millions.\n       But, E. Coli bacteria can be killed by irradiation and that \n     irradiation has virtually no effect on most foods. \n     Nevertheless, irradiation isn't used much in this country, \n     largely because of opposition from some consumer groups that \n     question its safety.\n       But there is no scientific evidence of danger. In fact, \n     when the decision is left up to scientists, they opt for \n     irradiation--the food that goes into space with our \n     astronauts is irradiated. And if you're interested in this \n     subject, a recent issue of the MIT Technology Review details \n     the advantages of irradiated food.\n       I've talked about bad past decisions that haunt us today. \n     Now I want to talk about decisions we need to make today.\n       The President has outlined a program to stabilize the U.S. \n     production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases at \n     1990 levels by some time between 2008 and 2012. \n     Unfortunately, the President's goals are not achievable \n     without seriously impacting our economy.\n       Our national laboratories have studied the issue. Their \n     report indicates that to get to the President's goals we \n     would have to impose a $50/ton carbon tax. That would result \n     in an increase of 12.5 cents/gallon for gas and 1.5 cents/\n     kilowatt-hour for electricity--almost a doubling of the \n     current cost of coal or natural gas-generated electricity.\n       What the President should have said is that we need nuclear \n     energy to meet his goal. After all, in 1996, nuclear power \n     plants prevented the emission of 147 million metric tons of \n     carbon, 2.5 million tons of nitrogen oxides, and 5 million \n     tons of sulfur dioxide. Our electric utilities' emissions of \n     those greenhouse gases were 25 percent lower than they would \n     have been if fossil fuels had been used instead of nuclear \n     energy.\n       Ironically, the technology we are relying on to achieve the \n     benefits of nuclear energy\n\n[[Page S637]]\n\n     is over twenty years old. No new reactors have been ordered \n     in this country for almost a quarter of a century, due at \n     least in part to extensive regulation and endless \n     construction delays--plus our national failure to address \n     high level waste.\n       We have created an environment for nuclear energy in the \n     United States wherein it isn't viewed as a sound investment. \n     We need absolute safety, that's a given. But could we have \n     that safety through approaches that don't drive nuclear \n     energy out of consideration for new plants?\n       The United States has developed the next generation of \n     nuclear power plants--which have been certified by the NRC \n     and are now being sold overseas. They are even safer than our \n     current models. Better yet, we have technologies under \n     development like passively safe reactors, lead-bismuth \n     reactors, and advanced liquid metal reactors that generate \n     less waste and are proliferation resistant.\n       A recent report by Dr. John Holdren, done at the \n     President's request, calls for a sharply enhanced national \n     effort. It urges a ``properly focused R effort to see if \n     the problems plaguing fission energy can be overcome--\n     economics, safety, waste, and proliferation.'' I have long \n     urged the conclusion of this report--that we dramatically \n     increase spending in these areas for reasons ranging from \n     reactor safety to non-proliferation.\n       I have not overlooked that nuclear waste issues loom as a \n     roadblock to increased nuclear utilization. I will return to \n     that subject.\n       For now, let me turn from nuclear power to nuclear weapons \n     issues.\n       Our current stockpile is set by bilateral agreements with \n     Russia. Bilateral agreements make sense if we are certain who \n     our future nuclear adversaries will be and they are useful to \n     force a transparent build-down by Russia. But our next \n     nuclear adversary may not be Russia--we do not want to find \n     ourselves limited by a treaty with Russia in a conflict with \n     another entity.\n       We need to decide what stockpile levels we really need for \n     our own best interests to deal with any future adversary.\n       For that reason, I suggest that, within the limits imposed \n     by START II, the United States move away from further treaty \n     imposed limitations to what I call a ``threat-based \n     stockpile.''\n       Based upon the threat I perceive right now, I think our \n     stockpile could be reduced. We need to challenge our military \n     planners to identify the minimum necessary stockpile size.\n       At the same time, as our stockpile is reduced and we are \n     precluded from testing, we have to increase our confidence in \n     the integrity of the remaining stockpile and our ability to \n     reconstitute if the threat changes. Programs like science-\n     based stockpile stewardship must be nurtured and supported \n     carefully.\n       As we seriously review stockpile size, we should also \n     consider stepping back from the nuclear cliff by de-alerting \n     and carefully reexamining the necessity of the ground-based \n     leg of the nuclear triad.\n       Costs certainly aren't the primary driver for our stockpile \n     size, but if some of the actions I've discussed were taken, \n     I'd bet that as a bonus we'd see some savings in the $30 \n     billion we spend each year on the nuclear triad.\n       Earlier I discussed the need to revisit some incorrect \n     premises that caused us to make bad decisions in the past. I \n     said that one of them, regarding reprocessing and MOX fuel, \n     may hamstring our efforts to permanently dismantle nuclear \n     weapons.\n       The dismantlement of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons \n     in Russia and the United States has left both countries with \n     large inventories of perfectly machined classified components \n     that could allow each country to rapidly rebuild nuclear \n     arsenals.\n       Both countries should set a goal of converting those excess \n     inventories into non-weapon shapes as quickly as possible. \n     The more permanent those transformations and the more \n     verification that can accompany the conversion of that \n     material, the better.\n       Language in this year's Energy and Water Development \n     Appropriations Legislation that I developed clearly sets out \n     the importance of converting those shapes as part of an \n     integrated plutonium disposition program.\n       Technical solutions exist. Pits can be transformed into \n     non-weapons shapes and weapon material can be burned in \n     reactors as MOX fuel--which, by the way, is what the National \n     Academy of Sciences has recommended. However, the proposal to \n     dispose of weapons plutonium as MOX runs into that old \n     premise that MOX is bad despite its widespread use by our \n     allies.\n       I believe that MOX is the best technical solution. The \n     economics of the MOX solution, however, need further study. \n     Ideally, incentives can be developed to speed Russian \n     materials conversion while reducing the cost of the U.S. \n     effort. We need an appropriate approach for MOX to address \n     its economic challenges--perhaps something paralleling the \n     U.S.-Russian agreement on Highly Enriched Uranium.\n       I said earlier that I would not advocate increased use of \n     nuclear energy and ignore the nuclear waste problem. The path \n     we've been following on Yucca Mountain sure isn't leading \n     anywhere very fast. I'm about ready to reexamine the whole \n     premise for Yucca Mountain.\n       We're on a course to bury all our spent nuclear fuel, \n     despite the fact that a spent nuclear fuel rod still has 60-\n     75% of its energy content--and despite the fact that Nevadans \n     need to be convinced that the material will not create a \n     hazard for over 100,000 years.\n       Reprocessing, even limited reprocessing, could help \n     mitigate the potential hazards in a repository, and could \n     help us recover the energy content of the spent fuel. Current \n     economics may argue against reprocessing based on present-day \n     fuel prices, but now we seem to be stuck with that old \n     decision to never reprocess, quite independent of any \n     economic arguments.\n       For Yucca Mountain, I propose we use interim storage now, \n     while we continue to actively advance toward the permanent \n     repository. In addition to collecting the nation's spent \n     nuclear fuel in one well secured facility, far from \n     population centers, interim storage also allows us to keep \n     our options open.\n       Those options might lead to attractive alternatives to the \n     current ideas for a permanent repository in the years before \n     we seal the repository. Incidentally, 65 Senators and 307 \n     Representatives agreed with the importance of interim \n     storage, but the Administration has only threatened to veto \n     any such progress and has shown no willingness to discuss \n     alternatives.\n       Let me highlight one attractive option. A group from \n     several of our largest companies, using technologies \n     developed at three of our national laboratories and from \n     Russian institutes and their nuclear navy, discussed with me \n     an approach to use spent nuclear fuel for electrical \n     generation. They use an accelerator, not a reactor, so there \n     is never any critical assembly.\n       There is minimal processing, but carefully done so that \n     weapons-grade materials are never separated or available for \n     potential diversion. Further, this isn't reprocessing in the \n     sense of repeatedly recirculating fissile materials back into \n     new reactor fuel--this is a system that integrates some \n     processing with the final disposition.\n       When they get done, only a little material goes into a \n     repository--but now the half lives are changed so that it's a \n     hazard for perhaps 300 years--a far cry from 100,000 years. \n     The industrial group believes that the sale of electricity \n     can go a long way toward offsetting the cost of the system, \n     so this process might not add large costs to our present \n     repository solution. Furthermore, it would dramatically \n     reduce any real or perceived risks with our present path. \n     This approach, Accelerator Transmutation of Waste, is an area \n     I want to see investigated aggressively.\n       I still haven't touched on all the issues embedded in \n     maximizing our nation's benefit from nuclear technologies, \n     and I can't do that without a much longer speech.\n       For example, I haven't discussed the increasingly desperate \n     need in the country for low level waste facilities like Ward \n     Valley in California. In California, important medical and \n     research procedures are at risk because the Administration \n     continues to block the State government from fulfilling their \n     responsibilities to care for low level waste.\n       And I haven't touched on the tremendous window of \n     opportunity that we now have in the former Soviet Union to \n     expand programs that protect nuclear material from moving \n     onto the black market or to shift the activities of former \n     Soviet weapons scientists onto commercial projects. Along \n     with Senators Nunn and Lugar, I've led the charge for these \n     programs. Those are programs directly in our national \n     interest. I know that some national leaders still think of \n     these programs as foreign aid, I believe they are sadly \n     mistaken.\n       We are realizing some of the benefits of nuclear \n     technologies today, but only a fraction of what we could \n     realize:\n       Nuclear weapons, for all their horror, brought to an end 50 \n     years of world-wide wars in which 60 million people died.\n       Nuclear power is providing about 20% of our electricity \n     needs now and many of our citizens enjoy healthier longer \n     lives through improved medical procedures that depend on \n     nuclear processes.\n       But we aren't tapping the full potential of the nucleus for \n     additional benefits. In the process, we are short-changing \n     our citizens.\n       I hope in these remarks that I have demonstrated my concern \n     for careful reevaluation of many ill-conceived fears, \n     policies and decisions that have seriously constrained our \n     use of nuclear technologies.\n       My intention is to lead a new dialogue with serious \n     discussion about the full range of nuclear technologies. I \n     intend to provide national leadership to overcome barriers.\n       While some may continue to lament that the nuclear genie is \n     out of his proverbial bottle, I'm ready to focus on \n     harnessing that genie as effectively and fully as possible, \n     for the largest set of benefits for our citizens.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Madam President, I am proud to join the Vice President, \nVice President Gore, Senator Conrad, and other colleagues, in support \nof comprehensive tobacco control legislation. I believe it is time for \nthe Congress to join the President's call to curb teenage smoking.\n  But I believe that as a U.S. Senator, as a Vermonter, and as the \nranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, that the HEALTHY Kids \nAct improves the proposed national tobacco settlement in two key \nareas--this is what I am looking at in tobacco settlements--that you \nhave to have full document disclosure and that there can be no immunity \nfor the tobacco industry.\n  The reason I say this, Madam President, is I have here a 1974 \nmarketing plan by RJR Tobacco.\n  In 1974 they were saying how they have to target the 14-to-24 age \ngroup. In 1974 they were saying how they had to put their ads together \nso that people in the 14-to-24-year-old group could be targeted, could \nbecome cigarette smokers, could become addicted, and once addicted \nwould remain their customers until they died. Of course, so many of \nthem did die of lung cancer and other tobacco-related diseases.\n  These documents became public almost a quarter of a century later \nonly because of the suits that are going on, only because of the forced \ndisclosure. I say whatever we do in tobacco legislation, make sure all \ndocuments have to be disclosed and make sure that there is no immunity \nto the tobacco industry.\n  I want to thank Senator Conrad for working with me to craft \nlegislative language that calls for full disclosure of all tobacco \nindustry documents relating to the health effects of tobacco products, \nthe control of nicotine in tobacco products and the marketing of \ntobacco products. This disclosure to the FDA includes key documents \nthat the industry may claim as privileged.\n  After internal review, the FDA has the authority to publish these \ndocuments to further the interests of public health. And these \ndocuments will be available on the Internet for every citizen to \nfinally learn the full truth about the tobacco industry.\n  Contrary to its public relations ploys, the tobacco industry is still \nusing stonewalling tactics to keep industry documents secret. Minnesota \nAttorney General Skip Humphrey has been prying loose documents that \nreveal much about the past practices of tobacco corporations. But the \ntobacco industry continues to abuse its attorney-client privilege by \ntrying to block damaging documents from being publicly released. Again, \nyesterday, the court in Minnesota found the tobacco industry improperly \nused the attorney-client privilege to hide thousands of industry \ndocuments.\n  This stonewalling will stop and the American people will know all the \nfacts about the tobacco industry under our bill. Second, our bill \nscraps the sweetheart deal of immunity for the tobacco industry from \npunitive damages and class action lawsuits that was in the proposed \nnational settlement.\n  Every day we learn more and more about documents that reveal industry \nschemes to market their deadly product to children and hide smoking-\nrelated health research.\n  Marketing cigarettes to 14 year-old children is outrageous. Is that \nthe kind of conduct that we should reward with unprecedented legal \nprotections? In the words of today's 14 year-olds, ``Get real.''\n  Under our bill, a state may resolve its attorney general suit or take \non the tobacco industry in court, as Minnesota is doing. It is up to \nthe people of that state, not a Washington knows best approach. I am \nconfident that Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell knows the facts \nin his lawsuit against big tobacco and will weigh the best interests of \nVermonters in making the decision whether to opt-in to the bill's \nsettlement provisions.\n  I strongly believe that this comprehensive tobacco control \nlegislation puts the interests of our children ahead of the interests \nof the tobacco lobby.\n  I look forward to working with President Clinton, Vice President \nGore, Senator Conrad and my other colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto enact it into law.\n  I thank again my good friend from Indiana. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, over the past 3 weeks or so, Independent \nCounsel Ken Starr has been the subject of a sustained attack by \nindividuals speaking on behalf of the President. Judging by some of \nthese statements, it seems there is little that the President's \nsurrogates are unwilling to say about Judge Starr. The objective of \nthese comments seems clear--to undermine public confidence in the very \nlegal processes designed to assure public integrity in the White House.\n  In an extraordinary televised interview, the First Lady accused the \nindependent counsel of being ``politically motivated'' by an \ninvestigation of the Monica Lewinsky matter and part of a ``vast right-\nwing conspiracy'' to bring down the President. Other Presidential \nadvisors have also taken to the airwaves, attacking Kenneth Starr as a \n``scumbag,'' and ``merchant of sleaze.'' One of these advisors went so \nfar as to declare war on Judge Starr and the Office of the Independent \nCounsel.\n  Now these tactics bring to mind the old adage known to every trial \nlawyer in the country: When you have the facts, argue the facts; when \nyou have the law, argue the law; and when you have neither the facts \nnor the law, go after the prosecutor, go after the witnesses, go after \nthe accuser, attack their credibility.\n  Yesterday in the Wall Street Journal in an editorial entitled \n``Spinning Starr,'' the editors state:\n\n       Events of recent days suggest that an analysis by Mr. \n     Clinton's legal team has concluded that their strongest \n     strategy is not to meet on the battlefield of facts and law, \n     but to conduct a political offensive against the independent \n     counsel and his staff.\n       No matter what opposition they've encountered--Paula Jones, \n     Linda Tripp, Kathleen Willey, Fred Thompson, Judge Royce \n     Lamberth--the Clinton side has always chosen the same \n     strategy of stonewalling, smash-mouth lawyering.\n\n  Madam President, for those of us who know Ken Starr and have watched \nand appreciated his distinguished career, the picture painted of this \nman by the President's people is virtually unrecognizable.\n  The President's people have asked us to forget Kenneth Starr's \nexemplary personal character, his service as the Nation's Solicitor \nGeneral, and his tenure in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  The President's people have asked us to forget the reputation he has \ngained for fairness and balance and good judgment that he earned \nthrough working with the Justice Department.\n  The President's people have asked us to forget the unpopular chances \nhe took in defending freedom of the press and freedom of religion \nduring his tenure as a Federal judge.\n  And most of all, the President's people have asked us to forget that \nKenneth Starr has brought to the independent counsel's office the \ncautious, deliberative mind of a judge and not the zeal of a \nprosecutor.\n  The President's attack machine has left us not with a caricature of \nKen Starr but with a smudge: Kenneth Starr, right-wing conspirator, \npartisan prosecutor, Republican hack.\n  Madam President, there is too much hanging in the balance of this \ninvestigation to permit these attacks on Judge Starr's character and \nreputation to go unchallenged. The fact is that even some of Kenneth \nStarr's most committed ideological opponents have in earlier times \npainted a very different picture of the man who is now at the receiving \nend of so much of the Clinton fury.\n  Some of you may have heard of Walter Dellinger. He is a professor of \nlaw at Duke University, a liberal democrat and the former head of the \nOffice of Legal Counsel under Attorney General Janet Reno. When Kenneth \nStarr was chosen as independent counsel, Professor Dellinger said, ``I \nhave known Ken\n\n[[Page S639]]\n\nStarr since he was one of my students at Duke Law School and I have \nalways known him to be a fair-minded person.''\n  An official with the American Civil Liberties Union said of Starr's \nappointment, ``I'd rather have him investigate me than almost anyone I \ncould think of.''\n  Alan Morrison, the cofounder of Public Citizen Litigation Group told \nTime magazine last week that the idea of Kenneth Starr as a right-wing \navenger is ``not the Ken Starr I know.''\n  When Democrats criticized Judge Starr's appointment as politically \ninspired, five former presidents of the American Bar Association \nrefused to call for his resignation, citing their ``Utmost confidence \nin his integrity and his objectivity.''\n  Just last week, Robert Bork, one of the sternest critics of the \nindependent counsel law, wrote that the Office of the Independent \nCounsel ``requires but does not always get an independent counsel of \nmoral strength and judicial temperament. Kenneth Starr is just such a \nprosecutor * * * He has conducted himself professionally and without a \ncredible hint of partisanship.''\n  The worlds of Kenneth Starr and the Clinton White House are \ncompletely different. The independent counsel has a reputation for \nintegrity and fairness. He is temperate by nature and has been \ncriticized by his own staff as being deliberative to a fault. Kenneth \nStarr regards justice not as a matter of winning or losing but as a \nsearch for the truth.\n  Madam President, if there is ever a time when we need an impartial \nindependent search for the truth, this is that time. A great deal does \nhang in the balance. We have important decisions to make relative to \nforeign policy of this Nation and the domestic policy of this Nation. \nIt is important that we be able to rest credibility and trust in the \nOffice of the Presidency. It is important that we elicit the facts and \nthe truth relative to the allegations swirling around the President and \nthe White House at this particular time.\n  I can think of no fairer minded nor nonpartisan, capable individual \nthan the current independent prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, and I think it \nwould be appropriate if all of us let him do his job.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S638-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S639-S640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ATTACKS ON KENNETH STARR\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I rise today to make a couple of \nobservations. One is that it is very apparent that there is a concerted \nattack on Kenneth Starr, the court-appointed independent counsel \ninvestigating several serious allegations against the Clinton \nadministration. Some of those attacks were made today on the floor of \nthe Senate. I believe a previous attack was made earlier in the week in \nthe Senate. And I think Mrs. Clinton joined in the attack on Judge \nStarr. So, there appears to be a concerted attempt by the President, \nhis staff, his wife, and others to attack Kenneth Starr as the \nindependent counsel. I just think that is inappropriate.\n  Just for the information of my colleagues, I have known Ken Starr. I \nunderstand that he clerked for the Supreme Court for Chief Justice \nWarren Burger when he got out of law school. I got to know him when he \nwas assistant and chief of staff to Attorney General William French \nSmith during the Reagan administration. That is the first time I got to \nknow him. And I remember him when he served as Solicitor General of the \nUnited States and argued cases on behalf of the United States before \nthe Supreme Court. I happened to sit in on one or two. In one case that \nI remember in particular, he did a very fine job. He represented the \nUnited States very well. I don't remember anybody ever making any \nallegations that he was a right-wing conspirator at that time.\n  He served as a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals with \nJustices Scalia and Ginsburg, and he served with distinction. I don't \nremember hearing one scintilla of negative comments of his service \nthere.\n  He was chosen--and this is interesting--by the Senate to review \nSenator Packwood's diaries that dealt with a sex scandal in the Senate. \nThat was a very sensitive issue and not an easy one. And probably not a \njob that he had any interest in doing either. But it shows that, yes, \nhe handled that, and he handled it very professionally. I think \neveryone in the Senate would have to acknowledge that.\n  Judge Starr has taught constitutional law at New York University Law \nSchool, a very prestigious law school. He was chosen by the three-judge \ncourt to take over as independent counsel and replace Robert Fiske in \nhis investigation of Whitewater and related matters. He was chosen for \nthis job by the court. I don't believe he campaigned for it. He was \nselected by a three-judge panel.\n  So he worked for the Senate, he worked in the Attorney General's \noffice, in the Solicitor General's office, he served as a judge, and he \ntaught--all of which he did with distinction.\n  So I really regret that many people in the administration, and now \nsome of our colleagues, are attacking Ken Starr--impugning his motives, \nraising charges of conflict of interest, and so on. I think that is \nreally unfortunate.\n  I happen to also think it is intended as a diversion. I think it is a \npattern that we have seen followed by this administration time and time \nagain when they are feeling pressure from an investigation or emerging \nscandal.\n  It is unfortunate, but this administration has been plagued by \nscandals since prior to President Clinton's election in 1992. It seems \nlike there is a repetitive pattern of attacking whoever that scandal \nhappens to be involved with--whether it was Gennifer Flowers, when she \nwas attacked; Paula Jones, when she was attacked; the FBI, when \ninvestigating the FBI files matter. A couple FBI people lost their jobs \nover that unfortunate incident. The travel office employees were \nattacked, when Billy Dale was investigated. The Justice Department was \ncalled in to investigate Billy Dale. So time and time again, it seems \nlike there is a pattern that if there is a complaint, we all of a \nsudden start hearing negative stories.\n  When it became well known that FBI Director Louis \nFreeh's recommendation was that an independent counsel should be \nappointed to investigate possible campaign abuses by the Clinton \nadministration, all of a sudden we start hearing negative stories about \nDirector Freeh and the White House's lack of confidence in his work. \nThere was even some speculation that he would be fired. Well, he could \nnot be fired, he had a 10-year term. I think it is very unfortunate.\n\n  Mrs. Clinton was on television talking about a ``right-wing \nconspiracy,'' and about all these groups spreading stories. I don't \nthink Ken Starr has anything to do with any alleged right-wing \nconspiracy, nothing whatsoever. I don't think he has ever had that \nstrong of a political philosophy or involvement with partisan issues. \nHe has been a judge, he has been working at the Justice Department and \nteaching law school. I just don't think that's the case. I certainly \ndon't think that the President's own personal secretary was part of a \nright-wing conspiracy. So I am just bothered by that.\n  I think that we see a concerted effort by the administration to have \na diversion. Certainly this latest scandal is serious. There were \nallegations that were brought to Ken Starr's attention, and he took \nthem to the Attorney General for authority to investigate. She gave a \nrecommendation to the three-judge court to expand his authority to \ninvestigate. Janet Reno recommended to the three-judge panel that these \nlatest allegations concerning the sex scandal be investigated. That is \nwhat Ken Starr is doing.\n  So I hope that my colleagues will tone down their rhetoric. I hope \nthis administration will tone down the rhetoric and quit attacking Ken \nStarr and maybe cooperate with the investigation and let the facts be \nknown.\n  I hope that nothing happened. I hope that there is nothing to this \nscandal. But I think the President should tell the truth. I think that \nthe American people are entitled to the truth and, hopefully, it will \ncome out very shortly. Then we can go on and do the Nation's business--\nas the President has\n\n[[Page S640]]\n\ncalled for. But when there are allegations of perjury, or obstruction \nof justice, coaching witnesses, or trying to get people to leave town \nso maybe they would not testify--these are serious charges. I might \nremind colleagues that President Nixon was on the road to impeachment \nnot because he broke into the Watergate, but because of charges of \nperjury, tampering with a witness and obstruction of justice.\n  So these are serious charges, but they don't need to be investigated \non the floor of the Senate. It is possible that at some point the \nSenate will have a role; I don't know. But I don't think it is proper \nor right to have this campaign of attack and smear on Ken Starr. I \nthink it undermines the judicial process and really undermines those \npeople who are making such charges. Madam President, I hope that our \ncolleagues and others will allow the independent counsel to do his \nwork.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth).

Debate on the nomination is limited to 2 hours \nequally divided and controlled by the Senator from Utah and the Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of \nMargaret Morrow to the Federal District bench in California.\n  Ms. Morrow enjoys broad bipartisan support, and it is no wonder. She \ngraduated magna cum laude from Bryn Mawr College, and cum laude from \nthe Harvard Law School. She is presently a partner at Arnold and Porter \nin their Los Angeles office where she handles virtually all of that \noffice's appellate litigation.\n  I plan to outline in greater detail why I intend to support Ms. \nMorrow's nomination. But first I would like to discuss the Judiciary \nCommittee's record with respect to the confirmation of President \nClinton's judicial nominees.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of the most \nimportant duties I fulfill is in screening judicial nominees. Indeed, \nthe Constitution itself obligates the Senate to provide the President \nadvice concerning his nominees, and to consent to their ultimate \nconfirmation. Although some have complained about the pace at which the \ncommittee has moved on judicial nominees, I note that it has undertaken \nits duty in a deliberate and serious fashion. Indeed, with respect to \nMs. Morrow, there were concerns. Her answers to the committee were not \nentirely responsive. Rather than simply pushing the nomination forward, \nhowever, I believed it was important for the committee to ensure that \nits questions were properly answered. Thus, the committee submitted \nwritten questions for Ms. Morrow to clarify some of her additional \nresponses. And, having reviewed Ms. Morrow's answers to the questions \nposed by the committee, I became satisfied that she would uphold the \nConstitution and abide by the rule of law.\n  In fact, we held two hearings in Margaret Morrow's case, as I recall, \nand the second hearing was, of course, to clarify some of these issues \nwithout which we might not have had Ms. Morrow's nomination up even to \nthis day.\n  Thus, I think it fair to say that the committee has fairly and \nresponsibly dealt with the President's nominees. Indeed, the Judiciary \nCommittee has already held a judicial confirmation hearing, and has \nanother planned for February 25. Thus, the committee will have held two \nnomination hearings in the first month of the session.\n  I note that Judiciary Committee processed 47 of the President's \nnominees last session, including Ms. Morrow. Today there are more \nsitting judges than there were throughout virtually all of the Reagan \nand Bush administrations. Currently, there are 756 active Federal \njudges. In addition, there are 432 senior Federal judges who must by \nlaw continue to hear cases. Even in the ninth circuit, which has 10 \nvacancies, only one judge has actually stopped hearing cases. The \nothers have taken senior status, and are still actively participating \nin that court's work. I am saying that the other nine judges have taken \nsenior status. Those who have retired, or those who have taken senior \nstatus, are still hearing cases. The total pool of Federal judges \navailable to hear cases is 1,188, a near record number.\n  I have sought to steer the confirmation process in a way that kept it \na fair and a principled one, and exercised what I felt was the \nappropriate degree of deference to the President's judicial appointees.\n  I would like to personally express my gratitude and compliments to \nSenator Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, for his \ncooperative efforts this past year. In fact, I would like my colleagues \nto note that a portrait of Senator Leahy will be unveiled this very \nevening in the Agriculture Committee hearing room. This is an honor \nthat I believe my distinguished colleague justly deserves for his \nefforts on that great committee. I want Senator Leahy to know that I \nplan on attending that portrait unveiling itself even though this \ndebate is taking place on the floor between 4 and 6 today.\n\n  It is in this spirit of cooperation and fairness that I will vote to \nconfirm Ms. Morrow. Conducting a fair confirmation process, however, \ndoes not mean granting the President carte blanche in filling judicial \nvacancies. It means assuring that those who are confirmed will uphold \nthe Constitution and abide by the rule of law.\n  Based upon the committee's review of her record, I believe that the \nevidence demonstrates that Margaret Morrow will be such a person. Ms. \nMorrow likely would not be my choice if I were sitting in the Oval \nOffice. But the President is sitting there, and he has seen fit to \nnominate her.\n  She has the support of the Senators from California. And the review \nconducted by the Judiciary Committee suggests that she understands the \nproper role of a judge in our Federal system and will abide by the rule \nof law. There is no doubt that Ms. Morrow is, in terms of her \nprofessional experience and abilities, qualified to serve as a Federal \ndistrict court judge. I think the only question that may be plaguing \nsome of my colleagues is whether she will abide by the rule of law. As \nI have stated elsewhere, nominees who are or who are likely to be \njudicial activists are not qualified to serve as Federal judges, and \nthey should neither be nominated nor confirmed. And I want my \ncolleagues to know that when such individuals come before the Judiciary \nCommittee I will vociferously oppose them. In fact, many of the people \nthat have been suggested by the administration have been stopped before \nthey have been sent up. And that is where most of the battles occur, \nand that is where most of the work between the White House and myself \nreally occurs. I have to compliment the White House in recognizing that \nsome people that they wish they could have put on the bench were not \nappropriate persons to put on the bench because of their attitudes \ntowards the rule of law primarily.\n  While I initially had some concerns that Ms. Morrow might be an \nactivist, I have concluded, based on all the information before the \ncommittee, that a compelling case cannot be made against her. While it \nis often difficult to tell whether a nominee's words before \nconfirmation will match that nominee's deeds after confirmation, I \nbelieve that this nominee in particular deserves the benefit of the \ndoubt. And\n\n[[Page S641]]\n\nall nominees deserve the benefit of the doubt, unless the contrary is \nsubstantial--or, should I say, less evidence to the contrary is \nsubstantial. In my view, there is not sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that Ms. Morrow will engage in judicial activism. In fact, \nMs. Morrow has assured the committee that she will abide by the rule of \nlaw, and will not substitute her preferences for the dictates of the \nConstitution.\n  If Ms. Morrow is a woman of her word, and I believe she is, I am \nconfident that she will serve the country with distinction.\n  I would like briefly to address some of the questions raised by those \nwho oppose Ms. Morrow's nomination. Perhaps the most troubling evidence \nof potential activism that Ms. Morrow's critics advance comes from \nseveral speeches she has given while president of the Los Angeles, CA, \nBar Association. At the fourth annual Conference on Women in the Law, \nfor example, Ms. Morrow gave a speech in which she stated that ``the \nlaw is almost by definition on the cutting edge of social thought. It \nis a vehicle through which we ease the transition from the rules which \nhave always been to the rules which are to be.''\n  Now, if Ms. Morrow was speaking here about ``the law'' and ``rules'' \nin a substantive sense, I would have no choice but to read these \nstatements as professing a belief in judicial activism. On that basis \nalone, I would likely have opposed her nomination. However, Ms. Morrow \nrepeatedly and somewhat animatedly testified before the committee that \nshe was not speaking substantively of the law itself but, rather, was \nreferring to the legal profession and the rules by which it governs \nitself.\n  When the committee went back and examined the context of Ms. Morrow's \nspeech, it concluded that this explanation was in keeping with the \ntheme of her speech.\n  In her inaugural address as president of the State Bar of California \non October 9, 1993, Ms. Morrow quoted then Justice William Brennan, \nstating that ``Justice can only endure and flourish if law and legal \ninstitutions are engines of change able to accommodate evolving \npatterns of life and social interaction.''\n  Here again some were troubled that Ms. Morrow seemed to be advocating \njudicial activism. Ms. Morrow, however, assured the committee that she \nwas not suggesting that courts themselves should be engines of change. \nIn response to the committee she testified as follows:\n\n       The theme of that speech was that the State Bar of \n     California as an institution and the legal profession had to \n     change some of the ways we did business. The quotation \n     regarding engines of change had nothing to do with changes in \n     the rule of law or changes in constitutional interpretation.\n\n  Once again, the committee went back and scrutinized Ms. Morrow's \nspeech and found that its theme was in fact changes the bar should make \nand did not advance the theme that courts should be engines of social \nchange. The committee found the nominee's explanation of the use of the \nquotation, given its context, very plausible. In addition, the nominee \nwent to some lengths in her oral testimony and her written responses to \nthe committee to espouse a clearly restrained approach to \nconstitutional interpretation and the rule of the courts. Frankly, much \nof what she has said under oath goes a long way toward legitimized, \nvery restrained jurisprudence that some of our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle called out of the mainstream just a decade ago.\n  For example, she testified that she would attempt to interpret the \nConstitution ``consistent with the intent of the drafters.'' She later \nexplained in more detail that judges should use the constitutional text \n``as a starting point, and using that language and whatever information \nthere is respecting the intent behind that language one ought to \nattempt then to decide the case consistent with that intent.''\n  She later testified that judges should not ``by incremental changes \nease the law from one arena to another in a policy sense.'' And in \nwritten correspondence with the committee, Ms. Morrow further \nelaborated on her constitutional jurisprudence by highlighting the case \nwhich in her view adopted the proper methodology to constitutional \ninterpretation.\n  As she explained, in that case the Court ``looked first to the \nlanguage of the Constitution,'' then ``buttressed its reading'' of the \ntext by ``looking to the language of other constitutional provisions.'' \nAnd finally to ``the intent of those who drafted and ratified this \nlanguage as reflected in the Federalist Papers, debates of the \nConstitutional Convention and other writings of the time.''\n  Contrary to the claim that she condemns all voter initiatives, Ms. \nMorrow has actually sought to ensure that voters have meaningful ways \nof evaluating such initiatives.\n  In a widely circulated article, Ms. Morrow noted that the intensive \nadvertising campaigns that surround citizen initiatives often focus \nunfairly on the measure's sponsor rather than the initiative's \nsubstance. This made it hard, she argued, for voters to make meaningful \nchoices and ``renders ephemeral any real hope of intelligent voting by \na majority.''\n  Read in its proper context, this statement seized upon by Ms. \nMorrow's critics was a statement concerning the quality of information \ndisseminated to the voters, not a comment on the voters' ability to \nmake intelligent policy choices. Thus Ms. Morrow's statement is not \nparticularly controversial but in fact highly respectful of the role \nvoters must play in our electoral system. In fact, Ms. Morrow argued \nthat the courts should not be placed in a position of policing the \ninitiative process. She explained that ``having passed an initiative, \nthe voters want to see it enacted. They view a court challenge to its \nvalidity as interference with the public will.''\n\n  For this reason, Ms. Morrow advocated reforms to the California \ninitiative process to take a final decision on ballot measures out of \nthe hands of judges and to place it back into the hands of the people.\n  In supporting this nomination, I took into account a number of \nfactors, including Ms. Morrow's testimony, her accomplishments and her \nevident ability as an attorney, as well as the fact that she has \nreceived strong support, bipartisan support from both Democrats and \nRepublicans. Republicans included Ninth Circuit Judges Cynthia Hall, \nSteven Trott and Pamela Rymer, Reagan-Bush appointees, as well as Rob \nBonner, a respected conservative, former Federal judge and head of the \ndrug enforcement agency under President Bush.\n  I know all of these people personally. They are all strong \nconservatives. They are really decent people. They are as concerned as \nyou or I or anybody else about who we place on the Federal bench, and \nthey are strongly in favor of Margaret Morrow, as are many, many other \nRepublicans. And they are not just people who live within the district \nwhere she will be a judge. They are some eminent judges themselves.\n  I have a rough time seeing why anybody basically under all these \ncircumstances would oppose this nominee. Each of those individuals I \nmentioned and others, such as Richard Riordan, the Republican mayor of \nLos Angeles, have assured the committee that Ms. Morrow will not be a \njudicial activist. I hope they are correct. And at least on this point \nI have seen little evidence in the record that would suggest to me that \nshe would fail to abide by the rule of law once she achieves the bench \nand practices on the bench and fulfills her responsibility as a judge \non the bench.\n  In sum, I support this nominee and I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame. I am also pleased, with regard to these judicial nominees, that \nno one on our side has threatened to ever filibuster any of these \njudges, to my knowledge. I think it is a travesty if we ever start \ngetting into a game of filibustering judges. I have to admit my \ncolleagues on the other side attempted to do that on a number of \noccasions the last number of years during the Reagan-Bush years. They \nalways backed off, but maybe they did because they realized there were \nnot the votes to invoke cloture. But I really think it is a travesty if \nwe treat this third branch of Government with such disregard that we \nfilibuster judges.\n  The only way I could ever see that happening is if a person is so \nabsolutely unqualified to sit on the bench that the only way you could \nstop that person is to filibuster that nominee. Even then, I question \nwhether that should be done. We are dealing with a\n\n[[Page S642]]\n\ncoequal branch of Government. We are dealing with some of the most \nimportant nominations a President, whoever that President may be, will \nmake. And we are also dealing with good faith on both sides of the \nfloor.\n  I have to say, during some of the Reagan and Bush years, I thought \nour colleagues on the other side were reprehensible in some of the \nthings they did with regard to Reagan and Bush judges, but by and large \nthe vast majority of them were put through without any real fuss or \nbother even though my colleagues on the other side, had they been \nPresident, would not have appointed very many of those judges. We have \nto show the same good faith on our side, it seems to me. And unless you \nhave an overwhelming case, as may be the case in the nomination of \nJudge Massiah-Jackson, unless you have an overwhelming case, then \ncertainly I don't see any reason for anybody filibustering judges. I \nhope that we never get into that. Let's make our case if we have \ndisagreement, and I have to say that some of my colleagues disagree \nwith this nomination, and they do it legitimately, sincerely, and I \nthink with intelligence, but I think they are wrong. And that is after \nhaving been part of this process for 22 years now and always trying to \nbe fair, whoever is the President of the United States and whoever the \nnominees are.\n  It is important because most of the fight has to occur behind the \nscenes. It has to occur between honest people in the White House and \nhonest people up here. And that's where the battles are. When they get \nthis far, generally most of them should be approved. There are some \nthat we have problems with still in the Judiciary Committee, but that \nis our job to look at them. That is our job to look into their \nbackground. It is our job to screen these candidates. And, as you can \nsee, in the case of Massiah-Jackson we had these accusations but nobody \nwas willing to stand up and say them. I am not about to rely on \nunsubstantiated accusations by anybody. I will rely on the witness \nherself in that case. But we never quit investigating in the committee, \nand even though Massiah-Jackson was passed out of the committee, the \ninvestigation continued and ultimately we find a supernumber of people, \nvery qualified people, people in that area who have a lot to do with \nlaw and justice are now opposed to that nomination. We cannot ignore \nthat. But that is the way the system works. We have had judges withdraw \nafter we have approved them in the Judiciary Committee because \nsomething has come up to disturb their nomination.\n  That is the way it should work. This is not a numbers game. These are \namong the most important nominations that any President can make and \nthat the Senate can ever work on. In the case of Margaret Morrow, I \npersonally have examined the whole record, and, like I say, maybe \npeople on our side would not have appointed her if they were President, \nbut they are not the President. And unless there is an overwhelming \ncase to be made against a judge, I have a very difficult--and \nespecially this one; there is not--I have to say that I think we do a \ngreat injustice if we do not support this nomination.\n  So with that, I will yield the floor.\n  How much time does the distinguished Senator need?\n  Mrs. BOXER. About 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  If my colleague would prefer to control the time on his side, I would \nbe happy--should I yield to the Senator?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would prefer we yield to Senator Leahy given his \nschedule.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let's split the time. You control half the time, and I \nwill control half. You can make the determination, or if you would \nlike----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is there remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 36 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wonder if I might yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this really has been a long time coming, \nand I appreciate the effort of my friend, the chairman, who is on the \nfloor, to support this nomination. I commend my good friend, the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Boxer, who has been indefatigable in this \neffort. She has worked and worked and worked. I believe she has spoken \nto every single Senator, every single potential Senator, every single \npast Senator, certainly to all the judges, and she has been at us over \nand over again to make sure that this day would come. She has worked \nwith the Republican leader, the Democratic leader, and Republican and \nDemocratic Senators alike. I appreciate all that she has done. We have \nall been aided by our colleague, Senator Feinstein. She has spoken out \nstrongly for Margaret Morrow as a member of the Judiciary Committee and \nas a Senator.\n  I feel though, as Senator Boxer has said, that none of us would have \npredicted that it would take 21 months to get this nomination before \nthe Senate. I know that we would not even be here now if the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah and the distinguished majority leader \nhad not made the commitment before we broke last fall to proceed to \nthis nomination this week.\n  I have spoken about this nomination so many times I have almost lost \ntrack of the number. I will not speak as long as I would otherwise \ntoday because I want to yield to the Senator from California. But I \nthink people should know that for some time there was an unexplained \nhold on this outstanding nominee. This is a nominee, incidentally, who \nwas reported out of the Judiciary Committee twice. This is a nominee \nwho is the first woman to be the president of the California State Bar \nAssociation and a president of the Los Angeles County bar.\n  This is a nominee who is a partner in a prestigious law firm. This is \na nominee who has the highest rating that lawyers can be given when \nthey come before our committee for approval as a judge. This is a woman \nabout whom letters were sent to me and to other Senators from some of \nthe leading Republicans and some of the leading Democrats in California \nand from others whose background I know only because of their \nreputations, extraordinary reputations. I have no idea what their \npolitics are. But all of them, whether they describe themselves as \nconservatives, liberals, moderates or apolitical, all of them say what \nan extraordinary woman she is. And I agree.\n  I have read all of the reports about her. I have read all the things \npeople said in her favor, and the things, ofttimes anonymous, said \nagainst her. I look at all those and I say of this woman: If I were a \nlitigant, plaintiff or defendant, government or defendant, no matter \nwhat side I was on, I could look at this woman and say I am happy to \ncome into her court. I am happy to have my case heard by her--whether I \nam rich, poor, white, black, no matter what might be my background. I \nknow she would give a fair hearing.\n  Now, finally, after 12 months on the Senate calendar without action \nover the course of the last 3 years, I am glad that the debate is \nbeginning. I am also glad we can now look forward to the end of the \nordeal for Margaret Morrow, for her family, her friends and her \nsupporters.\n  Her supporters include the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and \nhalf the Republican members on that committee. The Republican Mayor of \nLos Angeles, Richard Riordan, calls her ``an excellent addition to the \nFederal bench.'' All of these people have praised her.\n  To reiterate, this day has been a long time coming. When this \naccomplished lawyer was first nominated by the President of the United \nStates to fill a vacancy on the District Court for the Central District \nof California, none of us would have predicted that it would be more \nthan 21 months before that nomination was considered by the United \nStates Senate.\n  I thank the Majority Leader and the Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for fulfilling the commitment made late last year to turn to \nthis nomination before the February recess. Fairness to the people and \nlitigants in the Central District of California and to Margaret Morrow \nand her family demand no less.\n  I trust that those who credit local law enforcement and local \nprosecutors and local judges from time to time as it suits them will \ncredit the views of the many California judges and local officials who \nhave written to the Senate over the last several months in support of \nthe confirmation of Margaret Morrow. I will cite just a few examples:\n\n[[Page S643]]\n\nLos Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block; Orange County District \nAttorney Michael R. Capizzi; former U.S. Attorney and former head of \nthe DEA under President Bush, Robert C. Bonner; former Reagan Assistant \nAttorney General of the Criminal Division and former Associate Attorney \nGeneral and current Ninth Circuit Judge Stephen S. Trott; and \nCalifornia Court of Appeals Associate Justice H. Walter Croskey.\n  I deeply regret that confirmation as a Federal Judge is becoming more \nlike a political campaign for these nominees. They are being required \nto gather letters of support and urge their friends, colleagues and \nclients to support their candidacy or risk being mischaracterized by \nthose who do not know them.\n  Margaret Morrow's background, training, temperament, character and \nskills are beyond reproach. She is a partner in the law firm of Arnold \n& Porter. She has practiced law for 24 years. A distinguished graduate \nof Bryn Mawr College and Harvard Law School, Ms. Morrow was the first \nwoman President of the California State Bar Association and a former \npresident of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. She has had the \nstrong and unwavering support of Senator Boxer and Senator Feinstein of \nCalifornia.\n  In light of her qualifications, it was no surprise that in 1996 she \nwas unanimously reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. In 1997 her \nnomination was again reported favorably, this time by a vote of 13 to \n5.\n  Yet hers has been an arduous journey to Senate consideration. She has \nbeen targeted--targeted by extremists outside the Senate whose $1.4 \nmillion fundraising and lobbying campaign against judges needed a \nvictim. As our debate will show today, they chose the wrong woman.\n  Lest someone accuse us of gratuitously injecting gender into this \ndebate, I note the following: Her critics have gone so far as to deny \nher the courtesy of referring to her as Ms. Morrow. Instead, they went \nout of their way repeatedly to refer to her as ``Miss'' in a Washington \nTimes op ed. Margaret Morrow is married to a distinguished California \nState Court Judge and is the proud mother of a 10-year-old son. It is \nbad enough that her words are taken out of context, her views \nmisrepresented and her nomination used as a ideological prop. She is \nentitled to be treated with respect.\n  Nor was this reference inadvertent. The first point of criticism in \nthat piece was her membership in California Women Lawyers, which is \ncriticized for supporting parental leave legislation.\n  Senator Feinstein posed the question whether Margaret Morrow was held \nto a different standard than men nominees. That is a question that has \ntroubled me throughout this process. I was likewise concerned to see \nthat of the 14 nominees left pending at the end of last year whose \nnominations had been pending the longest, 12 were women and minority \nnominees. I did not know, until Senator Kennedy's statement to the \nSenate earlier this year, that judicial nominees who are women are now \nfour times as likely as men to take over a year to confirm.\n  At the same time, I note that Senator Hatch, who supports this \nnomination, included two women whose nominations have been pending for \nmore than a year and one-half, at last week's Judiciary Committee \nhearing. I also note that the Senate did vote last month to confirm \nJudge Ann Aiken to the Oregon District Court. So one of the four \narticle III judges confirmed so far this year was a woman nominee.\n  Margaret Morrow has devoted her career to the law, to getting women \ninvolved in the practice of law and to making lawyers more responsive \nand responsible. Her good work in this regard should not be punished \nbut commended.\n  As part of those efforts Margaret Morrow gave a speech at a Women in \nthe Law Conference in April 1994. That speech was later reprinted in a \nlaw review. Critics have seized upon a phrase or two from that speech, \nripped them out of context and contended that they show Margaret Morrow \nwould be an unprincipled judicial activist. They are wrong. Their \nargument was refuted by Ms. Morrow in her testimony before the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  This criticism merely demonstrates the critics own indifference to \nthe setting and context of the speech and its meaning for women who \nhave worked so hard to achieve success in the legal profession. Her \nspeech was about how the bar is begrudgingly adjusting to women in the \nlegal profession. How telling that critics would fasten on that \nparticular speech on women in the law and see it as something to \ncriticize.\n  Margaret Morrow spoke then about ``the struggles and successes'' of \nwomen practices law and ``the challenges which continue to face us day \nto day in the 1990s.'' Margaret Morrow has met every challenge. In the \ncourse of this confirmation, she has been forced to run a gauntlet. She \nhas endured false charges and unfounded criticism. Her demeanor and \ndignity have never wavered. She has, again, been called upon to be a \nrole model.\n  The President of the Woman Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, the \nPresident of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, the President of the Los \nAngeles County Bar Association, the President of the National \nConference of Women's Bar Association and other distinguished attorneys \nfrom the Los Angeles area have all written the Senate in support of the \nnomination of Margaret Morrow. They wrote that: ``Margaret Morrow is \nwidely respected by attorneys, judges and community leaders of both \nparties.'' She ``is exactly the kind of person who should be appointed \nto such a position and held up as an example to young women across the \ncountry.'' I could not agree more.\n  By letter dated February 4, 1998, a number of organizations including \nthe Alliance for Justice, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and \nwomen's lawyer associations from California likewise wrote urging \nconfirmation of Margaret Morrow without further delay. I ask that a \ncopy of that letter be included in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 February 4, 1998.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: We write to express our concern over a \n     series of developments that continue to unfold in the Senate \n     that are undermining the judicial confirmation process. These \n     include calls for the impeachment of judges, a slowdown in \n     the pace of confirmations, unjustified criticisms of certain \n     nominees, and efforts to leave appellate vacancies unfilled. \n     Some court observers have opined that collectively these are \n     the most serious efforts to curtail judicial independence \n     since President Roosevelt's plan to pack the Supreme Court in \n     1937.\n       In the past year nominees who failed to meet certain \n     ultraconservative litmus tests have been labeled ``judicial \n     activists.'' While these charges are unfounded, they \n     nonetheless delay confirmations and leave judicial seats \n     unfilled. We note that of the 14 individuals whose \n     nominations have been pending the longest, 12 are women or \n     minorities. This disturbing pattern is in striking contrast \n     to those 14 judges who were confirmed in 1997 in the shortest \n     period of time, 11 of whom are white men. For example, \n     Margaret Morrow, a judicial nominee to the United States \n     District Court for the Central District of California, was \n     nominated more than a year and a half ago. Not only is she an \n     outstanding candidate, but her credentials have earned her \n     enthusiastic and bipartisan endorsements from leaders of the \n     bar, judges, politicians, and civic groups.\n       An honors graduate from Harvard Law School, a civil \n     litigator for more than 20 years, winner of numerous legal \n     awards, and the first female president of the California Bar \n     Association, Morrow has the breadth of background and \n     experience to make her an excellent judge, and in the words \n     of one of her sponsors, she would be ``an exceptionally \n     distinguished addition to the federal bench.'' Morrow has \n     also shown, through her numerous pro bono activities, a \n     demonstrated commitment to equal justice. As president of the \n     Los Angeles County Bar Association, she created the Pro Bono \n     Council, the first of its kind in California. During her year \n     as bar president, the Council coordinated the provision of \n     150,000 hours of previously untapped representation to \n     indigent clients throughout the county. Not surprisingly, the \n     American Bar Association's judicial evaluation committee gave \n     her its highest rating.\n       Republicans and Democrats alike speak highly of her \n     accomplishments and qualifications. Robert Bonner, a Reagan-\n     appointed U.S. Attorney and U.S. District Judge for the \n     Central District of California and head of the Drug \n     Enforcement Administration during the Bush Administration, \n     has said Morrow is a ``brilliant person with a first-rate \n     legal mind who was nominated upon merit, not political \n     affiliation.'' Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block wrote \n     that, ``Margaret Morrow is an extremely hard working \n     individual of impeccable character and integrity. . . . I \n     have no doubt that she would\n\n[[Page S644]]\n\n     be a distinguished addition to the Court.'' Other supporters \n     include local bar leaders; officials from both parties, \n     including Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan; California \n     judges appointed by the state's last three governors; and \n     three Republican-appointed Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \n     judges, Pamela Rymer, Cynthia Holcomb Hall, and Stephen \n     Trott.\n       Despite here outstanding record, Morrow has become the \n     target of a coordinated effort by ultraconservative groups \n     that seek to politicize the judiciary. They have subjected \n     her to a campaign of misrepresentations, distortions and \n     attacks on her record, branding her a ``judicial activist.'' \n     According to her opponents, she deserves to be targeted \n     because ``she is a member of California Women Lawyers,'' an \n     absurd charge given that this bipartisan organization is \n     among the most highly respected in the state. Another \n     ``strike'' against her is her concern, expressed in a \n     sentence from a 1988 article, about special interest \n     domination of the ballot initiative process in California. \n     Her opponents view the statement as disdainful of voter \n     initiatives such as California's term limits law; however, \n     they overlook the fact that the article outlines a series of \n     recommended reforms to preserve the process. It is a stretch \n     to construe suggested reforms as evidence of ``judicial \n     activism,'' but to search for this members of the Judiciary \n     Committee unprecedentedly asked her to disclose her personal \n     positions on all 160 past ballot propositions in California.\n       Morrow's confirmation has been delayed by the Senate beyond \n     any reasonable bounds. Originally selected over nineteen \n     months ago in May 1996, her nomination was unanimously \n     approved by the Judiciary Committee that year, only to \n     languish on the Senate floor. Morrow was again nominated at \n     the beginning of 1997, subjected to an unusual second \n     hearing, and recommended again by the Judiciary Committee, \n     after which several Senators placed secret holds on her \n     nomination, preventing a final vote on her confirmation. \n     These holds, which prevented a final vote on her confirmation \n     during the 1st Session of the 105th Congress, where recently \n     lifted.\n       As Senator Orrin Hatch repeatedly said: ``playing politics \n     with judges is unfair, and I'm sick of it.'' We agree with \n     his sentiment. Given Margaret Morrow's impressive \n     qualifications, we urge you to bring the nomination to the \n     Senate floor, ensure that it receives prompt, full and fair \n     consideration, and that a final vote on her nomination is \n     scheduled as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alliance for Justice: Nan Aron, President.\n       American Jewish Congress: Phil Baum, Executive Director.\n       Americans for Democratic Action: Amy Isaacs, National \n     Director.\n       Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law: Robert Bernstein, \n     Executive Law.\n       Brennan Center for Justice: E.

It is time. It is time to stop holding her hostage and \nhelp all Americans, and certainly those who are within the district \nthat this court will cover in California. It is time to help the cause \nof justice. It is time to improve the bench of the United States. It is \ntime to confirm this woman. And it is time for the U.S. Senate to say \nwe made a mistake in holding it up this long. Let us go forward.\n  Mr. President, if the Senator from Utah has no objection, I would \nlike now to yield, and yield control of whatever time I might have, to \nthe Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to Senator Leahy, before he leaves the floor, and \nbecause Senator Hatch in his absence explained the wonderful tribute he \nis going to have shortly with his portrait being hung in the \nAgriculture room, and he himself said that he is so respectful of you \nand wants to show his respect so much that he is going to join you, so \nthat will leave me here on the floor to debate with the Senator from \nMissouri--before you leave the floor I wanted to say to you and to \nSenator Hatch together, and I say this from the bottom of my heart, \nwithout the two of you looking fairly at this nomination, this day \nwould never have come.\n  To me it is, in a way, a moving moment. So often we stand on the \nfloor and we talk about delays and so on and so forth. But when you put \nthe human face on this issue and you have a woman and her husband and \nher son and a law firm that was so excited about this nominee, and you \nadd to that 2 years of twisting in the wind and not knowing whether \nthis day would ever come, you have to say that today is a wonderful \nday.\n  So, before my colleague leaves, I wanted to say to him: Thank you for \nbeing there for Margaret Morrow and, frankly, all of the people of \nAmerica. Because she will make an excellent judge.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I say to my friend from California and to \nmy friend from Utah, I do appreciate their help in this. I can assure \nyou that, while my family and I will gather for the hanging of this \nportrait--I almost blushed when you mentioned that is my reason for \nbeing off the floor--I can assure you I will be back in plenty of time \nfor the vote and I will have 210 pounds of Vermonter standing in the \nwell of the Senate to encourage everybody to vote the appropriate way.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague very much, Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining on this \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 15 minutes. \nThe Senator from Utah has 30 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My understanding is I would have 15 minutes, then?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask that the Presiding Officer let me know when 10 \nminutes has passed, and I will reserve 5 minutes in which to debate the \nSenator from Missouri, because I know he is a tough debater and I am \ngoing to need some time.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I am so very pleased that this day has come \nat long last, that we will have an up-or-down vote on Margaret Morrow. \nI really think, standing here, perhaps the only people happier than I \nam right now are Margaret and her husband and her son and her law \npartners and the various citizens of California, Republicans and \nDemocrats, who worked together for this day.\n  Margaret Morrow is the epitome of mainstream values and mainstream \nAmerica, and the depth and breadth of her support from prominent \nRepublicans and Democrats illustrate that she is eminently qualified to \nsit as a Federal judge. I don't think I could be any more eloquent than \nChairman Hatch and Ranking Member Leahy, in putting forward her \ncredentials.\n\n[[Page S645]]\n\n  What I am going to do later is just read from some of the \nmany letters that we got about Margaret, and then I, also, at that \ntime, will have some letters printed in the Record.\n\n  Again, I want to say to Senator Hatch how his leadership has been \nextraordinary on this, and also I personally thank Majority Leader Lott \nand Democratic Leader Daschle for bringing this to the floor and \narranging for an agreement that this nominee be brought to the floor. I \nthank my colleague from Missouri for allowing an up-or-down vote, for \nnot launching a filibuster on this matter. I think Chairman Hatch spoke \nof that eloquently, and I am very pleased that we can have this fair \nvote.\n  I recommended Margaret Morrow to the President in September of 1995. \nShe was nominated by the President on May 9, 1996. She received her \nfirst hearing before the Judiciary Committee on June 25, 1996, and was \nfavorably reported out unanimously by the committee 2 days later. \nBecause there was no action, she was renominated again on January 7, \n1997, and had her second hearing on March 18, 1997. This time she was \nreported out favorably. This time the vote was 13 to 5.\n  I want to make the point that there is a personal side to this \njudicial nomination process. For nominees who are awaiting \nconfirmation, their personal and professional lives truly hang in the \nbalance. Margaret Morrow, a 47-year-old mother and law partner has put \nher life and her professional practice on hold while she waited for the \nSenate to vote on her nomination. Her whole family, particularly her \nhusband and son, have waited patiently for this day. That is stress and \nthat is strain, as you wait for this decision which will so affect your \nlife and the life of your family and, of course, your career.\n  Former Majority Leader Bob Dole spoke of this process himself when he \nonce said, ``We should not be holding people up. If we need a vote, \nvote them down or vote them up, because the nominees probably have \nplans to make and there are families involved.'' I think Senator Dole \nsaid it straight ahead. So I am really glad that Margaret's day has \ncome finally.\n  I do want to say to Margaret, thank you for hanging in there. Thank \nyou for not giving up. I well understand that there were certain \nmoments where you probably were tempted to do so. There were days when \nyou probably thought this day would never come. But you did hang in \nthere, and you had every reason to hang in there.\n  This is a woman who graduated magna cum laude from Bryn Mawr College \nand received her law degree from Harvard, graduating cum laude, 23 \nyears in private practice in business and commercial litigation, a \npartner at the prestigious law firm of Arnold and Porter. She is \nmarried to Judge Paul Boland of the Los Angeles Superior Court and has \na 10-year-old son, Patrick Morrow Boland, who actually came up here on \none of the times that she was before the committee.\n  Over the years, Margaret has represented a diverse group of business \nand Government clients, including some of the Nation's largest and most \nprominent companies.\n  In the time I have remaining now, I want to quote from some very \nprestigious leaders from California, and from the Senate, who have \nspoken out in behalf of Margaret Morrow. First we have Senator Orrin \nHatch. He spoke for Margaret himself, so I won't go over that quote.\n  Robert Bonner, former U.S. attorney appointed by President Reagan, \nformer U.S. district court judge in the Central District of California \nand former head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, appointed by \nPresident George Bush, he sent a letter to Senators Bond, D'Amato, \nDomenici, Sessions and Specter. In it he says:\n\n       The issue--the only real issue--is this: Is Margaret Morrow \n     likely to be an activist judge? My answer and the answer of \n     other Californians who have unchallengeable Republican \n     credentials and who are and have been leaders of the bar and \n     bench in California, is an unqualified NO. . . . On a \n     personal note, I have known Margaret Morrow for over twenty \n     years. She was my former law partner. I can assure you that \n     she will not be a person who will act precipitously or rashly \n     in challenging the rule of law.\n  He continues:\n\n       Based on her record, the collective knowledge of so many \n     Republicans of good reputation, and her commitment to the \n     rule of law and legal institutions, it is clear to me that \n     Margaret will be a superb trial judge who will follow the law \n     as articulated by the Constitution and legal precedent, and \n     apply it to the facts before her.\n\n  I think that this statement is quite powerful. We have numbers of \nothers as well. In a letter to Senators Abraham and Gordon Smith and \nPat Roberts, Thomas Malcolm, who is chairman of Governor Wilson's \nJudicial Selection Committee for Orange County and served on the \nJudicial Selection Committees of Senators Hayakawa, Wilson, and \nSeymour, wrote the following:\n\n       I have known Ms. Morrow for approximately 10 years. Over \n     the years, she has constantly been the most outstanding \n     leader our California Bar Association has ever had the \n     privilege of her sitting as its President. . . . Of the \n     literally hundreds of nominations for appointment to the \n     federal bench during my tenure on Senators Hayakawa, Wilson \n     and Seymour's Judicial Selection Committees, Ms. Morrow is by \n     far one of the most impressive applicants I have ever seen.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Remaining of my 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 3 minutes of your 10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. In the 3 minutes remaining I am \ngoing to quote from some others.\n  Los Angeles Mayor, Richard Riordan, in a letter to Senator Hatch, \nsaid:\n\n       Ms. Morrow would be an excellent addition to the Federal \n     bench. She is dedicated to following the law and applying it \n     in a rational and objective fashion.\n\n  Republican judges in the 9th Circuit, Pamela Rymer and Cynthia Hall--\nthey are both President Bush and President Reagan's appointees \nrespectively--in a letter to Senators Hutchison, Collins and Snowe, \nwrite:\n\n       [We] urge your favorable action on the Morrow nomination \n     because [we] believe that she would be an exceptional federal \n     judge.\n\n  Representative James Rogan, former Republican Assembly majority \nleader in the California State Assembly, the first Republican majority \nleader in almost 30 years--actually he testified in front of the \nJudiciary Committee and said:\n\n       When an individual asks me to make a recommendation for a \n     judgeship, that is perhaps the single most important thing I \n     will study before making any recommendation . . . I am \n     absolutely convinced that . . . she would be the type of \n     judge who would follow the Constitution and laws of the \n     United States as they were written. . . . [I]t is my belief . \n     . . that should she win approval from this committee and from \n     the full Senate, she would be a judge that we could all be \n     proud of, both in California and throughout our land.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of people from all over California endorsing Margaret Morrow.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               Republican Support for Margaret M.

Pretty, former President of the Association of \n     Business Trial Lawyers.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to say to you again, I know you \nhave been very fair as I presented the case to you, this is a woman \nthat every single Senator should be proud to support today. It is not a \nmatter of political party. This is a woman uniquely qualified. I almost \nwant to say, if Margaret Morrow cannot make it through, then, my \ngoodness, who could? I really think she brings those kinds of \nbipartisan credentials.\n  I reserve my 5 minutes and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you very much. I yield myself so \nmuch time as I may consume, and I ask that the Chair inform me when I \nhave consumed 15 minutes.\n  I thank you very much for allowing me to participate in this debate. \nIt is appropriate that we bring to the floor nominees who are well \nknown to the committee for debate by the full Senate. I commend the \nchairman of the committee for bringing this nomination to the floor. I \nhave no objection to these nominations coming to the floor and no \nobjection to voting on these nominees. I only objected to this nominee \ncoming to the floor to be approved by unanimous consent because I think \nwe deserve the opportunity to debate these nominees, to discuss them \nand to have votes on them.\n  So many people who are not familiar with the process of the Senate \nmay think that when a Senator says that he wants to have a debate that \nhe is trying to delay. I believe the work of the Senate should be done \nin full view of the American people and that we should have the \nopportunity to discuss these issues, and then instead of having these \nthings voted on by unanimous consent at the close of the business day \nwith no record, I think it is important that we debate the nominee's \nqualifications on the record.\n  I think it is important because the judiciary is one-third of the \nGovernment of the United States. The individuals who populate the \njudiciary are lifetime appointments.\n  The United States Constitution imposes a responsibility on the Senate \nto be a quality screen, and it is the last screen before a person \nbecomes a lifetime member of the judiciary. So we need to do our best \nto make sure that only high-quality individuals reach that level, \nindividuals who have respect for the Constitution, who appropriately \nunderstand that the role of the courts is to decide disputes and not to \nexpand the law or to somehow develop new constitutional rights. The \nlegislature is the part of the body politic that is designed to make \nlaw. The courts are designed to settle disputes about the law.\n  It is against this background that I am pleased to have the \nopportunity to debate the nomination of Margaret Morrow.\n  Let me begin by saying that Ms. Morrow is an outstanding lawyer. No \none wants to challenge her credentials. No one believes that she is not \na person of great intellect or a person of tremendous experience. She \nis a person who has great capacity. It has been demonstrated in her \nprivate life, her educational record and in her life of service as an \nofficer of the California Bar Association.\n  The only reservations to be expressed about Ms. Morrow, and they are \nsubstantial ones in my regard--they are not about her talent, not about \nher capacity, not about her integrity--they are about what her \ninterpretation of the role of a judge is; whether she thinks that the \nlaw as developed in the court system belongs on the cutting edge, \nwhether she thinks that the law, as developed in the court system, is \nan engine of social change and that the courts should drive the Nation \nin a direction of a different culture and a direction of recognizing \nnew rights that weren't recognized or placed in the Constitution, and \nthat needed to be invented or developed or brought into existence by \nindividuals who populate the courts. That, I think, is the major \nquestion we have before us.\n  So let me just say again, this is an outstanding person of intellect, \nfrom everything I can understand a person of great integrity, a person \nwhose record of service is laudable and commendable. The only question \nI have is, does she have the right view of the Constitution, the right \nview of what courts are supposed to do, or will she be someone who goes \nto the bench and, unfortunately, like so many other lawyers in the \nninth circuit, decide that the court is the best place to amend the \nConstitution? Does she think the court is the best place to strike down \nthe will of the people, to impose on the people from the courts what \ncould not be generated by the representatives of the people in the \nlegislature.\n\n  So, fundamentally, the question is whether or not this candidate will \nrespect the separation of powers, whether this candidate will say the \nlegislature is the place to make the law, and whether she will \nrecognize that courts can only make decisions about the law. Will she \nacknowledge that the people have the right to make the law, too? After \nall, that is what our Constitution says, that all power and all \nauthority is derived from the people, and they, with their elected \nrepresentatives, should have the opportunity to make the law.\n  It is with these questions in mind that I look at some of the \nwritings of this candidate for a Federal judgeship, and I come to the \nconclusion that she believes that the court system and the courts are \nthe place where the law can be made, especially if the people are not \nsmart enough or if the people aren't progressive enough or if the \nConstitution isn't flexible enough.\n  I can't say for sure this is what would happen. I have to be fair. I \nhave to go by what she has written. I will be at odds with the \ninterpretation of some of the things said by the committee chairman. I \nrespect the chairman, but I think that his interpretation of her \nwritings is flawed.\n  In 1995, in a law review comment, Ms. Morrow seemed to endorse the \npractice of judicial activism, that is judge-made law. She wrote:\n\n       For the law is, almost by definition, on the cutting edge \n     of social thought. It is a vehicle--\n\n  Or a way--\n\n     through which we ease the transition from the rules which \n     have always been to the rules which are to be.\n\n  She is saying that the law is the vehicle, the thing that takes you \nfrom what was to what will be. I was a little puzzled when the \ncommittee chairman said that the committee found that she didn't mean \nthe substantive as expressed in the courts and the like. Let me just \nsay I don't believe the committee made any such findings. I have \nchecked with committee staff, and it is just not the case that the \ncommittee made findings.\n  It is true that a majority of the members of the committee voted this \ncandidate to the floor, but the committee didn't make findings that \nthis was not a statement of judicial activism. Frankly, I think it is a \nstatement of judicial activism, despite the fact that Ms. Morrow told \nthe committee that she was not speaking about the law in any \nsubstantive way, but rather was referring to the legal profession and \nthe rules governing the profession.\n  The law, by definition, is on the cutting edge of social thought? \nSocial\n\n[[Page S647]]\n\nthought doesn't govern the profession, social thought governs the \nsociety. The transition of the rules from the way they have always been \nto the rules which they are to be? I think it is a stretch to say that \nthis really refers to the legal profession.\n  If she meant that the legal profession is a vehicle through which we \nease the transition from the rules which always have been to the rules \nwhich are to be, that doesn't make sense. Clearly she is referring to \nsomething other than the legal profession or the rules of professional \nconduct.\n  Some have suggested that because Ms. Morrow initially made these \nremarks at a 1994 Conference on Women and the Law, that it is plausible \nthat she was referring to the profession and not to the substantive \nlaw. But I think it is more likely that her statement reflects a belief \nthat the law can and should be used by those who interpret it to change \nsocial norms, inside and outside of the legal profession.\n\n  Truly, that is a definition of activism, the ability of judges to \nimpose on the culture those things which they prefer rather than have \nthe culture initiate through their elected representatives those things \nwhich the culture prefers.\n  Frankly, if it is a question of a few in the judiciary defining what \nthe values of the many are in the culture, I think that is \nantidemocratic. I really believe that the virtue of America is that the \nmany impose their will on the Government, not that the few in \nGovernment impose their will on the many.\n  Reasonable people can disagree on the proper interpretation of Ms. \nMorrow's statement. Others can argue about whether or not hastening \nsocial change is a proper role for judges in the courts. But I think it \nis fair to conclude that Ms. Morrow's comments were an endorsement of \njudicial activism.\n  In 1993, Ms. Morrow gave another speech that suggested approval of \njudicial activism, quoting William Brennan, an evangelist of judicial \nactivism. Morrow stated:\n\n       Justice can only endure and flourish if law and legal \n     institutions are ``engines of social change'' able to \n     accommodate evolving patterns of life and social interaction \n     in this decade.\n\n  She said these remarks were not an endorsement of activism. She told \nthe Judiciary Committee the subject of the comments was, once again, \nnot the law but the legal profession and the California State Bar \nAssociation.\n  To say that both law and legal institutions are engines of social \nchange I think begs the question of whether you are just talking about \nthe State bar association. In this statement, Ms. Morrow refers \nspecifically to the law and legal institutions. Ms. Morrow's words were \na call for activism to those who administer the law.\n  Again, the committee chairman indicated that the committee found that \nshe was referring to those things she referenced in her testimony. That \nmay have been the conclusion of some on the committee as a basis for \nhow they voted, but I don't believe the committee made any findings \nabout what her statements meant.\n  Ms. Morrow was the president of the California State bar in 1993 and \n1994, one of the things for which she is to be applauded. She was first \nwoman elected president of the bar. But according to press reports, her \nfirst bar convention as president was ``marked by only one big issue: \ngun control.'' Even U.S. Attorney Janet Reno traveled all the way to \nthe San Diego convention to exhort attendees to work against Americans' \n``love affair with guns.''\n  And although a 1990 U.S. Supreme Court decision prohibited the \nCalifornia bar from using dues for political activities and \nspecifically listed advocacy of gun control legislation as an example, \nMs. Morrow said the bar should consider the Court's ruling, ``assess \nthe risks, and then do what is right.''\n  So looking into the face of a Supreme Court decision of the United \nStates, Ms. Morrow said, ``Yeah, we should figure out what we think is \nright and assess the risks,'' I suppose of getting caught and what the \nconsequences would be, ``and then just basically do what we think is \nright.''\n  I think if we are going to ask someone to undertake the \nresponsibility of administering justice in the Federal judicial system, \nwe have to expect them to accord the Constitution of the United States \nrespect. We have to expect them to accord the rulings of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States respect, and to assess the risks and do what \nis right is not a philosophy.\n  Frankly, one does not need to assess the risks if one is going to do \nwhat is right. If you are going to do what is right, there are no \nrisks. Rather than imply that the Court's prohibition on using bar dues \nfor political purposes may be somehow circumvented or disregarded, Ms. \nMorrow could have stated her clear intention to respect the Court's \ndecision and to urge her membership to do the same.\n  Ms. Morrow not only has indicated her willingness to use the law ``on \nthe cutting edge'' and to use the law, the legal profession and the \ncourts to change the rules whereby people live and to make law and not \njust interpret law or decide disputes, she has argued that when the \npeople get involved in making the law, the result is dubious and should \nbe called into question and into doubt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I allocate myself such further time as I may consume in \nmaking this next point.\n  Mr. President, Ms. Morrow's supporters argue that her comments about \njudicial activism are taken out of context or misinterpreted, but I \ndon't believe that they are. Her supporters will have a harder time \nexplaining away Ms. Morrow's disparaging and elitist views about direct \ncitizen involvement in decisionmaking processes.\n  If she is not clear about saying that she would displace the \nlegislative function by being a judicial activist in one arena, that \nis, when it comes to interpreting the law and expanding the \nConstitution, she is very clear about her disrespect for legislation \nenacted by the people.\n  In 1988, she wrote an article and smugly criticized the ballot \ninitiative as used by the citizens of California. Here is what she \nwrote in that article:\n\n       The fact that initiatives are presented to a \n     ``legislature'' of 20 million people renders ephemeral any \n     real hope of intelligent voting by a majority.\n\n  What she is saying, in other words, is that whenever the people get \ninvolved, decisions will not be intelligent. She suggests that the \ncourts are going to have to step in and do the right thing, what they \nknow to be better than what the people have said, and take over. I \nthink a lot of Americans would be concerned if the courts simply took \nover.\n  By the way, I noted there was a substantial list of letters that were \nsent to the desk on behalf of individuals that endorsed Ms. Morrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list assembled by the Judicial \nSelection Monitoring Project be printed in the Record. It lists more \nthan 180 different grassroots organizations, from the American \nAssociation for Small Property Ownership to the Independent Women's \nForum to the Women for Responsible Legislation, that oppose this \nnomination.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                Judicial Selection\n\n\n                                           Monitoring Project,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 29, 1997.\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: We strongly oppose the nomination of \n     Margaret Morrow to the U.S. District Court for one or more of \n     the following reasons.\n       First, her activities and writings reveal aggressive \n     advocacy of liberal political causes and the view that courts \n     and the law can be used to effect political and social \n     change. This combination foretells liberals judicial activism \n     on the bench. She wants bar association to take ``a strong \n     active voice'' on political issues and has written that the \n     law is ``on the cutting edge of social thought'' and ``the \n     vehicle through which we ease the transition from the rules \n     which have been to the rules which are to be.'' She opposes \n     any restrictions on blatantly political litigation by the \n     Legal Services Corporation.\n       Second, as Senator Charles Grassley has said, Morrow's \n     ``judgment and candor are under a great deal of question.'' \n     Morrow twice withheld nearly 40 articles, reports, and \n     speeches from the Senate Judiciary Committee, including those \n     clearly reflecting her activist approach to the law. She \n     refused to answer Senators' legitimate questions following \n     her hearing, and eventually provided answers that Senator \n     Grassley called ``false and misleading.''\n       Finally, and perhaps most important, Americans now know \n     what Morrow's wholesale condemnation of direct democracy will\n\n[[Page S648]]\n\n     mean if she becomes a federal judge. She has written that \n     ``any real hope of intelligent voting'' by the people on \n     ballot measures is only ``ephemeral.'' On October 8, the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals in California implemented that same view and \n     swept aside an initiative enacted by Californians because two \n     judges thought the voters did not understand what they were \n     doing. It is clear that Morrow will be yet another judge more \n     than willing to substitute her own elitist judgments for the \n     will of the people.\n       A nominee who believes the courts can be used to enact \n     liberal political an social policy, whose ``judgment and \n     candor are under a great deal of question,'' and who will \n     undermine democracy has no place on the federal bench.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alabama Citizens for Truth\n       Alabama Family Alliance\n       Alliance Defense Fund\n       Alliance for American\n       American Association of Christian Schools\n       American Association for Small Property Ownership\n       American Center for Law and Justice--DC\n       American Center for Law and Justice--National\n       American Family Association\n       American Family Association of KY\n       American Family Association of MI\n       American Family Association of MO\n       American Family Association of NY\n       American Family Association of TX\n       American Foundation (OH)\n       American Land Rights Association\n       American Policy Center\n       American Pro-Constitutional Association\n       American Rights Coalition\n       Americans for Choice in Education\n       American for Decency\n       Americans for Tax Reform\n       California Coalition for Immigration Reform\n       Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights\n       Center for Arizona Policy\n       Center for Individual Rights\n       Center for New Black Leadership\n       Christian Coalition\n       Christian Coalition of California\n       Christian Coalition of IA\n       Christian Coalition of KS, Inc.\n       Christian Exchange, Inc.\n       Christian Home Educators of Kentucky\n       Citizens Against Repressive Zoning\n       Citizens Against Violent Crime\n       Citizens for Better Government\n       Citizens for Community Values\n       Citizens for Constitutional Property Rights, Inc.\n       Citizens for Economically Responsible Government\n       Citizens for Excellence in Education (TX)\n       Citizens for Law & Order\n       Citizens for Reform\n       Citizens for Responsible Government\n       Citizens United\n       Coalition Against Pornography\n       Coalitions for America\n       Colorado Coalition for Fair Competition\n       Colorado for Family Values\n       Colorado Term Limits Coalition\n       Concerned Women for America\n       Concerned Women for America of Virginia\n       Legislative Action Committee\n       Conservative Campaign Fund\n       Conservative Opportunity Society PAC\n       Constitutional Coalition\n       Constituionalists Networking Center\n       Coral Ridge Ministries\n       Council of Conservative Citizens\n       Defenders of Property Rights\n       Delaware Family Foundation\n       Eagle Forum\n       Eagle Forum of Alabama\n       Eagle Forum, Inc.

I think the fact that these grassroots organizations \noppose this nomination reflects the fact that they distrust an \nindividual who distrusts the people. Whenever you have someone moving \ninto the Federal court system who expresses in advance the fact that \nwhen people get involved in government, it renders an intelligent \nresult ephemeral or unlikely to take place, I think they have a right \nto be disconcerted and upset.\n  She continued in her article:\n\n       Only a small minority of voters study their ballot pamphlet \n     with any care, and only the minutest percentage takes time to \n     read the proposed statutory language itself. Indeed, it seems \n     too much to ask that they do, since propositions are . . . \n     difficult for a layperson to understand.\n\n  Basically, this says that lawyers are smart enough to understand \nthese things but ordinary people cannot and, as a result, cannot make \nintelligent decisions. I have noted before that it is not a requirement \nto be a lawyer to be a Member of the Senate. Ordinary people can run \nfor the U.S. Senate. And they do. You need only be 35 years old.\n  I have also noticed that, very frequently, only a small minority of \nthe Senators have read, in the totality, the legislation which is \nbefore the Senate. If you are going to say that laws are not effective \nand should not be respected because they were not read thoroughly or \nnot everybody who voted on them was a lawyer, that would be a premise \nfor disregarding any law passed in the United States. It would be a \npremise for saying that the laws of the United States are not to be \naccorded deference by the courts. And sometimes I think that is the way \nthe courts look at them.\n\n[[Page S649]]\n\n  They look at the laws that are enacted by the Congress and they say, \n``Well, we're going to have to expand that. We're going to have to \nchange that. They weren't smart enough. The representatives of the \npeople weren't smart enough. They didn't know what they were doing.''\n  Frankly, this distrust of democracy is the kind of thing that \nprovides the predicate for judicial activism where individuals \nsubstitute their judgment for the law of the Constitution, where courts \nsubstitute their preferences for the people's will as expressed in the \nlaw.\n  This has been a particular problem with the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, which has been striking down propositions approved by the \nvoters of Californians right and left.\n  Proposition 140. A three-judge panel affirmed a decision by Judge \nWilkin, a Clinton appointee, to throw out term limits for State \nlegislators. The ninth circuit en banc reversed and upheld the \nconstitutionality of the initiative.\n  Here you have it. The people of California decide they want term \nlimits, and you have a Federal judge who thinks, ``Well, they don't \nknow what they're doing. They're just people. They aren't lawyers. They \ndidn't read this carefully enough,'' and it is set aside. That is the \nattitude we cannot afford to replicate there.\n  Proposition 209. Judge Henderson struck down this prohibition of race \nand gender preferences. People of America do not want quotas and \npreferences. They want to operate based on merit. So the people of \nCalifornia did what the people should do when they want something in \nthe law, they enacted it through the constitutional method of passing \nan initiative.\n  But the judge, Federal judge, thinking himself to be superior in \nwisdom to the voters--maybe the judge had been reading the article by \nMs. Morrow that said, ``The fact that initiatives are presented to a \n`legislature' of 20 million people renders ephemeral any real hope of \nintelligent voting by a majority''--struck down that initiative.\n  Proposition 187. This law denying certain public benefits to illegal \naliens was declared unconstitutional by another judge.\n  Proposition 208 was recently blocked in its enforcement by Judge \nKarlton.\n  Over and over again in California we have had this problem caused by \njudges who basically think that the initiatives of the people are not \ndue the respect to be accorded to enactments of the law. And when \njudges place themselves above the people, when judges elevate their own \nviews to a point where they are saying that they have a legislative \ncapacity to say what ought to be the law rather than to resolve \ndisputes about the law, I think that is when we get into trouble.\n  Now, many confirmation decisions will require Senators to anticipate \nwhat will happen. We cannot really know for sure what is going to \nhappen. Almost 4\\1/2\\ years ago the Senate confirmed, by unanimous \nconsent, without a vote, Claudia Wilken to be a district court judge in \nthe Northern District of California.\n  She was asked about things like this before the Judiciary Committee. \nAnd she stated, ``A good judge applies the law, not her personal views, \nwhen she decides a case.'' She said judges should fashion broad, \nequitable relief ``only where the Constitution or a statute'' requires. \nBut she's the judge who said that the term limits initiative passed in \nCalifornia in 1990 was unconstitutional. Now, when the Federal \nConstitution itself has term limits for the President, you have to \nwonder if she is not just trying to substitute her judgment and \ndisplace the judgment of the people of California.\n  Last April, Judge Wilken ruled that the term limits initiative, which \nwas passed by the voters in the State, and approved by the California \nSupreme Court--violated the Constitution. The new law, Judge Wilken \nheld, was unfair to those voters who wanted to support a candidate with \nlegislative experience. I wonder if maybe she had been reading the \nmaterial of the nominee in this case. I wonder if she really believed \nthat ``The fact that initiatives are presented to a `legislature' of 20 \nmillion people renders ephemeral any real hope of intelligent voting by \na majority.''\n  The ninth circuit court of appeals, which covers California, is the \ncircuit in which these questions arose. Unfortunately, it is the most \nactive circuit judicially. I think we have to be very careful when we \nare appointing individuals to courts within that circuit that we do not \nfind ourselves reinforcing this judicially active mentality.\n  Let us just take a look at what kind of legal environment they are in \nout there.\n  In 1997, the Supreme Court reversed an astounding 27 out of 28 ninth \ncircuit decisions.\n  In 1996, it was 10 out of 12 decisions that were reversed.\n  In 1995, it was 14 out of 17.\n  It is obvious that the ninth circuit is out of control, filled with \nindividuals who believe that the people are to be disregarded, that the \nintelligence resides solely in the court system. Frankly, I think that \nis a troublesome problem.\n  Here is what one of the judges on the ninth circuit said, expressing \npride in the fact that the court was frequently reversed. Chief Judge \nProcter Hug said in a recent interview:\n\n       We're on the cutting edge of a lot of cases.\n\n  Does the phrase ``cutting edge'' remind you of anything? Another one \nof those quotes from Ms. Morrow.\n\n       We're on the cutting edge of a lot of cases. If a ruling \n     creates a lot of heat, that's why we have life tenure.\n\n  I really believe that life tenure is supported by the need for \nindependence, but it is not to be a license to take over the \nlegislative responsibility of Government. It is not to be a license to \nbe out there on the cutting edge, to be writing new laws, instead of \ndeciding controversies presented by application of old laws.\n\n  On the ninth circuit, no judge is reversed more than judge Stephen \nReinhardt, the renegade judge who in recent years has argued that the \nConstitution protects an individual's right to commit physician-\nassisted suicide. Of course, he was reversed by the Supreme Court. He \nrecently ruled that school-administered drug tests for high school \nathletes violated the Constitution. His creation there of a new \nconstitutional right again was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court. \nFinally, Reinhardt argued that farmers lack standing to challenge the \nEndangered Species Act because they have an economic interest in doing \nso. This decision also was reversed by the Supreme Court. And just last \nweek, Reinhardt reversed a lower court decision and held employers are \nprevented by the Constitution from conducting genetic tests as part of \ntheir employees' routine physicals--another new constitutional right \nfound by an activist judge.\n  Judge Reinhardt seems to share the arguments made by Ms. Morrow in \nher article about initiatives. To Reinhardt, the Constitution is not a \ncharter to be interpreted strictly; rather, it is an outline for \ncreative judges to fill in the blanks.\n  I think judges who believe that the Constitution is written in pencil \nand who think that the Bill of Rights is written in disappearing ink \nare judges that are out of control. We have to be careful we don't put \nmore individuals on the bench who have a disregard for the separation \nof powers and who do not understand that what the people do under the \nauthority of the Constitution is valid and must be respected.\n  I see my colleague from the State of Alabama has arrived and is \nprepared, I believe, to make remarks in this respect. I want to thank \nhim for his outstanding work on the Judiciary Committee. He takes his \nwork very seriously. He is a champion of the Constitution of the United \nStates. He understands that the people are the source of power. He \nunderstands well that judges are very important. It is important that \nwe have intelligent judges, capable judges; but also, judges that \nrespect the fact that they have a limited function of resolving \ndisputes. And in so doing they are not to amend the Constitution or \nextend the law but to rely upon the legislature or the people to do \nthat whenever is necessary.\n  I yield to the Senator from Alabama 10 minutes in which to make his \nremarks in opposition to this nominee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I spent 15 years in my professional career as a Federal \nprosecutor prosecuting full-time before Federal judges. I have had the \npleasure of practicing before some of the finest judges in America. It \nis a thrill to have\n\n[[Page S650]]\n\nthat opportunity, to have the opportunity to represent the United \nStates of America in court and to utilize our Constitution, our laws \nand our statutes, and the logic that God gives us the ability to \nutilize, to analyze difficult problems.\n  Many of us can disagree, but I do rise today in opposition to the \nnomination of Margaret Morrow to the U.S. District Court bench for the \nCentral District of California. This is not an easy decision. These are \nnot pleasant tasks for those of us on the Judiciary Committee and in \nthis Senate to decide to vote against a Presidential nomination. But if \nwe believe in that and we are concerned about that, our responsibility \nas Members of this body calls on us to do so.\n  By all accounts, she is a fine lawyer and a good person. However, her \nwritings and speeches which span over a decade indicate that she views \nthe Federal judiciary as a means to achieve a social or political end.\n  This nomination is all the more important when one considers that Ms. \nMorrow's home State of California has repeatedly been victimized \nrecently by liberal and undemocratic Federal judges. Moreover, judicial \nactivism has plagued her judicial circuit, the ninth circuit, like no \nother circuit in the country.\n\n  Consider for a moment how big a problem judicial activism is on the \nninth circuit. In 1997, last year, the Supreme Court reversed 27 out of \n28 decisions rendered by the ninth circuit. In 1996, the Supreme Court \nreversed 10 out of 12 ninth circuit decisions. That pattern has been \ngoing on for decades. As a Federal prosecutor in Alabama, when criminal \ndefense lawyers file briefs and cite law to argue their opinion or to \nsuppress evidence or matters of that kind, they most frequently cited \nninth circuit opinions because those were the most liberal in the \ncountry on criminal law. Frankly, they were not given much credit \naround the country. Most judges in the United States recognize that \nthis circuit too often was out of step with the rest of the country.\n  There are a number of factors that cause me to oppose the \nconfirmation of Ms. Morrow. Chief among the factors is her skepticism, \nif not outright hostility, toward voter initiatives. In a 1988 article, \nMorrow criticized California's initiative process. In this article, she \nstated, really condescendingly, these words, ``The fact that \ninitiatives are presented to a `legislature' of 20 million people \nrenders ephemeral any real hope of intelligent voting by a majority.'' \nI suggest that that indicates a lack of respect for that process and \nthe jealously guarded privilege of California voters to enact \nlegislation by direct action of the people.\n  She further criticized the initiative process with this statement: \n``The public, by contrast, cast its votes for initiatives on the basis \nof 30- and 60-second advertisements which ignore or obscure the \nsubstance of the measure.''\n  At the time of her hearing, I found that Ms. Morrow's suspicion of \ninitiatives particularly troubling because of two recent California \ninitiatives, Proposition 187 and Proposition 209, the California civil \nrights initiative, both of which have been blocked by activist Federal \njudges in California. In fact, the judges in the ninth circuit have \ninvalidated voter initiatives on tenuous grounds since the early 1980s. \nThese decisions demonstrate the enormous power that a single sitting \nFederal district judge possesses to subvert the will of the people. \nMorrow's criticism of citizen initiatives reveals an elitist mindset \ncharacteristic of activist judges who use the judiciary to impose their \npersonal values onto the law.\n  Unfortunately, recent events have left me even more concerned about \nher disdain for the people's will as expressed in voter initiatives. \nLate last year, the ninth circuit effectively enshrined Ms. Morrow's \nview of initiatives into ninth circuit law. In an opinion striking down \nyet another voter initiative, term limits for California State \nlegislatures, the ninth circuit held that Federal courts must \nscrutinize voter initiatives more closely than ``ordinary legislative \nlawmaking.'' This ``extra scrutiny'' is necessary, according to the \nninth circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt and Betty Fletcher, because \ninitiatives are not the product of committee hearings and because ``the \npublic also generally lacks legal or legislative expertise.'' In the \nend, the ninth circuit invalidated the term limits initiative not \nbecause term limits are unconstitutional--because I submit to you they \nplainly are not unconstitutional--but because the two Federal judges \ndid not think the voters fully understood what they were voting for.\n  The ninth circuit does not need any more reinforcements in its war on \nthe initiative process. The people of California are rightly jealous of \ntheir initiative process. They are frustrated that judges go out of \ntheir way to strike down the decisions they reach by direct \nplebiscite. We don't need to send them another judge, another leader on \nthat court who would support the anti-initiative effort.\n\n  Ms. Morrow's distaste for voter initiatives is not the only troubling \naspect of her record. For example, in a 1995 law review comment, she \nwrote what can be interpreted clearly to me as a blatant approval of \njudicial activism:\n\n       For the law is, almost by definition, on the cutting edge \n     of social thought. It is a vehicle through which we ease the \n     transition from the rules which have always been to the rules \n     which are to be.\n\n  I know she has suggested a view of that language that would indicate \nthat she meant something like the practice of law, rather than the rule \nof law. But that's not what she said and, in fact, maybe she meant it \nto apply to both circumstances. In fact, I think that's the most \naccurate interpretation of it. She may well have been talking about the \npractice of law, but at the same time her approach to law, because that \nis what her language includes. It would suggest to me that this is, in \nfact, the language of a judicial activist.\n  In a 1983 speech, she also made comments that suggest approval of \njudicial activism. In this speech, she quoted Justice William Brennan, \nthe evangelist of judicial activism, stating:\n\n       Justice can only endure and flourish if the law and legal \n     institutions are ``engines of change'' able to accommodate \n     evolving patterns of life and social interaction in this \n     decade.\n\n  Obviously, using the law as an ``engine of change'' is the very \ndefinition of judicial activism and is fundamentally incompatible with \ndemocratic government.\n  Mr. President, it is a serious matter when the people, through their \ncontract with the Government and their Constitution, set forth plain \nrestraints on the power of the law, when the people, through their \nlegislators in California, or through their Congress in Washington, \npass statutes requiring things to be done one way or the other, and \nwhen a judge, if they do not respect that law, feels like he or she can \nreinterpret or redefine the meaning of words in those documents in such \na way that would allow them to impose their view of the proper outcome \nunder the circumstances. That makes them a judicial activist. I submit \nthat these writings from her past indicate that tendency.\n  Also, in 1983, the nominee strongly criticized the Reagan \nadministration's efforts to restrict the Legal Services Corporation \nfrom filing certain categories of lawsuits. As many of you know, the \nLegal Services Corporation grantees--they receive money from the \nGovernment--have repeatedly filed partisan suits in Federal courts to \nachieve political aims. For example, the Legal Services Corporation has \nrepeatedly sued to block welfare reform efforts in the States. Issues \nof public policy simply are not properly decided by litigation. The use \nof public tax dollars to promote an ideological agenda through the \nFederal courts is not acceptable.\n  Of course, support for the historic mission of the Legal Services \nCorporation--helping the poor with real legal problems --is not the \nissue. What bothers me is Ms. Morrow's opposition to President Reagan's \nattempt to depoliticize the Legal Services Corporation and to direct \nit's attention fundamentally to its goal of helping the poor. But we \nhad a very serious debate in America and I think, for the most part, it \nhas been won; for the most part, Legal Services Corporation has been \nrestrained. There are still problems ongoing, but I hope we have made \nprogress, despite the very strong opposition of Ms. Morrow in her \nwritings.\n  So Ms. Morrow's intelligence, academic record, and professional \nachievements are not in question. However,\n\n[[Page S651]]\n\nher writings, published over the last decade, provide a direct look at \nher view of the law. That view, I must conclude, indicates that Ms. \nMorrow would be yet another undemocratic, activist Federal judge.\n  One last point must be made. Unlike other judicial nominees, Ms. \nMorrow has not previously been a judge. Consequently, she does not have \na lengthy judicial record for the Senate to review. In this situation, \nwe must rely on her private writings and speeches to determine her \njudicial philosophy. This is not an easy or certain task. We must make \njudgments as to what is relevant and probative and what is not. In this \nsituation, I have made such an inquiry and have decided to oppose the \nconfirmation of this very able attorney. The Senate must fulfill its \nadvise and consent responsibilities to ensure that federal judges \nrespect their constitutional role to interpret the law. Consequently, I \nurge you to oppose this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the confirmation \nof Margaret Morrow to the Federal District for the Central District of \nCalifornia.\n  Her consideration by the United States is long overdue:\n  Ms. Morrow's nomination has twice been reported out by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, on which I have the honor to serve;\n  Both times she has enjoyed the public support of the Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch;\n  Both times the American Bar Association voted unanimously to give her \nits highest rating, ``well qualified.''\n  Yet for nearly two years, Ms. Morrow's nomination has languished in \nthe Senate.\n  By way of background, Ms. Morrow graduated from Harvard Law School, \ncum laude, in 1974. Prior to that, she graduated from Bryn Mawr \nCollege, magna cum laude, in 1971.\n  Since 1996, she has been a partner in the Los Angeles office of \nArnold & Porter, one of the nation's preeminent corporate law firms.\n  Prior to 1996, she helped form the Los Angeles law firm of Quinn, \nKully & Morrow in 1987, where she chaired the firm's Appellate \nDepartment.\n  Prior to 1987, she practiced for 13 years at the Los Angeles firm of \nKadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn, & Rossi, where she attained the rank \nof partner and handled a wide range of commercial litigation in the \nfederal and state courts.\n  The legal profession has recognized Ms. Morrow's quality of work, \ncommitment to the profession, and dedication to the broader community \nwith a host of awards.\n  Among the many legal awards Ms. Morrow has received are the \nfollowing:\n  In 1997, she received the Shattuck-Price Memorial Award, the Los \nAngeles County Bar Association's highest award, awarded to a lawyer \ndedicated to improving the legal profession and the administration of \njustice.\n  In 1995, she received the Bernard E. Witkins Amicus Curiae Award, \npresented by the California Judicial Council to non-jurists who have \nnonetheless made significant contributions to the California court \nsystem.\n  In 1994, the Women Lawyers Association in Los Angeles recognized Ms. \nMorrow as most distinguished woman lawyer with the Ernestine Stalhut \nAward.\n  She received the 1994 President's Award from the California \nAssociation of Court-Appointed Special Advocates for her service on \nbehalf of abused, neglected, and dependent children.\n  In 1990, the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles presented her with \nthe Maynard Toll Award for her significant contribution to legal \nservices for the poor. She is the only woman to date who has received \nthis award.\n  Margaret Morrow's excellent legal skills have been consistently \nrecognized:\n  She was listed in the 1997-1998 edition of The Best Lawyers in \nAmerica.\n  In 1995 and 1996, the Los Angeles Business Journal's ``Law Who's \nWho,'' listed her among the one hundred outstanding Los Angeles \nbusiness attorneys.\n  In 1994, she was listed as one of the top 20 lawyers in Los Angeles \nby California Law Business, a publication of the Los Angeles Daily \nJournal.\n  Margaret Morrow has held leadership positions in Federal, State and \ncounty bar associations and other legal organizations.\n  She served as the first woman President of the State Bar of \nCalifornia, a position she held from 1993 to 1994. Prior to that, she \nserved as the State Bar's Vice-President.\n  From 1988-89, she served as President of the Los Angeles County Bar \nAssociation, creating the Pro Bono Council and the Committee on the \nStatus of Minorities in the Profession during her term.\n  As President of the Barristers' Section of the Los Angeles County \nBar, she established a nationally recognized Domestic Violence \nCounseling Project as well as an AIDS hospice program.\n  She directed the American Bar Association's Young Lawyers' Division \nand served on its Standing Committee for Legal Aid for Indigent \nDefendants.\n  She has served on the boards of a number of legal services programs, \nand has been a member of several Advisory Committees of the California \nJudicial Council.\n  The true test of Margaret Morrow's qualifications to serve on the \nfederal bench is the long list of attorneys, judges, law enforcement \npersonnel, and community leaders who actively support her nomination.\n  Indeed, the list of Margaret Morrow's supporters reads like a ``Who's \nWho'' of California Republicans and Bush, Reagan, Deukmejian, and \nWilson appointees.\n  Just to highlight a few of Margaret Morrow's many supporters:\n  Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, Republican;\n  Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, Republican;\n  Orange County District Attorney Michael Capizzi, Republican;\n  Former DEA Head, U.S. District Judge, and U.S. Attorney, Robert \nBonner, who was appointed to those positions by Presidents Bush and \nReagan; Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Stephen Trott, Reagan appointees to \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals; and the list goes on and on.\n  Perhaps most telling is the recommendation of H. Walter Croskey. \nJudge Croskey is a Governor Deukmejian appointee to the appellate court \nof the State of California, and a self-described life-long conservative \nRepublican.\n  Judge Croskey is well-acquainted with Margaret Morrow's reputation in \nthe legal community, having observed her over a period of 15 years, \nwhen she appeared before him in both trial and appellate courts, and \nworked professionally on numerous State and local bar activities.\n  Based on his observations, this conservative Republican appellate \njurist concluded:\n\n       She is the most outstanding candidate for appointment to \n     the Federal trial court who has been put forward in my \n     memory.\n\n  Margaret Morrow is, by any measure, an unusually accomplished member \nin her profession, and I believe that her qualifications will serve her \nwell as a member of the Federal judiciary.\n  I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm her nomination.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President. I rise in strong support of Margaret \nMorrow to the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. She is well-qualified \nto serve as a federal judge, and she has already been waiting far too \nlong for the vote she deserves on her nomination.\n  Margaret Morrow was nominated in the last Congress in May 1996. \nPartisan politics prevented action on her nomination before the 1996 \nelection, but even that excuse can't be used to justify the Senate's \nfailure to act on her nomination in all of 1997.\n  Margaret Morrow is a partner in a prestigious California law firm, \nand the first woman to serve as the president of the California Bar \nAssociation. She is a well-respected attorney and a role model for \nwomen in the legal profession.\n  Her nomination has wide support. The National Association of Women \nJudges calls her ``an extraordinary candidate for the federal bench, a \ntrue professional, without a personal or political agenda, who would be \na trustworthy public servant of the highest caliber.'' The National \nWomen's Law Center calls her ``a leader and a path blazer among women \nlawyers.''\n  She also has the support of many prominent Republicans, because of \nher impressive qualifications for the bench.\n\n[[Page S652]]\n\nRepresentative James Rogan says that ``she would be the type of judge \nwho would follow the Constitution and the laws of the United States as \nthey were written.'' Richard Riordan, the Republican Mayor of Los \nAngeles has stated that the residents of Los Angeles ``would be \nextraordinarily well-served by her appointment.'' Robert Bonner, who \nheaded the Drug Enforcement Administration under President Bush, says \nthat Morrow is ``a brilliant person with a first-rate legal mind.''\n  I hope we can move ahead today her nomination. But I also want to \nexpress my concern over a related issue--the excessive difficulty that \nwomen judicial nominees are having in obtaining Senate action or their \nconfirmation. An unacceptable double standard is being applied, and it \nis long past time it stopped.\n  In this Republican Congress, women nominated to the federal courts \nare four times--four times--more likely than men to be held up by the \nRepublican Senate for more than a year.\n  Women nominees may eventually be approved by the Judiciary Committee. \nBut too often their nominations languish mysteriously, and no one will \ntake responsibility for secretly holding up their nominations.\n  The distinguished majority leader has rightly noted that the process \nof confirming judges is time-consuming. The Senate should take care to \nensure that only individuals acceptable to both the President and the \nSenate are confirmed. The President and the Senate do not always agree. \nBut there is no reason the process should take longer for women than it \ndoes for men.\n  It is time to end the delays and double standards that have marred \nthe Senate's role in the Advice and Consent process. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the nomination of Margaret Morrow and to vote for \nher confirmation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator Ashcroft feels strongly about the \nvalidity of citizen initiatives. So do I. So does Margaret Morrow. As \nshe explained to the Committee when she testified and reiterated in \nresponse to written questions, she fully respects and honors voters \nchoice.\n  Ms. Morrow has explained to the Committee that she is not anti-\ninitiative in spite of what some would have us believe. In response to \nwritten questions, she discussed an article she wrote in 1988 and \nexplained, in pertinent part:\n\n       My goal was not to eliminate the need for initiatives. \n     Rather, I was proposing ways to strengthen the initiative \n     process by making it more efficient and less costly, so that \n     it could better serve the purpose for which it was originally \n     intended. At the same time, I was suggesting measures to \n     increase the Legislature's willingness to address issues of \n     concern to ordinary citizens regardless of the views of \n     special interests or campaign contributors. I do not believe \n     these goals are inconsistent.\n       . . . . The reasons that led Governor Johnson to create the \n     initiative process in 1911 are still valid today, and it \n     remains an important aspect of our democratic form of \n     government.\n\n  Does this sound like someone who is anti-democratic? No objective \nevaluation of the record can yield the conclusion that she is anti-\ninitiative. No fair reading of her 1988 article even suggests that.\n  After the November 1988 elections in California, she was writing in \nthe aftermath of five competing and conflicting ballot measures on the \nmost recent California ballot. They had been placed there by competing \nindustry groups, the insurance industry and lawyers each had their \nfavorites, and each group spent large sums of money on political \nadvertising campaigns to try to persuade voters to back their version \nof car insurance restructuring. It was chaotic and confusing for \ncommentators and voters alike.\n  Rather than throw up her hands, Margaret Morrow wrote in a bar \nmagazine as President of a local bar association that lawyers could \ncontribute their skills to make the process more easily understood by \nthose voters participation is limited to reading the ballot measures \nand descriptions and voting.\n  Her concerns were not unlike those of our colleague from Arizona, who \nproclaimed last year that when the voters of Arizona adopted a state \nballot measure to allow medical use of marijuana, they had been duped \nand deceived. Indeed, Senator Kyl criticized that ballot initiative \npassed by the voters of Arizona during the last election and said: ``I \nbelieve most of them were deceived, and deliberately so, by the \nsponsors of this proposition.''\n  Senator Kyl proceeded at a December 2, 1996 Judiciary Committee \nhearing to focus on the official description of the proposition on the \nArizona ballot as misleading. His approach was similar to what the \nmajority did on the 9th Circuit panel that initially held the \nCalifornia term limits initiative unconstitutional, but that does not \nmake Senator Kyl a ``liberal judicial activist.''\n  I also recall complaints from conservative quarters when the people \nof Houston reaffirmed their commitment to affirmative action in a \nballot measure last fall. They complained that the voters in Houston \nhad been deceived by the wording of the ballot measure.\n  There have been problems with citizen initiatives and the campaigns \nthat they engender. But that problem is not with Margaret Morrow or her \ncommitment to honor the will of the voters. The problem is that they \nare being utilized in ever increasing number to circumvent the \nlegislature and the people's will as expressed through their \ndemocratically-elected representatives. They are no longer the town \nmeeting democracy that we enjoy in New England but the glitzy, Madison \nAvenue, poll-driven campaigns of big money and special interest \npolitics.\n  Margaret Morrow was right when she pointed out that these measures, \ntheir ballot descriptions and their advertising campaigns ought to be \nbetter, more instructive, more clearly written. The thrust of that now-\ncontroversial article was that lawyers should contribute their skills \nbetter to draft the measures so that once adopted they are clear and \ncontrolling, so that they are not followed by court challenges during \nwhich courts are faced with difficult conflicts over how to interpret \nand implement the will of the people.\n  We know how hard it is to write laws in a way that they are binding \nand leave little room for misinterpretation. With all the staff and \nlegislative counsels, and legal counsels and specially-trained \nlegislative drafters and Congressional Research Service and hearings \nand vetting and comments from Executive Branch departments and highly-\nskilled and experienced and highly-paid lobbyists, Congress has a \ndifficult time writing plain English and passing clear law. Were it not \nfor the administrative agencies and supplemental regulatory processes \neven more of our work product would be the target of legal actions by \nthose who lost the legislative battle over each contested point.\n  For those who preach unfettered allegiance to initiatives, I commend \ntheir rhetoric but note that it does not advance us. The questions in \nmost of the subsequent legal challenges to voter-passed ballot measures \nare either what does it mean or was it passed fairly. Both those \nquestions are premised on an acceptance of the will of the voters.\n  For example, the first challenge to the California term limits \ninitiative was not that in Federal court that resulted in the split \nopinion by a panel of the Ninth Circuit that is later reversed. No, the \nearlier challenge was in the state courts and reached the California \nSupreme Court. The California Supreme Court was required to determine, \nwhat did the ballot measure say, was it written to be a lifetime ban or \na limit on the number of consecutive terms that could be served.\n  That was not an easy question given the poor drafting of the measure \nand the official materials that described it to the voters. Indeed, the \nCalifornia Attorney General, a conservative Republican, argued that the \nmeasure meant only to be a limit on the number of consecutive terms. \nAfter three levels of state court proceedings and months and months and \nhundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees the case was decided by \na split decision of the California Supreme Court.\n  The Federal challenge to the statute followed on the alternative \nground that the voters were not clearly informed what the measure \nmeant. This is only important for those who cherish the will of the \nvoter and want to protect against voter fraud.\n  On citizen initiatives, Margaret Morrow has told the Committee:\n\n       I support citizen initiatives, and believe they are an \n     important aspect of our democratic form of government. . . .\n\n[[Page S653]]\n\n       I believe the citizen initiative process is clearly \n     constitutional. I also recognize and support the doctrine \n     established in case law that initiative measures are \n     presumptively constitutional, and strongly agree with [the] \n     statement that initiative measures that are constitutional \n     and properly drafted should not be overturned or enjoined by \n     the courts.\n\n  Contrary to the impression some are seeking to create about her \nviews, she told the Committee:\n       In passing on the legality of initiative measures, judges \n     should apply the law, not substitute their personal opinion \n     of matters of public policy for the opinion of the \n     electorate.\n\n  I am disappointed to see that some have sought to make the nomination \nof Margaret Morrow into a vote about guns; it is not. During two years \nof consideration by the Judiciary Committee and through two sets of \nhearings and waves of written questions, no one even asked Ms. Morrow \nabout guns.\n  Nonetheless, some who have sought to find a reason to oppose Ms. \nMorrow have fastened upon a few phrases taken out of context from a \nNational Law Journal article from October 1993 that discussed the 67th \nCalifornia State Bar conference. This meeting followed the July 1993 \nkillings in the San Francisco offices of the law firm of Pettit & \nMartin.\n  The National Law Journal's report notes that the representatives of \nthe local voluntary bars considered 100-plus resolutions for referral \nto the State Bar's Board of Governors. The fact missed by those who are \nseeking to criticize this nominee is that the State Bar took no anti-\ngun action.\n  The National Journal report noted that the widow of one of the \nvictims pleaded at a reception that the convention ``take action on gun \ncontrol.'' What has gone unrecognized is that in spite of the emotional \nrhetoric at the conference, the California State Bar took no such \naction. Instead, mindful of the legal constraints on bar associations \nand the United States Supreme Court decision in Keller v. State Bar, \nthe conference scaled back anti-gun resolutions. A resolution calling \nfor a ban on semiautomatic handguns from the San Francisco delegation \nwas reworded as a safety measure for judges, other court personnel and \nlawyers. A resolution from the Santa Clara delegation was turned into a \nmere call for a study.\n  The Chairwoman of the conference was not Margaret Morrow but Pauline \nWeaver of Oakland. Margaret Morrow was not installed as the new \nPresident of the California State Bar until the end.\n  Ms. Morrow told the National Law Journal that the bar should act like \na client and do what is right by following the legal advice of its \nlawyers. That is what the California State Bar did under Margaret \nMorrow. In fact, and this is the key fact missed by those who seek to \ncriticize Ms. Morrow, the California State Bar followed the law as \ndeclared by the United States Supreme Court and did not take action on \ngun control.\n  Mindful of the strictures of law, Margaret Morrow appointed a special \ncommittee of the Board of Governors to review the resolutions that had \nbeen recommended at the conference. Based on the recommendations of \nthat committee, the Board of Governors of the California State Bar did \nnot take a stand on gun control and did not even adopt the resolutions \npassed at the State conference.\n  This is hardly a basis on which to oppose this outstanding nominee. \nFirst, she was not involved in the efforts by some to push gun control \nresolutions through the State Bar, following the horrific killings in \nthe San Francisco law offices a few months before. Second, she was not \ninstalled as the President of the State Bar until the end of the \nconference. Third, the actions she took as President were essentially \nto make sure the Board of Governors understood the law and the limits \non what they could do.\n  So, in spite of the emotional plea by victims and the desires of \ncertain activists, the California State Bar did not adopt gun control \nresolutions in 1994 and did not act to use mandatory dues for political \nactivities. Far from demonstrating that she would be a judicial \nactivist or is anti-gun, these facts show how constrained Margaret \nMorrow was in making sure the law was followed and everyone's rights \nwere respected.\n  I grew up hunting and fishing in the Vermont outdoors and I enjoy \nusing firearms on the range. I believe in the rights of all Americans \nto use and enjoy firearms if they so desire. I voted against the Brady \nbill and other unconstitutional anti-gun proposals. I have no reason to \nthink that Margaret Morrow will judicially impose burdens on gun \nownership.\n  I urge others to review the facts. I am confident that they will come \nto the same conclusion that I have with respect to the nomination of \nMargaret Morrow and the lack of any basis to conclude that she is anti-\ngun.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a January 15, 1998 letter to Senator \nBoxer signed by 11 members of the Board of Governors of the California \nState Bar that year be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 15, 1998.\n     Re Margaret M. Morrow: Judicial nominee for the Central \n         District of California.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: We write concerning the nomination of \n     Margaret M. Morrow to the United States District Court for \n     the Central District of California. It has recently come to \n     our attention that various individuals and/or groups have \n     charged that Ms. Morrow ``vowed to push a gun control \n     resolution'' through the State Bar of California during the \n     year she served as President of that association.\n       Each of us was a member of the State Bar Board of Governors \n     during Ms. Morrow's year as President. We represent a broad \n     spectrum of political views. We are Republicans and \n     Democrats, liberals and conservatives. We write to inform you \n     that Ms. Morrow did not advocate that the State Bar take a \n     position on gun control, and that the association in fact did \n     not take a position on the issue during the 1993-1994 Board \n     year.\n       The assertion that Ms. Morrow vowed to push gun control \n     appears to emanate from an article that appeared in the \n     National Law Journal concerning the 1993 State Bar Annual \n     Meeting. At that meeting, the Conference of Delegates, which \n     is comprised of representatives of voluntary bar associations \n     throughout California, passed two resolutions that called \n     upon the State Bar to study the possible revision of laws \n     relating to firearms, and propose and support measures to \n     protect judges, court personnel, lawyers, lawyers' staffs and \n     lawyers' clients from gun-related violence. These resolutions \n     were passed in the wake of a shooting incident at a prominent \n     San Francisco law firm that took the lives of several of the \n     firm's lawyers and employees.\n       At the time the Conference resolutions were passed, Ms. \n     Morrow had not yet assumed the office of President. When \n     asked how the Board of Governors would respond to the \n     resolutions, she told the National Law Journal that she would \n     ``discuss Keller strictures with the Board,'' and also that \n     she believed the bar ``should act more like a client, . . . \n     that is, get legal advice, `assess the risks and then do what \n     is right.' '' Ms. Morrow's reference to ``Keller strictures'' \n     was a reference to the United States Supreme Court's decision \n     in Keller v. State Bar. That case held that the bar could not \n     use mandatory lawyers' dues to support political or \n     ideological causes.\n       On its face, therefore, the National Law Journal article \n     does not support the assertion that Ms. Morrow ``vowed to \n     push a gun control resolution'' through the State Bar. \n     Rather, it reports that she vowed to discuss legal \n     restrictions on the bar's ability to act on such a resolution \n     with other members of the Board.\n       Ms. Morrow's actions in the months that followed the Annual \n     Meeting further demonstrate that she followed the law as it \n     relates to this subject. Consistent with usual State Bar \n     procedure, the resolutions passed by the conference of \n     Delegates were considered by the Board of Governors. Because \n     of the legal issues involved, Ms. Morrow appointed a special \n     committee of the Board to review the resolutions and \n     recommend a position to the full Board. Based on the \n     committee's recommendation, the Board did not adopt the \n     resolutions passed by the Conference. Rather, it adopted a \n     neutral resolution that called on lawyers to ``participate in \n     the public dialogue on violence and its impact on the \n     administration of justice,'' and suggested that the State Bar \n     sponsor ``neutral forums on violence and its impact on the \n     administration of justice.'' The even-handed tone of the \n     resolution was due, in large part, to the belief of Ms. \n     Morrow and others that the Board should not violate Keller's \n     spirit or holding. Stated differently, Ms. Morrow and the \n     Board followed the law, and avoided taking a stand in favor \n     of or against gun control.\n       We hope these comments help set the record straight with \n     respect to Ms. Morrow's actions as President of the State \n     Bar.\n           Very truly yours,\n         Michael W. Case,\n         Maurice L. Evans,\n         Donald R. Fischbach,\n         Edward B. Huntington,\n         Richard J. Mathias,\n         James E. Towery,\n         Glenda Veasey,\n         Hartley T. Hansen,\n         John H. McGuckin, Jr.,\n         Jay J. Plotkin, and\n\n[[Page S654]]\n\n         Susan J. Troy.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note that Senators Ashcroft and Sessions \nhave not challenged Ms. Morrow's truthfulness before the Committee. At \ntheir press conference last fall announcing their opposition to her \nnomination, they were careful to avoid such personal attacks. Instead, \nthey based their conclusions on her writings. I disagree with them and \nagree with those who read those writings in context. That is a \ndisagreement, we draw different conclusions from the same words. That \nis understandable.\n  What I do not understand is how anyone can continue to repeat the \nclaim that Ms. Morrow was not truthful with the Committee. She was \nrequired to answer more litmus test questions and was more forthcoming \nthan any nominee I can remember.\n  Some have made the confirmation process into an adversary process. \nMs. Morrow is not paranoid; someone has been out to get her.\n  In this difficult context, in which the Morrow nomination was \ntargeted by forces opposing the filling of judicial vacancies, charges \nagainst Ms. Morrow's integrity and character remain out of line and \nunfounded. Unfortunately, I have heard repeated over the last day the \ncharge that Ms. Morrow provided a false answer to a written question \npropounded at the Committee. That is incorrect.\n  While I will not take the Senate's time to refute all of the \nunfounded arguments that have been used in opposition to this \nnomination, I do want to clear up the record on this. This is a matter \nof honor and honesty. I do not want the record left unchallenged should \nher son, Patrick, come to read it someday.\n  The written questions propounded long after the Committee deadline \nfollowing the March 18, 1997 hearing included the following: ``Are \nthere any initiatives in California in the last decade which you have \nsupported? If so, why? Are there any initiatives in California in the \nlast decade you have opposed? If so, why?\"\n  On April 4, the nominee responded in writing noting:\n\n       I have not publicly supported or opposed any initiative \n     measure in the past decade, with one exception.'' The nominee \n     proceeded in her answer to describe her participation as a \n     member of the Los Angeles County Bar Association Board of \n     Trustees in a unanimous vote authorizing the Association to \n     oppose a measure sponsored by Lyndon LaRouche concerning \n     AIDS, a measure that was also opposed by Governor Deukmejian \n     and many others.\n\n  I raised objection to these questions at a meeting of the Committee \non April 17 because I saw them as asking how Ms. Morrow voted on the \nmore than 150 initiatives that Californians had considered over the \nlast 10 years. Later, the Senator who submitted these questions \nindicated that he did not intend to ask how the nominee voted and he \nrevised the questions. When he did, he resubmitted another set of \nsupplemental written questions to the nominee on April 21, he \nacknowledged that 160 initiatives have been on the ballot in California \nin the last 10 years and he disavowed any interest whether or not the \nnominee voted on the initiatives but asked for ``comment'' on a list of \ninitiatives.\n  Some have come to contend that the portion of the answer about public \nsupport or opposition to initiatives was ``intentionally or \nunintentionally'' not truthful information. Their supposed ``smoking \ngun'' is a November 1988 article in the Los Angeles Lawyer magazine. \nWhat this contention about dishonesty ignores is that the nominee had \npreviously furnished the Committee with the November 1988 article and \nthat article had been inquired about at the March 18 hearing and in the \nfollow up written questions. In fact, the written questions that \nincluded the ones at issue contained quotes from the article and \nquestions specifically about it. Thus, no one can seriously contend \nthat this article was unknown to the Committee or that the nominee had \nfailed to disclose it.\n  Equally important, and the reason I suspect that the nominee did not \nrefer to the article in her written response to the questions in issue, \nwas that the article was not relevant to these particular questions. \nPreceding questions had inquired about the meaning of the article. The \nquestions in issue ask about support or opposition for initiatives and \nappear to inquire about such support or opposition for initiatives in \nthe course of their being considered by voters in California.\n  By contrast, the article concerned measures that had already been \nacted upon by the voters of California, including one that had been \nconsidered two years previously. They were not support for or \nopposition to these initiatives, as the nominee, or, for that matter as \nI, understood those questions. They were commentary after the fact by \nway of comment upon the growing resort to initiatives in California and \nways lawyers might help to improve the initiative process and the \ndrafting and consideration of initiatives as well as a call for the \nState legislature to function more efficiently.\n  Indeed, when the author of those questions received the initial \nanswer, he did not question that it was untruthful or feign ignorance \nof the November 1988 article. Instead, when he revised and resubmitted \nsupplemental questions he prefaced his revised question by noting that \nhe was aware of the nominee's ``public comments regarding citizen \ninitiatives.''\n  Thus, no one can fairly believe that this nominee's answer was \nincomplete or deceptive for having failed to include express reference \nto an article that was not advocating in favor or in opposition to a \npending initiative and about which the questioner had knowledge, had \nalready specifically inquired and on which the questioner promptly \nprofessed knowledge.\n  Stripped of the rhetoric and hyperbole, there is simply no basis to \ncontend that this nominee mislead the Committee by her answer. This is \nno basis to question her candor. Any purported ``major misstatement of \nfact'' is not that of this nominee but would be of those who accuse her \nof a lack of honesty or candor.\n  No fair and objective evaluation of the record can yield the \nconclusion that she is anti-initiative. No fair reading of her \nstatements suggests a basis for any such assertion.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from Missouri said I could yield myself 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments \nregarding the nomination of Margaret Morrow.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side have attempted to argue that \nMs. Morrow has been treated unfairly. This unsubstantiated argument is \nbased partly on the questions she was asked in the Judiciary Committee. \nHowever, all that some of us were trying to achieve in asking those \nquestions was to attempt to understand what Ms. Morrow's views were on \na number of important issues to the American people. In particular, \nwe've had a number of Federal judges overturn popular initiatives, in \ndirect conflict with voters' decisions. The last thing we need is \nanother Federal judge that will defy what the voters have decided. Ms. \nMorrow has spoken against citizen initiatives and has publicly opposed \nspecific ballot initiatives. So, we believed it was important to \nunderstand better what kind of a judge she might be.\n  Now, we've heard Margaret Morrow was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee in the last Congress without a problem. So, why is there a \nproblem now? Well, I think to our credit, we on this side tried to give \nthe President a great deal of deference regarding his nominees. But, as \nSenator Hatch and others have pointed out, the President has appointed \na number of judges who have taken it upon themselves to try to make the \nlaw, and have angered the public in doing so. This record now demands \nthe kind of scrutiny Senator Leahy advocated, which has been absent \nuntil the last couple of years or so. I've received a great deal of \nletters from my State asking me to do a better job of scrutinizing \nnominees.\n  Of course, after getting used to us rubber-stamping nominees, I'm \nsure it's been quite a shock to see Republicans borrowing from the \nDemocrats' playbook and turning the tables. Over the last year, I've \nheard irresponsible and overheated rhetoric directed at Republicans \nregarding judicial nominees.\n  To suggest, as some misguided Members have, that Ms. Morrow's gender \nis a factor in our decision to ask her\n\n[[Page S655]]\n\nquestions, or even oppose her nomination, is both irresponsible and \nabsurd. As others may have noted, we've processed around 50 women \njudicial nominees for President Clinton, including Justice Ginsberg, \nand I've supported almost all of them. As a matter of fact, the first \nnominee unanimously confirmed last year was a woman candidate, and \nwe've already confirmed a couple this year. It's just absurd to think \nthat any Senator makes his or her decision on a nominee based on gender \nor race.\n  Mr. President, I sent Ms. Morrow five pages of questions in total. As \na contrast, I sent Merrick Garland 25 pages of questions. So, 5 pages \nversus 24 pages. And, we're supposedly unfair to Ms. Morrow. Figure \nthat one out.\n  I must say though, it was easier getting Mr. Garland to respond to \nhis 25 pages of 100 or so questions than it was to get Ms. Morrow to \nanswer her 5 pages.\n  Mr. President, when a judicial nominee, whether a man or a woman, \nwrites an article which is critical of democratic institutions like the \ncitizen initiative process, it is our duty as Senators to learn the \nreasons for this. How can a Senator reasonably give advice and consent \nwithout understanding a potential judge's position on such fundamental \nissues? With the recent propensity of Federal judges, especially in \nCalifornia, to overturn Democratic initiatives on shaky grounds. It's \nimportant that we not confirm another activist judge who is willing to \nsubstitute his or her will for that of the voters.\n  I recall during the Democrat-run confirmation hearings of various \nRepublican nominees the issue of ``confirmation conversion'' was a \nrecurrent theme.\n  But, now the shoe is on the other foot. When Ms. Morrow answered \nwritten and oral questions contradicting her former beliefs on certain \nissues, I became somewhat concerned. Several of my followup questions \nrelated to such ``conversations.'' Where there are discrepancies, we \nhave a duty to uncover the reasons why.\n  But a more disturbing problem I have seen with Ms. Morrow's writing \nis that, on number of issues, she doesn't say her views have changed. \nShe says we are misreading her writing. In other words, she doesn't \nreally mean what she appears to say.\n  In the 1988 article on citizen initiatives, for example, Ms. Morrow \nwrites in language that is highly critical of the voters. She has \nrecently responded that she ``had not meant to be critical of citizen \ninitiatives.'' Yet, in her article she goes so far as to state that\n\n       The fact that initiatives are presented to a \n     ``legislature'' of 20 million people renders ephemeral any \n     real hope of intelligent voting by a majority.\n\n  In her statement, Ms. Morrow was basically saying that initiatives \nare inherently flawed, although now she is translating it differently. \nSo this raises serious questions about Ms. Morrow's ability to \nenunciate her views in a clear and concise manner, which we all hope \njudges will do. If such conflicting messages are reflected in her \nwriting as a lawyer, her potential judicial opinions may be equally \nconfusing. How can citizens rely on writings of someone who has a \nrecord of contradicting herself?\n  But, on top of these shortcomings, Mr. President, there is a matter \nof more importance. Whether intentionally or not, Ms. Morrow has, \nunfortunately, provided false and misleading information to the \nJudiciary Committee. And, I believe the integrity of the committee and \nthe nomination process is at stake.\n  When asked her views on a number of initiatives, Ms. Morrow first \nresponded by stating unequivocally, ``I have not publicly supported or \nopposed any initiative measure in the past decade with one exception.'' \nAnd, then she mentioned a specific initiative from 1988 sponsored by \nthe extremist Democrat, Lyndon Larouche, that she opposed.\n  But, despite Ms. Morrow's unequivocal denial, in 1988 it turns out \nshe also publicly attacked three other initiatives that pitted the \ninsurance industry against trial lawyers. Ms. Morrow wrote, \n``Propositions 101, 104 and 106 were, plain and simple, an attack on \nlawyers and the legal system.'' In 1988, she went on to attack a 1986 \nproposition that would have reduced the salaries of public officials. \nShe argued it would have ``driven many qualified people out of public \nservice.'' Of course, we hear that worn out argument every time we \ndebate our own pay raises.\n  Now, Ms. Morrow had stated, without question, that she had not taken \nany public position on these initiatives whatsoever. And, after \ncreating this foundation of sand, she used it to refuse to answer \nquestions on her views.\n  Well, the foundation crumbled after the chairman demanded responses, \nand perhaps the nominee realized her misinformation had been \ndiscovered. Only then did she finally provide more responsive answers \nto the questions.\n  But, the fact remains that regardless of whether there was an \nintention or motive, false and misleading information was provided to \nthe Judiciary Committee by the nominee, an experienced lawyer, who one \nwould presume either knew, or should have known, what she was doing. If \nshe indeed didn't realize what she was doing, then one has to question \nher ability to be careful with the details, which would reflect on her \nability to function as a Federal judge.\n  Now, I'm sure that many of you are unaware of this problem, so I'm \nbringing it to your attention. Unfortunately, some have tried to make \nthe feeble argument that these were just mistakes that should be \noverlooked. Well, this isn't a mistake of failing to provide articles \nto the committee, which the nominee did. This isn't a mistake of \nquoting a controversial statement of Justice Brennan, and they saying \nshe pulled the quote from some book, but hadn't read the context of the \nquote, and didn't know what it meant.\n  This is a major misstatement of fact, that was used as the basis for \nnot responding to the committee. This is not what we expect from \nlifetime tenured judges. Mr. President, this is below the standard we \nall demand. This is below the standard afforded most Americans in their \ndealings with the government. For these reasons Mr. President, I will \nvote against the nominee.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask that I be able to speak for 5 minutes and retain \nthe remainder of my time, and Senator Hatch would like to have his 5 \nminutes retained as well. My understanding is I have 10 minutes, he has \n5 minutes, and I will now use 5 minutes of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to put in the Record an article from the Los \nAngeles Lawyer, November 1988, that directly refutes the remarks by the \nSenator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, who said that Ms. Morrow misled \nthe committee and publicly took a stand on initiatives when clearly in \nthis article it is very obvious she wrote about these after those \ninitiatives were voted on in all cases. I think it is very serious that \nthe Senator from Iowa, who is my friend and we work on many issues \ntogether, would misstate what occurred.\n  So, Mr. President, at this time I would place this article in the \nRecord. She says she is commenting on initiatives that had appeared on \nthe November 8 ballot in one case. On the other she commented on an \ninitiative that was voted on 2 years prior. So I ask unanimous consent \nthat be printed in the Record for starters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nReforming the Initiative Process--An Opportunity To Restore Responsible \n                        Government to California\n\n                        (By Margaret M. Morrow)\n\n       We in California have this month concluded the single most \n     expensive and one of the most complicated initiative \n     campaigns in history. I refer, of course, to the battle over \n     Propositions 100, 101, 103, 104 and 106, the insurance and \n     attorneys' fees initiatives, which appeared on the November 8 \n     ballot. Much as we might like to dismiss these propositions \n     and the campaigns they spawned as an aberration, we cannot do \n     so. The cost and tone of the campaigns, and the complexity of \n     the measures involved, are simply the latest examples of a \n     disturbing trend toward overuse and abuse of the initiative \n     process.\n       Much of the rhetoric in the recent campaign focused on \n     lawyers, and much of the spending pro and con was done by \n     lawyers. Insurance industry Propositions 101, 104 and 106 \n     were, plain and simple, an attack on lawyers and the legal \n     system. They were not the first such assault and they \n     probably will not be the last. Self-interest alone, \n     therefore,\n\n[[Page S656]]\n\n     may dictate that lawyers examine the initiative process to \n     see if it is serving the purpose intended by its creators. \n     Our responsibility as citizens compels us to do so as well, \n     since recent abuse of the initiative process is but one \n     symptom of a general malaise in government in this state.\n       The right of initiative was placed in the California \n     Constitution in 1911, as part of a series of reforms \n     championed by populist Governor Hiram Johnson. Johnson \n     believed that the initiative would serve as a check on the \n     unaccountable, corrupt or unresponsive legislature, and would \n     provide a grass roots vehicle for citizens who saw their \n     desires thwarted by elected representatives.\n       The initiative was never intended to serve as a substitute \n     for legislative lawmaking, nor as a weapon in the arsenal of \n     wealthy special interest groups. In reality, however, it has \n     become both of these things.\n\n\n                           dramatic increase\n\n       The number of initiatives put before the public has risen \n     dramatically in recent years. Only 17 initiatives were filed \n     in the 1950s. This number rose to 44 in the 1960s, and leaped \n     to 180 in the 1970s. Thus far in the 1980s, 204 initiatives \n     have been filed. There were 12 on this month's ballot alone, \n     covering such diverse topics as the homeless, AIDS, insurance \n     rates, attorneys' fees, cigarette taxation and part-time \n     teaching by judges at public universities and colleges.\n       This increased use of the initiative process is \n     attributable to a number of factors. In recent years, \n     California legislators have become so beholden to special \n     interest groups for campaign financing and added personal \n     income that they have been paralyzed to act on controversial \n     measures negatively impacting their benefactors. One need \n     look no further than tort reform and insurance reform, the \n     meat of Propositions 100, 101, 103, 104 and 106, to see that \n     this is true. Bills on these subjects have been consistently \n     opposed by trial lawyers associations on the one hand, and \n     the insurance industry on the other. Whether one favors \n     reform in these areas or not, it is hard to argue with the \n     fact that their movement in the legislature has been stymied \n     not on the merits, but because of the perceived power of the \n     interests involved. This lawmaking paralysis, coupled with \n     tales of corruption in Sacramento, has led the public to lose \n     confidence in and to mistrust state government. A natural \n     side effect has been an increase in the popularity of the \n     initiative.\n       Special interest groups, too, have begun to perceive the \n     utility of the initiative in pushing their agendas. Measures \n     sponsored by such groups often lend themselves to packaging \n     for mass media consumption. Initiatives, moreover, get less \n     scrutiny than legislative bills, and frequently this is just \n     what their interest group sponsors want. In the legislature, \n     many eyes review a bill before it is put to a final vote. \n     Legislative counsel examines it for technical or legal \n     shortcomings. Various committees look at it from different \n     perspectives. Pros and cons are debated, and compromises are \n     reached.\n       The public, by contrast, casts its vote for initiatives on \n     the basis of 30- and 60-second advertisements which ignore or \n     obscure the substance of the measure, and which focus instead \n     on who sponsors the proposition. The process allows for no \n     amendment or compromise. An initiative is an all-or-nothing \n     proposition.\n       Reformers and special interest groups have been joined, \n     ironically enough, by politicians and officeholders in \n     frequent resort to the initiative. Lawmakers, frustrated with \n     being the party out of power or seeking to increase their \n     popularity through association with a successful proposition, \n     have begun to sponsor and promote a variety of initiatives. \n     They do so to circumvent a legislative process they cannot \n     control or to create leverage they can use to manipulate that \n     process more effectively. Personal popularity is enhanced, \n     too, when one lends one's name to a successful ballot \n     proposition.\n\n\n                            SPIRALING COSTS\n\n       This increased use of the initiative has fundamentally \n     changed the nature of the right. Spiraling costs have made a \n     mockery of its grass roots origins. A good example of the \n     runaway expense associated with most initiative campaigns is \n     Proposition 61, a measure which appeared on the ballot two \n     years ago. This proposal would have drastically reduced the \n     salaries of all government officials, including judges, and \n     driven many qualified people out of public service. The \n     measure was opposed by virtually every recognized \n     organization and by the state's most prominent political \n     leaders. Yet opponents were told that they would have to \n     raise millions of dollars to ensure the measure's defeat. \n     This year's battle over insurance and attorney's fees raises \n     the even more frightening specter of massive campaigns \n     financed by wealth special interest groups. The insurance \n     industry alone has spent something in the range of $50 \n     million promoting its position on Propositions 100, 101, 103, \n     104, and 106. These kinds of numbers make any true grassroot \n     effort by a group of citizens nothing more than a pipedream.\n       Misleading advertising and reliance on seconds-long \n     television and radio spots, moreover, defeat any chance that \n     citizens can obtain the information necessary to cast an \n     informed vote. The fat that initiatives are presented to a \n     ``legislature'' of 20 million people renders ephemeral any \n     real hope of intelligent voting by a majority. Only a small \n     minority of voters study their ballot pamphlet with any care \n     and only the minutest percentage take time to read the \n     proposed statutory language itself.\n       Indeed, it seems too much to ask that they do, since \n     propositions are often lengthy and difficult for a layperson \n     to understand. Proposition 104, for example, consumed almost \n     13 pages of small, single-spaced type in the most recent \n     ballot pamphlet and concerned some of the most technical \n     aspects of the Insurance Code. The problem is exacerbated by \n     the fact that paid advertising and news reports tend to focus \n     on the identity of the proponents and opponents and on how \n     much money each campaign is spending, rather than on the \n     substance of the measure and the arguments in favor of or \n     against it. Some advertising, in fact, is affirmatively \n     misleading concerning the content and effect of the \n     initiative.\n       To add to the confusion, many initiatives are poorly \n     drafted, internally inconsistent or hopelessly vague. Bills \n     introduced in the legislature are subjected to many levels of \n     review before final passage, and drafting or clarity problems \n     usually surface and are resolved before a final vote is \n     taken. Initiatives, by contrast, receive no prior review \n     before being put to a vote of the people. The likelihood of \n     any subsequent review is minimal too, since an initiative, \n     once approved, can only be amended by another vote of the \n     people.\n       The net result is that many of the more complicated \n     measures passed by the voters end up in the courts for final \n     review.\n       As David Magleby of Brigham Young University, a leading \n     authority on the initiative process, has said, ``Unlike other \n     political processes, there are no checks and balances on the \n     initiative process [other] than the courts.'' The courts are \n     thus forced to become ``the policeman of the initiative \n     process.''\n       Requiring that the courts assume this role is not good for \n     the public image of the judiciary or of the legal profession. \n     Having passed an initiative, voters want to see it enacted. \n     They view a court challenge to its validity as interference \n     with the public will, and blame the lawyers and judges who \n     control the legal process for thwarting the public's \n     directive.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     numerous proposals for reform of the initiative process over \n     the years. Some have urged that contributions to initiative \n     campaigns be limited, and that disclosure of financial \n     backers be required in all campaign advertising. Others have \n     suggested that initiatives go directly to the legislature for \n     a vote before being presented to the electorate. Still others \n     have proposed that all initiatives be screened by the \n     Secretary of State's office for legal and drafting problems \n     before they qualify for the ballot. Several of these ideas \n     are sound and would address some of the most glaring problems \n     with the initiative process as it now operates. Given the \n     campaign we have just endured, we must hope that these \n     proposals are resurrected quickly and implemented swiftly.\n       Initiative reform, however, is not enough. There must be in \n     addition an overhaul of the way business gets done in \n     Sacramento, so that the legislature can function as it should \n     and resort to the initiative is not necessary. Limits on \n     campaign spending, higher salaries coupled with rules \n     prohibiting the taking of honoraria and gifts, quarterly \n     disclosure of contributions by legislators and serious self-\n     policing through active ethics committees in the Assembly and \n     Senate are just a few of the ideas which should be explored. \n     Whatever the solution, legislators must become what they were \n     intended to be--representatives of the people, not puppets of \n     a panoply of interest groups who define public good in terms \n     of their own pocketbooks.\n       Lawyers and lawyers' organizations should be at the \n     forefront of these reform efforts. Lawyers are among those \n     most uniquely concerned with the interpretation of laws and \n     the enforcement of legal rights. We are among those most \n     familiar with the delicate balance between executive, \n     legislative, and judicial branches envisioned by the founders \n     of our democratic form of government. Our traditions and our \n     rules of professional responsibility, moreover, obligate us \n     to work for the public good. There is no greater public good \n     than strong, effective, good government.\n       We lawyers assert that we are among the leaders of society, \n     and it is time we began to act the part. I intend to \n     establish a committee to examine existing proposals for \n     reform, explore other options and recommend a course of \n     action. Our Association has a real opportunity, which we \n     cannot ignore, to contribute to restoring responsible \n     government of California. We welcome your ideas and support.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I also want my colleagues to understand that the Senator \nfrom Iowa asked Ms. Morrow in an unprecedented request which, frankly, \nhad Senators on both sides in an uproar, to answer the question how she \npersonally voted on 10 years' worth of California initiatives. It was \nastounding. I remember going over to my friend, whom I enjoy working \nwith, and I have worked with him on so many procurement reform issues, \nand I said, ``Senator, I can't imagine how you would expect someone to \nremember how they voted on 160 ballot measures,'' some of which had to \ndo with\n\n[[Page S657]]\n\nparks, some of which had to do with building railroads, some of which \nhad to do with school bond measures. And besides, I always thought--and \ncorrect me if I am wrong--we had a secret ballot in this country; it is \none of the things we pride ourselves on.\n  Now, Margaret Morrow has been forthcoming. That is why she has the \nstrong support of Senator Orrin Hatch, and let's read what Senator \nHatch has written about Margaret Morrow.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, since my name was mentioned, I would \nlike to respond, if the Senator would yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from California yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I will be happy to allow a 30-second response.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will only remind the Senator from California that the \npoint I was making is not when--the question I was proposing is not \nwhen Ms. Morrow responded. The question is that she said she did not \ntake a position on public policy issues except for that one, and she \ndid take, we found out that she did take positions on public policy \nissues. So she was misleading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I might make a point here. When one is asked if one \ntook a stand on an initiative, one would assume the critical point is \nat what time you speak out about it. My goodness, if we are forbidden \nas human beings, let alone the head of a bar association, to comment on \nwhat voters have voted on and to talk about ways the initiative process \ncan be improved--and I am going to put into the Record her remarks on \nthat point because she has such respect for the initiative process. She \nhas thought about ways to improve it--if we are gagged as human beings \nfrom commenting on what the voters have voted on, this is a sad state \nof affairs for this country.\n  So I want to talk about what Senator Hatch has said about Margaret \nMorrow. I think it is important. He said it himself quite eloquently at \nthe beginning of this debate. But I want to reiterate because he sent a \nletter out to all of our colleagues, and he talked about the comment \nthat Margaret Morrow made that has been so taken out of context by my \ncolleagues.\n  He said that the committee, the Judiciary Committee, studied Margaret \nMorrow's response to make a decision as to whether she was an activist \njudge, and they concluded that her explanation was in keeping with the \ntheme of her speech. And essentially, Senator Hatch goes on to say, \n``[T]he nominee went to some lengths in her oral testimony and her \nwritten responses to the Committee to espouse a clearly restrained \napproach to the constitutional interpretation and the role of the \ncourts.''\n  Then he goes on to say the following:\n\n       In supporting the nomination, the Committee takes into \n     account a number of factors including Ms. Morrow's testimony, \n     her accomplishments and her evident ability as an attorney, \n     as well as the fact that she has received strong support from \n     a number of Republicans.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask I be allowed another 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So my colleagues have every right to oppose Margaret \nMorrow. My goodness, it is a free country. They have every right to \nvote against her and speak against her. But I would like when we have \narguments in the Chamber, particularly where someone is not present, \nthat these arguments be true, that these arguments hold up, that these \narguments are backed up by the facts.\n\n  I want to point out that in several of my colleagues' dissertations \nhere today, they have talked about other lawyers, they have talked \nabout other judges. It is extraordinary to me that they do not want \nMargaret Morrow, so they talk about three other judges. Margaret Morrow \nis Margaret Morrow. She is not judge X, judge Y or judge Z. She is \nMargaret Morrow. She is coming before us, the second woman ever elected \nto head the Los Angeles County Bar Association, the first woman ever \nelected to head the California State Bar Association. This is the \nlargest State bar in any State. Republicans voted for her for that \nposition. Democrats did as well. She has the most extraordinary support \nacross the board.\n  So when we attack Margaret Morrow, my goodness, don't talk about \nother judges. Talk about Margaret Morrow. If my colleagues are running \nfor the Senate, they want to be judged on who they are, what do they \nstand for, not to stand up and say, well, I can't vote for this \ncandidate X because he or she reminds me of candidate Y, and if he gets \nin, he will act like candidate Y.\n  One great thing about the world today is we are all individuals. We \nare all human beings. God doesn't make us all the same. That is why I \nam going to vote against cloning. We are different than one another. So \nwhen you attack Margaret Morrow, I think you need to do it in a fair \nway, not by the fact that another judge ruled a certain way. And when I \ncome back to my last 5 minutes, I will continue on this theme.\n  I yield back and retain my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield to myself the remainder of the \ntime and ask you to inform me when there is 1 minute remaining.\n  I am concerned about this nominee who has indicated that when the \npeople are involved in developing the law through a referendum, you \ndon't get intelligent lawmaking. I am concerned about that because from \nher writings it appears that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nembraced that very view. When the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals sought \nto set aside the California voters' commitment to term limits, they did \nso based on what they considered to be the lack of expertise of the \npeople. Here is what Judge Reinhardt said when he set aside the term \nlimits initiative in California:\n\n       The public lacks legal or legislative expertise--or even a \n     duty to support the Constitution. Our usual assumption that \n     laws passed represent careful drafting and consideration does \n     not obtain.\n\n  Where might he get an idea like that idea, to allege that the people \nare disregarded because they don't have legal training.\n  Here is what Ms. Morrow said:\n\n       The fact that initiatives are presented to a legislature of \n     20 million people renders ephemeral any real hope of \n     intelligent voting by the majority.\n\n  This is the judge who has been reversed over and over again when the \nCalifornia Ninth Circuit was reversed 27 out of 28 times by the Supreme \nCourt. They are embracing this philosophy in those kinds of items.\n  Reinhardt said:\n\n       The public . . . lacks the ability to collect and study \n     information that is utilized routinely by legislative bodies.\n\n  Where could he have gotten that? Same philosophy as Ms. Morrow who \nsaid:\n\n       . . . propositions are often lengthy and difficult for a \n     layperson to understand. The public . . . casts its votes for \n     initiatives on the basis of 30- and 60-second advertisements.\n\n  Both of these reflect a distrust of the people: One an activist \njudge, one of the most reversed judges in history; the other an \noffering of this administration for us to confirm.\n  I am calling into question the judgment and the respect that this \nnominee has for the people. And it is based on her statements. By \ncontrasting her to Judge Reinhardt, I am trying to point out that the \nsame kind of mistakes made by the most reversed judge on the ninth \ncircuit are the kinds of mistakes that you find in Ms. Morrow's \nwritings, and I think it reflects a confidence in lawyers and judges \nthat permits them to do things that the law doesn't provide them a \nbasis to do.\n  The law says the people of California have a right, if they want to \nhave term limits, to have an initiative that embraces it. But what does \nJudge Reinhardt say? Judge Reinhardt says:\n\n       Before an initiative becomes law, no committee meetings are \n     held, no legal analysts study the law, no floor debates \n     occur, no separate representative bodies vote on the bill. . \n     . .\n\n  He does that as a means of setting aside the law, saying the people \nare simply too ignorant. They have not studied this carefully enough.\n  Where would Morrow be on that kind of issue? According to her \nwritings:\n\n       In the legislative, many eyes review a bill before it is \n     put to a final vote. Legislative counsel [another lawyer] \n     examine it for technical or legal shortcomings. Various \n     committees look at it from different perspectives. Pros and \n     cons are debated.\n\n  We have already in California and on the west coast in the Ninth \nCircuit\n\n[[Page S658]]\n\nCourt of Appeals, a court of appeals that is reversed constantly. In \ntheir setting aside of initiatives, in their invasion of the province \nof the people, and in their invasion of the legislative function, they \ntake a page out of the writings of this candidate. But I don't think we \nneed more judicial activists. I think it is clear she believes the \ncutting edge of society should be the law and its profession. I think \nthe cutting edge needs to be the legislature and the people expressing \ntheir will in initiatives. That is where the law should be changed. The \nengine of social change should not be the courts. The engine for social \nchange should be the people and their elected representatives. When the \npeople enact a law through the initiative process, it is imperative \nthat the will of the people be respected.\n  Even if you graduate from the best of law schools and you have a \ngreat understanding of legal principles, our country says that the \npeople who cast the votes are the people whose will is to be respected. \nBecause she seems to believe otherwise, I do not think this nominee \nshould be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, at this point, since Senator Hatch is not \nhere, he has given me permission to use up his time and mine, and I \nassume I have about 7 minutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, sometimes I think my colleagues have a \nvery strange definition of activist judge. Listening to them, I think \nif you have a heartbeat and a pulse, they call you an activist. I mean, \nI--really, listen to them.\n  Are you supposed to nominate a person who has not had a thought in \nher head, who cannot say, 2 years after an initiative passed, that she \nthought it was good, bad, or indifferent, who cannot comment on a way \nto make the initiative process better?\n  They also have a way of selective arguing--selective arguing. In \n1988, Margaret Morrow wrote the following. This is directly from an \narticle in 1988, way before she even dreamt of coming before this \nSenate. Here is what she wrote:\n\n       Having passed an initiative, voters want to see it enacted. \n     They view a court challenge to its validity as interference \n     with the public will.\n\n  So here is Margaret Morrow arguing that when the voters pass an \ninitiative, they want it enacted. I see Senator Hatch is here, so when \nI finish my 2 minutes I am going to yield him his 5 minutes.\n  I want to say that this is a woman whose practice, if you look at it, \nis far from anyone's definition of being an activist. These are the \nareas of law that she has practiced.\n  Contract disputes, business torts, unfair competition, securities \nfraud, directors' and officers' liability, employment law, arbitration \nlaw, copyright and trademark infringement, libel, partnership \ndissolution, real estate development, government contracts, and \ninsurance coverage.\n  So my colleagues paint the picture of someone who is entirely \ndifferent from Margaret Morrow. Mr. President, I just ask my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to vote on Margaret Morrow. Do not vote on \njudge X, do not vote on judge Y, don't vote on some ideological basis \nbecause you think she is going to be a certain way. Follow the \nleadership of Chairman Hatch, follow the leadership of the many \nRepublican conservatives who have gone on the line to fight for \nMargaret Morrow.\n  I have to say to my colleague from Missouri, thank you for bringing \nthis debate almost to an end. I think I have enjoyed debating you. I \nwish we could have done it sooner rather than later. But I am pleased \nthat we have reached this day, and to Margaret and to her family, I \nhope that tonight you will have a reason to celebrate. I can't be sure \nuntil the votes are in, but we will know soon.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would just like to continue my response to \nsome of the arguments offered by my colleagues, and set the record \nstraight. On the issue of Ms. Morrow's position on ballot initiatives, \nthere are some people who, having read an article she wrote in 1988, \nbelieve that Ms. Morrow holds disdain for citizen initiatives. This is \ncompletely false. I repeat--any concerns that Ms. Morrow holds a \nposition other than being 100% supportive of citizen initiatives has no \nbasis in fact. In fact, in that 1988 article, Ms. Morrow expressed her \nconcern about misleading advertisements which provide misinformation \nfor voters. This made it hard, she argued, for voters to make \nmeaningful choices and ``renders ephemeral any real hope of intelligent \nvoting by a majority.'' Read in context, this statement concerned the \nquality of information disseminated to the voters, and was not a \ncomment on the ability of voters to make intelligent choices with the \nnecessary information in hand. Ms. Morrow holds the utmost respect for \ndemocratic institutions like the citizen initiative process in \nCalifornia.\n  In that same 1988 article, Ms. Morrow argued that courts should not \nbe put in the position of policing the initiative process. ``Having \npassed an initiative,'' she explains, ``voters want to see it enacted. \nThey view a court challenge to its validity as interference with the \npublic will. . . .'' Hopefully my colleagues here in the Senate \nunderstand that Ms. Morrow merely advocated reforms that would \nameliorate problems in the California initiative process.\n  For those who may still not be convinced, I would like to read a \nportion of a letter that I referred to earlier from Robert Bonner, who, \nas I mentioned, was former U.S. Attorney under President Reagan, former \nU.S. District Court Judge in the Central District of California and \nformer Head of the Drug Enforcement Administration under President \nBush. Mr. Bonner writes:\n\n       The concerns expressed about judicial activism appear to be \n     based on a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of certain \n     articles written by Margaret years ago in her capacity as \n     President of the State Bar of California, the Los Angeles \n     County Bar Association, and the Barristers (young lawyers) \n     section of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. In \n     particular, in 1988, while she was the President of the Los \n     Angeles County Bar Association, Margaret wrote an article \n     concerning the initiative process. The article was critical \n     of the way certain recently concluded initiative campaigns \n     had been run, and suggested ways in which the initiative \n     process could be strengthened by communicating more \n     information to the electorate about the substance of the \n     measures. It also discussed procedural reforms that would \n     assist in correcting the drafting errors that sometimes \n     provide the basis for a legal challenge. Finally, it \n     suggested measures to reduce the influence of special \n     interests and increase the legislature's willingness to \n     address issues of concern to the citizens of the state.\n       The article does not suggest hostility to the initiative \n     process; rather it seeks to strengthen the process. \n     Margaret's responses to the Judiciary Committee demonstrate \n     that she unequivocally supports the initiative process and \n     believes that all legislative enactments, including \n     initiatives, are presumptively constitutional, and that \n     courts should be reluctant to overturn them. Margaret \n     explained to the committee her desire to strengthen the \n     process, not make it vulnerable to legal challenge. She also \n     explained that the article proposed ways to make the process \n     more efficient and less costly, so that the initiatives could \n     serve the purpose for which they were intended.\n\n  To anyone still skeptical, I invite you to call Robert Bonner, who \nbelieves in Margaret Morrow. In his letter to Senators Bond, D'Amato, \nDomenici, Sessions and Specter, Mr. Bonner urged them to give him a \ncall with any questions.\n  Finally, the California Research Bureau, which is a branch of the \nstate public library and supplies nonpartisan data to the executive and \nlegislative branches of the California state government, has much the \nsame role as the Congressional Research Service does for the U.S. \nLegislative Branch. The Bureau put out a study in May of 1997, entitled \nCalifornia's Statewide Initiative Process, which iterated many of the \nsame concerns Ms. Morrow has about the initiative process in \nCalifornia, and which the senior senator from California, Senator \nFeinstein, referred to during the markup of Ms. Morrow's nomination. \nFor instance, this impartial, non-partisan research service notes that \nproponents and opponents of a ballot measure may not have the incentive \nto provide clear information to voters. Further, the Bureau notes that \na number of scholars, elected officials, journalists and commissions \nhave examined the initiative process over the last decade.\n\n  The Bureau cited to concerns about ``serious flaws that require \nimprovement,'' including limited voter information, deceptive media \ncampaigns,\n\n[[Page S659]]\n\nthe lack of legislative review, poor drafting, and the impact of money \nin the initiative process. In other words, Margaret Morrow believes in \nballot initiatives, but has concerns similar to those of the California \nResearch Bureau, a nonpartisan research service for the California \nState Legislature.\n  In summary, let there be no doubt that Ms. Morrow supports citizen \ninitiatives as an important part of our democratic form of government. \nShe also subscribes to the position that legislative enactments, \nincluding initiatives, are presumed to be constitutional, and that \ncourts should be reluctant to overturn legislation. Margaret Morrow did \nsuggest ways the initiative process could be strengthened by providing \nmore information to the electorate and by correcting the drafting \nerrors that sometimes form the basis for a legal challenge, but she \ndoes NOT oppose ballot initiatives.\n  On charges that she may be a judicial activist, let me make it very, \nvery clear. Ms. Morrow believes in the respective roles of the \nlegislative and judicial branches, and will look to the original intent \nof the drafters of the laws and our Constitution.\n  Some have questioned whether Margaret Morrow will be an activist \njudge. Her critics pulled a quote, out of context, from one of her many \nspeeches, and those critics have decided that that single quote is \nevidence that Margaret Morrow will be an activist judge. The quote in \ncontroversy is from a 1- to 2-minute presentation to the State Bar \nConference on Women in the Law. She says: ``For the law is, almost by \ndefinition, on the cutting edge of social thought. It is the vehicle \nthrough which we ease the transition from the rules which have always \nbeen to the rules which are to be.''\n  As Margaret said during her second hearing, the overall context of \nthat speech concerned how lawyers were going to govern the legal \nprofession. She wasn't speaking of the substance of the law. Rather, \nshe was referring to the legal profession. Her point in that speech was \nif lawyers have to work 2,000 to 3,000 hours a year in order to have \npositions in private law firms, how will both men and women in the \nlegal profession govern and balance their careers and their family \nlives? In her speech at the Women in the Law Conference, Margaret \nMorrow said: ``[Women lawyers] should reject the norm of 2000-plus \nhours a year; the norm that places time in the office above time with \nfamily . . . We should work to infuse our perspective into the law--our \nexperience as women, as wives, and as mothers.''\n  I would also refer you to the letter from Robert Bonner which so \nclearly states that he, and so many other Republians of good \nreputation, can assure you that Margaret Morrow will not be an activist \njudge.\n  Finally, some of her critics base their belief that Ms. Morrow will \nbe an activist judge on a speech she made during her installation as \nthe first woman president of the State Bar of California on October 9, \n1993. In her speech, Ms. Morrow quoted Justice William Brennan: \n``Justice can only endure and flourish if law and legal institutions \nare engines of change, able to accommodate evolving patterns of life \nand social interaction.'' Taken out of context, her critics believe Ms. \nMorrow will use the courts as an engine of change. However, during her \nhearing, Ms. Morrow confessed she pulled Justice Brennan's statement \nfrom a book of quotes, and she testified that ``The theme of that \nspeech was that the State Bar of California as an institution and the \nlegal profession had to change some of the ways we did business. The \nquotation regarding engines of change had nothing to do with changes in \nthe rule of law or changes in constitutional interpretation.'' In fact, \nthe speech was about the changes the bar should make so that it would \nbe more responsive to the public. It did not advance a theme that the \ncourts should be engines of change.\n\n  To respond to my colleagues' charge that Margaret Morrow advocated \ngun control while president of the state bar, let me just say that this \nis patently untrue, and is refuted by 11 of the 21 Members of the \nCalifornia State Bar Board of Governors who were on the board at the \ntime in question. They were there, they know what happened and what \ndidn't happen, and they have signed a letter confirming that Margaret \nMorrow did not advocate gun control as her critics accuse her of. These \n11 members are Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  These Republicans and Democrats explain in their letter to me that in \n1993, the State Bar Conference of Delegates--representatives of \nvoluntary bar associations throughout California--adopted two \nresolutions calling upon the Bar to study a possible revision of \nfirearms laws and to propose measures to protect judges, lawyers, and \nothers from gun violence. These resolutions were prompted by a tragic \nshooting incident at a San Francisco law firm in which several people \nwere killed. These resolutions were passed before Ms. Morrow assumed \nher position as the first woman President of the State Bar of \nCalifornia.\n  The resolutions were then considered by the State Bar Board of \nGovernors, of which Margaret Morrow was president in 1993-94. She \nappointed a special committee to consider the firearms resolutions, \nsaying that she wanted to ensure compliance with the Supreme Court \ndecision, Keller v. State Bar, that forbids a state bar from using \nmandatory lawyers' dues to support political or ideological causes.\n  The Board of Governors, under Margaret Morrow's leadership, rejected \nthe resolutions passed by the delegates and passed explicitly neutral \nlanguage instead. Let me repeat this very important point. As President \nof the State Bar Board of Governors, Margaret Morrow led the Board in \ndeciding to reject resolutions on gun laws passed by the California Bar \nConference of Delegates and instead adopted a neutral resolution, which \nsuggested that the State Bar sponsor ``neutral forums on violence and \nits impact on the administration of justice.'' Therefore, she did the \nexact opposite of what her critics accuse her of. She followed the law \nas articulated by the United States Supreme Court, precisely what she \nwill do if she is confirmed as a district judge.\n  I yield the remaining 5 minutes to the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Chairman Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as we close this debate, I would like to \ntake just a moment to reiterate my support for Margaret Morrow. As my \nfriend from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, has conceded, Ms. Morrow \ncertainly enjoys the professional qualifications to serve as a United \nStates district court judge.\n  Unfortunately, those who have chosen to vote against Ms. Morrow have \nfailed to identify a single instance in the nominee's legal practice in \nwhich she has engaged in what can be considered as activism. The best \nthe opponents to Ms. Morrow can do is take quotes from several of her \nspeeches and read into that an activist intent. I do not believe, \nhowever, that when closely analyzed, those claims stand up. Regarding \nthe two brief statements being used to question Ms. Morrow's propensity \nto engage in judicial activism, when balanced against the 20-plus-year \ndistinguished and dedicated career, the statements are simply \ninsufficient to determine that Ms. Morrow would be a judicial activist.\n  The first statement attributed to Ms. Morrow that the ``law is on the \ncutting edge of social thought,'' when placed within its proper context \nand read along with the entire speech is not troubling to me. I note \nthat the opposition did not discuss the text of that speech or the \ntheme of the speech, because the speech itself is not controversial in \nany manner. In fact, the theme of the speech advocates change in the \nlegal profession itself. The speech does not advocate judicial \nactivism. This is why no one has mentioned any other sentence or phrase \nfrom the speech. It simply does not advocate activism.\n  The second statement attributed to Ms. Morrow, that the law and legal \ninstitutions are engines of change, was taken from a quote by Mr. \nJustice Brennan. Whether you agree with Mr. Justice Brennan or not, he \nwas one of the most substantial Justices in history. And she was \nquoting him. Again, the opposition has not mentioned the theme of the \nspeech from which this quote was taken. The speech also advocated \nchange in the legal profession, not activism in the courts.\n  I personally believe that the profession could stand some changes in \ncertain areas. It is not fair to this nominee or any other that her \nentire career\n\n[[Page S660]]\n\nand judicial philosophy be judged on the basis of a few statements, \narguably very ambiguous statements. I cannot ignore the overall theme \nof the speeches from which these statements were taken. The speeches in \nno way advocated activism. They only advocated change in the legal \nprofession.\n  Ms. Morrow's legal career speaks for itself. She will be an asset to \nthe Federal bench, in my opinion. Thus, when Ms. Morrow's statements \nare read in context, they do not paint a picture of a potential \nactivist. Moreover, when asked by the members of the committee to \nexplain her judicial philosophy and her approach to judging, she gave \nan answer with which any strict constructionist would agree. And when \nasked to explain whether her speeches were intended to suggest that \njudges should be litigating from the bench, she adamantly denied such a \nclaim.\n  Given her plausible explanation of these statements criticized by my \ngood friends from the Judiciary Committee and her sworn testimony that \nshe would uphold the Constitution and abide by the rule of law, I have \nto give her the benefit of the doubt and will vote to confirm her. I \nthink and I hope my colleagues will do the same.\n  Ordinarily, I believe that a nominee's testimony should be credited \nunless there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Here, those who \noppose this nominee lack such evidence. What they are left with are \nsnippets from some of her speeches, speeches that we are trying to \ndivine the intent of, while lacking the evidence to think otherwise.\n  I will credit the testimony of the nominee and her stated commitment \nto the rule of law. I sincerely hope that she will not disappoint me, \nand I believe that she is a person of integrity and one who will judge, \nas she has promised, in accordance with the highest standards of the \njudgeship profession and with the highest standards of the Constitution \nand the rule of law.\n  On this basis, I support the nominee. I believe we all should support \nthis nominee. She has had a thorough hearing and we have had many, many \ndiscussions of this. But I just don't think we should take things out \nof context and stop a nominee on that basis.\n  With that, I hope our colleagues will support the nominee.

Madam President, I rise today to recognize an important day \nin the history of this nation--a day that may intrigue some of you who \nare not familiar with Southern history. Tomorrow is the 299th \nanniversary of the landing of D'Iberville on the shores of present-day \nMississippi, and the beginning of the French colonization of the \nAmerican South.\n  Madam President, my colleagues are familiar with the English landings \nin Jamestown and Plymouth, Maryland and Pennsylvania. Some may recall \nthe Spanish settlements up the eastern seaboard or the missions in the \nfar West. But I suspect few of you know of the French colonization of \nthe deep South and the frontier of the future United States, and the \ndeeds of men like Pierre Lemoyne Sieur D'Iberville, the French military \nofficer who began that colonization.\n  However, down home, all along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, we know and \nwe remember. We remember how D'Iberville's band of French soldiers, \nhunters, farmers and adventurers began the exploration and occupation \nof the lower Mississippi valley. We remember that this landing \neventually gave birth to towns as far-flung as Biloxi, Natchez, Mobile, \nNew Orleans, Baton Rouge, Memphis, St. Joseph, Detroit, and Galveston.\n  My native Mississippi Gulf Coast is a place of year-round beauty, \nromance, and charm. It is easy to understand why the French chose to \nfound their first colony there.\n  We are throwing a party today, in Biloxi, Mississippi, where \nD'Iberville landed, 299 years ago tomorrow, and in Ocean Springs, where \nhe built Fort Maurepas. As I am sure you have heard, we know how to \nthrow a party. But next year, on this very day, will be the 300th \nanniversary of D'Iberville's landing. And I especially want to invite \nevery one of my colleagues and you, Madam President, to attend that \ncelebration.\n  All along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, from my native Pascagoula west \nto Pass Christian and Bay St. Louis, hundreds of volunteers are already \nplanning and preparing a vast array of festivals, parties, national \nsporting events, educational activities, and cultural exchanges with \nFrench cities, working to make our 1699 Tricentennial a truly wonderful \ncelebration.\n  In conjunction with next year's festivities will be the Mardi Gras \nCelebration in all the coast towns, from Texas to Florida. I believe \nall of my colleagues are familiar with Mardi Gras.\n  But the Tricentennial celebrations are more than just festivities. \nThey are celebrations of how really diverse we are in the deep South, \nhow wonderfully varied and multi-cultural our Southern heritage, our \nAmerican heritage really is, and how much we've accomplished over the \npast 300 years!\n  Come to the Gulf Coast next year with us, and help us celebrate that \ndiverse culture, and our hard-won economic prosperity. You might be \nsurprised. You'll find that whether we are of French, Scottish, Irish, \nSpanish, Yugoslavian, Vietnamese, English, African-American or Native \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S661]]\n\nancestry, or a little of everything, we are all fair, honest, \nhardworking, and friendly to a fault. And we can all cook!! And we all \ntalk with this accent!!\n  So come down and join us, if not this year, certainly for the big \nTricentennial celebration. A lot of faces and names will be familiar to \nyou: Brett Favre, the great NFL quarterback, astronauts Fred Haise of \nApollo XIII and Stuart Roosa, and the works of great American painter \nWalter Anderson and potter George E. Ohr. And the places to see!--the \nbeautiful home of Jefferson Davis, the beaches, the southern way of \nlife, the unique nightlife, the Mardi Gras, the 1699 celebrations and \nre-enactments.\n  Madam President, I invite all my colleagues to come down to the Gulf \nCoast next year and join us in the wonderful celebration of our \nTricentennial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S660-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Madam President, I would like to take a moment to \ncommend my colleagues for voting ``no'' this morning on the effort to \nshut down debate and take up S. 1601, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act \nof 1998 without hearings or the benefit of a comprehensive Committee \nreview of the bill.\n  At the outset, I want to make it clear that I stand with the vast \nmajority of Americans who oppose efforts to clone human beings. S. \n1601, however, does much more than that. The bill includes a permanent \nban on the act of human somatic cell nuclear transfer, which means \ntaking the nucleus--which contains DNA--from a mature cell and putting \nit into an egg cell from which the original nucleus has been removed. \nAlthough the bill defines the product of such a transfer as an embryo, \nit is not actually a fertilized egg, as that term is commonly \nunderstood. It is an unfertilized egg cell that contains DNA from \nanother source. It is true that if this cell were implanted in a \nwoman's womb, it could very well develop into a baby. However, the cell \nmay also be grown in a laboratory to become skin, nerve, or muscle \ntissue.\n  Because of its ban on human somatic cell transfer, there is a strong \nlikelihood that S. 1601 would extinguish biomedical research in several \nvital areas. Scientists are examining approaches to treating disease \nthat won't depend on drugs, but on stem cells that can differentiate \ninto brain, skin, blood, or heart cells. S. 1601 would put an end to \nsuch research whenever somatic cell nuclear transfer is involved. Thus, \nit would outlaw efforts to create cardiac muscle cells to treat heart \nattack victims and degenerative heart disease; skin cells to treat burn \nvictims; spinal cord neuron cells for the treatment of spinal cord \ntrauma and paralysis; neural cells to treat those suffering from \nParkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Lou Gehrig's disease; \nblood cells to treat cancer anemia and immunodeficiencies; cells for \nuse in genetic therapy to treat 5,000 genetic diseases, including \ncystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs, schizophrenia, and depression; liver cells \nfor the treatment of such diseases as hepatitis and cirrhosis; and \nmyriad other cells for use in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention \nof a multitude of serious and life-threatening medical conditions.\n  Consider the effect that S. 1601 would have on research related to \nthe treatment of diabetes. A diabetes patient has a shortage of \ninsulin-producing cells in her pancreas. Somatic cell nuclear transfer \ntechnology may allow for the transplantation of a large number of \ninsulin-producing cells into the diabetic patient that would be \ngenetically identical to her. As a result, rejection would not be an \nissue and the patient would be cured. S. 1601 would stifle research \ninto this promising approach to the treatment of diabetes.\n  Moreover, S. 1601 would prevent doctors from utilizing certain \ntreatments that already exist, such as an effective therapy for \nmitochondrial disease, which causes infertility in women.\n  In sum, too much is at stake to allow legitimate concerns over human \ncloning to quash the beneficial research and existing treatments \nassociated with somatic cell nuclear transfer. Over 120 medical \nresearch, industry, and patient advocacy organizations have expressed \nthe view that S. 1601 would do just that. That is why I am co-sponsor \nof Senator Feinstein and Senator Kennedy's substitute bill, S. 1602. \nThis legislation, drafted with the assistance of the National Bioethics \nAdvisory Commission (NBAC), the National Institutes of Health, the \nAmerican Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Biotech Industry \nAssociation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Food \nand Drug Administration, imposes a 10-year ban on the implantation of \nthe product of somatic cell nuclear transfer into a women's uterus. \nWhile it bans the cloning of human beings for 10 years, the bill does \nnot prohibit the cloning of molecules, DNA, cells, tissues, or non-\nhuman animals. It therefore does not restrict important biomedical and \nagricultural research that will improve the quality of life for \nmillions of Americans and save the lives of many more.\n  S. 1602 requires that in four-and-a-half years the NBAC prepare and \nsubmit a report on the state of the science of cloning; the ethical and \nsocial issues related to the potential use of this technology in human \nbeings; and the wisdom of extending the prohibition. The bill also \nrequires the President to seek cooperation with other countries to \nestablish international restrictions similar to those it enumerates.\n  Madam President, S. 1601 was brought directly to the floor two days \nafter it was introduced without a day of committee hearings or a \nmarkup. The Senate did the right thing today when it decided that such \na far-reaching bill with so many implications for the future direction \nof scientific inquiry must be carefully considered in committee. I am \nconfident that we will ultimately agree upon a bipartisan approach to \ndealing with the issues raised by cloning technology, one that ensures \nthat life-saving medical research will not be threatened. Through its \naction today, the Senate has sent the message that it intends to give \nthis complex matter the thoughtful and deliberative consideration it \ndeserves.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ninjunction of secrecy be removed from the following treaty transmitted \nto the Senate on February 11, 1998, by the President of the United \nStates:\n  Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on accession of \nPoland, Hungary, and Czech Republic (Treaty Document No. 105-36.)\n  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on \nthe accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. These \nProtocols were opened for signature at Brussels on December 16, 1997, \nand signed on behalf of the United States of America and the other \nparties to the North Atlantic Treaty. I request the advice and consent \nof the Senate to the ratification of these documents, and transmit for \nthe Senate's information the report made to me by the Secretary of \nState regarding this matter.\n  The accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will improve the ability of the \nUnited States to protect and advance our interests in the transatlantic \narea. The end of the Cold War changed the nature of the threats to this \nregion, but not the fact that Europe's peace, stability, and well-being \nare vital to our own national security. The addition of these well-\nqualified democracies, which have demonstrated their commitment to the \nvalues of freedom and the security of the broader region, will help \ndeter potential threats to Europe, deepen the continent's stability, \nbolster its democratic advances, erase its artificial division, and \nstrengthen an Alliance that has proved its effectiveness during and \nsince the Cold War.\n  NATO is not the only instrument in our efforts to help build a new \nand undivided Europe, but it is our most important contributor to peace \nand security for the region. NATO's steadfastness during the long years \nof the Cold War, its performance in the mission it has led in Bosnia, \nthe strong interest of a dozen new European democracies in becoming \nmembers, and the success of the Alliance's Partnership for Peace \nprogram all underscore the continuing vitality of the Alliance and the \nTreaty that brought it into existence.\n  NATO's mission in Bosnia is of particular importance. No other \nmultinational institution possessed the military capabilities and \npolitical cohesiveness necessary to bring an end to the fighting in the \nformer Yugoslavia--Europe's worst conflict since World War II--and to \ngive the people of that region a chance to build a lasting peace. Our \nwork in Bosnia is not yet complete, but we should be thankful that NATO \nexisted to unite Allies and partners in this determined common effort. \nSimilarly, we should welcome steps such as the Alliance's enlargement \nthat can strengthen its ability to meet future challenges, beginning \nwith NATO's core mission of collective defense and other missions that \nwe and our Allies may choose to pursue.\n  The three states that NATO now proposes to add as full members will \nmake the Alliance stronger while helping to enlarge Europe's zone of \ndemocratic stability. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have been \nleaders in Central Europe's dramatic transformation over the past \ndecade and already are a part of NATO's community of values. They each \nplayed pivotal roles in the overthrow of communist rule and repression, \nand they each proved equal to the challenge of comprehensive democratic \nand market reform. Together, they have helped to make Central Europe \nthe continent's most robust zone of economic growth.\n  All three of these states will be security producers for the Alliance \nand not merely security consumers. They have demonstrated this through \nthe accords they have reached with neighboring states, the \ncontributions they have made to the mission in Bosnia, the forces they \nplan to commit to the Alliance, and the military modernization programs \nthey have already begun and pledge to continue in the years to come at \ntheir own expense. These three states will strengthen NATO through the \naddition of military resources, strategic depth, and the prospect of \ngreater stability in Europe's central region. American troops have \nworked alongside soldiers from each of these nations in earlier times, \nin the case of the Poles, dating back to our own Revolutionary War. \nOur cooperation with the Poles, Hungarians, and Czechs has contributed \nto our security in the past, and our Alliance with them will contribute \nto our security in the years to come.\n\n  The purpose of NATO's enlargement extends beyond the security of \nthese three states, however, and entails a process encompassing more \nthan their admission to the Alliance. Accordingly, these first new \nmembers should not and will not be the last. No qualified European \ndemocracy is ruled out as a future member. The Alliance has agreed to \nreview the process of enlargement at its 1999 summit in Washington. As \nwe prepare for that summit, I look forward to discussing this matter \nwith my fellow NATO leaders. The process of enlargement, combined with \nthe Partnership for Peace program, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership \nCouncil, the NATO-Russia Founding Act, and NATO's new charter with \nUkraine, signify NATO's commitment to avoid any new division of Europe, \nand to contribute to its progressive integration.\n  A democratic Russia is and should be a part of that new Europe. With \nbipartisan congressional support, my Administration and my \npredecessor's have worked with our Allies to support political and \neconomic reform in Russia and the other newly independent states and to \nincrease the bonds between them and the rest of Europe. NATO's \nenlargement and other adaptations are consistent, not at odds, with \nthat policy. NATO has repeatedly demonstrated that it does not threaten \nRussia and that it seeks closer and more cooperative relations. We and \nour Allies welcomed the participation of Russian forces in the mission \nin Bosnia.\n  NATO most clearly signaled its interest in a constructive \nrelationship through the signing in May 1997 of the NATO-Russia \nFounding Act. That Act, and the Permanent Joint Council it created, \nhelp to ensure that if Russia seeks to build a positive and peaceful \nfuture within Europe, NATO will be a full partner in that enterprise. I \nunderstand it will require time for the Russian people to gain a new \nunderstanding of NATO. The Russian people, in turn, must understand \nthat an open door policy with regard to the addition of new members is \nan element of a new NATO. In this way, we will build a new and more \nstable Europe of which Russia is an integral part.\n  I therefore propose the ratification of these Protocols with every \nexpectation that we can continue to pursue productive cooperation with \nthe Russian Federation. I am encouraged that President Yeltsin has \npledged his government's commitment to additional progress on nuclear \nand conventional arms control measures. At our summit in Helsinki, for \nexample, we agreed that once START II has entered into force we will \nbegin negotiations on a START III accord that can achieve even deeper \ncuts in our strategic arsenals. Similarly, Russia's ratification of the \nChemical Weapons Convention last year demonstrated that cooperation on \na range of security matters will continue.\n  The Protocols of accession that I transmit to you constitute a \ndecision of great consequence, and they involve solemn security \ncommitments. The addition of new states also will entail financial \ncosts. While those costs will be manageable and broadly shared with\n\n[[Page S663]]\n\nour current and new Allies, they nonetheless represent a sacrifice by \nthe American people.\n  Successful ratification of these Protocols demands not only the \nSenate's advice and consent required by our Constitution, but also the \nbroader, bipartisan support of the American people and their \nrepresentatives. For that reason, it is encouraging that congressional \nleaders in both parties and both chambers have long advocated NATO's \nenlargement. I have endeavored to make the Congress an active partner \nin this process. I was pleased that a bipartisan group of Senators and \nRepresentatives accompanied the U.S. delegation at the NATO summit in \nMadrid last July. Officials at all levels of my Administration have \nconsulted closely with the relevant committees and with the bipartisan \nSenate NATO Observer Group. It is my hope that this pattern of \nconsultation and cooperation will ensure that NATO and our broader \nEuropean policies continue to have the sustained bipartisan support \nthat was so instrumental to their success throughout the decades of the \nCold War.\n\n  The American people today are the direct beneficiaries of the \nextraordinary sacrifices made by our fellow citizens in the many \ntheaters of that ``long twilight struggle,'' and in the two world wars \nthat preceded it. Those efforts aimed in large part to create across \nthe breadth of Europe a lasting, democratic peace. The enlargement of \nNATO represents an indispensable part of today's program to finish \nbuilding such a peace, and therefore to repay a portion of the debt we \nowe to those who went before us in the quest for freedom and security.\n  The rise of new challenges in other regions does not in any way \ndiminish the necessity of consolidating the increased level of security \nthat Europe has attained at such high cost. To the contrary, our policy \nin Europe, including the Protocols I transmit herewith, can help \npreserve today's more favorable security environment in the \ntransatlantic area, thus making it possible to focus attention and \nresources elsewhere while providing us with additional Allies and \npartners to help share our security burdens.\n  The century we are now completing has been the bloodiest in all of \nhuman history. Its lessons should be clear to us: the wisdom of \ndeterrence, the value of strong Alliances, the potential for overcoming \npast divisions, and the imperative of American engagement in Europe. \nThe NATO Alliance is one of the most important embodiments of these \ntruths, and it is in the interest of the United States to strengthen \nthis proven institution and adapt it to a new era. The addition to this \nAlliance of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic is an essential \npart of that program. It will help build a Europe that can be \nintegrated, democratic, free, and at peace for the first time in its \nhistory.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Alaska; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 14\n\n       Whereas the United Nations has designated 67 sites in the \n     United States as ``World Heritage Sites'' or ``Biosphere \n     Reserves,'' which altogether are about equal in size to the \n     State of Colorado, the eighth largest state; and\n       Whereas art. IV, sec. 3, United States Constitution, \n     provides that the United States Congress shall make all \n     needed regulations governing lands belonging to the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas many of the United Nations' designations include \n     private property inholdings and contemplate ``buffer zones'' \n     of adjacent land; and\n       Whereas some international land designations such as those \n     under the United States Biosphere Reserve Program and the Man \n     and Biosphere Program of the United Nations Scientific, \n     Educational, and Culture Organization operate under \n     independent national committees such as the United States \n     National Man and Biosphere Committee that have no legislative \n     directives or authorization from the Congress; and\n       Whereas these international designations as presently \n     handled are an open invitation to the international community \n     to interfere in domestic economies and land use decisions; \n     and\n       Whereas local citizens and public officials concerned about \n     job creation and resource based economies usually have no say \n     in the designation of land near their homes for inclusion in \n     an international land use program; and\n       Whereas former Assistant Secretary of the Interior George \n     T. Frampton, Jr., and the President used the fact that \n     Yellowstone National Park had been designated as a ``World \n     Heritage Site'' as justification for intervening in the \n     environmental impact statement process and blocking possible \n     development of an underground mine on private land in Montana \n     outside of the park; and\n       Whereas a recent designation of a portion of Kamchatka as a \n     ``World Heritage Site'' was followed immediately by efforts \n     from environmental groups to block investment insurance for \n     development projects on Kamchatka that are supported by the \n     local communities; and\n       Whereas environmental groups and the National Park Service \n     have been working to establish an International Park, a World \n     Heritage Site, and a Marine Biosphere Reserve covering parts \n     of western Alaska, eastern Russia, and the Bering Sea; and\n       Whereas, as occurred in Montana, such designations could be \n     used to block development projects on state and private land \n     in western Alaska; and\n       Whereas foreign companies and countries could use such \n     international designations in western Alaska to block \n     economic development that they perceive as competition; and\n       Whereas animal rights activists could use such \n     international designations to generate pressure to harass or \n     block harvesting of marine mammals by Alaska Natives; and\n       Whereas such international designations could be used to \n     harass or block any commercial activity, including pipelines, \n     railroads, and power transmission lines; and\n       Whereas the President and the executive branch of the \n     United States have, by Executive Order and other agreements, \n     implemented these designations without approval by the \n     Congress; and\n       Whereas actions by the President in applying international \n     agreements to lands owned by the United States may circumvent \n     the Congress; and\n       Whereas Congressman Don Young introduced House Resolution \n     No. 901 in the 105th Congress entitled the ``American Lands \n     Sovereignty Protection Act of 1997'' that required the \n     explicit approval of the Congress prior to restricting any \n     use of United States land under international agreements;\n       Be it resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature supports \n     the ``American Lands Sovereignty Protection Act'' that \n     reaffirms the constitutional authority of the Congress as the \n     elected representatives of the people over the federally \n     owned land of the United States.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Ted Stevens and the Honorable Frank Murkowski, U.S. Senators, \n     and the Honorable Don Young, U.S. Representative, members of \n     the Alaska delegation in Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-338.

\n     and\n       Whereas, In December, 1997, the United States participated \n     in negotiations in Kyoto, Japan, resulting in the agreement \n     known as the Kyoto Protocol, which calls for the United \n     States to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 7 percent \n     from 1990 levels during the period A.D. 2008 to 2012, with \n     potentially larger reductions thereafter; and\n       Whereas, The United States delegation signed the Protocol \n     on December 10, 1997; and\n       Whereas, The Kyoto Protocol calls for reductions by other \n     industrial nations from 1990 levels by 6 to 8 percent during \n     the same period; and\n       Whereas, Developing nations are exempted from greenhouse \n     gas emission limitation requirements of the Framework \n     Convention and refused to accept any new commitments for such \n     limitations during the negotiations of the Kyoto Protocol; \n     and\n\n[[Page S664]]\n\n       Whereas, The United States relies on carbon-based fossil \n     fuels for more than 90 percent of its total energy supply; \n     and\n       Whereas, The requirements of the Protocol would bind the \n     United States to more than a 35 percent reduction in carbon \n     dioxide emissions between 2008 and 2012; and\n       Whereas, Research has not reached convincing proof that \n     fossil fuel related emissions is in fact creating global \n     climate changes; and\n       Whereas, Economic impact studies by the United States \n     government estimate that the requirements of the treaty could \n     result in the loss of 900,000 jobs, increased energy prices, \n     losses of output in energy intensive industries such as \n     aluminum, steel, rubber, chemical and utility production and \n     especially the coal industry; and\n       Whereas, The State of West Virginia, being dependent upon \n     these industries and especially upon the coal industry, would \n     experience these effects severely, including the possible \n     loss of thousands of jobs; and\n       Whereas, The President of the United States pledged on \n     October 22, 1997, that the United States will not assume \n     binding obligations unless key developing nations \n     meaningfully participate in this effort; and\n       Whereas, The failure of key developing nations to \n     participate will create unfair competitive imbalances between \n     the United States and these developing nations, potentially \n     leading to the transfer of jobs vital to the West Virginia \n     economy to developing nations; and\n       Whereas, On July 25, 1997, the United States Senate adopted \n     Senate Resolution No. 98, expressing the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States should not be a signatory to any \n     protocol or to any other agreement which would require the \n     advice and consent of the Senate to ratify, and which would \n     mandate new commitments to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions \n     unless the protocol or agreement mandates commitments and \n     compliance by developing nations; therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of West Virginia, That the \n     President of the United States is requested not to sign the \n     Kyoto Protocol so long as the possibility of all above \n     mentioned negative effects upon the American economy exists; \n     and, be it\n       Further Resolved, That, in the event that the President \n     signs the Kyoto Protocol, the Senate of the United States is \n     requested to refuse ratification of the Protocol so long as \n     the possibility of said effects exits; and, be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     shall, immediately upon its adoption, transmit duly \n     authenticated copies of this resolution to the President of \n     the United States, to the President Pro Tempore and the \n     Secretary of the United States Senate, and to the United \n     States Senators representing West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S663-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REPORTS OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following report of committee was submitted:\n\n       By Mr. MURKOWSKI, from the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources:\n       Special Report entitled ``History, Jurisdiction, and a \n     Summary of Activities of the committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources During the 104th Congress'' (Rept.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce nine bills to \nsuspend temporarily the imposition of duties on the importation of \ncertain products.\n  I am pleased to introduce six bills to suspend temporarily the \nimposition of duties on imports of certain chemicals used in the \nproduction of pesticides. These chemicals are deltamethrin, diclofop-\nmethyl, piperonyl butoxide, resmethrin, thidiazuron and tralomethrin. \nBy temporarily suspending the imposition of duties, these bills would \nhelp AgrEvo USA, a company located in Wilmington, Delaware, lower its \ncost of production and improve its competitiveness.\n  I am also pleased to introduce three bills to suspend temporarily the \nimposition of duties on imports of Pigment Yellow 109, Yellow 110 and \nPigment Red 177. These high quality coloring materials are imported for \nsale in the United States by Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation \n(Pigments Division), a company located in Newport, Delaware. By \ntemporarily suspending the imposition of duties, these bills will \nreduce significantly the cost of coloring materials that are used in a \nwide variety of finished products, including automotive parts, vinyl \nflooring, carpet fibers and plastic utensils.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1622\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the General Education Provisions Act to \nallow parents access to certain information; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n                the parental freedom of information act\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, imagine, if you will, that your \ndaughter is given an assignment by her teacher which requires her to \nkeep a journal, not just a journal of her own intimate and very private \nthoughts, but of answers to questions that have been posed to her by \nher teacher. Should you as a parent have a right to know what questions \nthe teacher has posed, what questions the teacher has asked?\n  Now imagine that a research team from a local university is given \npermission by your child's school to perform psychological exams on \nyour son or daughter. Should you as a parent in that situation have a \nright to approve of this exam before it takes place? Should you as a \nparent at least be informed about the impending exams?\n  Finally, Mr. President, imagine that your son is required to take a \nclass in ``decisionmaking'' which you are concerned may include \ndiscussion of issues that might violate or be contrary to the teachings \nyou have espoused and inculcated in your children in the\n\n[[Page S666]]\n\nhome.Should you, in that circumstance, as a parent have a right to \nreview the classroom material prior to enrolling your children in that \nparticular class, in that decisionmaking class?\n  In each of these three examples, the clear and, I think, the obvious \nanswer is yes, parents, as those to whom primary responsibility for the \neducation of their children is entrusted, should be allowed to know \nwhat questions their children are being asked; parents should have the \nright to decide whether or not their children are examined \npsychologically; parents should have the right to review their \nchildren's curriculum.\n  Unfortunately, the above examples are not just random hypotheticals \nthat I dreamed up or that I had my staff dream up. These are real-world \nexamples of how public schools are currently usurping the rights of \nparents to be informed about the education of their children.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Robinson from Sheridan, AR, have yet to learn what \nquestions were posed to their daughter by her teacher in an in-class \njournaling assignment. Parents in Monroeville, PA, have yet to obtain \ntheir children's records maintained as a part of a research project run \nin their children's school by the University of Pittsburgh. Parents in \nCalifornia have been forced to go to court to view the curriculum being \nused in their local school for a class that they fear may delve into \ndeeply personal matters.\n  How can this be the case? How can we have this situation in a country \nfounded on the principles of freedom, in a country that has always \nrespected the parents' ultimate authority in the rearing and education \nof their children? How can parents be denied basic information relating \nto their children's education?\n  The answer may lie in a book recently published by Eric Buehrer \nentitled ``The Public Orphanage.'' In this book, Mr. Buehrer points out \nthat public schools have become ``one-stop social service agencies'' \nattempting to address the needs of children that were traditionally the \nresponsibility of the children's parents.\n  Whether this trend is the errant result of a legitimate attempt to \nfill the void left in children's lives with the breakdown of the \nAmerican family, or whether this trend is part of a more sinister \nphilosophy based on belief that ``Washington or Government knows \nbest,'' it is a trend that is leading to lower educational achievement \nand to less clearly defined standards of right and wrong for our \nNation's children. In short, I think it is a trend that we should not \nallow to continue.\n  The importance of parents in the education of their children was \nclearly emphasized in 1994 by Secretary of Education Richard Riley in \ntestimony before the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. In this \ntestimony, Secretary Riley, I think very powerfully and poignantly, \nemphasized that ``Thirty years of research tells us that the starting \npoint of American education is parental expectations and parental \ninvolvement with their children's education'' and that schools must \n``establish a supportive environment for family involvement.''\n  Despite this important parental role, Secretary Riley pointed out \nthat ``many parents feel that their right to be involved in school \npolicy--to be full participants in the learning process--is being \nignored, frustrated or even denied.'' In short, Secretary Riley noted \nthat many parents simply do not feel ``valued'' by the schools that \neducate their children.\n\n  So today, I am introducing legislation that will value the role of \nparents in educating their children. It will help to establish a \nsupportive environment for families by guaranteeing parents a place at \nthe table in decisions central to the creation and implementation of \neducation policies within their local schools.\n  This legislation builds on the already well-established principles \noutlined in the 1974 Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, which \nensures that parents have access to all records which public schools \nmaintain on their children. The Parental Freedom of Information Act, \nwhich I am introducing today, will strengthen the rights of parents by \nguaranteeing them access to the curriculum being used to teach their \nchildren. Current law, the 1974 law, ensures that parents will have \naccess to the records and files that are maintained on their children. \nBut we need to go a step further. We need to build on that successful \n1974 legislation by ensuring that parents also have the right to access \nthe curriculum being used to teach their children. I think it is a \nreasonable provision which allows parents to review their children's \ntextbooks, audio-visual materials, manuals, journals, films and any \nother supplemental material used to educate their children.\n  On the surface, one would think this legislation shouldn't be \nnecessary. I think most Americans assume that parents already have the \nright to go into the school and ask to see the books, ask to see the \ncurriculum materials, ask to see the supplemental materials, ask \npermission to view a film that might be shown to their children, to \nlook at the journals that are in the library, and to have basic access \nto all of the information and all of the curriculum materials being \nused in the education of their children. But unfortunately, the record \nis now replete with examples of where parents have run into a stone \nwall and have met stiff resistance when they have tried to obtain that \nkind of basic educational information. Information which is so \nessential to the education of their children.\n  So we say on one hand, we want parents to be supportive, we want \nparents to be involved, we want parents to attend PTA, we want them to \nattend parent-teacher conferences, we want them to show by their \nactions that they are actively involved in the education and upbringing \nof their children. We don't want our public schools to be social \norphanages that take care of the children from breakfast until supper.\n  Then, on the other hand, we allow policies to be enacted in local \nschools across this country that resist that very desire by many \nparents, that make it difficult, if not impossible, to access critical \nmaterials being used in the education of their children.\n  The Parental Freedom of Information Act will provide parents access \nto curriculum and to the testing materials administered to their \nchildren, and it will require parental consent prior to any student \nbeing subjected to medical, psychological or psychiatric examinations, \ntesting or treatment at the school.\n  This legislation is very basic and straightforward and, I think, is \njust plain common sense. This legislation will empower parents by \nproviding them access to the information they need to oversee and \ndirect the education of their children and will slow, and hopefully \nreverse, the establishment of schools as public orphanages.\n  I look forward to pursuing this legislation in committee and with my \ncolleagues in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1631\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to suspend through December 31, 1999, the duty on \ncertain textile machinery; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      duty suspension legislation\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this afternoon I am introducing \nlegislation to suspend the duty on the importation of certain textile \nprinting machines that are used by textile manufacturers in the United \nStates.\n  These particular machines are used for the printing of patterns, \ndesigns and motifs on fabrics--an important process in the making of \ntextile goods. However, none of these machines are made in the United \nStates. That means domestic manufacturers must import these machines at \nconsiderable cost, which does not help their ability to compete in what \nis an increasingly challenging market. Yet since there is no domestic \nindustry producing these machines, the duties serve little purpose.\n  The bill I am introducing would lift the duty imposed on these \nmachines. It is my hope that by doing so, we will be helping the \ntextile industry in this country to improve its competitiveness and \nmaintain its workforce, both in Rhode Island and around the nation.\n  By introducing this legislation today, I believe there should be \nample time for review and comment on the bill, and that it can be ready \nfor inclusion when Senate begins work on comprehensive duty

Bond, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Roberts) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Finance:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 74\n\n       Whereas the European Union has banned imports of United \n     States beef treated with hormones since 1989;\n       Whereas 9 out of 10 United States cattle are treated with \n     growth promoting hormones;\n       Whereas growth promoting hormones have been deemed safe by \n     all countries that have reviewed the use of such hormones, \n     including reviews by European Union scientists in 2 separate \n     studies;\n       Whereas since the implementation of the European Union ban, \n     United States cattle producers have lost hundreds of millions \n     of dollars in exports;\n       Whereas the United States beef industry loses approximately \n     $250,000,000 in annual sales due to the ban;\n       Whereas the United States beef industry, the United States \n     Department of Agriculture, and the United States Trade \n     Representative have invested substantial resources to comply \n     with strict dispute settlement procedures of the World Trade \n     Organization;\n       Whereas the Dispute Settlement panel and the Appellate Body \n     of the World Trade Organization have ruled that the European \n     Union's ban of United States beef is not based on sound \n     science or supported by a risk assessment and is therefore in \n     violation of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on the \n     Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures; and\n       Whereas noncompliance by the European Union regarding the \n     ban on United States beef threatens the integrity of both the \n     Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary \n     Measures and the World Trade Organization as a dispute \n     settlement body: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the United States expects the European Union to \n     immediately and completely comply with the World Trade \n     Organization's ruling and grant United States beef producers \n     access to the European market; and\n       (2) the United States Trade Representative should take \n     immediate action to open European markets to United States \n     beef producers in the event the European Union fails to \n     comply with the World Trade Organization's ruling.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a concurrent \nresolution to open the European market to U.S. beef exports. Last \nmonth, the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization affirmed the \nearlier findings of the WTO that Europe's ban on U.S. beef violates \ncommitments made under the Uruguay Round Agreement. The decision should \nclear the way for U.S. beef producers to sell their product to Europe.\n  This concurrent resolution requests the European Union to open its \nmarket immediately, in light of the WTO's decision, and directs the \nU.S. Trade Representative to take action if the EU fails to do so.\n  This dispute goes back to 1989 when the EU banned all imports of meat \nfrom animals treated with growth hormones. About 90% of U.S. cattle is \ntreated with hormones. They have been found to be safe by every country \nthat has studied them. In fact, twice the EU commissioned its own \nscientists to study the hormones and found them to be safe.\n  Mr. President, to put these growth hormones in perspective: A person \nwould have to eat 169 pounds of beef from an animal treated with a \ngrowth hormone in order to consume the equal amount of that hormone \npresent in one, single egg. They are completely safe for human \nconsumption.\n  Yet, nine years ago, the EU decided to ban this meat from coming into \nits market. At that time, there was little we could do to counter the \nban. We negotiated with the EU and even imposed sanctions, but nothing \nhas worked.\n  Then came the Uruguay Round Agreement. For the first time, members of \nthe GATT agreed to eliminate trade barriers not founded on a sound, \nscientific basis. In other words, trade decisions would be made on \nsound science, not political science. Clearly, the beef ban was not \nbased on sound science.\n  In 1996, the U.S. requested a WTO panel  to  determine  whether  the  \nEU had breached the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement of the Uruguay \nRound. In August of last year, the panel found in favor of the U.S. \nposition and the decision was affirmed in January. So the WTO has \ndecided that the European's ban on U.S. beef violates the S/PS \nAgreement and must be removed immediately.\n  Mr. President, you would think that would be the final word on this \nissue. But the trade press is reporting that the Europeans are looking \nfor ways around the decision. They want to study the issue a little \nlonger. Even though the ban has already been in place for nine years.\n  It seems to me that they have had enough time. Our farmers have \nsuffered the effects of this ban for too long. When the ban was put in \nplace in 1989, we were sending $100 million of beef annually to Europe. \nIf the ban was lifted, it is estimated that beef exports would total \nabout $250 million per year. American beef producers literally have \nlost hundreds of millions of dollars due to this unjustified ban.\n  This concurrent resolution says to the Europeans, open your markets. \nYou would had your day in court, now it is time to abide by the judge's \ndecision.\n  If the WTO is to have long-standing legitimacy as an objective \narbiter of international trade disputes, its decisions must be \nrespected and complied with. We expect the Europeans to respect this \ndecision, just as the United States has complied with the decision in \nthe Kodak-Fuji case that went against us. We do not have to like the \ndecision. But we have to respect the dispute resolution process.\n  The concurrent resolution also states if the Europeans do not \nimmediately comply with the decision and open its markets, the U.S. \nTrade Representative should take action. I leave it up to the able USTR \nto decide what action is appropriate. But we cannot stand by and allow \nthis decision to be ignored.\n  Mr. President, enough is enough. The private sector and several \ngovernment agencies have spent significant time and money attempting to \nresolve this dispute. And they have been proven to be correct. The \nEuropean beef ban is simply a trade barrier, disguised as a health \nconcern. No scientific evidence exists to justify it. And the WTO has \nsaid so. Now is the time for the EU to end the ban and allow American \nfarmers and ranchers a fair chance to compete in the European market.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S669-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S669-S670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 75--HONORING THE SESQUICENTENNIAL OF \n                          WISCONSIN STATEHOOD\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Kohl) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. \nHiram Bingham IV, a Connecticut native, who risked his life and \nsacrificed his career to rescue thousands of Jews from the Nazis while \nserving as a U.S. diplomat in Vichy France. Mr. Bingham performed these \nservices despite the opposition of his superiors in France and in \nWashington, displaying a courage of conviction which demands both our \nrecognition and greatest respect.\n  Hiram Bingham IV died in 1987 and it was only last year that his son, \nWilliam S. Bingham, discovered the records which brought his father's \nexploits to light. Survivors whom Hiram Bingham helped rescue have now \npetitioned Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust Memorial, that he be honored \nas a ``righteous gentile'' for having put his life and career on the \nline to save Jewish refugees.\n\n[[Page S671]]\n\n  Hiram Bingham IV never sought glory for himself but as a man who put \nservice to others before all other considerations he has earned our \nappreciation as a true American hero. In doing so he has extended the \nremarkable public service and honorable reputation of the Bingham \nfamily, one of Connecticut's great families.\n  Mr. President, I ask that an article by William Bingham in the New \nLondon Day be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New London Day, Oct. 5, 1997]\n\n A Man From Salem Emerges as a Hero of the Holocaust: Hiram Bingham IV\n\n                        (By William S. Bingham)\n\n       When we lose a loved one, we struggle desperately to \n     recollect bits and pieces of a life lived and finished. We \n     hang tightly onto the slightest memories that have meaning \n     for us. Gradually, the memories fade and the vividness of \n     those who were once alive grows dim. But parchment and \n     celluloid, letters and photographs allow us to recapture our \n     loved ones' lives. These images and words left behind in \n     journals, books and correspondence allow us to revisit the \n     life and times of our loved ones and the history they \n     embrace.\n       Such was the journey I started when I began investigating \n     my father's secret history as a covert operative in a mission \n     to rescue Jews, artists and other political figures from the \n     Nazis during World War II.\n       I cannot say I know everything about my father. Most of him \n     is still a mystery to me. But almost 10 years after the death \n     of my father, Hiram Bingham IV, I discovered a cache of \n     diaries and documents tightly bound in manila folders by hay \n     bale rope and masking tape, buried deep in the dust and \n     cobwebs of an ancient linen closet tucked by colonial design \n     into the wall behind the fireplace in my family's 230-year-\n     old pre-Revolutionary homestead in Salem. In these bound \n     folders and files marked simply ``H.B.--Personal Notes--\n     Marseilles--1940,'' which had lain untouched for more than a \n     half-century, I discovered chilling evidence of my father's \n     secret role in thwarting the spread of Nazism and in rescuing \n     thousands of Jews from the Nazis.\n       After my father died in 1987, I discovered he was a silent \n     hero of the Holocaust. As with almost all intelligence \n     operatives, he maintained secrecy about most of his actions \n     from everyone except those who had a need to know up to the \n     time of his death. He kept his silence because he himself \n     became a victim of pro-Nazi elements and Nazi sympathizers in \n     the U.S. government and, in his role as a rescuer, he took \n     actions which were condemned by his superiors and contravened \n     U.S. laws and policy. My father's story contained in these \n     hidden papers sheds a small ray of light on one of the \n     darkest periods in human history.\n       Among his papers were secret memos, photographs and reports \n     on the concentration camps, maps and notes on escape routes \n     and meetings of the anti-Nazi conspirators. There were \n     reports on Nazi propaganda, hidden Nazi gold and war \n     criminals and the ``Fifth Column'' (Nazi civilian \n     infiltrators worldwide). There were accounts and descriptions \n     of Nazi agents and suspected agents within and without the \n     U.S. consulate in Marseilles and embassies in Europe and \n     Latin America and their methodology for world conquest. There \n     were letters from Marc Chagall and Thomas Mann, which the top \n     opponents of Adolf Hitler had written to my father pertaining \n     to the rescues, the rescue operations and my father's \n     participation. There were copies of passport photos and \n     ``official'' documents and papers used by the escapees to \n     gain freedom from the concentration camps and to escape the \n     Holocaust.\n       As a vice consul in the U.S. Consulate in Marseilles, \n     France, when the Nazis invaded and took Paris in the summer \n     of 1940, my dad became a government expert on Nazis and \n     Fascists, and a key agent in the secret rescue operation of \n     thousands of Jewish and other political refugees from war-\n     torn Europe. The whole rescue operation, encouraged and \n     supported by Eleanor Roosevelt, was kept in large part secret \n     even from his State Department superiors, because many of \n     them at first supported Hitler. Some in the U.S. government \n     believed Hitler would win the war and felt that the U.S. \n     should maintain favorable political, social and economic \n     relations with the Nazis.\n       In the face of strident and vocal opposition from his own \n     bosses in France and Washington, my father helped establish a \n     clandestine operation of international operatives smuggling \n     Hitler's ``most wanted'' enemies--predominantly Jewish \n     intellectuals, political activists and artists who opposed \n     Nazism--through an underground railroad system across Europe \n     to gain safe passage through Africa, the Caribbean and Latin \n     America to the United States and other safe harbors. Some of \n     my father's collaborators formed Maquis, guerrilla-resistance \n     cadres, to fight the Nazis in the countryside.\n       But my father's role in the operation had to remain secret \n     from his superiors, his family and all but his closest \n     friends, because he followed a moral imperative to aid Jews \n     and other political refugees in violation of official U.S. \n     policy, regulations and laws. My father's superiors in the \n     State Department and other branches of government who favored \n     accommodation and cooperation with Hitler had forbidden \n     official and unofficial support for the operation.\n       It was only because of Eleanor Roosevelt's quiet support, \n     pressuring Franklin D. Roosevelt to permit the operation, and \n     my father's Washington contacts through his own father \n     (former Connecticut Gov. and U.S. Sen. Hiram Bingham III), \n     that my father himself was not arrested and prosecuted for \n     violating ``official'' U.S. law and policy. But my father \n     suffered retaliatory treatment at the hands of his superiors \n     and feared government prosecution if the extent of his role \n     in the planning and execution of rescue missions was known.\n       Why were the Nazis chasing Chagall? In the pictures and \n     letters it became clear that my father was instrumental in \n     saving Chagall, but why did he need to? Why did the Nazis \n     want to exterminate the surrealist artists like Max Ernst, \n     Marcel Duchamp and Andre Masson, or the surrealist poet Andre \n     Breton, or the novelists?\n       Because surrealism was a threat to Nazism--it was \n     nonconformist and often contained political messages that \n     were the antithesis of Nazism, totalitarianism and \n     nationalism.\n       My father was an artist and philosopher till the end of his \n     life. He would sit on an old beat-up chair by the bathtub, \n     where he would place his large-framed canvases flat on the \n     porcelain rim of the tub and paint his surreal visions while \n     listening to Beethoven and Brahms. He liked the subdued light \n     from the west through a small window there, and he could \n     rotate his paintings to adapt to the swirls of his ``music on \n     canvas,'' as he called it. You could turn the panting upside \n     down or sideways, he told me, any way, and new visions would \n     be revealed.\n       My father had painted portraits of some of the rescued, and \n     he had painted copies of several of Chagall's paintings \n     because he admired Chagall and had become his friend during \n     the crisis. My father's journal entries revealed that Chagall \n     had gracefully admired my father's rather traditional \n     portraits and landscapes during meetings at my father's \n     villa in Marseilles while they were planning his escape, \n     and Chagall told him always to paint large canvases and \n     never conform to what others wanted him to paint.\n       I remembered the tale of Lion Feuchtwanger, who was \n     smuggled out of a concentration camp at Nimes dressed up as \n     woman at the direction of my father and hidden at my father's \n     villa for two months, passed off as his mother-in-law from \n     Waycross, Ga., to fool the neighbors and the Gestapo and \n     spies at the U.S. Consulate. Feuchtwanger, I learned, was \n     Hitler's Public Enemy Number One, because of his historical \n     novel, ``The Oppermans,'' which exposed Hitler and the evils \n     of Nazism in 1933.\n       Hitler stripped Feuchtwanger of his German citizenship, and \n     the Nazis issued a death warrant for him before he fled to \n     France, where the pro-Nazi Vichy government held him until he \n     was rescued. When it was leaked to members of the U.S. \n     Consulate that my father was hiding Feuchtwanger and his wife \n     at my father's villa, my father soon realized that his own \n     life was in danger--so he put a pseudonym ``Lion Wetcheek'' \n     on Feuchtwanger's passport and arranged that the \n     Feuchtwangers be smuggled on a footpath over the Pyrenees \n     Mountains into Spain and on to Lisbon, Portugal, where they \n     caught a steamship to New York City. The code words for them \n     in this operation were ``Harry's friends.''\n       I vaguely remembered the names of Rudolf Breitscheid and \n     Rudolf Hilferding, whom my parents would discuss in hushed \n     and saddened voices. Although their names rang a bell in my \n     recollections from youth, I never knew who they were or what \n     happened to them. The two Rudolfs were Hitler's greatest \n     political enemies in the Reichstag. Old political activists \n     in Germany, they too were stripped of German citizenship by \n     Hitler and fled to France.\n\n\n                            Met in brothels\n\n       Some of the rescue team would meet in Marseilles brothels \n     with their prospective escapees, because it was one of the \n     few places where discretion and hushed conversation in \n     English and other foreign languages could take place without \n     arousing the suspicion of the proprietors. On occasion, some \n     of the women in the team (Americans among them) would entice \n     pro-Nazi guards and policemen in order to distract them, or \n     get them drunk so that rescue operations could proceed with \n     little or no interruption. Other meetings took place in jazz \n     clubs, until the Nazis forbade jazz, or at my father's villa \n     in the evening after his work in the visa section of the \n     consulate was finished for the day.\n       Until I discovered these papers, only a few individuals \n     knew my father's role: those who worked closely with him and \n     a handful of those he helped rescue. Some, like the artists \n     Marc Chagall, Max Ernst and Andre Masson--and writers Victor \n     Serge, Lion Feuchtwanger and Franz Werfel and the family of \n     Thomas Mann--were close to my father during their own \n     escapes. But because my father had to keep his actions secret \n     from his own government superiors and fellow employees, some \n     of whom were supporters of and informants for the Nazis, he \n     could not reveal his role in planning and executing the \n     escapes of the refugees to any but a select few of the \n     escapees who were staunch anti-Nazi activits and conspirators \n     in the underground network.\n       At any moment, Nazi agents posing as refugees or enemies of \n     Hitler and Mussolini might infiltrate and blow the whole \n     operation.\n\n[[Page S672]]\n\n       Indeed, when the true nature of my father's role became \n     more fully known by his superiors in the U.S. State \n     Department, he was removed from his position in the visa \n     section. Given meaningless bureaucratic paperwork, he was \n     passed over time and again for promotions, and he was \n     ultimately dispatched to Buenos Aires, Argentina, with my \n     mother and their five children. Despite the threat from Nazi \n     sympathizers and agents acting with the U.S. State \n     Department, my father continued to investigate and report on \n     the Nazi menace in Latin America and in the U.S. Embassy \n     in Buenos Aires.\n       In an ultimatum to the State Department in 1945, he vowed \n     to resign from the diplomatic corps if there were no efforts \n     to put a stop to the spread of Nazism and fascism in Latin \n     America. For this ultimatum, he was again passed over for \n     promotion and his pleas for investigations of Nazi gold and \n     war criminals being smuggled into Chile and Argentina on \n     German U-boats (submarines) were ignored.\n       He then made good on his vow, resigned from his post, and \n     returned to the family homestead in Salem to farm, paint, \n     pursue various business ventures and study Buddhism and \n     Eastern philosophy, which he embraced as a believer in \n     mystical Christianity.\n       Only now, after 50 years of obscurity, is my father's story \n     coming to light worldwide. After discovering the cache of \n     documents, I began an effort to investigate all of his \n     correspondence and official files, including those in the \n     U.S. archives, which are now declassified, and to find those \n     he rescued who may never have known his role in their \n     escapes.

More than 50 documents and photographs from my \n     father's files were exhibited, along with several of my \n     father's surrealist paintings and landscapes, at the Simon \n     Weisenthal Center--House of Tolerance Museum, in Los Angeles, \n     during July and August this past summer.\n\n\n                          petition seeks medal\n\n       A petition prepared by survivors my father helped rescue \n     asks that Hiram Bingham IV be honored with a medal from the \n     State of Israel and a tree planted in his honor at Yad \n     Vashem, the Holocaust Memorial in Israel.\n       If he is awarded the Yad Vashem medal as one of the \n     rescuers, he will be only the second U.S. Citizen and the \n     only U.S. diplomat ever so honored for putting his life and \n     career on the line to rescue Jewish refugees.\n       Perhaps most important, the documents related to Nazi gold \n     and war criminals being spirited away to Latin America on \n     submarines with the knowledge of the U.S. State Department \n     now are being investigated by the Simon Weisenthal \n     Center.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S670-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, in recognition of Black \nHistory Month I come to the floor to honor a little-known member of the \nLewis and Clark expedition that explored the Oregon territory. \nExpedition historians tell us that an African-American by the name of \nYork accompanied Lewis, Clark and the Shoshoni woman, Sacagawea on the \nlong journey ending in the area of what is now Fort Clatsop, OR.\n  Throughout the Lewis and Clark expedition, York served as a valuable \ntranslator, helped to strengthen Native-American relations, and guided \nseveral successful trading ventures. It has been said that on numerous \noccasions, York risked his life so that the expedition could continue. \nYork's contributions were numerous, and according to the Lewis and \nClark Heritage Foundation, when the party reached the Columbia River, a \ndecision had to be made whether to head to the north shore of the \nColumbia--Washington State--or cross the river to the south side--\nOregon--where Indians had said that game could be found. An actual vote \nof the members was recorded, representing the first American \ndemocratically held election west of the Rockies that included the vote \nof a woman, Sacagawea, and a black man, York.\n  Today, a mural in the southwest corner of the Rotunda of Oregon State \nCapital in Salem depicts the expedition that Merriwether Lewis and \nWilliam Clark, Sacagawea and York made through the Louisiana and Oregon \nTerritories. I want to join all Oregonians today in celebrating Black \nHistory Month and celebrate the contributions that African-Americans \nhave made to American history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S672-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNITION OF DR.

Mr. President, since 1926, we have designated \nFebruary as the month during which we honor the contributions of \nAfrican-Americans to our history, our culture, and our future.\n  Of course, no month should pass without our giving attention to the \nhistorical legacy of America's African-Americans. However, this month \nis the time when we devote special attention to this legacy, which, in \nthe face of seemingly insurmountable odds, has survived and enriched \nAmerican life in countless ways.\n  As it does each year, the Association for the Study of Afro-American \nLife and History (ASALH) has selected a theme for this month's \ncelebration. This year's theme is ``African Americans and Business: The \nPath Toward Empowerment.''\n  Mr. President, maybe more than any other theme, the question of \nAfrican-Americans and business demands our attention and interest. The \ndegree to which African-Americans participate in and benefit from \nAmerica's commercial and business life may be the single best indicator \nof whether they have obtained the equality of opportunity and freedom \nfor which they have long strived and to which they are entitled under \nour Constitution. We move toward full equality when uniquely gifted \nindividuals--athletes, artists, entertainers, etc.--capture the \npublic's imagination and because of their unique gifts transcend the \nlimits placed on their race. We move even closer to this goal when each \nand every African-American has the opportunity to get a loan, lease or \npurchase property, open a business, develop a product, hire other \nAfrican-Americans, and contribute to the betterment of his community. \nThe ability of African-Americans to have these most basic avenues of \nopportunity and advancement open to them may give us the best sense of \njust how far we have progressed on the road to equality.\n  Thus, any study of the history of African-Americans and business \nshould highlight not only the many brilliant inventors and \nentrepreneurs who have made unique or major contributions to American \nhistory. It should also take note of the many average, hard-working \npeople who have fulfilled, against\n\n[[Page S673]]\n\ngreat odds, the American dream of owning and operating their own \nbusinesses. Let me devote a few minutes to both these sets of heroes.\n  On one hand African-Americans, and Americans in general, can boast of \nsuch great minds as Jan Matzeliger (1852-1889), Joseph Lee (1849-1905), \nElijah McCoy (1843-1929), and Andrew Beard (1850-1910)--19th century \ninventors who helped revolutionize American industry at a crucial \nperiod in its development. They can boast of groundbreaking success \nstories such as Madame C.J. Walker (1867-1919), America's first black \nmillionaire businesswoman, whose hair products company employed 3,000 \npeople, and Maggie Lena Walker (1867-1934), America's first female bank \npresident. Mr. President, this list is merely a sample of the many \nAfrican-Americans who have made unique contributions to American \ncommerce, and who have helped lead us to the heights we occupy today as \nthe strongest economic force in the world.\n\n  On the other hand, let us also take note of the more modest success \nstories of the many African-Americans who at this same time owned and \nran businesses, surviving not only economic hardship but a social \nsystem that left them short of funding, public support, and legal \nprotection. Here I speak of the members--now long forgotten--of the \nColored Merchants Association of New York City, formed during the Great \nDepression to sustain the city's African-American businesses against \nthe shocks of that economic disaster. I speak here also of the numerous \nAfrican-American newspapers established in the late 19th century, the \nfirst of which, Baltimore's Afro-American, is still published to this \nday.\n  Mr. President, I submit that only when such stories of struggle and \nachievement are commonplace, and demand no particular attention, can we \ntruly claim credit for eradicating completely the scourge of racial \nbias from our society.\n  I think we are moving in the right direction. Between 1987 and 1992, \nwhen the last set of complete figures were available from the Census \nBureau, the number of American businesses owned by African-Americans \nincreased by 46%. In my own State of Maryland, the numbers are even \nmore impressive. In Maryland during the 1987-1992 period, the number of \nAfrican-American businesses grew by 14,080 to 35,578, a 65% increase. \nThese figures, I am proud to say, make Maryland the State with the most \nAfrican-American-owned businesses in the Nation. Moreover, two of \nMaryland's counties are among the top ten in the nation in terms of the \nnumber of African-American businesses based there. Clearly, more and \nmore African-Americans are taking the path to empowerment that \nAmericans of all colors and creeds should view as their birthright.\n  Thus, during Black History Month, let us celebrate not only firms \nlike Prince George's County's Pulsar Data Systems, a computer systems \nintegration company that made $165 million in 1995, and was ranked by \nBlack Enterprise Magazine as the fifth most profitable black-owned \ncompany in America that year. Let us also celebrate smaller enterprises \nlike Grassroots II, an African-American bookstore in Salisbury, MD, \nwhich specializes in literature celebrating the African-American \nexperience. Both these types of businesses--the smaller no less than \nthe bigger --show us how far we have come as a nation and how far we \nstill need to go.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me pay tribute to a Maryland-based \nAfrican-American run ``business'' that deserves special mention this \nmonth. This business sought to lead African-Americans down a different \npath of empowerment--not economic empowerment, but intellectual and \ncultural empowerment. I speak of the black history calendar business \nrun by C. Cabell Carter during the 1970's and 1980's. Mr. Carter, a \nretired schoolteacher who died in 1987, travelled throughout \nBaltimore's African-American community selling calendars that featured \nAfrican-American artwork and highlighted on each day of the year a \nsignificant achievement in African-American history. He charged a \nnominal fee for each calendar, and, by most estimates, sold few \ncalendars per year. I ask that a February 5, 1998 article in the \nBaltimore Sun about Mr. Carter be printed in the Record at the end of \nmy statement.\n  Mr. Carter did not create jobs, he was not known outside his \nimmediate community, and he would hardly qualify as a prosperous \nbusinessman, much less a captain of industry. His achievement, however, \nwas to make his fellow African-Americans aware of their rich history, \nand to instill in them the pride to be part of that history. It is my \nsincere hope that some of those with whom Mr. Carter spoke and to whom \nhe sold calendars will be the ones that we in Congress will honor in \nfuture editions of Black History Month.\n  The article follows:\n\n                  Taking Black History to the Streets\n\n               (By Elmer P. Martin and Joanne M. Martin)\n\n       Historian Carter G. Woodson began Negro History Week in \n     1926 (now Black History Month), but over the years many \n     average citizens helped popularize the February observance.\n       One such local person was the late C. Cabell Carter, a \n     Baltimore schoolteacher who spent much of his retirement \n     years in the 1970s and '80s peddling black history calendars \n     he created, and serving as a sort of street-corner historian, \n     preaching to everyone from drug dealers to church leaders \n     about the importance of knowing their history.\n       Mr. Carter charged a nominal fee for the calendars that \n     featured black and white renderings of ancient African \n     royalty and historical African-Americans of note. Virtually \n     every day on the calendars was marked with a significant \n     event in black history.\n       Mr. Carter probably sold 1,000 calendars a year. Any \n     proceeds were used to finance the production of the next \n     year's calendars and black history postcards. Once, he self-\n     published a thin paperback of profiles of black historical \n     figures.\n\n\n                            widely traveled\n\n       With his tall, thin figure always immaculately dressed in a \n     starched, white, buttoned-down shirt and tie, and frequently \n     a jacket or suit, Mr. Carter was a well-known figure in \n     Baltimore's black community who traveled all over the area \n     selling his calendar. You were as likely to see him outside \n     Lexington Terrace housing project as you were to find him \n     traversing Morgan State University.\n       Amazingly, he did all his travels--in good weather and \n     bad--using public transportation. When he was cautioned not \n     to go into dangerous areas, he shrugged off such suggestions. \n     After all, he was on a mission to educate his people, which \n     meant he had to go wherever his people were.\n       Mr. Carter sought to ``liberate''  black history from \n     academia and take it to the streets. He said it was \n     important for black youth to know that their people had a \n     rich history long before coming to this country. He wanted \n     to fill the gaps left by many history books.\n       While Mr. Carter spread the word about black history, he \n     didn't spend a lot of time talking about himself, so details \n     of his background are sketchy.\n       He was born Dec. 5, 1912, and graduated from Hampton \n     Institute (now Hampton University). He taught for years at \n     Carver Vocational School, where he became a leading advocate \n     for instituting black studies and black history in the public \n     schools.\n       His wife apparently died years ago; his only child, a son, \n     could not be located at the time of Mr. Carter's death, Aug. \n     8, 1987.\n       We came to know Mr. Carter when we established the Great \n     Blacks in Wax Museum in 1983. He volunteered his services and \n     became one of our founding board members. He loved taking our \n     wax figures on the road for exhibits to such places as \n     Mondawmin Mall.\n       Mr. Carter said he developed his love of history while \n     serving in the Army's 92nd Infantry Division during World War \n     II, where he received the Bronze Star for bravery in action.\n       Faced with extreme racial prejudice and segregation from \n     fellow soldiers and others, Mr. Carter read black history to \n     keep from succumbing to feelings of inferiority and \n     bitterness. The therapeutic results persuaded him that all \n     black people should become acquainted with their history.\n       Toward that end, he spent considerable time collecting \n     newspaper clippings, visiting libraries and engaging in other \n     activities in an effort to amass historical data for his \n     files, which he would in turn share with others.\n\n\n                         an eccentric character\n\n       Although some people regarded him as a bit crazy for \n     approaching hardened youths on street corners, such youths \n     were generally disarmed by Mr. Carter's easy smile, his \n     sincerity, his low tolerance for foolishness and the great \n     confidence he had in their promise and potential.\n       Mr. Carter often said, ``It is a sad day when the elders \n     are afraid of their own children. I refuse to ever get in \n     that state.''\n       Mr. Carter also started the Reading Improvement \n     Association, a community-based literacy program. His work did \n     not go unappreciated. At his funeral, some 300 people from \n     all walks of life packed a small cemetery chapel to pay \n     tribute to that wonderfully unusual man.\n       The West Baltimore resident died penniless at age 74. His \n     landlord, not realizing the importance of Mr. Carter's \n     collection, had it\n\n[[Page S674]]\n\n     gathered up and thrown away. So there's little left of Mr. \n     Carter's work except a few calendars and a few copies of his \n     book, ``Black History Makers.''\n       But, during Black History Month, we recognize such little-\n     known figures as Mr. Carter, as well as the celebrated.\n       Mr. Carter would have liked that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S672-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING HOBBS, N.M., HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL COACH RALPH TASKER\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a man \nwho has accumulated a remarkable record as the head basketball coach at \nHobbs High School in New Mexico. This year he ends more than a half \ncentury of teaching and coaching. During these decades of service, he \nhas endeared himself to a community and earned acclaim as one of the \nmost winning high school coaches in the United States.\n  To understand the significance of Ralph Tasker's impact, it is useful \nto know more about Hobbs, the community to which he had dedicated his \nlife.\n  Hobbs is a city born of the hard-scrabble oil and gas industry. \nSituated on the dusty mesquite-laden plains of southeast New Mexico, it \nis primarily dependent on farming, ranching, and the petroleum \nindustry. It is a proud community that has touted itself as ``Hobbs, \nAmerica.''\n  I believe I can safely say that a lot of the pride in this community \nhas been fostered by its school system and, more specifically, the \nrenowned success of its high school basketball team.\n  Mr. President, on February 20, Ralph Tasker will coach his last high \nschool basketball game in Hobbs.\n  On that Friday evening in the Ralph Tasker Arena, the people of \nHobbs--a town accustomed to the booms and busts of the oil and gas \nindustry--will honor the man who since 1949 has lead the Hobbs Eagles \nto consistent basketball glory. Under Ralph Tasker's steady tutelage, \nit can be said a most constant sound in Hobbs, beyond the hum of \noilfield pumps, has been the swish of basketballs ripping through the \nhoops, the squeak of rubber on hardwood, and decades of cheering fans. \nIt has been through the efforts of Ralph Tasker, the hard knuckled \nbasketball coach, that Hobbs has become known to America.\n  Understandably, Hobbs honors the end of Coach Tasker's remarkable \ncareer with a measure of trepidation.\n  Mr. President, I believe Ralph Tasker's career as a high school coach \nhas been so outstanding that he deserves the recognition of the Senate.\n  Born, raised and educated in West Virginia, Ralph Tasker's life has \nvirtually always involved basketball. His teaching and coaching career \nbegan in Ohio. During World Was II, he served with the U.S. Army Air \nCorps stationed at what is now Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque. \nTasker played basketball with the Flying Kellys during his service \ndays.\n  Following the war, he earned a masters degree and returned to New \nMexico, this time to Lovington where he taught and coached starting in \n1946. It was in 1949 that Ralph Tasker began his illustrious tenure as \nthe head basketball coach at Hobbs High School.\n  Over the decades, Coach Tasker has compiled the third most winning \nrecord of active high school coaches in the United States, with a \nrecord of at least 1,116 wins and only 289 losses.\n  Tasker's Hobbs Eagles have won a dozen state championships--one in \nLovington in 1949 and 11 in Hobbs in 1956, 1957, 1958, 1966, 1968, \n1969, 1970, 1980, 1981, 1987, and 1988. He is believed to have set a \nrecord of sorts by coaching state championship basketball teams in five \ndifferent decades, from the 1940s to the 1980s. The varsity team has \nqualified for the state basketball tournaments 36 times, including 24 \nconsecutive tourney appearances between 1961 and 1985.\n  In 52 seasons as head basketball coach, Ralph Tasker's teams have \nsuffered only two losing seasons. In comparison, he has coached 36 \nteams to seasons with 20 or more victories. He led two teams through \nperfect seasons, 1966 (28-0) and 1981 (26-0). His 1970 squad averaged \n114.6 points per game during a 27-game season, which is still a \nnational record.\n  All this success has been rewarded with a trophy case of personal \nhonors. Ralph Tasker has been named National High School Coach by the \nNational High School Coaches Association and by the National Sports \nNews Service. In 1991, he was named the National Athletic Coach of the \nYear by the prestigious Walt Disney National Teacher Awards Program.\n  He was a 1988 inductee into the National High School Sports Hall of \nFame in Kansas City, Missouri. He has also been inducted into the New \nMexico High School Coaches Association Hall of Honor, the Alderson-\nBroaddus College's Battler Hall of Fame, and the New Mexico State \nUniversity Aggie Hall of Fame.\n  Recognition of Coach Tasker's abilities is underscored by the fact \nthat more than 100 Eagle basketball players have gone to college on \nbasketball scholarships, with 50 named to All-State squads, nine \nselected to prep All-American teams, and 13 drafted by professional \nbasketball leagues.\n  But I know that the citizens of Hobbs are most proud and appreciative \nof Ralph Tasker for the hundreds of lives he has helped shape as a \ncoach and mentor. Hundreds upon hundreds of youth people have benefited \nfrom the hard work, discipline, and sense of comradery they gained \nunder Coach Tasker's direction. For more than 50 years he has given \nimpressionable young men a sense of direction, a sense of being part of \nsomething bigger and greater than they could be by themselves. In \nteaching such lessons through sweat and toil on the varnished boards of \na gymnasium floor, he has made Hobbs a better place to live.\n  For all his accomplishments, I salute Ralph Tasker, and join those \nwho bring deserved attention to his lifetime of commitment to an \nhonored sport and the youth who play the game.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S674-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF RALPH TASKER\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to give praise to a great \nman. Ralph Tasker has announced that after 52 seasons of coaching, he \nwill retire as the head basketball coach at Hobbs High School in New \nMexico. In his 52 seasons, Coach Tasker has amassed over 1,103 wins en \nroute to 12 State championships, 4 State runner-up titles, and 1 \nNational Coach of the Year title. Indeed, Coach Tasker's legacy is that \nof a man who not only won many basketball games, but also brought his \npositive influence into the lives of hundreds of high school students.\n  From 1965 to 1967, Coach Tasker's team won 53 consecutive games. In \nthe 1969-70 season, his team averaged 114.6 points per game, earning \nhim the prestigious National Coach of the Year title. In the 1980's, \nCoach Tasker continued his winning ways as he led his team to \nconsecutive undefeated seasons from 1980-82, and he was elected to the \nNational High School Sports Hall of Fame.\n  Mr. President, on the eve of the third-winningest active high school \ncoach's retirement, I would like to take this opportunity to thank \nRalph Tasker for his years of dedication to the youth of New Mexico. \nCertainly, we all have a lot to learn from this man, and his example \nstands as a marker that we should all strive to attain. Thank you, \nCoach Tasker, for teaching us the true meaning of winning \ngracefully.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S674-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S674-S675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF DR.

Mr. President, over the course of the debate on Dr. \nSatcher's nomination for Assistant Secretary of Health and Surgeon \nGeneral, Senator Ashcroft and others have expressed some issues of \nconcern. First, Dr. Satcher's comments regarding abortion. Second, an \nAZT study in Africa to research alternative treatments for developing \nnations to the costly and inaccessible AZT regimen.\n  While I initially had concerns about Dr. Satcher's comments on \nabortion, I wanted to listen to the debate, examine additional written \nresponses Dr. Satcher provided to the committee on this issue, and make \nmy decision.\n  During the committee's consideration of Dr. Satcher, he stated that \nhe supports President Clinton in his veto of the ban on partial-birth-\nabortions. After the hearings, he tried to back-track.\n  In his October 28, 1997 written comments to Senator Frist, Dr. \nSatcher further explained his position on abortion and I'd like to \nquote those remarks.\n\n       Let me state unequivocally that I have no intention of \n     using the positions of Assistant\n\n[[Page S675]]\n\n     Secretary for Health and Surgeon General to promote issues \n     related to abortion. I share no one's political agenda and I \n     want to use the power of these positions to focus on issues \n     that unite Americans--not divide them.\n\n  I am not comforted by this clarification of his position.\n  Mr. President, I believe we as a nation require a Surgeon General \nwho's position on this issue is one of furthering policies which, at a \nminimum, do not give tacit approval of a procedure that 75 to 80 \npercent of Americans agree is barbaric and unneeded.\n  With regard to the AZT trials to prevent the maternal-to-infant \ntransfer of HIV in Africa, I also share some concerns about the \nprotocol set up in this study. Specifically, the use of a placebo \ncontrol group.\n  Mr. President, I have always been a strong supporter of medical \nresearch. I cannot, however, endorse or condone research done in \ndeveloping countries in a manner which we would not conduct it here in \nour own Nation--with our own constituents as the subjects of that \nresearch.\n  Mr. President, I listened to both sides of the arguments and came to \na conclusion. I have no reason to believe Dr. David Satcher is not \nqualified to serve as Assistant Secretary of Health and Surgeon General \nof the United States. However, I, for the reasons cited earlier, could \nnot in good conscience support his nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S674-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MAKING CRS REPORTS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, last week Senator McCain, the \nChairman of the Commerce Committee, introduced legislation to make \nCongressional Research Service Reports, Issue Briefs and Authorization \nand Appropriations products available over the Internet to the public. \nI rise today to express my support for this timely legislation.\n  The Congressional Research Service has a well-deserved reputation for \nproducing objective, high-quality reports and issue briefs. I have \nrelied on these reports in the past and have only the highest regard \nfor the material produced by CRS. This information is not readily \navailable to the general public, however. Congressional offices must \nofficially request information on a constituent's behalf.\n  Senator McCain's legislation, S. 1578, directs the Director of CRS to \nmake reports, issue briefs and the more comprehensive CRS reports on \nfederal authorizations and appropriations available on the Internet. \nMost of this information is already available on the CRS website but \ncan only be accessed by Members of Congress and their staff. Obviously, \nsince we use the Internet to make this information more accessible to \nCongress, we have the ability to make this information available to the \ngeneral public. It is time we do so.\n  Increasingly, the public is demonstrating that it is not satisfied \nwith the way Congress does business. Amid the furor over campaign \nfinance reform, accusations abound of Members ``selling'' their votes \nto private interest groups. I believe that greater access to the \ndocuments used by Members of Congress when making decisions will \nincrease public understanding of this institution. Since constituents \nwill be able to see the materials which influence the way a Member \nvotes, a more accurate view of the Congressional decision-making \nprocess should emerge.\n  Passage of this legislation will also permit the Congressional \nResearch Service to serve an important role in informing the public. \nThis nation's citizens will be able to read CRS products and receive a \nconcise, accurate summary of the issues that concern them. The American \ntaxpayer is paying for this information, almost $65 million for this \nyear alone, and has a right to see it.\n  The technological advances of the last decade are truly astonishing. \nEvery effort should be made to apply this new technology as widely as \npossible. The advent of the Internet provides an important avenue for \nthe exploration of new applications. This new medium has made possible \nthe low-cost, rapid dissemination of information to an growing \naudience, and, whereas legislation to make CRS information available to \nthe public was not plausible ten years ago, today we can do it at a \nvery low cost.\n  Mr. President, removing the barriers to public view of CRS documents \nis a great idea who's time has come. It will help Congress to better \nfulfill its duty to inform the public and allow constituents to see \nfirst hand the information that serves as the basis for many of the \ndecisions made by its federally elected representatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S675-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AN IDAHOAN MINES OLYMPIC GOLD\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate an \nAmerican athlete who has shown us all that adversity can be turned into \ninspiration and success.\n  Picabo Street, a young woman from the tiny mining town of Triumph in \nmy home state of Idaho, has thrilled us all with her gold medal-winning \nperformance in the women's super giant slalom at the Winter Olympics in \nNagano, Japan.\n  Four years ago I stood in this chamber to offer my congratulations to \nPicabo, who won a silver medal in the Lillehammer Olympics in the \ndownhill. While a lot has happened in this country and the world over \nthose four years, one thing has remained the same: Picabo Street's \ndesire to win an Olympic gold medal.\n  That dream looked like it might not be fulfilled after a horrible \naccident 14 months ago during a training run. Picabo blew out her knee, \nand missed almost the entire 1997 season. But thanks to her \ndetermination and tireless rehabilitation, the knee was strong enough \nto return to action late last year. And then, another setback marred \nher prospects for Nagano. Just 12 days ago, she was knocked unconscious \nin a spill during a race in Sweden.\n  But this remarkable third-generation Idahoan, who learned to ski on \nthe slopes of Sun Valley, was determined not to let this latest setback \nkeep her from fulfilling the promise she made to her parents when she \nwas a little girl--the promise of Olympic gold.\n  Picabo says the long and difficult months of rehabilitation from her \ninjury were the toughest times of her life. Yet her hard work and \ndedication pulled her through. Even while she could only sit and watch \nher teammates get ready for these games, she never lost hope.\n  Picabo's mother, Dee, taught her the words to the Star Spangled \nBanner. Four years ago, Picabo stood on the silver medal platform, \nlistening to another country's anthem being played. She vowed the next \ntime she'd hear her anthem. Those singing lessons came in handy today. \nWith the gold medal around her neck, Picabo sang the words to our \nnational anthem. I'm sure every American sang with her.\n  Idaho can be truly proud of a hometown hero, who overcame seemingly \ninsurmountable odds to regain the form that made her a world champion. \nI ask every Idahoan and every American to join me in offering \ncongratulations to this amazing athlete.\n  The little girl from the gold mining town of Triumph, Idaho has \ntriumphed and won the gold medal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S675-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S675-S676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Madam President, I am pleased to report a very historic \nevent that occurred today at the State Department at about 12 noon. The \nPresident of the United States, the Secretary of State, the Vice \nPresident, and the Foreign Ministers of the Czech Republic, Poland, and \nHungary, were in attendance. At this event, the President signed an \namendment to the Washington treaty--the NATO treaty--that has been or \nwill shortly be delivered to the Senate asking that the Czech Republic, \nHungary and Poland become full members of NATO. This ceremony at the \nState Department completed the formal transmission from the President \nto this body for its advice and consent of the protocols of accession \nof those three countries into NATO.\n  It was pointed out to me by the Vice President, as we were leaving \nthe State Department ceremony, that it was this very day upon which the \nYalta Conference ended some 50 years ago. It seems to me incredible \nthat it is happening, but also that it has taken this long for to us \nrectify a serious historical error. At the ceremony, there were a \nnumber of things stated about why this was so important.\n  We are moving very quickly this session to a momentous vote \naddressing America's security interests in Europe, which will not only \naffect us, but the next several generations of Americans. I refer to \nthe addition of new allies to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. \nRecognizing that the protocols would be referred to the Foreign \nRelations Committee for its review,\n  The committee, under Chairman Helms' leadership, has been holding a \nseries of comprehensive hearings since October on the pros and cons of \nenlarging NATO.\n  Beginning with Secretary of State Albright, we heard testimony from \nsenior Clinton administration and former executive branch officers, \nretired ambassadors and generals, and distinguished academics and \nforeign policy experts--most in favor of, but some in opposition to \nexpansion.\n  The Committee also invited public testimony from all citizens \nconcerned with this issue, welcoming veterans groups, scholars, and \nrepresentatives of the American Baltic, Central and East European, and \nJewish communities. Opinion among all witnesses ran four to one in \nfavor of embracing the Poles, Hungarians, and Czechs as NATO allies.\n  With the Protocols now in hand, the Committee will hold one more \nhearing with Secretary of State Albright, Secretary of Defense Cohen, \nand Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Shelton on February 24.\n  The following week, the Committee is expected to markup and vote on \nthe Resolution of Ratification. I anticipate that the Committee will \noverwhelmingly recommend consideration of the Resolution by the full \nSenate. The Majority Leader has indicated that consideration should \nbegin in March, after action on campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. President, rather than giving a detailed statement now on the \nmany benefits to America of NATO enlargement, I wish only to enunciate \na few central themes upon which I will expand as Senate consideration \nof these vital protocols approaches.\n  The first thesis is that, as NATO's leader, America must ensure the \nAlliance moves beyond its Cold War mission. The status quo is \ntantamount to declaring NATO a non-performing asset.\n  Internally, NATO is already adapting to address different threats to \npeace, now that a massive military strike from the East is highly \nunlikely. The Alliance is placing smaller, smarter, more mobile forces \nunder a streamlined command system with a new strategic concept. This \nwill allow rapid action, including beyond the borders of NATO, such as \nour current mission in Bosnia.\n  Enlargement is part of NATO's external transformation. This \ntransformation is designed to widen the zone of stability, deter new \nthreats of ethnic conflict, eliminate new divisions or ``zones of \ninfluence,'' and promote common action against weapons proliferation \nand transfer, terrorism, and organized crime. NATO's open door to \nexpansion helps provide the confidence and inspiration for continued \ndemocratization and economic development in the former Soviet States \nand in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\n  Admission of new allies is the most solemn in the spectrum of new \nsecurity relationships NATO has undertaken throughout Europe and the \nformer Soviet Union, since the admission of Spain, and prior to that, \nGermany, Greece and Turkey. In addition, NATO has developed unique \npartnerships with Russia and Ukraine, and has drawn former adversaries \ninto a web of cooperation through what we refer to as the Partnership \nfor Peace and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.\n  The second thesis that I will be expounding on at a later time is \nthat the costs of enlargement are real but manageable, and represent a \nbargain for the American people in terms of our security.\n  NATO's own study of the Polish, Hungarian, and Czech contributions to \nour common defense rates them well worth the ten-year, one-and-a half \nbillion dollar price tag. The U.S. share in this price will be roughly \nfour hundred million dollars over ten years, or about forty million \ndollars per year.\n  Most importantly, Secretary of State Albright noted in her testimony, \nthat our Allies stated at the last NATO summit that the resources for \nenlargement will be found and that she will ensure that our allies pay \ntheir fair share--a very important requirement to be met in order to \ngain the support of our colleagues in the Senate.\n\n  In the long-run, America has always found that common defense is \ncheaper defense. This is true certainly in financial, but even more so \nin the far more\n\n[[Page S677]]\n\nprecious human resources the sixty million people and two hundred \nthousand troops Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic bring to our \ncommon security. This is not a question of whether the U.S. will trade \nWarsaw for Washington, or Budapest for Buffalo, but rather that the \nPoles, Czechs, and Hungarians are willing to assume the front line in \nAmerica's forward defense of its shores.\n  The third thesis is that our relations with Russia remain solid, \nproductive, and cooperative, notwithstanding enlargement. Prophets of \nbacklash have been disproven.\n  Although few Russians are fond of NATO enlargement, policymakers in \nMoscow have accepted it. Moreover, no Russian with whom I met in \nMoscow--from Communist leader Zyuganov, to liberal leader Yavlinsky, to \nthe nationalist retired General Lebed--believed that NATO enlargement \nconstitutes a security threat to Russia.\n  We have seem Russia ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, renew \nefforts to ratify START II, send troops under overall U.S. command to \nimplement peace in Bosnia, and work smoothly with NATO as an \norganization in the new Russia-NATO Permanent Joint Council.\n  But ultimately, Russia must understand that it has no veto over NATO \nactions, nor over the right of former Soviet satellites to freely \nchoose their defense arrangements. I believe their actions demonstrate \nthat they have come to terms--however grudgingly--with this fact.\n  My fourth thesis is a caution. The consequences of a failure to \nembrace the Poles, Hungarians, and Czechs as new allies would be a \ndisaster.\n  This century has taught us that when Central Europeans are divorced \nfrom Western institutions of common defense, they are vulnerable to \npressure and control by the great powers around them, and susceptible \nto insidious suspicions of their neighbors' intentions. This forces \nthem to nationalize their defense policies, creating tension and \ninstability\n  Here, I would like to quote from Dr. Henry Kissinger's testimony to \nthe Foreign Relations Committee on this very point. Dr. Kissinger's \ntestimony to the Foreign Relations Committee on this very point was \nvery, very enlightening, I thought.\n\n       Kissinger warned: Basing European and Atlantic security on \n     a no man's land between Germany and Russia runs counter to \n     all historical experience, especially that of the interwar \n     period. It would bring about two categories of frontiers in \n     Europe, those that are potentially threatened but not \n     guaranteed, and those that are guaranteed but not threatened. \n     If America were to act to the defend the Oder [between \n     Germany and Poland] but not the Vistula [in Poland], 200 \n     miles to the east, the credibility of all the existing NATO \n     guarantees would be gravely weakened.\n\n  Madam President, I will close with a fifth and final thesis, and it \nis a moral one.\n  For 40 years, the United States loudly proclaimed its solidarity with \nthe captive nations of Central and Eastern Europe who were under the \nheel of communist oppressors. Now that most of them have cast off their \nshackles, it is our responsibility, in my view, to live up to our \npledges to readmit them into the West through NATO and the European \nUnion as they qualify.\n  Just as NATO enlargements embraced Turkey, Greece, and West Germany \nseveral years before the European Union's precursors were yet in \nexistence, so we should not hesitate to accept Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic now, even before their accession to the European Union.\n  The habits of cooperation created by NATO membership can only help \nthese nations as they prepare for economic integration into Europe and \nthe West.\n  I thank the Chair for listening and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/11/senate-section/article/S676-5", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
