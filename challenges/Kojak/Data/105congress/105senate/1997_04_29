Carry us by the \ncurrents of Your spirit. Guide us through the rocks in the river, some \nof which are hidden beneath the surface.\n  Lord, we want to be inner-directed people rather than those who are \npulled in all directions. Make us so secure in You that we will have \nstrength to discover and do Your will.

Mr. President, today, the Senate will resume consideration \nof the motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 543, the Volunteer \nProtection Act. Debate on the motion to proceed will continue until \n12:30 p.m., with the time equally divided between Senator Coverdell, or \nhis designee, and the ranking member, or his designee. From 12:30 p.m. \nto 2:15 p.m., the Senate will be in recess for the weekly policy \nluncheons. By a previous order, at 2:15 p.m., there will be a cloture \nvote on the motion to proceed to S. 543, the Volunteer Protection Act. \nIf cloture is invoked, there will be 1 hour of debate, followed by a \nvote on the motion to proceed. As a reminder, a second cloture motion \nwas filed last night on the motion to proceed to S. 543. Therefore, if \ncloture is not invoked at 2:15 p.m., there will be a second vote on \nWednesday. Hopefully, cloture will be invoked today, and the Senate can \nbegin consideration of this important bill.\n  I note again, this is debate on the motion to proceed on a bill that \nseems to me we would certainly want to pass in short order to provide \nsome basic protection for volunteers who serve on boards of charitable \norganizations, volunteer organizations. That is the spirit of what we \nhave seen in Philadelphia for the last 3 days, and yet, if you \nvolunteer in America, you run the risk of being sued. Maybe we can work \nout some of the concerns that lawyers may have about this bill. But it \nseems like it is the fair thing to do.\n  We have other work we need to do. I am sure Senators would like to \nturn to the supplemental appropriations bill as soon as possible. We \nhope that bill will be ready for consideration Wednesday or Thursday, \nbut we have to dispose of the Volunteer Protection Act first. There are \nother concerns that we think need to be addressed. So we will be \nworking with the minority leader to see if we can come to some \nagreement on how we can conclude these very important pieces of \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/29/senate-section/article/S3763-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3763-S3773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          VOLUNTEER PROTECTION ACT OF 1997--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. \n543, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 543) to provide certain protections to \n     volunteers, nonprofit organizations, and governmental \n     entities in lawsuits based on the activities of volunteers.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. LOTT. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The time between 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. shall be equally divided \nbetween the Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] or his designee, and \nthe Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] or his designee. The Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, just for clarification, we are \ndebating, in essence, whether the other side will allow us to move to \nthe Volunteer Protection Act. That is the beginning of something we \ndescribe in the Senate as a filibuster, an attempt to block \nconsideration of the Volunteer Protection Act.\n  I will take a moment just to describe the cast of characters here. \nWhat we have is a community that can perhaps be best described as \nLittle League baseball that is trying to find relief from our current \nlitigious society because they claim and can substantiate\n\n[[Page S3764]]\n\nthat it is having a chilling effect on the volunteer community.\n  We have a number of legislators--myself, Senators McConnell, \nAshcroft, Santorum, and others--who have tried to frame legislation \nunder the Volunteer Protection Act that would protect the unique \ncreature of a volunteer in America. We have some trial attorneys who \nare apparently objecting to even these limited reforms to protect \nvolunteers and their participation in what makes America so good.\n  The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 is a bill, first to describe it \nin general terms, to provide certain protections to volunteers, \nnonprofit organizations, and Government entities from lawsuits based on \nactivities of the volunteers. The findings are that potential \nvolunteers are deterred from offering their services by the potential \nfor liability actions against them; that many nonprofit organizations \nand Government entities that rely on volunteer service are harmed by \nthe withdrawal of volunteers from boards of directors and other \nservice; and that this, therefore, diminishes the contribution of these \nprograms in this most important time in our history, of volunteer \nactivity on behalf of communities and, therefore, our nonprofit \norganizations have fewer programs and they are experiencing higher \ncosts.\n  The purpose of the Volunteer Protection Act is to promote the \ninterests of social service programs beneficiaries and taxpayers by \nsustaining programs that rely on volunteers, by helping those entities, \nthose organizations that encourage voluntarism in America.\n  This would reform the laws to provide liability protection for \nvolunteers serving nonprofit organizations and Government entities. It \nwould put a limitation on the liability for volunteers. No volunteer of \na nonprofit organization or governmental entity would be liable for \nharm caused by the act or omission of the volunteer. It has certain \nprotections, of course. The volunteer must be acting within the scope \nof his or her responsibilities in the organization. If required, the \nvolunteer must be properly licensed, certified, or authorized in the \nState where the harm might have occurred. There is no protection for \nvolunteers if harm caused was willful or criminal misconduct, if it was \ngross negligence or reckless misconduct.\n  The legislation does not affect any action brought by the \norganization itself against a volunteer, and it does not affect the \nliability of the organization itself for harm caused to any person.\n  Mr. President, in the area of punitive damages--this is an area of \nthe law that goes beyond just direct costs and deals with punishing \nsomeone--punitive damages are awarded to punish or deter misconduct by \na defendant, as opposed to compensatory damages awarded to pay the \nplaintiff for harm that he or she has suffered.\n\n  In this legislation, punitive damages may not be awarded against a \nvolunteer, nonprofit organization, or government entity for harm caused \nby a volunteer without clear and convincing evidence that the harm \nresulted from willful or criminal misconduct or gross negligence.\n  No protection for volunteers or organizations for misconduct that \nconstitutes a crime of violence, a hate crime, a crime that involves a \nsexual offense or a civil rights violation, or where the defendant was \nunder the influence of drugs or alcohol. The legislation offers no \ndefense or protection in these critical areas.\n  The legislation deals with liability for noneconomic loss. \nNoneconomic losses are such things as physical and emotional pain or \nsuffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, or injury to reputation, et \ncetera.\n  The legislation requires liability for noneconomic losses to be \nproportionately assigned and paid by each defendant. So it is therefore \nabolishing joint and several liability where any defendant can be \nrequired to pay the whole judgment even if the defendant were only \nminimally involved or at fault.\n  The legislation, Mr. President, recognizes the State role in these \naffairs. It would preempt State law to the extent that State laws are \ninconsistent with the Volunteer Protection Act. But it does not preempt \na State that provides greater protection for volunteers or any category \nof volunteers performing services for a nonprofit organization or \ngovernmental entity or for the organizations themselves.\n  A State, Mr. President, may elect to have the Volunteer Protection \nAct not apply in cases where all parties are a citizen of that State. \nSo, in other words, it can elect to opt out from under this national \nlaw if it is a circumstance that involves just citizens of their State. \nTo opt out, the State must declare its election to do so in a \nfreestanding bill.\n  The Volunteer Protection Act would take effect 90 days after the date \nof enactment, and it applies to any claim filed on or after the \neffective date regardless of whether the underlying harm or the conduct \nthat caused the harm occurred before the effective date.\n  Mr. President, you cannot see this, but this is two complete pages of \nthe kinds of institutions that are asking for national policy to \nprotect the natural resource, the Nation's resource, that are \nrepresented by the American volunteer. It ranges from the Air Force \nAssociation--which reminds me of a vignette, Mr. President, that \noccurred over the weekend.\n  I do not know if you can see this jagged scar above my eye here, but \nin running to get out of the inclement weather in my home State, in the \nmiddle of the State, I was jumping into an automobile owned by the U.S. \nAir Force, and misjudged and hit the corner of the door--it made for a \nrather interesting moment or two--and the first words from my Air Force \ncompanion were, ``Gosh, I hope you're not going to sue the Air Force,'' \nwhich I have no intention of doing.\n  But it sort of reminded me of that. The first organization is the Air \nForce Association. And there is the American Camping Association, \nAmerican Diabetes Association, American Hospital Association, American \nRed Cross, American Symphony Orchestra League, American Society of \nAssociation Executives, the B'Nai B'rith International, Big Brothers \nand Big Sisters, Boys Club, Little League, which I mentioned a moment \nago, the Lupus Foundation of America, the National Association of Towns \nand Townships, the National Council of Jewish Women, the National Crime \nPrevention Council, the National Easter Seal Society, the National \nMilitary Family Association, the National PTA--and the list goes on.\n\n  Just to restate the nature of what these organizations are saying and \nthe appeal they are making, it is well documented in a letter to me \ndated April 22, 1997. I want to read it again. It is directed to me \nfrom the office of the president and chief executive officer of the \nNational Little League Baseball, Inc., from their international \nheadquarters in Williamsport, PA.\n\n       Dear Senator Coverdell: On behalf of the 1,000,000 annual \n     Little League Baseball volunteers, I am writing to express \n     Little League Baseball's support for the ``Volunteer \n     Protection Act.''\n       Little League Baseball, played in 6,800 communities in all \n     50 States, exists today with volunteerism as its foundation \n     strength. Each year this corps of 1,000,000 adult volunteers, \n     mostly mothers and fathers who consider Little League as a \n     healthy activity which strengthens families, give freely of \n     their time to provide an athletic arena in which their \n     children will learn valuable leadership lessons. To let this \n     volunteer spirit erode or be eliminated through frivolous and \n     expensive litigation would be a grave injustice to the \n     present and future generations.\n       The time is now to reduce the chilling effect of liability \n     exposure for those who [would] donate their time and services \n     to Little League Baseball or any non-profit, charitable \n     institution. If protection from nuisance suits is not \n     provided, every community is at risk of losing those very \n     people whose community service will mold the leaders of \n     tomorrow.\n       We thank you and your colleagues for giving this important \n     issue the attention it needs.\n       Sincerely, Stephen D. Keener, President and Chief Executive \n     Officer.\n\n  Here is a letter dated April 15, directed to me from Gordon Banks, \nwho is the executive director of the American Industrial Hygiene \nAssociation.\n\n       On behalf of the American Industrial Hygiene Association, I \n     am pleased to convey our support for passage of. . .the \n     ``Volunteer Protection Act of 1997.''\n       AIHA is the world's largest association of occupational and \n     environmental health professionals. The membership of AIHA, \n     nearly 13,000 members, comes from government, labor, \n     industry, academia and private business. You would be hard-\n     pressed to find a more diverse, professional organization \n     dedicated solely to the prevention of workplace\n\n[[Page S3765]]\n\n     fatalities, injury, and illness. AIHA's goal is to bring \n     ``good science'' and the benefit of our work place experience \n     to the public policy process directed at worker health and \n     safety.\n       Enactment of [the Volunteer Protection Act] would be of \n     great benefit to AIHA.\n\n  This is testimony of John H. Graham IV, who is the chief executive \nofficer of the American Diabetes Association on behalf of the American \nSociety of Association Executives and the National Coalition for \nVolunteer Protection. This testimony, Mr. President, was before the \nHouse Judiciary Committee on April 23, 1997. This gentleman says that:\n\n       . . .on behalf of the American Society of Association \n     Executives, an organization representing more than 23,500 \n     individuals from more than 11,000 national, state and local \n     trade and professional associations. As a member of the \n     ASAE's board of directors, I can report that these \n     associations are completely dependent upon volunteers who \n     serve on their boards and committees and who perform direct \n     service functions. . ..\n       The National Coalition for Volunteer Protection continues \n     to coordinate and generate support for the passage of \n     volunteer protection legislation. As of April 18, 1997, this \n     coalition represents more than 300 national, state and local \n     volunteer-dependent groups. These groups collectively utilize \n     tens of millions of volunteers.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       We have seen recently that otherwise qualified and willing \n     individuals are withholding their services out of fear of \n     liability and confusion concerning the different volunteer \n     protection laws on the books in many states. These are \n     individuals who would help house and feed the homeless, who \n     would treat and support the elderly, and who would clothe and \n     care for the poor.\n\n  In his statement he cites a study done in 1988, a Gallop study. He \nsays:\n\n       The study, ``The Liability Crisis and the Use of Volunteers \n     by Nonprofit Associations,'' was released by the Gallop \n     Organization in January 1988. The study was sponsored by the \n     American Society of Association Executives and funded by the \n     Gannett Foundation. The study concentrated on director and \n     officers liability. The results of the study revealed very \n     interesting data on the effect of this crisis on direct \n     service volunteers. According to the study:\n       Approximately one in ten nonprofit organizations \n     have experienced the resignation of a volunteer due to \n     liability concerns. If this figure were multiplied by the \n     number of nonprofit organizations in America (600,000), \n     then it would mean that 48,000 volunteers would have been \n     lost during the past few years strictly due to liability \n     concerns. Remember: these volunteers resigned. Resignation \n     is a very drastic measure.\n       One in six volunteers report withholding their services due \n     to fear of exposure to liability suits.\n\n  On that point, Mr. President, when we had a press conference in the \nHouse several days ago, it was attended by a very famous athlete with \nthe Washington Redskins, Terry Orr, who remembered when he came to play \nfor the Washington Redskins that it was a common practice for the \nsenior members of the team to come to the rookies and say, ``We need \nsome help with this Boy's Club or another organization generally \ndedicated to youth and youthful activities.'' When it came his turn--he \nwas no longer the rookie--he was going to the rookies and asking for \nsupport to get these famous role models before young people right here \nin the Nation's Capital City. And to his surprise, Mr. President, he \nwas shocked that it was not, as in his day, the response, ``Well, where \ndo we go and what Saturday morning is it?'' The response was, ``What's \nthe liability coverage and what is my risk and what kinds of forms do I \nhave to complete in order to participate?'' And, ``I'm not sure that I \ncan afford to do this kind of thing.''\n  This is a dramatic change of events and a chilling experience that \nrobs people of all walks of life, indeed, of an opportunity to be \nhelped by the unique volunteer spirit that we know in America.\n  Mr. President, I see we have been joined by the other side on this \nissue. As I understand it, we have from 9:30 to 12:30 equally divided. \nI yield to the other side at this point.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will observe the time between 9:30 \nand 12:30 is equally divided between the Senator from Georgia and the \nSenator from Vermont. The Senator from Vermont has 84 minutes remaining \non his time. The Senator from Georgia has 64 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, like many who have volunteered for everything from \nhelping out libraries to volunteering on law enforcement matters, I \nsupport the idea of voluntarism, but I oppose the motion to proceed to \nimmediate consideration of S. 543. The merit of this motion seems \nsolely to be the fact that this may be an opportunity to jump aboard \nthe train of the Philadelphia summit on volunteering in America.\n  I applaud President Clinton, General Powell, President Bush, \nPresident Carter, Mrs. Reagan, and others who were at the summit on \nvoluntarism in Pennsylvania. I hope it will encourage people to \ncontinue beyond the time of the weekend.\n  We also have some things we are supposed to do in this body. We are \nsupposed to pass a Federal budget. You and I, Mr. President, are \nrequired by law to file our income tax returns by April 15. If we do \nnot, we get a knock on the door from the IRS. We are also, as Members \nof the Senate and Members of the House, required to pass a budget by \nApril 15. The determination of when we start on a budget resolution is \ndetermined by the Republican leadership of the House and the Republican \nleadership of the Senate. Today is April 29 and they have yet to \nschedule 12 seconds of debate on the budget that the law requires us to \nhave by April 15.\n  We have a number of members of the President's Cabinet and subcabinet \nthat we cannot get 18 seconds of debate on, or to vote on them. We have \n100 vacancies in the Federal courts. We have only found time--between a \nnumber of vacations this year--to confirm two members of the court, \neven though the Chief Justice has said that the vacancies have created \na crisis in the courts of this country.\n  Now, America's 93 million volunteers, in the spirit of altruism, \nshould get better treatment than to be used as unwilling partners in a \npartisan publicity stunt as a way to come up with the fact that the \nSenate is not doing the work the law requires us to do, the \nresponsibility that we dictate we do. Instead, we have this.\n  Here we are, 2 weeks after the Senate missed its deadline to consider \nthe budget, the legislative schedule again stretches before us as a \nvast desert of inactivity, but now in the vapor, also like a mirage, \ncoming out of the desert, comes this bill.\n  Now, why was this particular bill suddenly brought to the floor \nwithout any notice, without any hearings, without a committee report? \nWhy was careful scrutiny of this bill avoided by short circuiting the \nnormal process of bringing bills through committee and to the floor of \nthe Senate? Why is this bill being tendered to the Senate and the \npublic like a stowaway, opportunistically cloaked in the camouflage of \nthe week--voluntarism?\n  Mr. President, the answer is that this is a bill whose flaws would \ncome to light under the scrutiny of our regular order. If we actually \nhad 20 minutes of hearings, if we actually had a committee report, if \nwe actually had a debate, we would find out the flaws.\n  Now, a commendable bill in the other body, which more precisely and \nthoughtfully addresses the issue which S. 543 purports to address on \nliability and volunteer work, has been introduced by Congressman John \nPorter. The Porter bill is being publicly examined through committee \nhearings, as it should be, and it is a better bill for the examination \nit is receiving.\n  The events this weekend in Philadelphia and for much of the rest of \nthis week are a tribute to the spirit of American voluntarism. It is a \nmagnifying glass that will help spark intensified efforts by all \nAmericans to be better citizens and better neighbors; citizens who will \nbe more willing to give of themselves to make life better in our \ncommunities and our Nation. The events in Philadelphia this week are \ndesigned to be nonpartisan and inclusive of the interests of all.\n  I mentioned those who were there, and I want to express again my \ngratitude to President George Bush and Barbara Bush for their \nlongstanding leadership in this cause. I remember Mrs. Bush reading to \nchildren when they were at the White House and the example that set. It \nis time to recognize the personal commitment of Jimmy and Rosalynn \nCarter with Habitat for Humanity. They have gone out\n\n[[Page S3766]]\n\nand worked and actually built houses for people to live in. They have \ndone work around the world. It is time to heed and welcome the calls to \naction by national leaders such as Gen. Colin Powell, who, by his own \nlife, set such a fine example to appreciate the vision of President \nClinton and our First Lady. We see the President, even with his leg in \na cast, hobbling over to set an example of helping.\n  We should all look forward to the results of the summit, and we \nshould pledge to work in a bipartisan way to consider any \nrecommendations--any recommendations--for legislation that may emerge \nfrom this national forum and accept the example of President Clinton \nand President Bush, of President Carter and Mrs. Reagan, of General \nPowell and others, to act in a nonpartisan fashion.\n  By contrast, the motion by the Republican majority to move to \nimmediate consideration of S. 543, a bill rushed into the hop only days \nago, reflects none of the spirit and instead actually is a narrow, \npartisan effort. Again, we find the Senate ignoring its own duties and \nresponsibilities. We find the Senate ignoring the April 15 date, which \nby law required the leadership to bring forward a budget resolution. We \nignored our duties and responsibilities to confirm Alexis Herman as the \nSecretary of Labor. We have ignored our responsibilities and duties and \nallowed this lengthening backlog of judicial nominees to the Federal \ncourt--now almost 100 vacancies--in order to tell some others what they \nshould be doing and how.\n  This time, what the majority in this body, the Republican leadership, \nhas targeted are the legislatures of the 50 States. What the Senate is \ntrying to tell the State legislatures is that they do not know how to \ndo their business. Big Daddy is right here in Washington. We will tell \nyou how to do it better. Frankly, that might not go over too well with \nthe legislature in Vermont, and I hope it will not in Kansas, Georgia, \nor anywhere else. Over the last several years, the States have \nconsidered and passed a variety of statutes to provide protections they \ndetermined advisable to encourage and protect those who volunteer or \nwork for charitable organizations.\n  In 1990, President Bush endorsed a model State law to protect \nvolunteers from legal liability, but he did it the right way. President \nBush said, ``Here is a good law, here is a model law, but we are not \ngoing to impose it on the State legislatures. We in Washington are not \ngoing to tell the people of Missouri, Georgia, Vermont, Kansas, or \nanywhere else, how you must do it. We will make the suggestion but your \nown legislature can make that determination.''\n  Amazingly, for once, the Senate of the United States or the House of \nRepresentatives was not trying to tell them what they had to do. They \nwere delighted, and they endorsed it. Since 1990, when President Bush \nmade what I thought was a very sensible call, and one I encourage, \nState legislatures across the country have moved to protect volunteers \nthrough enactment of State laws, not something imposed on them from \nWashington, but something they designed within their own States. At \nleast 44 of the 50 States have enacted some form of volunteer \nprotection from liability. But even though those 44 have been active, \nwe want to come rushing in, with no hearings, no debate, no discussion, \nno consideration by the States or anything else of legislation, and we \nsay, ``Tough luck, your legislatures do not count. Here we are. We will \ntell you what to do.''\n  Why does the Senate of the United States need to take up and pass \nFederal legislation on this subject on an emergency or expedited basis \nwhen we cannot even do the work we are supposed to do? We cannot even \nget the budget here on April 15 like we are required. We cannot confirm \njudges. We cannot do anything we are supposed to do. Why are we \nproceeding to a bill that was only introduced days ago? Why are we \nproceeding without any hearings or committee consideration? Why are we \nbeing forced to proceed without the benefit of a committee report, \nwithout an opportunity to study the recent actions of our State \nlegislatures? Can we at least look at what legislatures do before we \nhit them over the head and tell all these States, ``You are not smart \nenough to do this. We are so much smarter than you are.''\n  Do we really want to do that when we have not even had 12 seconds of \nhearings on this bill? Why is the Republican leadership demanding the \nSenate consider a law to override the laws of each of our State \nlegislatures designed to protect volunteers and charitable \norganizations in our States? Why are we being told to just wipe out all \nthe things the State legislatures have done to protect volunteers in \ntheir States? The States of Vermont, Georgia, and many others, for \nexample, have already provided protection for directors and officers of \nnonprofit organizations from civil liability. Do we, in the U.S. \nSenate, intuitively know better than our State legislatures what is \nneeded?\n  Do we know whether the better approach is to require indemnification \nor mandate insurance or provide limited immunity or help properly to \nstructure acceptance of limitations of liabilities so that State law \ncan serve to encourage charitable efforts without leaving innocent \ncitizens to suffer from wrongful conduct without legal recourse? Have \nwe developed any kind of a record--a page, a paragraph, a sentence, one \nitsy-bitsy tiny word--on which to justify such a legislative judgment \nor to justify Federal intrusion into areas that are traditionally \nmatters of local concern? Of course not.\n  For a group whose rhetoric is about reducing the role of the Federal \nGovernment and returning power to the States, the Republican Senate \nseems awfully sure it knows better than anyone else what the States \nshould pass to encourage local volunteers. You go home and give a \nspeech to the local Rotary Club and say, ``We want to give the power \nback to the States. We want the people to make these decisions; \nhowever, we know better than you in the long run, so we will pass \nthis.'' For a group that criticizes others for acting as if Washington \nhas solutions to every local problem, the smell of cherry blossoms \nseems to have gotten to someone.\n\n  I do not know what is wrong with the partial immunity and limited \nliability laws passed in Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania, or \nMissouri. I have not seen convincing evidence that vast punitive damage \njudgments exist to a significant factor in voluntarism, yet we are \nabout to enact a Federal law regime to alter State law and State common \nlaw traditions in one ill-considered swoop.\n  At least when we considered Senate Joint Resolution 22, the \nindependent counsel resolution, it was only a patently partisan sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution. It was inappropriate. It demeaned the Senate. \nBut it did not strip rights from individual Americans.\n  At least when we considered the substitute for the Taxpayer Browsing \nProtection Act on April 15 to distract from the Republican leadership's \nfailure to produce a Federal budget by that statutory deadline, we at \nleast had previously considered and passed the National Information \nInfrastructure Protection Act, we had a GAO report noting the \ncontinuing problem of IRS employees snooping into confidential tax \nrecords, and we limited our action to a Federal agency.\n  At least when the Senate discharged the Judiciary Committee from any \nconsideration of S. 495 and engaged in an artificially abbreviated \ndiscussion of its provisions in order to get to debate on the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, it did so knowing that we would have an opportunity \nto reconsider and correct it in the context of implementing legislation \nfor the chemical weapons treaty, and at least it concerned Federal law, \nnot State law. But this matter is different. It is not a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution. It is not about a Federal agency or a Federal law or \na Federal law problem. Instead, it is a repudiation of federalism and \nthe primary role of the States in defining liability laws for local \nactivities. It can have serious repercussions. When we just slap down \nthe States like that and say they don't know enough to do these things, \nso we will do it for you, we ought to at least consider it \nsubstantively.\n\n  There is a slight procedural twist in S. 543. It is technically not \nbeing discharged from the Senate Judiciary Committee because it wasn't \nreferred to the committee at all. On April 9, the same group of \nRepublican sponsors introduced the same bill twice, held it on the \nSenate calendar and allowed the identical twin to be referred to the \nJudiciary Committee as S. 544. I guess\n\n[[Page S3767]]\n\nChairman Hatch and I did not jump quickly enough for their purposes. \nThey get impatient after less than 3 weeks, and here we are on the \nfloor with this ill-considered legislation and, again, we ignored the \nstatutory date to get important legislation out, like the budget, on \nApril 15.\n  Now, of course, I did have a chance to read the bill over the \nweekend. That is a lot bigger opportunity for deliberation than was \nafforded the Senate when we voted on a substitute version of S. 495 the \nsame afternoon it was offered. So we in the minority are grateful to \nactually have a chance to do our job.\n  I want to point to a couple of problems. I wish to alert the Senate \nto several aspects of the bill. It may not be apparent from the \nstatement of the sponsors. First, this bill is misnamed. It ought to be \ncalled the Ku Klux Klan Protection Act. That is as good an example as \nany of the nonprofit, ``volunteer'' organizations that will be the \nprincipal beneficiaries of premature consideration of this legislation. \nThe bill's definition of ``nonprofit organization'' is overly broad and \nunnecessarily so. If we had had a hearing--something that apparently we \nno longer do in the Senate; we just bring bills to the floor--do you \nknow what we would have found out about this bill, Mr. President? This \nbill is going to be supported, I assume strongly, by the Ku Klux Klan, \nbecause if you look at the web page of the Ku Klux Klan, look what they \nsay on it: ``The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan are a noncommercial, \nnonprofit, volunteer organization.'' And when we knock down all the \nState laws by passing this to give immunity, who are we giving immunity \nto? Noncommercial, nonprofit, volunteer organizations like--oh, I don't \nknow, maybe the Ku Klux Klan. Well, if we had had 20 minutes of \nhearings on this bill, we might have known that. Isn't this special? In \nrushing this sucker through, we rush through something that wipes out \nState laws and imposes our feelings and our judgment to protect \nnoncommercial, nonprofit, volunteer organizations like ``the world's \noldest, largest, and most professional whites' civil rights \norganization, the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.''\n  Mr. President, look at the picture taken off of the web page of the \nKu Klux Klan: ``The world's oldest, largest, and most professional \nwhites' civil rights organization * * * a noncommercial, nonprofit, \nvolunteer organization.'' But no matter what kind of laws we might have \nin Vermont or any other State, this bill would wipe those laws off the \nbooks and give them protection.\n  I am not suggesting for one moment that this is what the sponsors of \nthis legislation want to do. There is not a single one of these \nsponsors of this legislation that want to do something to protect the \nKu Klux Klan. I think we all know that. But what happens, Mr. \nPresident, is that we just rush legislation through because it sounds \ngood and fits in for a good political sound bite for the day, and we \nhaven't had any hearings, haven't done any of the work the Senate is \nsupposed to do. This is what happens--something like this comes \nslipping through. This is why I oppose this moving forward like this.\n  This bill has been so hastily drafted as to provide legal protection \nto the Ku Klux Klan and its ``volunteer members'' as well as to all \n501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations under the Internal Revenue Code and \nto an untold variety of not-for-profit organizations.\n  Who is to decide which groups qualify for limited liability under \nsuch a definition? Is it a matter for the organization to declare in \nits purposes, such as when the Ku Klux Klan declares itself to be a \n``noncommercial, nonprofit, volunteer organization''? Is this a matter \nfor the State courts to decide, or is it a Federal question that will \nbe reserved for Federal courts to determine on a case-by-case basis? Is \nit a matter for the organization to declare its purpose, such as the Ku \nKlux Klan does when it designates itself to be a noncommercial, \nnonprofit, volunteer organization? Do we want Government to decide \nwhether the organization's activities are such that it should be held \nto be engaged in ``civic'' or ``educational'' purposes? Are the State \nlegislatures expected hereafter to pass lists of qualifying or \nnonqualifying groups or activities? Consistent with the first amendment \nprinciples, can Government be directed to make judgments on liability \nbased on the political orientation of the group? Should the group on \nthe left be allowed and a group on the right not be allowed, or vice \nversa? For that matter, how are State legislatures constitutionally \npermitted to make case-by-case determinations that avoid the \nconstraints of this Federal preemptive statute, such as required by \nsection 3(b) of S. 543?\n\n  I, for one, don't believe victims of hate groups should have to \novercome the Federal law immunities that would be created by this bill \nin order to recover damages done to them. I don't think that somebody \nwho wants to recover damages caused by actions of the Ku Klux Klan \nagainst them should have to overcome the prohibitions of this bill. Nor \ndo I believe it is our job to encourage ``volunteer'' members of the \nKKK, street gangs, or violent militias, all of which might qualify for \nnot-for-profit and nonprofit organizations under S. 543.\n  The overly broad definition of nonprofit in S. 543 might also shield \nmany hospitals from legal liability for actions involving a volunteer. \nIf a not-for-profit hospital uses a volunteer to take down patient \ninformation during the admittance process, or to wheel a patient down a \nhallway, should that hospital be shielded later from liability for \nmedical malpractice? Do we really want to close off remedies for \nmedical malpractice because a hospital used a volunteer and, thus, is \ninsulated under this?\n  I don't know that victims of malpractice in not-for-profit hospitals \nneed to overcome special federally imposed immunity rules to recover \nfor their injuries and pain and suffering. In fact, for that matter, I \nam unaware of a rush to suits against volunteers or any circumstances \nthat cry out for Federal preemption of State law on this subject. We \ndon't have a mess of suits against volunteers going on around this \ncountry, where the States are saying: Please come in and save us from \nourselves. You can do our jobs so much better than we can. You know so \nmuch better. You people are so much wiser in Washington than we are in \nthe State legislatures. Please save us from ourselves.\n  I haven't heard a lot of that. Maybe others have, but I haven't.\n  When we want to encourage voluntarism to help others, we can do so as \nwe did when we considered and passed legislation to encourage doctors \nto serve in medical clinics to provide medical services to people who \nwould otherwise do without. Now, that actually helps.\n  Last year, we enacted a targeted bill to encourage the delivery of \nfood to the poor and needy when we passed the Bill Emerson Good \nSamaritan Act. It provides food banks to people on the front lines in \nthe war against hunger, with sensible liability protection. We thought \nit out and did it.\n  But this bill, S. 543, is not so targeted. I do not understand, for \nexample, why the Republican sponsors insist on forcing victims of \nnegligent driving by a volunteer for any nonprofit and not-for-profit \nactivity to carry a heavier burden and be denied compensation for their \ndisfigurement and pain and suffering. A victim of an auto accident does \nnot care--if they are crossing the street and somebody goes barreling \nthrough a red light and nails you, when you are lying in traction in \nthe hospital, you don't really care that that driver was speeding \nbecause he or she was late to a PTA meeting, or a meeting of some trade \nassociation. But if they are going to a PTA meeting and nailed you, you \nmay not be able to recover. But if they are going to a trade \nassociation, you can. This might be enough to exempt the volunteer \ndriver under volunteer in the bill.\n  Many States have excluded motor vehicle injuries from their laws \nprotecting volunteers. The Senators pushing this through to override \nwhat the States think, do they really know better than the State \nlegislatures? What makes them think that the potential of a lawsuit for \nnegligent driving is impeding volunteer activity across the Nation? Is \nit the potential to be liable like any other driver, a liability that I \nbelieve all States require a driver to be insured against, which is so \naffecting national insurance rates, that the Federal Government has to \nstep in and create a Federal immunity? I doubt it.\n  I will work with people who want to make a better law. We can do it. \nWe ought to work together to correct the\n\n[[Page S3768]]\n\nexcesses of S. 543. I believe that nobody wants to exempt the Ku Klux \nKlan, but that is what the bill does. Why don't we find a way that we \ncan work on something, as President Bush did when he put together a \nmodel law and passed it on to the States and said, here, use your \nwisdom and determine what you need in your State. That sets a better \nway.\n  The real volunteer protection act is H.R. 911, legislation introduced \nby Congressman Porter. This actually has tripartisan support--\nDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents--and almost 140 House \ncosponsors. It is endorsed by the American Heart Association; American \nRed Cross; Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America; Girl Scout Council USA; \nLittle League; National Easter Seal Society; National PTA; Salvation \nArmy; the United Way; American Diabetes Association; the National \nCoalition of Volunteer Protection, and a whole lot of others.\n  That bill seeks to respect State prerogatives and State law, and it \nsays we are not going to just pound you over the head in Washington and \nsay that we know better, no matter what you think; we are so much wiser \nthan your State legislatures on whether to impose Federal immunities, \npreempting State law. It offers financial incentives for States to \nenact model language for limiting volunteer liability. That makes a lot \nmore sense to me.\n  If we can achieve the objective in encouraging and protecting real \nvolunteers in direct contact with those who need help, without \nFederalizing State law, we ought to consider the benefits of that. I \nknow the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, and I strongly support the \nPorter bill as a substitute to S. 543.\n  There is no record that our State courts are glutted with liability \ncases against volunteers. And there is no record that our State \nlegislatures have fallen down on the job and have been ignoring a \ncrisis that threatens voluntarism in our society. Frankly, Mr. \nPresident, I am far more comfortable to have the legislature, the \ngeneral assembly in Vermont determine what makes a good law for Vermont \nthan I am with a law rushed through the Senate with no hearings, \nvirtually no debate. We don't have a Ku Klux Klan chapter in Vermont. \nAt one time in our history, we did. I don't want anything that is going \nto encourage them to come back.\n  Indeed, the Wall Street Journal reported last week, on April 23, \n1997: ``Voluntarism, a classic American solution to social problems, \nappears to be on the rise.'' I think we should tread kind of lightly. \nThe States seem to know what they are doing. They usually do. We should \ntread lightly before we jump in and give them a slap up alongside the \nhead and take over.\n  This bill doesn't just apply to volunteers. In fact, immunizing the \nnegligent conduct of volunteers is a small part of the bill. It also \ncreates a regime of governmental entities, nonprofit organizations and \nnot-for-profit organizations that changes the laws in our 50 States \nwhenever a claim for personal injury is based on the action of a \nvolunteer.\n  It would shield myriad organizations from being liable for damages \nfor failing to properly supervise or train or screen their volunteers.\n  Suppose you say to the volunteers, take the car and drive down and \npick somebody up. Are you screened from liability when they run over \nsomebody? If a group that works with young people fails to investigate \nreports of sexual abuse by a volunteer and several young girls or young \nboys suffer abuse, should that organization be immune from sharing the \ndamages for the trauma, suffering and psychological scars these young \nvictims would carry with them the rest of their lives? Is that really a \nFederal immunity we want to pass? If the Senate wants to immunize them \nfrom any liability to those children who might be sexually abused, \nwell, then, let us at least have a hearing on it and make that \ndetermination. I, for one, am not willing to give that immunity.\n  The House Judiciary Committee last week held a hearing on volunteer \nliability. They considered H.R. 911 as a proposal to provide exemptions \nfrom liability for volunteers, not the supervisory organizations. I do \nnot perceive the compelling need to extend liability protection beyond \nsuch volunteers as S. 543 insists. We should be encouraging, not \ndiscouraging, nonprofit organizations to properly screen and train and \nsupervise their volunteers. We ought to have fair and balanced \nlegislation on this.\n  As a lifelong Vermonter, I am proud and profoundly appreciative of \nthe thousands of volunteers in Vermont, and millions across the country \nin all our States, whose selfless acts make the world a better place \nfor all of us. The people who spend their weekends preparing dinners \nfor the homeless and the poor, the parents who organize a car wash to \nraise money for the local PTA, those filling sandbags in flood-\nthreatened areas--these kinds of acts of voluntarism are an essential \npart of the American social fabric, the kind of voluntarism I learned \nfrom my parents growing up as a boy in Montpelier, VT, as so many of \nthe rest of Americans did. Those who volunteer deserve our thanks and \nencouragement.\n  I think if we work together on this and actually have some hearings, \nwe can have broad, strong consensus of Republicans and Democrats to \ngive any needed protection and other helpful encouragement to our \nvolunteers. These really are the heroes of America. These volunteers in \nservice organizations are not asking for a free ride, for a license to \nbehave badly. In fact, I imagine many of them, if they read what is in \nhere, are going to be very offended to have any suggestion that they \nmight want something like this. But S. 543 would encourage free rides \nand licenses to behave badly. Before we needlessly cut off rights of \nvictims of harmful conduct, we ought to consider whether it is \nnecessary or it is desirable.\n  I think what we ought to do is send this bill on for its normal \nhearings in the Judiciary Committee. Lord knows, we are not doing \nanything there to get judges out, notwithstanding our 100 vacancies. We \ncould take some time to take a look at this piece of legislation. Let \nus do that, Mr. President. Let us not rush something through just \nbecause it is volunteer week. I would hate to think if next week became \norgan transplant week; we might find ourselves all being marched down \nto the Capitol physician's office to donate an organ before we had \nany--maybe then we would actually ask for a hearing if it affected us \nthat way. This affects a lot more than 100 Members of the Senate. It \naffects 260 million of our American citizens, 260 million Americans who \nhave gone to their State legislatures and assume their State \nlegislatures know what they are doing. We are saying to those 260 \nmillion Americans, ``You do not need your State legislatures. You have \nus.'' Well, I do not want us to make this decision without any kind of \na hearing.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in a moment I am going to yield to my \ndistinguished colleague from Missouri, but I want to make a couple of \ncomments regarding the remarks of the Senator from Vermont. I have long \nworked with the Senator from Vermont on issues relating to voluntarism \nin the Peace Corps when I was director. But I have to say to him that \nevoking the Ku Klux Klan is something I would not have expected from \nhim. It is demeaning. It is an inaccurate portrayal of the legislation. \nThere is regional arrogance in the context of the Senator's statement, \nand I do not appreciate it.\n  I will read to the Senator the exact sections of the bill.\n\n       Section 4(f). Exceptions to Limitations on Liability. The \n     limitations on the liability of a volunteer, nonprofit \n     organization, or governmental entity under this section shall \n     not apply to any misconduct that--\n       (1) constitutes a crime of violence (as that term is \n     defined in section 16 of title 18, United States Code) or act \n     of international terrorism (as that term is defined in \n     section 2331 of title 18) for which the defendant has been \n     convicted in any court;\n       (2) constitutes a hate crime (as that term is used in the \n     Hate Crime Statistics Act (28 U.S.C. 534 note));\n       (3) involves a sexual offense, as defined by applicable \n     State law, for which the defendant has been convicted in any \n     court;\n       (4) involves misconduct for which the defendant has been \n     found to have violated a Federal or State civil rights law; \n     or\n       (5) where the defendant was under the influence (as \n     determined pursuant to applicable State law) of intoxicating \n     alcohol or any drug at the time of the misconduct.\n\n\n[[Page S3769]]\n\n\n  I refer the Senator to:\n\n       Section 6(4) Nonprofit Organization. The term ``nonprofit \n     organization'' means--\n       (A) any organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under \n     501(a) of such code; or\n       (B) any not-for-profit organization organized and conducted \n     for public benefit and operated primarily for charitable, \n     civic, educational, religious, welfare or health purposes.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question on that point?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I do not yield just yet.\n  Mr. President, I might also say that the organizations to which the \nSenator from Vermont alluded, Little League and others, are supporting \nthis legislation before the Senate, or hope to if we can get it before \nthe Senate, if we can get it over the cloture and the filibuster that \nis being conducted by the other side. These organizations hardly \nconstitute a force in our society of evil or ill repute.\n  Mr. President, I would like to yield at this time my time to the \nSenator from Missouri.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question on my time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I do not yield at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am pleased to have this opportunity to address this \nproblem. It is a problem that challenges the capacity of individuals in \nour culture to share with each other and to help one another. The fact \nthat there are proposals that relate to this, in addition to this \nproposal, from a wide variety of perspectives, demonstrates that this \nis not an effort to address something that is not a problem.\n  Let me just give you a couple of examples of how this problem has \nmanifested itself and what are the effects. First of all, I will give \nyou some of the general effects. The Gallup organization conducted a \nsurvey entitled: ``The Liability Crisis and the Use of Volunteers of \nNonprofit Associations.'' What did the Gallup organization find? \nApproximately 1 in 10 nonprofit organizations has experienced the \nresignation of a volunteer due to liability concerns. One in six \nvolunteers was reported to have withheld services due to a fear of \nexposure to liability suits.\n\n  Now, the question is, do we need more volunteers in our culture or do \nwe need less? Our current system is stopping 18 percent of volunteers \nfrom doing some volunteer activity and resulting in 10 percent of the \norganizations having people resign from their boards of directors.\n  I might also indicate that mention has been made that some of the \nStates have provided some protection for volunteers. I find it ironic \nthat about half of all the States which provide protection do so only \nfor the guy on the board of directors or the person at the top of the \norganization setting policy. The person who is the silk stocking guy in \nthe boardroom gets protected, but the fellow out there on the field, \nthe Little League coach, is the guy against whom the big judgment is \nrendered.\n  Our question has to be, are we going to tie the hands of the person \nwho is actually going to deliver the help while we provide some cocoon \nof protection to the fellow in the boardroom? Or are we going to say to \nthe average citizen, you can afford to get involved in your community \nwithout putting your house on the line, without jeopardizing your \nchildren's college education. You can afford to help the Little League \nbecause we are not going to make it so that you will be sued when \nsomeone does not catch a fly ball. You might laugh and say, wait a \nsecond, getting sued because a child doesn't catch a fly ball? I wish \nit were not so true.\n  Let me refer you to a 1982 case, and this is one of the first cases \nthat started the run of liability cases against volunteers. In \nRunnemede, NJ, a Little League coach volunteer was sued because he \nrepositioned his Little League shortstop to the outfield, and in the \noutfield the Little League shortstop misjudged a fly ball and sustained \nan eye injury.\n  A suit was filed on the allegation that the 10-year-old youngster was \n``a born shortstop'' but not an outfielder, and the courts found the \nvolunteer coach negligent. Over the next 5 years, liability rates for \nLittle League baseball in that area went up 10 times--1,000 percent.\n  Here is another example. We are talking about real people, real folks \nwho get up in the morning early, work hard all day, sometimes take time \noff their jobs to go out and volunteer to help the kids of America, \nsome of the kids without moms or dads or who do not have time to help \nchildren, kids who need positive role models, and here is what we do to \nthem. A boy in a scouting unit with the Boy Scouts of the Cascade \nPacific Council--a national problem, Runnemede, NJ, on the one side of \nthe country, Cascade Pacific Council on the other side. A Boy Scout \nsuffers a paralyzing injury while playing in a touch football game. I \nremember being a Boy Scout. Touch football was as mild as the \nsupervisors could possibly make it. We wanted to play tackle football \nor flag football, but touch football was a part of the curriculum we \nhad to play.\n  A boy gets injured. What in the world happens when the volunteers are \nfound personally liable for $7 million? What would a $7 million \njudgment do to your capacity to send your kids to college if you were \nthe volunteer? What would it do to your capacity to have the kind of \nlife you wanted? We are not making it difficult for volunteers; in many \ninstances, we are saying to them, you cannot volunteer.\n  Frankly, this is not something any of us intend. This is not a \npartisan issue. This is an issue of compassion. It is an issue about \nthe character of America. When Alexis de Tocqueville came to America--\nand they are having a wonderful series on de Tocqueville on C-SPAN; \nthey are following his steps that he took across America 150 years \nago--he talked about the greatness of this country, and he said \ngreatness in America is not governmental. Greatness is not a matter of \nthe law of this country. It is a matter of the people of this country. \nAmerica is great because the people are good. But that was at a time \nwhen there was such a thing known as charitable immunity, when \ncharities were simply held totally immune, so that if people were going \nto charities to get help, they got what help they could, and if a \nmistake was made or an injury, that is the way it was.\n  Now, we are not asking that it be restored to that condition. But we \nare saying that, when a volunteer, someone who is giving of her time or \nof his time, when they are giving that time generously and they are \ntrying to help the Boy Scouts, they should not end up with a $7 million \njudgment.\n  I should add a correction. In that case, the judgment was reduced to \n$4 million by the courts. That would have been a great comfort to me \nand my family. We would not come any closer to paying a $4 million \njudgment than we would a $7 million judgment. The system, though, \nrewards those who try to help the youngsters with that kind of legal \nliability. The system is broken in that respect. If we want America to \nbe great, it will be not because we have a governmental program that \nwill fix everything. But we, at least, need to release the energy \navailable in the American culture that comes from volunteers.\n  I indicate, as well, that the bill, which is being filibustered by \nthe other side, is not a bill that relieves organizations of all their \nresponsibility. This is a bill that relieves the volunteer of \nresponsibility for economic damages that are suffered by individuals \nwho are injured through simple negligence. Economic damages still can \nbe recovered against the organization, but the fellow who works all day \nand works hard to keep his family together and sometimes takes a little \ntime away from his family to help the rest of the world should not find \nhimself looking down the barrel of a $4 million judgment because he has \nbeen a good Scout leader. And unfortunately that has happened too \nfrequently.\n  Here is another example. From the Richmond Times-Dispatch, November \n4, 1995. A Red Cross volunteer in Virginia ``was driving a woman to a \nmedical facility for routine care.'' I have volunteered for the Red \nCross, done Meals on Wheels and things like that. ``The Red Cross-owned \ncar was involved in a collision and the passenger was injured. She \nlater died from causes unrelated to the crash. But the administrator of \nthe woman's estate sought judgment against the volunteer and alleged \nthat he negligently operated the vehicle.''\n\n[[Page S3770]]\n\n  We should not have people being hauled into court on things like \nthat. The fact is that these volunteers are being asked to defend \nthemselves.\n  Here is an interesting fact from the Washington Times, a May 2, 1995, \narticle.\n  ``A Legal System That Fails the Test of Charity,'' was the headline. \n``A Washington, DC, area Girl Scout council reports that it must sell \n87,000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies each year just to pay for liability \ninsurance.'' The first 87,000 boxes of cookies do not provide any help \nto any girls, do not provide any assistance, do not provide any of the \nreinforcement that these kids, without many of the benefits that you \nand I enjoyed as children, need. The first 87,000 boxes of cookies have \nto go to carry the liability insurance.\n  ``We have no diving boards at our camps,'' the executive director \nsaid. ``We will never own horses. And, many local schools will no \nlonger provide meeting space for our volunteers,'' because of the \nliability crisis as it relates to volunteers.\n  Here is an interesting item from the Washington Times, May 1995. ``A \nLegal System That Fails the Test of Charity,'' again.\n\n       The Junior League in Evanston, IL, discovered a few years \n     ago that, to set up a shelter for battered women, they would \n     have had to go without liability insurance for three years. \n     No directors would serve under these conditions, and the \n     plans for the shelter were shelved.\n\n  We need people to drive people to the hospital for the Red Cross. We \nneed the Junior League to help sponsor shelters for battered women. We \nneed Boy Scout volunteers that will not operate under the threat of $4 \nmillion judgments against them and the assets of their families. We \nneed Little League volunteers who have the ability to ask the kid to \nplay left field instead of shortstop, in spite of the claims of the \nchild's parents that the child is a born shortstop and not an \noutfielder.\n\n  We simply have to create an environment in this country where we do \nnot rely on the Government for everything. And, in that context, we \nhave to free up the energy of the goodness of the American people and \nnot ask them to operate under the threat of judgments that would \ndeprive them of their homes, their families' well-being, and their \ncapacity to send their children to college.\n  Americans are sacrificial people. They are willing to give you the \nproverbial shirts off their backs. But we should not make it a \nsituation where, if they give you the shirt and you do not like the \nshirt, you can sue them and take their house and deprive their kids of \nan opportunity to go to college. That is too much. It is too much to \nask of these generous volunteers. And our system of Government simply \nneeds to provide a little protection, a framework in which people can \noperate in decency and can beneficially extend themselves, one to \nanother. The idea that somehow America is automatically good and the \nGovernment can handle all this stuff is a bankrupt concept. We \nunderstood that in the debate last year over welfare reform. We saw the \nkind of miserable response that has come from this culture to welfare. \nWe were intensifying problems. The problem was growing rather than \nslowing.\n  If anything is going to help us recover, it will be our understanding \nthat we can help each other. But we will have a hard time helping each \nother if we make it a condition of volunteering that you put your \nfamily's well-being on the line and you look down the barrel of that $4 \nmillion cannon every time you want to go and help a few Boy Scouts. \nThat is why I think it is so important to have a discussion of these \nissues and to act on these issues. It is high time we do so. It is a \nmatter in discussion in this country and has been a matter of public \ndebate. This is not a surprise.\n  There are bills on the issue of voluntarism in both the House and \nSenate. Frankly, S. 543, Senator Coverdell's legislation, is \noutstanding legislation designed to relieve the volunteer of liability. \nThis bill does not relieve organizations of liability for economic \ndamages. I find it troublesome to have it suggested that this bill is \ndesigned in some way to relieve the Ku Klux Klan from consequences \nagainst the organization for criminal acts, or acts that would somehow \ndisparage the civil rights or dignity of Americans. It is simply not \nso.\n  I wonder if there are not any good arguments against this legislation \nwhen the only arguments that come up against it are arguments which do \nnot hold water and which are designed to go to the most base emotions \nwithin us.\n  When we are talking about making it possible for Americans to help \nother Americans, it is particularly troublesome that in order to \ndisrupt this discussion we try to talk about Americans hating other \nAmericans. We should be careful never to do anything to promote hate. \nIt would be a terrible thing if we allowed those who suggested that we \nwere doing that to impair our ability to provide a framework in which \npeople could promote love and care and concern. One of the real values \nof volunteer activity is what it communicates. When you get something \nfrom the Government you do it because you are entitled to it, so you \ntake it. But when you get something from your neighbor you know that he \nor she cares for you and loves you. And that mutual sense of concern is \nwhat builds community. It is what binds us together; it is not what \ntears us apart. We are talking about providing a context for people to \ndemonstrate a sense of community.\n  Two hundred years ago John Donne said it as eloquently as anyone has \never said it in his sonnet, on the fact that no man is an island. He \nsaid, ``No man is an island.'' He started out saying we are all in this \nthing together. We are not by ourselves. And he ends his sonnet:\n\n       . . . never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls \n     for thee.\n\n  And, in America, we have that sense. It is unique to America. It is \nwhat makes America what she is and what she will be in the future. And \nit is not that we want to try to promote organizations that would teach \nus to hate one another. This bill is designed and crafted and drafted \nto promote opportunities for people who want to demonstrate that they \ncare for each other and respect one another.\n\n  The hyperlitigious nature of our civil justice system is creating a \nbarrier, though, between the desire of Americans to help others and \ntheir ability to do so. It is empirically established. The data is \nthere: The resignations from the boards of directors; the reluctance of \nvolunteers to do what they wanted to volunteer to do; one out of six \nvolunteers say they withhold services; the absence of programs that can \nno longer be offered; the program for battered women in Evanston that \nthe Junior League wanted to have. You do not have diving boards at the \ncamp. You do not have horses at the camp.\n  We must free this energy in America, this impetus that says I love \nyou and I care for you and I would like to be active in helping you but \nI cannot afford to risk everything I own and have, and my children's \neducation, to do so. I would like for that desire to be fostered and \nlifted up, and we ought to fan that ember of hope for America and we \nshould not douse it.\n  So I believe we need the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997. I am proud \nto join as a cosponsor of this legislation. It will reinstate reason. \nIt will reinstate rationality. It will reinstate certainty and fairness \nin a judicial system with regard to voluntarism. And I am grateful for \nthat. The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 covers nonprofit \norganizations which are defined as those organizations having a \n501(c)(3) status, or nonprofit entities that are organized and \nconducted for public benefit and operated primarily for charitable, \ncivic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes. And, if any \norganization is involved in criminal activity, any protection for the \nvolunteer in that endeavor is gone.\n  The volunteers are relieved of liability for simple acts of \nnegligence, but it does not relieve the volunteer organization from \nliability for economic damages. This bill establishes a standard for \npunitive damages so there could not be outrageous levels of damages \nwithout high standards of proof. And it eliminates joint and several \nliability for noneconomic damages. Economic damages are those that you \nactually have in a monetary sense: The hospital bills, the lost wages \nand the like. In those settings, there is no limitation on the ability \nof an injured individual to go against the organization.\n  This bill does say that the volunteer should not be held responsible \nunless\n\n[[Page S3771]]\n\nshe engages in criminal activity or acted in a willful and wanton way. \nAnd if that is the case, the volunteer is not protected at all, because \nwe are not interested in protecting willful or wanton activity or \ncriminal activity. We are trying to allow people to say to their \ncommunities and to their fellow citizens that we care enough to love \nyou and to share ourselves with you but we do not think we ought to \nhave to risk the entirety of our family or the well-being of our family \nto do so.\n  With that in mind, I am pleased to support this legislation. I think, \nwhen the President of the United States asks us to engage in \nvolunteering, he calls us to the very best that is in us. He calls us \nto the character of America, to rekindle a spirit of community which \ncould be lost. He needs to call us, though, in a context which makes \nour response reasonable and possible. Simply, we are trying to develop \na framework for reasonable participation by volunteers, protecting them \nand their families from a litigious system which has found Scout \nleaders saddled with $4 million judgments because of a touch football \ngame; which has found a Little League coach staring down the barrel of \njudgments because he shifted a boy from shortstop to left field; which \nhas found people in court because they were good enough to drive a sick \ncitizen in their community to the hospital.\n  I do not think that is the kind of community in which we want to \nlive. We want to live in a place that puts reasonable limits on the \nexposure and risk to people who are actually giving of themselves so \nthey can afford to extend their charity to others without destroying \nthe future of their own families.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, could I inquire as to the time \nremaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 39 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Vermont has 51 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that it be equally charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to the comments of my \nfriends and colleagues on the other side. I wish to recount for the \nbody parts of a conversation I had with the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia, my good friend, Mr. Coverdell, during the time when the other \nSenator was speaking.\n  I had the pleasure of working with Senator Coverdell when he was in a \nposition where he had to go not only around this country, but around \nthe world seeking volunteers and help in some of the most important \naspects of life. So I do not question his commitment to voluntarism. He \nhas lived it and done it.\n  My concern, as I expressed to the distinguished Senator from Georgia, \nis that this bill came to the floor immediately in this fashion with no \nhearings. I should note for the Record, so there will be no confusion \non that, that this is not the decision of the Senator from Georgia or \nthe decision of the Senator from Vermont as to when the bill would come \nto the floor. That has to be done by the Republican leadership, and I \nhave expressed my concern to the Republican leadership in the past, and \nwill again in the future, that bills cannot come to the floor in that \nfashion, bills with significant repercussions, with no hearings.\n  Frankly, I took exactly the same position during the times I served \nhere when the Democrats were in the majority and would determine what \nbills would come on the floor. I have been very consistent throughout \nmy career in the Senate. If you have a significant matter, something \nthat is going to affect all of us, take time to discuss it before it \ncomes to the floor. We pass resolutions and sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions all the time that say, ``on the one hand'' this, ``on the \nother hand'' that, ``God bless America.'' Those can move through \nquickly. But this is a bill, at least the analysis that I have of it \nand the analysis of totally nonpartisan lawyers who have discussed it \nwith me, which would, in effect, replace State laws.\n  I think that the 50 States of the United States should expect no less \nof the U.S. Senate. If we are going to fetch them a smack up alongside \nthe head and knock their legislative work in the trash can, we ought to \nat least have a hearing about it and discuss what is involved in it.\n  I am perfectly willing to work with the Senator from Georgia and \nothers--as he knows we have worked together on so many issues in the \npast--on a voluntarism bill, on the question, as I did and others did, \nwith former President Bush on volunteers, but in the normal course of \nevents, with discussion. I hope we will not proceed to this bill today, \nnot to kill the bill, not to kill the act, but to send it back, to at \nleast go through the normal process where we actually have hearings.\n  I have discussed the Ku Klux Klan and others. The Ku Klux Klan has \nhad what I think is a vicious and long history in most States. It did \nin my State of Vermont during the time my parents were younger, and \nthey saw directly the effect of the hate of the Ku Klux Klan. The \nchurch where my parents were married and where they were buried--one of \nthem just a year from this coming Monday--the church where I was \nbaptized had the cross of the Ku Klux Klan burned on its front steps. \nSo I know the sense that they have, the sense that my mother of an \nimmigrant family recounted to me of how she felt about that, the fear \nthat was driven in to people who spoke a different language, as my \nmother and her family did, who practiced a religion very much in the \nminority in Vermont at that time.\n  None of us in this body, Republican or Democrat, wants to encourage \nin any way racism or the kind of things that the Ku Klux Klan and many \nother organizations similar throughout this country stand for. There \nare exceptions on limits and liabilities, those who have been found to \nviolate Federal and States civil rights laws, and so on.\n  It is still too broad. If the Ku Klux Klan marches down a street \ncarrying signs, they are not going to be convicted of international \nterrorism or a hate crime on that, but under the definition in here, \nthey may still well qualify, under their definition, which is under \nsection 6(4)(B):\n\n       . . . any not-for-profit organization organized and \n     conducted for public benefit and operated primarily for \n     charitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health \n     purposes.\n\n  Because it does not state who is making these kinds of \ndeterminations.\n  Again, Mr. President, let me make it very clear what my concerns are \nabout this bill. One, it is a major piece of legislation that is on the \nfloor with no hearings, none whatsoever. I understand it is the \nmajority leader who makes that determination, not the Senator from \nGeorgia who was called to be here on the floor and discuss this matter. \nBut we should not have that procedure. We did it once on a major piece \nof legislation, raising actually worldwide implications on terrorism, a \nweek ago with a bill, a huge bill that everybody voted on, either for \nor against. I doubt there were three Senators who could honestly say \nwhen they walked off the floor of the Senate that they had read the \nbill, because it was presented to us hours, some of us minutes, before \nwe voted on it. But it affected everything from our international \nrelations to our use of antiterrorism legislation, major criminal \ncodes, treaties and everything else--a very thick bill--and we voted on \nit. I voted against it because it raised enough of a red flag, even \nthough there were parts of the bill that were verbatim from parts of \nlegislation I had written.\n\n  I suppose imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but not when \nit is slapped together and handed to you to vote on matters that have \nmajor implications, and we whip it through. In fact, I encouraged the \npress actually to ask Senators who voted on it if they either read it \nor knew what was in it. To my knowledge, nobody was asked that \nquestion. It would have been interesting to hear the answers, because \nwe all knew the answer. Nobody had.\n  Now we have a similar piece of legislation brought up, hurried, no \nhearings, and pass it, even though it is\n\n[[Page S3772]]\n\ngoing to override the efforts of our State legislatures. I have heard \nso many speeches given about ``give the power back to the States; let \nthe States make the decisions. So much wisdom resides in the States.'' \nWhy do we say we are the ones who know what is best for the States? Why \nnot let the State legislatures have the ability to make some of these \ndecisions? And then when we are given that chance, we say, ``Not you, \nnot you, State legislature, not this particular one.'' Actually, this \nother one, this other one, this other one--actually, not any of the 50 \nlegislatures are smart enough to do the work that the U.S. Senate can \ndo without hearings, without debates and without any kind of a markup \non a piece of legislation on the day we come back to work.\n  Well, Mr. President, those who vote to go forward with this bill, I \nask this question of them; maybe their State legislatures, maybe their \nState press could ask this question: Of those who vote to go forward \nwith this, are you willing to go back to your State legislature and say \nthat on a piece of legislation that overrides their work, you are \nwilling to vote to do that, even though there have been no hearings on \nthis bill, even though there has been no debate in committee, even \nthough there is no report saying what it does? You are willing to on an \nact of faith, because the Republican leadership said we have to do this \nthis week, because we have nothing else to do, you are willing to \noverride the efforts of your State legislature? I wonder how many \nSenators are willing to go back home and say that. I am not. I have too \nmuch respect for the Vermont Legislature to do that. I think our \ngeneral assembly can make this determination.\n  So I encourage my friend from Georgia, and others, maybe we can sit \ndown together and try to put together a good piece of legislation, as \nthe Congressman from Illinois, Mr. Porter, has done in the other body, \nto find a way to do this without trampling on our States.\n  I understand there is some concern in the Republican leadership \nknowing that all Americans had to file their taxes on April 15 because \nthe law requires it, but the Republican leadership in the House and the \nSenate did not bring forth a budget on April 15, as the law also \nrequires. Maybe we should talk about other things, and with the \nsterling example of the President and Mrs. Clinton, of President and \nMrs. Bush, of President and Mrs. Carter or President Ford or Mrs. \nReagan and others, General Powell, who went to Philadelphia, why not \njust jump on this bandwagon because, politically, who can be against \nsome idea of protecting volunteers? That is not the issue.\n  The issue is, do we draw it so broadly that we bring in organizations \nlike the Ku Klux Klan that every single one of us in this body oppose? \nDo we draw it so broadly that we just knock down our State legislatures \nand say, ``You're immaterial because we 100 Members of the Senate, in \nour collective wisdom, know a lot more than you do?'' Do we draw it so \nbroadly that we do not think of the rights of all individuals, not just \na volunteer organization, but the rights of all individuals? Do we give \nblanket immunity to organizations we do not intend to, like hospitals \nand others?\n  These are questions that should be asked if we have a hearing, but \nthese are the questions that will never be answered if we continue with \nwhat I find a very, very disturbing trend in this country to rush major \npieces of legislation to the floor with no hearings, no debate and then \njust ask us to vote on it, especially when we do not have time to \nfulfill the backlog in the Senate Judiciary on judges. Chief Justice \nRehnquist said we have a real crisis because we have about 100 \nvacancies in the Federal courts, and yet we have only filled two of \nthose in 4 months.\n\n  We have taken several vacations, but we have not had time to fill \nmore than two. We have almost a zero population growth in the Federal \njudiciary. We have not found time to have a minute of debate on the \nbudget, even though the law requires it by April 15. We have a number \nof other Cabinet officials, from Alexis Herman on, to be blocked. But \nsuddenly we have time to rush forward something that just slaps down \nour 50 State legislatures, tells them they do not know enough, \ncertainly do not know as much as we do. And we are rushing through with \nno hearings and no debate. I think we should find a better way to do \nit.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum. I am sorry, I see the Senator from \nGeorgia on his feet. I did not realize that. I reserve the remainder of \nmy time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I am going to yield in a moment up to 10 minutes to \nthe Senator from Alabama, but I would just make two or three very quick \npoints.\n  No. 1, I believe the issues before us have been thoroughly debated \nover the last decade. This is not a piece of new legislation. No one in \nthis body is surprised by any of the language in it.\n  No. 2, this language preempts the assertion that the other side has \nmade that it would have protections for an organization like the Ku \nKlux Klan. That is just not so, as has been stated by myself and the \nSenator from Missouri.\n  No. 3, yes, it is an adjunct to the summit in Philadelphia. Here we \nhad a bipartisan expression of Republican and Democrat Presidents \ncalling on America to reinforce voluntarism, and it is an appropriate \nresponse. Yes, this is linked to that summit. It would be highly \nappropriate to respond aggressively to freeing up the American \nvolunteer from a cloud hanging over his or her head.\n  Mr. President, I now yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I take the floor today to offer my support as a cosponsor of S. 543, \nthe Volunteer Protection Act of 1997.\n  As this week's volunteer summit clearly shows, there is a need \nthroughout America for the kinds of services that are offered by \nselfless volunteers who are applying their time, their skills, and \ntheir labor toward bettering the lives of others.\n  Regrettably, however, the fear of lawsuits has become so pervasive \nthat many people fail to follow through on their charitable impulses, \nor the charities themselves decide not to take on activities because of \nthe fear of litigation. The legislation being discussed today will go a \nlong way toward removing this artificial barrier to individual service.\n  I would also like to congratulate the drafters of the bill, Senator \nCoverdell in particular, for recognizing the need to take this \ncorrective action. In my own experience as a member of various boards \nand commissions for charitable organizations, I have witnessed \nfirsthand the difficulties these organizations face in recruiting \nvolunteers to undertake worthwhile activities. Fear of lawsuits is one \nof these reasons.\n  I remind my colleagues that there was a time in American tort law \nwhen the doctrine of charitable immunity would have isolated many of \nthe individuals subjected to lawsuits today from this type of \nliability. This doctrine was based in large part on the public policy \npremise that a society is bettered in the long run not by creating \nbarriers to volunteer activity but, instead, by encouraging volunteer \naction. In recent years, this fundamental policy principle has been \nundermined.\n  I think it is time for this body to begin to address this problem. \nFew people will deny the need for unpaid, selfless volunteers in our \nsociety. These highly motivated individuals often will tackle problems \nthat would have been impractical for anyone else, including the \nGovernment, to take on. In its purest form, every individual action \ntaken by a volunteer in one area allows scarce resources to be used \nsomewhere else. The efficient use of volunteers allows us to have more \nbang for our charitable buck.\n  These efficiencies and cost savings are being undermined, however, in \nhigher insurance premiums and legal fees. Senators Abraham, Coverdell, \nand McConnell pointed out this fact recently in a newspaper article. In \ntheir article they cite the example of a Little League baseball league \nthat had its liability premiums go from $75 to $795 in just 5 years.\n  I have been involved in Little League baseball. My son has played, \nand I have\n\n[[Page S3773]]\n\ncoached. I know how hard those individuals work to sell hamburgers and \nhot dogs and peanuts to make money to buy ball caps and uniforms. These \nkinds of insurance rates are really detrimental to the public spirit in \nAmerica--and the rate increases are driven by lawsuits.\n  I believe that this bill will strengthen the role of both volunteers \nand nonprofit organizations. It restores common sense to the way our \ncourts treat volunteers by protecting them from tort liability for \nsimple acts of negligence. It also retains penalties for egregious \nactivities such as sexual abuse and hate crimes and civil rights \nviolations. Individuals who commit these kinds of acts will still be \nsubject to lawsuits.\n  It will not protect people who have done acts under the influence of \ndrugs or alcohol, so that volunteers who commit illegal acts or \nimproper acts under the influence of alcohol will still be liable. And, \nalthough the individual volunteer may not be liable for compensatory \ndamages, the organizations who are utilizing the volunteer's services \nwould remain liabile to compensate injured parties who have been \nwronged.\n  I support this bill's limitation on punitive damages. Under this bill \npunitive damages may not be awarded unless a claimant demonstrates \nthrough clear and convincing evidence--it is not impossible evidence; \njust clear and convincing evidence--that the harm arising from the \nactions of a volunteer was the result of conduct that was either \nwillful or criminal in nature or that showed a genuine indifference to \nthe safety of others.\n  By raising the legal bar for the award of punitive damages, we will \naccomplish two goals. We will help ensure that only the conduct that \ntruly deserves such a penalty will be punished and we will reduce the \namount of punitive damages awarded, thereby freeing up resources to be \nused for more productive purposes.\n  The bill's elimination of joint and several liability for noneconomic \nlosses, such as pain and suffering, will advance these goals as well.\n  Let me say this, Mr. President. There has been a suggestion that the \nKu Klux Klan would be covered under this bill. I do not believe that is \ncorrect. I do not believe the Klan would be covered by the definition \nof a charitable organization under this bill. I certainly would not \nwant it to be covered. But in any case, in any circumstance, actions \nthat are willful and unlawful would remain, under this bill, subject to \nlawsuits and punitive damages.\n  I had the opportunity, as U.S. attorney, to be involved in \nprosecuting a number of Klan members for an illegal action. It resulted \nin the death of a young black man for no other reason than because of \nhis race. One of those individuals is serving life without parole and \nanother one is on death row today. As U.S. attorney, just last year, \nthat death sentence was upheld by the Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals. I expect, as months go by, that he will be brought forward to \nexecution, as he should be.\n  Arising out of that case, under the leadership of one of America's \nmost capable lawyers, Morris Dees, a civil lawsuit was filed against \nthe Klan. It resulted in the winning of that lawsuit because of the \nKlan's policies that encouraged violence. That organization itself was \nheld responsible for the criminal actions of its members. As a result \nof that action, the Klan headquarters was forfeited and sold for the \nbenefit of the family that suffered death in that case.\n  I will just say this, Mr. President. That lawsuit would not be \nprohibited by this bill, because it was illegal and a part of a hate \ncrime. The activities that gave rise to that lawsuit are exempted from \nthe protections offered by this bill. Those kinds of lawsuits would \ncontinue. It is disturbing to me to see individuals take this floor and \nsuggest that a bill designed to protect people's charitable impulses, \nto allow them to participate freely in helping other people without \nfear of being sued, that that would somehow be a bill designed to \nprotect that despicable organization, the Ku Klux Klan. I think that it \nis unfortunate that that suggestion has been made. It is not true and \nis not a legitimate basis to object to this bill.\n\n  Finally, I support the bill's respect for federalism. The inclusion \nof the State opt-out provision in this bill recognizes the role of \nindividual States in setting the statutory boundaries of their own tort \nlaws when citizens of the same State are the only parties to an action. \nStates can opt out of this if they choose. It does not mandate that \nthey concur in these activities.\n  So again, I would like to encourage my colleagues to support this \nbill. It is good legislation which will serve to reinvigorate the \nvolunteer spirit that has been a traditional component of the American \ncharacter.\n  There have been a number of shows and studies and reports done on \nAlexis de Tocqueville and his travels throughout America. One of the \nthings he was most struck by was the volunteer community spirit of \nAmerica. That is a good spirit. The President, former President Bush, \nGen. Colin Powell, and others recognized that just this weekend. We \nneed to make sure that the laws of this country are supportive and \nconducive to the volunteer spirit. I think we have lost some of that \nprotection. It needs to be restored.\n  I congratulate Senators Coverdell, Abraham, and McConnell for their \nefforts. I look forward to having the opportunity to vote for this \nbill's final passage.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I want to thank the Senator from Alabama for his \noutstanding remarks, and I appreciate his support of the measure, \nparticularly in light of his experience. I commend him for his \ninvolvement in this important concept to help promote volunteering and \nto help foster and encourage the better impulses we have to help each \nother. That is what this bill is about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My understanding is there are 36 minutes left on the time \ncontrolled by Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nallocated as follows: That I be allowed to speak for 14 minutes; the \nSenator from the State of Washington, Senator Murray, for 14 minutes; \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, for 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/29/senate-section/article/S3763-5", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3773-S3774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE DISASTER IN THE NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today once again to \ntalk about the disaster that has occurred in the northern Great Plains, \nspecifically South Dakota, Minnesota, and North Dakota, and to talk \njust a bit about the need for us to proceed with a disaster \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, this poster is of a North Dakota farmer standing in \nfront of a 20-foot snowbank. This happens to be level ground. You could \nnot tell that much by what the poster looks like. Three years of snow \nfalling in 3 months in North Dakota, capped by the worst blizzard in 50 \nyears, which in many parts of the State added 2 more feet of snow. That \ncreated a set of conditions that resulted in the disastrous flooding \nthat now occurs.\n  This is a farmer standing in his yard, backgrounded by a 20-foot \nsnowbank. Unless you are there and have seen it, have seen the 40- and \n50-mile-an-hour winds with 60 and 80 below windchills that have created \nthis kind of situation, you really do not understand how it results in \nthis. This is the Wahpeton-Breckenridge area, right on the border of \nthe Red River. You will see the downtown area, and you will see that \nthe downtown is completely under water.\n  This is a picture just north of Fargo, ND, which gives a sense that \nin an area as flat as a table top, the Red River Valley, the flood \nwaters expanded to cover virtually everything. This little city of \nHarwood built a ring dike, and you will see that this tiny town of \nHarwood is not inundated, but you will see the rest of the Red River \nValley is flooded. As the rivers course through Fargo, first Wahpeton, \nthen Fargo, and on up to Grand Forks, you see now a picture of downtown \nGrand Forks, ND,\n\n[[Page S3774]]\n\nwith a fireman up to his waist in water. This is a downtown street. He \nis fighting a fire that consumed an entire city block. Firefighters, \nexperiencing hypothermia, in ice-cold sewage-infested water--because \nthe sewers backed up throughout the city, and the system collapsed--\nwere trying to fight a fire without equipment. A firemen named Randy \nsaid, ``Normally, when we fight a fire, water is our ally. In this \ncase, we did not have water to pump.'' They tried to fight fires in \nmultistory buildings, standing up to their waist in water in some \ncases, with fire extinguishers. What a valiant and heroric effort they \nmade. But of course this city was inundated.\n  I and some others have been in the downtown area of this city in a \nboat. One boat I was in, operated by the Coast Guard, ran into a car--\nran over the hood of the car. The only thing you could see of the car \nwas 2 inches of the radio antenna sticking above the water. That is how \nwe knew the boat hit a car on a downtown street so deep with the water.\n  The reason I come to the floor to show you these pictures and to tell \nyou about the people of my region is that it is important, as we have \ndone in every other disaster--earthquakes, floods, fire, and \ntornadoes--to extend a helping hand by the American people to this \nregion to say we know what is happening to you and we want to help you. \nYou are not alone. The rest of the country extends a helping hand to \ntry to help you through this crisis.\n  It is not about buildings and snowbanks. It is about little boys, \nabout grandpas and grandmas, about wage earners, working couples. A \nlittle boy, 7 years old, sitting in front of an airplane hangar at the \nGrand Forks Air Force Base, lost his home, and was looking at the \nground dejected when I came to him and visited the shelter where \nthousands of people had been evacuated. The little boy knew his home \nwas under water and he had nowhere to go. Not much hope. Eyes filled \nwith tears. An older woman named Vi, a wonderful woman, a wonderful \nwoman, on the phone when I met her, calling FEMA for help. Her eyes \nwere filled with tears talking about what she had lost. So many others \nwho have lost so much. Everything they have built, everything they have \ninvested in, everything they have saved, inundated and devastated by a \nflood that came and stayed.\n  This region is just now finally beginning to start thinking about \nrebuilding. I was on the phone half an hour ago with a fellow who just \ngot into his home and is pumping out his basement and trying to assess \nthe damage.\n  Now, we have an opportunity in this Congress to pass a bill called a \ndisaster supplemental appropriations bill. We have done that in the \npast. I, from North Dakota, have been pleased to vote for and support \ndisaster supplemental appropriations for people who have been victims \nof earthquakes, floods, fires and tornadoes across this country because \nI think we need to say to them, ``We offer hope, we want to help.''\n  Let me say, as the Appropriations Committee begins this process, I am \nenormously grateful for the chairman and the ranking member of that \ncommittee, Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd, and so many other members \nof the committee who have worked diligently on this issue and worked \nwith us and cooperated in a manner that one can only hope for. Thanks \nto them, thanks for the wonderful work they have done in order to put \ntogether a supplemental appropriations bill. We need to do much more \nbecause we do not know the entire extent of the damages. In the coming \ndays, we will continue to work to do much more, to add money for the \ncommunity development block grants, EDA and others, so we continue to \nappreciate very much the cooperation of the chairman and the ranking \nmembers and others on a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. President, I am worried now because we were told this morning \nthat there are some who want to add four very controversial amendments \nhaving nothing at all to do with floods, fires, winter storms, and \ndisaster. They want to add four very controversial amendments to this \ndisaster supplemental bill. When President Clinton came to North Dakota \nlast week, one of the things he said is, ``Let us pass a disaster \nsupplemental bill, let the Federal Government extend a helping hand, \nand let us make sure that no one in Congress is tempted to add \nextraneous or unrelated amendments that would hold it up.'' Well, I \nworry now, because what we were told this morning is that there are \nthose who want to add four amendments, all very controversial, all of \nthem or any of which could trip up this bill. Those people, with tears \nin their eyes but hope in their hearts because they feel that we are \ngoing to extend a helping hand, do not, do not, do not deserve to have \nanyone meddle with this kind of legislation.\n  Let us, all of us, decide when disaster strikes, when tragedy visits \nany region of this country, any group of Americans, that we must rise \nas one to say, ``Let us help. You are not alone. Let us be there with \nyou.'' That is what this bill is.\n\n  Again, I started by saying I so much appreciate the cooperation of \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, the \nranking member, Senator Byrd, and so many others, especially the staff \nand others, who worked so hard on this kind of legislation. Our job now \nis to get it up, out, and moving and get it to the President and get it \nsigned and get the help moving to these folks in this region of the \ncountry to say to them, ``We want to help you rebuild. We want to help \nin your recovery. We want to help you rebuild your dreams, your hopes. \nWe want to help your family recover.'' That is our responsibility. That \nis our requirement. Let us not, any of us, let us not be tempted to \ndecide that this is an opportunity to meddle with some kind of \namendment that has nothing to do, at all, with disaster and tragedy.\n  I, today, call on all of my colleagues, each and every one of my \ncolleagues, to decide this disaster supplemental bill ought to be \npassed, we ought to pass it soon, and we ought to get it signed into \nlaw to offer help and hope to those people who have suffered so much. \nIf there are those who have other agendas, there is time, plenty of \ntime, to address those agendas--the next day, next week, the next \nmonth. There is plenty of opportunity to bring any idea, any amendment, \nany agenda they have, to the floor of the Senate. But do not load this \nsupplemental appropriations bill with extraneous and unrelated \ncontroversial amendments that will either stop or slow down the help \nthat we intend to send on the way to the victims of this disaster.\n  I hope in these coming hours, as we talk through the issues that were \ndiscussed this morning, proposed amendments to the supplemental \nappropriations bill, I hope that all of us in this Chamber will come to \nthe same result: Passing a disaster appropriations bill, a supplemental \nbill, to respond to this disaster is critically important. It ought to \nbe done and done now, without anyone in this Chamber using it as an \nopportunity to advance an agenda that has nothing to do with the \ndisaster supplemental bill. I call on my colleagues for that level of \ncooperation. I thank all of them for their help. The people I represent \nin this region of the country will be enormously grateful for what this \nCongress will do in extending a helping hand to people who have \nsuffered so much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/29/senate-section/article/S3773-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3774-S3776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WASHINGTON STATE AND CHINA\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue of tremendous \nimportance to Washington State and the Nation. The issue is China and \nspecifically, my trip to both Hong Kong and Beijing over the recent \nEaster recess.\n  My trip to Hong Kong and China was an opportunity for me to discuss \ncandidly the issues to be confronted by the United States Senate; most-\nfavored-nation trade status for China, the World Trade Organization, \nHong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty, the trade imbalance \nbetween the United States and China, my personal concerns on human \nrights, and numerous other issues.\n  Additionally, I took this trip intent on raising the profile of \nWashington State in both Hong Kong and China. In the early 1950's, \nSenator Warren Magnusson of the State of Washington whose seat I now \noccupy was the first United States Senator to promote closer ties \nbetween the United States and China.\n\n[[Page S3775]]\n\n  Since that time, Washington State has led the way in advancing United \nStates-China relations for both the American and Chinese people. No \nother State in the country is as engaged and involved in China as my \nState. We have strong trade and cultural ties to China and indeed to \nall of Asia.\n  Washington State's involvement in China is much deeper than trade and \neconomics; educators and students, lawyers and judges, adoptive \nfamilies, religious organizations, military personnel, and many others \nin my State have relationships across the Pacific with counterparts in \nChina.\n  Several Washington cities including Tacoma, Seattle, Kent, and \nSpokane all have growing sister city relationships with cities or \ncounties in China. Washingtonians are going to great lengths to foster \nchange in China; participating in local elections, providing resources \nto counter cultural biases against young girls, and working with the \nChinese to create a commercial and a civil legal system for that \ncountry.\n  A diverse group of Washington State interests traveled with me to \nChina at their own expense. This group included representatives from \nagriculture, aviation, high technology, retail, financial services, \nheavy machinery, and ports.\n  In Hong Kong, we met with officials from the United States Consulate, \nthe American Chamber of Commerce, the Hong Kong Government and others. \nOn the street and in official meetings, I sought to determine the mood \nof the people of this British Colony as it speeds toward its new status \nas a Special Administrative Region of China.\n  Certainly there are concerns about the transition; concerns that we \nrequire the careful oversight of the United States and others who care \nabout the Hong Kong way of life. I also found much optimism among Hong \nKong's people and its leaders; a certain confidence that the people of \nHong Kong will take it upon themselves to preserve the prosperous and \nbeautiful enclave that they created from barren rock and the \nsurrounding waters.\n  I particularly enjoyed a meeting with Ms. Sophie Leung, an appointed \nmember of the Provisional Legislature that will replace the current \nLegislative Council following the transition. Though I question China's \ndecision to replace the current democratically elected legislature, I \nwas heartened by Ms. Leung's passion for Hong Kong, her background as a \ncivic activist, and her intention to support and participate in \nupcoming direct elections. Ms. Leung is also a part-time resident of \nWashington State. Interestingly, a number of the leaders selected to \ngovern Hong Kong following the transition are actually American \ncitizens.\n  Like many in this body, I am following closely the transition and \nChina's handling of the new Special Administrative Region. A heavy \nhanded approach to the transition by the Chinese side will be \ndisastrous for Hong Kong; disastrous for the mainland whose development \nis largely funded by and through Hong Kong; and disastrous for Pacific \noriented States like Washington which utilize Hong Kong as a gateway to \nChina and other parts of Asia.\n  Mindful of the threats to Hong Kong, it is important for all who want \nto influence change in China to recognize that Hong Kong's transition \nmay be our best opportunity to further influence the mainland in such \nimportant areas like the rule of law, respect for individual rights, \nand the many democratic principles that we cherish in the United \nStates.\n  As I traveled from Hong Kong to Beijing for additional discussions, I \ncouldn't help but wonder which side would have a greater impact \nfollowing the transition; 1.2 billion Chinese scattered throughout an \narea the size of the United States or 6 million Hong Kong capitalists \noccupying land that is similar in size to the Puget Sound area in \nWashington State.\n  In Beijing, I met with China's Vice Premier, Chinese Trade Ministry \nofficials, and Chinese leaders involved in financial services, \ntransportation, agriculture, electronics, and aviation.\n  United States Ambassador Jim Sasser, our former Senate colleague, was \nparticularly gracious and giving of his time and experiences in China \nto me and the Washington State delegation. Ambassador Sasser hosted a \ndinner for me and the Washington delegation, and our group was \ndelighted to be joined for the evening by former Speaker Tom Foley. At \nmy suggestion, Ambassador Sasser invited a number of prominent Chinese \nwomen known for their advocacy work within China on issues relating to \nwomen and children.\n  In my meeting with Vice Premier Li Lanqing, I focussed on the trade \nimbalance between the United States and China, my concerns and those of \nmy constituents on human rights, and the importance of China abiding by \nits commitments on Hong Kong.\n  Washington State exports to China grew by almost 40 percent in 1996 \nbut overall United States exports to China did not grow at a rate \ncomparable to the growth of China's exports to the United States.\n  I stressed to the Vice Premier my hope that the Chinese side would \nsoon agree to allow the International Red Cross access to Chinese \nprisons and reinforced with him that the United States would continue \nto push for improvements in human rights. A commitment to human rights \nis part of our moral fabric; and I was encouraged by Vice Premier's \nacknowledgment of U.S. interest in this issue and of his offer to \nengage in a dialog on this issue.\n  Hong Kong's transition will clearly be the international event of \n1997. The Chinese are well aware of this; I reminded the Chinese that \nthe United States is watching closely; Taiwan is watching; indeed all \nof the world is watching China's handling of the Hong Kong transition.\n  In China, I had the opportunity to raise a number of other issues of \nimportance to my State and my constituents. I encouraged the Chinese to \nincrease access to their markets for Washington State goods with \nparticular emphasis on resolving the TCK smut issue which keeps \nNorthwest wheat out of China's marketplace and tariff reductions which \nwould allow our horticultural producers to export significant volumes \nof apples, cherries, and pears to China.\n  The Chinese have made progress in combating piracy of intellectual \nproperty rights; I reminded them of ongoing problems and our continued \ninterest in stopping both the production and export of pirated United \nStates technology.\n  With the People's Bank of China, we discussed the importance of \nallowing more United States banks and insurance companies the \nopportunity to operate in China. This will provide new opportunities \nfor small- and medium-sized firms seeking export to China.\n  We also discussed many other important issues including the growth of \nthe Internet in China, the competitive advantages of Washington's ports \nand transportation infrastructure, the future energy needs of China, \nfood security issues including China's ability to feed its people, \nproblems associated with large, unproductive state-owned enterprises, \nand growth patterns in coastal and rural parts of China.\n  Numerous other high-profile congressional delegations also traveled \nthroughout China and to Hong Kong during the recess. Vice President \nGore visited the region with stops in Beijing and Shanghai. Several of \nmy Senate colleagues including Senators Lieberman, Mack, and Jeffords \ntraveled to China during the recess as did Speaker Gingrich and a large \nnumber of House Members. United States policy makers are visiting China \nand Hong Kong in record numbers. Close to 100 Members of Congress have \nvisited China in the last few months. And more will follow as the Hong \nKong return to Chinese sovereignty is now less than 100 days away.\n  I returned from my first visit to China convinced of the importance \nof engaging the Chinese, with heightened awareness of the difficult \nissues in the United States-China relationship, and very encouraged by \nthe congressional interest in Asia and China. And I am certain \nWashington State will continue to be the bellwether State in gauging \nboth the rewards and the pitfalls of the important United States-China \nrelationship.\n  Already there is significant interest in the Nation's Capital in \nChina. It is my hope that this interest will manifest itself in a \ngenuine debate about good U.S. policy rather than good partisan \npolitics. I certainly intend to represent forcefully the interests of \nmy State and our country with a voice for good U.S. policy in the \ncoming months.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S3776]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

HERMAN FOR SECRETARY OF LABOR\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I continue to be concerned about the \nfailure of the Senate to act on the nomination of Alexis Herman to be \nthe Secretary of Labor. President Clinton announced his intention to \nnominate Ms. Herman on December 20 last year, over 4 months ago. Her \npapers were officially received by the Senate Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources in early January.\n  During the Labor Committee's review of the nomination, Ms. Herman \nanswered over 150 written questions from committee members. She dealt \nthoroughly with all the questions put to her at a lengthy Labor \nCommittee hearing on March 18. The committee voted unanimously to \nconfirm Ms. Herman on April 10. Senate confirmation was expected soon \nafter that.\n  Instead, Ms. Herman's nomination has become a hostage in an exercise \nof political extortion that discredits the Senate. Those who are \nholding this nomination hostage admit that they are postponing a vote \non Ms. Herman for reasons that have nothing to do with her \nqualifications for office. They object to President Clinton's intention \nto issue an Executive order on labor issues which they oppose. The \nproposed Executive order would direct Federal agencies to consider the \nuse of so-called project labor agreements [PLA's] on Federal \nconstruction projects.\n  Such agreements have been used on large-scale construction projects, \nin the public and private sectors, for decades. Examples of Federal \nprojects carried out under PLA's include the Grand Coulee Dam in the \n1930's; atomic energy plants in the 1940's; Cape Kennedy in the 1960's; \nand today, the Boston Harbor cleanup project.\n  In the private sector, too, PLA's have been used on many projects \nacross the Nation, including the construction of Disney World in \nFlorida, the Toyota plant in Georgetown, KY, the trans-Alaska pipeline \nin Alaska, and the Saturn auto plant in Tennessee.\n  State governments use PLA's as well. Governor Pataki of New York \nissued an Executive order similar to President Clinton's proposal in \nJanuary 1997. The Governors of Nevada and New Jersey recently issued \nsimilar orders.\n  What PLA's do is require contractors to comply with the terms of \nlabor agreements for the duration of the project. The advantages of \nPLA's are numerous. Projects are more likely to be completed on time, \nbecause a skilled labor supply is always available. There are fewer \ncost overruns, because workplace disputes can be quickly resolved \nthrough grievance and arbitration procedures, instead of by strikes or \nlockouts.\n  Projects built under PLA's have lower accident rates, because \ncontractors can hire highly skilled and well-trained employees. \nProductivity increases as well, because of the higher skills of \nworkers.\n  Opponents of PLA's claim that such agreements unfairly deny contracts \nand jobs to nonunion firms and individuals. That charge is false.\n  Nonunion contractors can and do bid on jobs where PLA's are in \neffect. In the Boston Harbor project, 40 percent of the \nsubcontractors--over 100 firms--are nonunion. Similarly, on the Idaho \nNational Engineering Labs PLA, with the Department of Energy, 30 \npercent of the subcontractors were nonunion.\n  Nonunion workers can and do work on sites where PLA's are in place. \nUnions are required by law to refer nonmembers to jobs on the same \nbasis as union members.\n  The NLRB vigorously enforces this provision of the labor laws. Unions \nknow how to comply, and do comply. In the 21 so-called right-to-work \nStates, no worker can be required to give financial support to a union. \nIn the other 29 States, if the particular contract provides it, workers \ncan be required to pay a fee to the union while workers are employed at \nthe job site. However, no employee can be forced to join the union, or \nto pay for union activities that are not related to collective \nbargaining.\n  In all of these ways, PLA's are beneficial to project owners and \nworkers alike.\n  Further, it is clear that President Clinton has the authority to \nissue an Executive order dealing with Federal procurement practices. \nPresident Bush did just that in October 1992, when he issued an \nExecutive order prohibiting Federal agencies from requiring PLA's on \nFederal construction projects. Republican attacks on President \nClinton's power to issue an order directing the consideration of such \nagreements are hypocritical at best.\n  President Clinton won the 1996 election. He is entitled to use his \nPresidential powers as he sees fit. It is unconscionable that \nRepublican leaders in the Senate are holding Alexis Herman hostage to \ntheir antiworker bias. President Clinton has every right to issue his \nExecutive order on Federal construction projects. The Herman nomination \nhas nothing to do with that issue. Republicans should end this shameful \ntactic and let the Senate vote.\n  The Senate cannot faithfully discharge its constitutional \nresponsibility to conform nominees if the process grinds to a halt for \nreasons that are obviously extraneous. The time has come to end this \nunjustified delay. It is long past time for the Senate to vote on \nAlexis Herman's nomination.\n  When a vote is taken, I am confident that Alexis Herman will be \nconfirmed by the Senate and she will serve with distinction as our \nLabor Secretary. Ms. Herman's entire life has been dedicated to \nbuilding coalitions and bringing people together, regardless of \ndifferences in race, class, or gender. She comes from a family of \ntrail-blazers, and her own life, too, has been an extraordinary and \ninspirational story of commitment and achievement.\n  From childhood, her parents taught her the importance of helping \nothers. Her mother, who once was Alabama's Teacher of the Year, brought \nAlexis with her as she taught reading to children and adults. Alexis' \nfirst summer job was teaching reading at an inner-city housing project.\n  Alexis also learned at home about the importance of standing up for \nyour rights and participating in the political process. When she was \nonly 5, her father faced down some members of the Ku Klux Klan who \nstopped the family car on Christmas Eve. In the 1940's, her father sued \nfor the right to obtain an absentee ballot to vote in Mobile. Later, he \nwas elected a Wardman of Mobile's 10th Ward, one of the first African-\nAmericans elected in Alabama since Reconstruction.\n  In the early 1960's, her hometown of Mobile was still segregated. As \na high school sophomore, unable to reconcile her Catholic faith with \nthe segregation in the parochial schools, she confronted the Bishop of \nMobile. His response was to suspend her from school. Undaunted, she \ncontinued to press for change. The following year, the first African-\nAmericans were admitted to the white Catholic schools in Mobile.\n  After graduating from Xavier University, in New Orleans, she returned \nto Mobile as a social worker. She counseled delinquent youths, helped \nplace children in foster homes, and worked to assist families in \ndealing with issues such as teenage pregnancy.\n  She saw that lack of skills and opportunities were keeping many of \nMobile's\n\n[[Page S3777]]\n\nblack citizens from achieving their full potential. Working with the \nAFL-CIO and Catholic Social Services, she undertook a project to find \nwork for unemployed, unskilled young men in Mobile's housing projects.\n  In the 1970's, with Professor Ray Marshall of the University of \nTexas, she began a pilot project in Atlanta to place African-American \nwomen in white collar positions. With grants from the Ford Foundation \nand the Department of Labor, she established and managed this highly \nsuccessful program. As a result of her leadership, the first African-\nAmerican women were hired in white collar jobs at Coca Cola and Delta \nAirlines. The pilot project was so successful that it was extended to \n10 cities.\n  Alexis Herman then added public service to her many achievements in \nthe community and private enterprise. In 1977, when Ray Marshall became \nSecretary of Labor under President Carter, he asked her to become head \nof the Department's Women's Bureau--the youngest Director ever. She \nworked hard and well on expanding employment and training opportunities \nfor women, and co-chaired a Presidential task force to promote business \nownership by women.\n  After returning to the private sector, she worked as a consultant for \nbusinesses seeking to hire, train, and keep minority employees. Once \nagain, she demonstrated her life-long determination to extend \nopportunities to those who had long been denied jobs, careers, and, \nmost important, hope.\n  When President Clinton took office in 1993, he named Alexis Herman to \na senior White House position as Assistant to the President and \nDirector of the Office of Public Liaison. In this capacity, she \nidentified the concerns of individuals and families across the country \non the issues, and communicated the President's priorities to them. Few \nwould deny that over the past 4 years, she fulfilled these difficult \nand important responsibilities with remarkable skill and success.\n  All her life, as a young student, as a career woman, as a community \nleader and in public service, Alexis Herman has shown an extraordinary \ngift for bringing people together in a cooperative spirit. That skill \nwill serve her well as Secretary of Labor.\n  Alexis knows from her own life and first-hand experience the very \nreal obstacles that too many Americans still face in trying to achieve \nthe American dream. Most important, she is dedicated to the cause of \nimproving the lives of all working families. I'm confident she'll do an \noutstanding job as Secretary of Labor. I urge the Senate to act quickly \nto approve her nomination, and I look forward to working closely with \nher in the years ahead.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator from Illinois how \nmuch time will she be using?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. No more than 3 minutes. It is very brief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All of the time of the Democratic side has \nbeen allocated.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe we had 6 minutes that had been \nassigned to Senator Wellstone and Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent to have that 6-minute allocation \nchanged and that the 6 minutes be evenly divided between all three \nspeakers, and I will yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, my message is very simple, \nfollowing on the statement of the Senator from Massachusetts. That is, \nI call on the Senate to free Alexis Herman and liberate the Department \nof Labor. The fact is that her nomination is being held up for reasons \nthat have nothing to do with her qualifications for office, or, more to \nthe point, the need of the American people to have a captain of a ship, \nif you will, at the Department of Labor.\n  It is being held up because of some unrelated political issues and, \nquite frankly, it demeans and, I think, embarrasses some in the U.S. \nSenate to have this high-profile and important nominee held hostage for \nno reason.\n  So my message, in keeping with the message of the Senator from \nMassachusetts--and I associate myself with his remarks--is that I call \nupon the Members of the Senate to consider that Mrs. Herman's \nqualifications are exemplary. She has the leadership skills to lead \nthis Department of Labor in the 21st century, to lead our country in \naddressing the needs of working men and women, as well as the \ntransition that our business community is currently undergoing. I very \nmuch hope that our Members will come together to let this nomination \ngo--free Alexis Herman and liberate the Department of Labor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am going to consume about 1 minute, so I \nwould ask the Chair to keep an eye on the clock for me so that I leave \ntime for my colleague from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the current time, all the Democratic time \nhas been divided between Senator Harkin and Senator Wellstone.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will yield one of my minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut and tell him that he owes me a big time forever.\n  Mr. DODD. I owe him 1\\1/2\\ minutes, a minute with interest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. As a former Peace Corps volunteer and someone who was a Big \nBrother and served on the national board of Big Brothers, I commend the \neffort to focus attention on this. I would like to make note of the \nfact, with the Philadelphia Conference going on, we are 6 months almost \nto the day since election day and still there is a chair vacant around \nthe Cabinet table, that of the Secretary of Labor. This is a critically \nimportant issue to millions of people, a substantive issue that must be \naddressed immediately. My hope is that the leadership would see to it \nthis week that we would vote. Vote against Alexis Herman if people wish \nbut give her the opportunity to be confirmed or not confirmed and give \nus a chair at that Cabinet table for the millions of people who do not \nhave a voice at the table representing management and labor. So I urge \nthat the leadership move on this issue. We brought up this issue. I \nunderstand that. But the issue of the nomination of the Secretary of \nLabor 6 months after the election is long overdue.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is blatant politics at its worst. Alexis Herman \nwas voted unanimously out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. \nShe is eminently well qualified. This is an extremely important \nposition to working people, to working families. We have a lot of \nimportant legislation before us--the TEAM Act, comptime, flextime. We \nare supposed to be focusing on living wage jobs and educational \nopportunities for our citizens. The Secretary of Labor is a critical \nposition. She should not be held hostage. If the majority party does \nnot like an action taken by the administration, then oppose that \naction. Do not hold Alexis Herman hostage. Free her. Let her become \nSecretary of Labor and let her serve working families all across this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to go on but I think I used up my minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute of our time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  I actually think that I was able to do this in a minute. Again, I \nthink that it really behooves the Senate to move forward on this \nnomination. I do not think the Senate looks good as an institution. I \nthink people really do not like this kind of inside politics where a \nparticular party--in this case it is the majority party--does not agree \nwith a particular policy or particular action taken by the President or \nthe executive branch and then chooses to hold\n\n[[Page S3778]]\n\nsomeone else, in this particular case Alexis Herman, hostage. It is not \nthe way we should be conducting our business. It is not fair to her, an \neminently well qualified candidate to serve our country and, quite \nfrankly, it is not fair to families all across Minnesota and all across \nthe Nation that are focused on good jobs, education, and safe \nworkplaces. These are workaday majority issues. This is the Secretary \nof Labor--6 months without a Secretary of Labor. Again, do not hold her \nhostage. Free her and let us move forward. If my colleagues want to \nvote against her, vote against her, but she deserves a vote in this \nChamber.\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia for his graciousness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa for \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the President.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to make a brief comment about \nAlexis Herman. Recall that Ms. Herman was unanimously reported out of \nthis committee. We should not be holding her hostage over an unrelated \npolicy dispute--a disagreement with the President over project labor \nagreements. I hope that whatever one's views are on project labor \nagreements that her nomination can move forward.\n  The Secretary of Labor serves as the spokesperson for working \nfamilies in this country. We are considering several pieces of \nlegislation that will affect working families and it is important that \nthe Secretary of Labor be at the table as these changes in our work \nplaces are being considered. Ms. Herman must be allowed to assume her \nresponsibilities as Secretary of Labor without further delay. I think \nit is unfortunate that our colleagues continue to deny the Senate even \na vote on this important member of the President's Cabinet.\n  Now, let us be clear on the proposed Executive order regarding \nproject labor agreements [PLA's]. The Executive order only directs \nFederal agencies to consider using PLA's, it does not require them to \ndo so. The Federal Government's interest in PLA's is to help ensure \nthat public sector projects are completed efficiently, economically, \nand safely.\n  PLA's set wages, working conditions, and dispute-resolution \nprocedures for the duration of the project. This makes it easier for \nagencies to avoid cost-overruns and delays, while ensuring high quality \nwork and safety at the worksite. They guarantee that the project will \nbe completed on time, without strikes or lockouts. I find it incredible \nthat the majority is so offended by this commonsense initiative.\n  There is nothing new about project labor agreements--the Federal \nGovernment has used them on Federal projects since the 1930's. Examples \ninclude the Grand Coulee Dam, the Cape Canaveral Space Center, and the \nNevada test site. Project labor agreements have been a very effective \ntool for Federal, State and local governments when faced with a major \npublic works projects. PLA's have helped bring management and labor \ntogether to work out arrangements in terms of things like wages, \nbenefits, and working conditions in return for a promise of no work \nstoppages or strikes.\n  Contrary to what has been said about project labor agreements, non-\nunion contractors and nonunion workers would not be prohibited from \nworking on Federal projects--they simply would have to abide by the \nterms of the project labor agreement for that particular project.\n  Republican Governors Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and George \nPataki of New York issued similar executive orders authorizing state \nagencies to use project labor agreements. Also, State and local \ngovernments regularly use PLA's.\n  One notable example is the giant sewage treatment system now being \nbuilt for metropolitan Boston as part of a court ordered clean up of \nBoston Harbor. Forty percent of the contractors on the Boston Harbor \nproject are non-union. Furthermore, the projected cost of the project \nwas $6.1 billion, the present estimate for completion is $3.4 billion. \nThe Boston Harbor project is on schedule for completion by the year \n2000 and safety, measured in lost time due to workplace injuries is \nbelow the industry average. During the 7 years of work on this project, \nthere have been approximately 20 million hours worked without lost time \ndue to strike or lock-out. This is quite a record of success.\n  Lastly, contrary to the claim that President Clinton's proposed \nExecutive order (EO) exceeds his constitutional authority, this action \nis legitimate and typical of actions taken by other Presidents with \nclear constitutional and statutory authority. For decades, presidents \nof both political parties have exercised their authority to issue \nexecutive orders to implement changes in Government contracting \npolicies. Furthermore, when President Bush issued an Executive order in \n1992 to prohibit Federal agencies and Federal contractors from entering \ninto project labor agreements, there was no similar outcry.\n  The Executive order on PLA's and the upcoming regulations on \nprocurement reform are not a pay off to labor. They are sound policies \nthat will make government operate more efficiently. The Federal \nGovernment should consider using project labor agreements when they \nincrease efficiency, stability, and save taxpayer money.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/29/senate-section/article/S3776-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3778-S3781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          VOLUNTEER PROTECTION ACT OF 1997--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes of our \nallotted time to the distinguished Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me start by thanking my friend and \ncolleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, for his leadership on this \nimportant issue this year.\n  As the principal cosponsor of this bill in the previous Congresses, I \nam excited about the fact it is on the agenda and has an excellent \nchance of becoming law.\n  My wife Elaine, who many of my colleagues know is former head of the \nUnited Way of America, was up at the volunteer conference yesterday in \nPhiladelphia and there is no question that the timing of this could not \nbe better. I commend my colleague from Georgia and the majority leader \nfor scheduling this important piece of legislation during the volunteer \nconference, obviously making it easier for more and more Americans to \ncontribute their time to others. It is something that ought to be a \nhigh priority in America in 1997.\n  Unfortunately, volunteer service has become a high-risk venture. Our \nsue happy legal culture has ensnarled those selfless individuals who \nhelp worthy organizations and institutions through volunteer service. \nThey try to do good and end up risking their fortunes. These lawsuits \nare proof that no good deed goes unpunished. In order to relieve \nvolunteers from this unnecessary and unfair burden of liability, I am \npleased to join in the reintroduction of the Volunteer Protection Act. \nI am particularly happy it is being considered today.\n  The litigation craze is hurting the spirit of voluntarism that is an \nintegral part of our American society. From school chaperons to Girl \nScout and Boy Scout troop leaders to Big Brothers and Big Sisters, \nvolunteers, as we all know, perform invaluable services for our \nsociety. At no time is this value more evident than right now where \norganizations like the Red Cross are making such a big difference for \nthe victims in flood ravaged North Dakota, just like they did for the \nfolks in my home State of Kentucky during the floods there earlier this \nyear.\n  So how do we thank the volunteers? All too often we drag them into \ncourt and subject them to needless and unfair lawsuits. The end result: \ntoo many people pointing fingers and too few offering a helping hand. \nEven Little League volunteers face major league liabilities.\n  In February 1995, Dr. Creighton Hale, the CEO of Little League \nBaseball, wrote in the Wall Street Journal that Little League had in \nfact turned into ``litigation league.'' He pointed out that in one \ninstance two youngsters collided in the outfield, picked themselves up, \ndusted themselves off, and then sued the coach. In another case, a \nwoman won a cash settlement when she was struck by a ball that a player \nfailed to catch. Incidentally, the player was her own daughter.\n  It is sometimes difficult to quantify exactly how much of an \norganization's\n\n[[Page S3779]]\n\ntime and money is spent on liability protection. But the Girl Scouts \nhave been able to put it into terms we can all understand. The \nexecutive director of the Girl Scout Council of Washington, here in the \nDistrict of Columbia, said in a February 1995 letter that ``locally, we \nmust sell 87,000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies each year to pay our \nliability insurance.''\n  Very simply, this bill protects volunteers who act within the scope \nof their responsibilities--within the scope of their responsibilities--\nwho are properly licensed or certified where necessary, and some places \nrequire that, and, third, who do not act in a willful, criminal or \ngrossly negligent fashion.\n  We are not trying to insulate from liability those who may act in a \nwanton way. Let me emphasize this bill does not create immunity for the \norganizations themselves or for volunteers who act, as I said, in a \nwillful or grossly negligent manner.\n  Let me also point out that our bill clearly spells out that there is \nno protection for individuals who commit hate crimes or violent crimes \nor who violate the civil rights of others. So the opponents of the \nvolunteer protection bill who claim that this is a KKK bill are simply \nengaging in fear mongering and demagoguery at its worst. This is a bill \nabout protecting our volunteers. That is what it is about, nothing more \nand nothing less. This bill creates a minimum standard for volunteer \nprotection and then allows the States to add further refinements and \nprotections to that standard.\n  In short, the bill gives States flexibility. It strikes a balance \nbetween the federalism interests on the one hand and the need to \nprotect volunteers from unfair and unnecessary litigation on the other. \nSpecifically, any of the following State law provisions would be--I say \nwould be--consistent with our bill.\n  First, a requirement that the organization or entity be accountable \nfor the actions of its volunteers in the same way that an employer is \nliable for the acts of its employees.\n  Second, an exemption from liability protection in the event that the \nvolunteer is using a motor vehicle or similar instrument.\n  Third, a requirement that liability protection applies only if the \nnonprofit organization or Government entity provides a financially \nsecure source of recovery such as an insurance policy for those who \nsuffer harm.\n  Fourth, a requirement that the organization or entity adhere to risk \nmanagement procedures including the training of volunteers.\n  Now, none of those would be inconsistent with our bill should they be \nthe standards adopted by a given State. The bottom line: liability \nproblems for volunteers is a national problem that deserves a national \nsolution--a national problem that cries out for a national solution. My \nstate of Kentucky just experienced devastating floods. During those \nfloods, we also experienced an outpouring of compassion from volunteers \nall across the country. The volunteers were not just from Kentucky. \nThey were from Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, just to name a few States from \nwhich people came to help us out in Kentucky. If a Red Cross volunteer \nfrom Ohio wants to cross the bridge and come into northern Kentucky and \nhelp on our flood relief, they cannot just put on their coat and boots \nand go to Kentucky. They need to do some legal research first. They \nneed to do a survey of Kentucky and Ohio law to see if volunteers are \nprotected and to what extent they are protected. Voluntarism is \nobviously a national issue and volunteers regularly and repeatedly \ncross State lines to help their neighbors.\n  That is why, among other reasons, this is a national problem calling \nout for a national solution. I urge my colleagues to move forward on \nthis bill. The volunteer summit in Philadelphia is a testament to our \ncountry's strong efforts in this regard. And we think that clearly this \nis the time for action.\n  Today, in the cooperative spirit of the President's summit, I would \nask our colleagues to set aside our differences on other issues like \nlabor issues. I also would respectfully ask my colleagues not to try to \nsuggest that this bill is about anything other than what it is about. \nIt is not about the Ku Klux Klan. It is about protecting American \nvolunteers.\n  I am amazed, I might say further, Mr. President, how one day we are \ncriticized for moving too slowly and the next day we are criticized for \nmoving too fast. It is pretty difficult here to figure out exactly what \navoids criticism. These criticisms appear to be nothing more than \nattempts to divert this legislation which is obviously good for \nvolunteers and good for our country.\n  Let me just summarize. What we are talking about here is a national \nproblem crying out for a national solution to make it more possible for \nAmerican volunteers to go to the assistance of their neighbors. We are \nbringing this bill up in the middle of the national summit in \nPhiladelphia to encourage voluntarism and some are saying we are moving \ntoo fast. This bill has been around for quite a while. I offered a \nmeasure similar to this in 1991, I believe it was. It got about 31 \nvotes. But times have changed. There is a growing awareness that legal \nreform of a variety of different sorts is important to our country, and \nwe are starting in this area with the volunteer protection bill because \nit is timely, it is important, and this is obviously the time to move \nforward.\n  So let me conclude by thanking my good friend from Georgia for his \nleadership on this important issue. I hope we will soon be past the \nmotion to proceed and well onto sending this legislation down to the \nPresident for signature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am going to consume about 1 minute, so I \nwould ask the Chair to keep an eye on the clock for me so that I leave \ntime for my colleague from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the current time, all the Democratic time \nhas been divided between Senator Harkin and Senator Wellstone.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will yield 1 of my minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut and tell him that he owes me big time forever.\n  Mr. DODD. I owe him 1\\1/2\\ minutes, a minute with interest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. As a former Peace Corps volunteer and someone who was a Big \nBrother and served on the national board of Big Brothers, I commend the \neffort to focus attention on the Philadelphia conference. I would like \nto make note of the fact, we are 6 months almost to the day since \nelection day and still there is a chair vacant around the Cabinet \ntable, that of the Secretary of Labor. This is a critically important \nissue to millions of people, a substantive issue that must be addressed \nimmediately. My hope is that the leadership would see to it this week \nthat we would vote. Vote against Alexis Herman if people wish but give \nher the opportunity to be confirmed or not confirmed. Give us a chair \nat that Cabinet table for the millions of people representing \nmanagement and labor. So I urge that the leadership move on this issue. \nWe brought up this issue. I understand that. But the confirmation of \nthe Secretary of Labor 6 months after the election is long overdue.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is blatant politics at its worst. Alexis Herman \nwas voted unanimously out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. \nShe is eminently well qualified. This is an extremely important \nposition to working people, to working families. We have a lot of \nimportant legislation before us--the TEAM Act, comptime, flextime. We \nare supposed to be focusing on living wage jobs and educational \nopportunities for our citizens. The Secretary of Labor is a critical \nposition. She should not be held hostage. If the majority party does \nnot like an action taken by the administration, then oppose that \naction, but do not hold Alexis Herman hostage. Free her. Let her become \nSecretary of Labor and let her serve working families all across this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to go on but I think I used up my minute.\n\n[[Page S3780]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute of our time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  I actually think that I was able to do this in a minute. Again, I \nthink that it really behooves the Senate to move forward on this \nnomination. I do not think the Senate looks good as an institution. I \nthink people really do not like this kind of inside politics where a \nparticular party--in this case it is the majority party--does not agree \nwith a particular policy or particular action taken by the President or \nthe executive branch and then chooses to hold someone else, in this \nparticular case Alexis Herman, hostage. It is not the way we should be \nconducting our business. It is not fair to her, an eminently well \nqualified candidate to serve our country and, quite frankly, it is not \nfair to families all across Minnesota and all across the Nation that \nare focused on good jobs, education, and safe workplaces. These are \nworkaday issues. This is the Secretary of Labor--6 months without a \nSecretary of Labor. Again, do not hold her hostage. Free her and let us \nmove forward. If my colleagues want to vote against her, vote against \nher, but she deserves a vote in this Chamber.\n\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia for his graciousness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 19 minutes and 40 seconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 5 minutes of my \nown time.\n  Mr. President, of course, the matter before the Senate is the \nVolunteer Protection Act which we had hoped would be a response to an \nhistoric bipartisan summit on voluntarism. The Volunteer Protection Act \nis designed to stop a circumstance developing in our country where \nvolunteers are frightened to participate in the 600,000 volunteer \norganizations for fear that by participating they will have put their \nfamily and their family's assets at risk.\n  In the American Bar Association's section of business law recently a \nvery balanced article occurs about the subject. It says:\n\n       An analysis of the laws around the Nation uncovers two \n     important facts.\n\n  This is not exactly a partisan outfit.\n\n       Many volunteers remain fully liable for any harm they cause \n     and all volunteers remain liable for some actions. Prior to \n     1980, the number of significant lawsuits filed against \n     volunteers might have been counted on one hand--\n\n  Prior to 1980, lawsuits directed at volunteers could be counted on \none hand--\n\n     with fingers left over. But that all changed in the mid \n     1980's as several suits against volunteers attracted national \n     media attention. Besides accounts of lawsuits against \n     coaches, one of the most frequently publicized cases involved \n     a California mountain rescue team which evacuated a climber \n     who had injured his spine in a fall. The man later sued for \n     $12 million alleging that rescuers' negligence had caused him \n     to become paralyzed. With stories like this getting big play, \n     volunteers were suddenly worrying about the possibility of \n     personal liability.\n  In other words, stepping forward, being a good Samaritan, and then \nhaving your family's assets all at risk.\n  To meet the cost of higher insurance premiums, some nonprofit \norganizations cut back on services, that is, less attention to helping \nthe elderly, the poor, and the children of our Nation. Others went \nwithout insurance, increasing the risk that an injured party would sue \nthe organization's volunteers in search of a deep pocket.\n  As publicity about the lawsuits and insurance crunch raised \nvolunteers' apprehension, their willingness to serve waned. Even though \nreports of actual judgments against volunteers remain scarce, the \nspecter of a multimillion-dollar claim cast a deep shadow--and this is \nthe point. This is not a 300-page bill. This bill is 12 pages long, \ndouble spaced. This is not rocket science law. This does not require 15 \nyears of hearings. This bill is very simple. It begins to protect the \nvolunteer from simple mistakes or errors or omissions, not from gross \nnegligence. It does not protect hate organizations. It is \ndisappointing, to say the least, that an attempt to respond to four \nPresidents, two Republican and two Democrat, calling on America to step \nforward, and trying to aid and abet that by a very narrowly focused \nproposition that says when they do step forward, they are not stepping \nforward in front of a gun; they are free to step forward and volunteer \nwithout being unnaturally and unduly threatened from frivolous lawsuits \nor from an effort to seek a deep pocket.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. In that I have consumed these 5 minutes in an effort \nto protect those coming to speak, I suggest the absence of a quorum. As \nI understand it, that will be equally divided, but it will fall on our \ntime when theirs has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will come out of the time of the Senator \nfrom Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I see I have been joined by the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Texas. In an effort to leave him as \nmuch of the remainder of the time--how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 12 minutes, 45 seconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Twelve minutes remaining, and I yield as much time as \nnecessary to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, there has been an extended debate here this \nmorning about many different issues, about confirmation of Presidential \nnominees and about the protection of hate groups. What I would like to \ndo is to get back to the point of this bill, to get back to a \ndefinition of what we are trying to achieve, what kind of safeguards we \nhave in the bill, and to explain why it is critically important that we \nsupport this legislation.\n  The distinguished Senator from Georgia and those who have cosponsored \nhis bill--and I am proud to be one of them--believe in voluntarism. We \nbelieve that there is no Government substitute for people being engaged \nin and trying to participate in the activities of their own \ncommunities. We do not believe there is any Government program that can \nsubstitute for genuine volunteers.\n  The President, numerous past Presidents, and General Powell are \nengaged at this very moment in trying to promote voluntarism. I see the \nbill of the Senator from Georgia as being a complement to that effort.\n  First, let me try to define the problem. When I was coaching little \nleague football 25 years ago, I never thought about the fact that I \nmight be liable had some player who was playing for me been hurt. I \nnever thought about the liability implications because 25 years ago, at \nleast in the very active central Texas league I coached in for 3 years, \nto my knowledge we never had a lawsuit filed against any volunteer.\n\n  The problem is that the world has changed dramatically in the last 25 \nyears. It is now commonplace for volunteers who are trying to help \npeople, for no pay, taking time away from their businesses, their \nprofessions and their families, to end up being attacked in a lawsuit. \nFurthermore, the volunteer frequently has very little, if any, \ninvolvement in the incident, has very little responsibility for the \nharm that has been alleged, and yet is often the only one with deep \npockets.\n  Let me just give an example that I think is pretty easy to envision. \nAssume you have a volunteer working at a boys and girls club. Let us \nassume that the volunteer is working at the front entrance, checking \npeople in as they come in to participate in the activities. This \nvolunteer is critically important because, in trying to conserve the \nmoney we raise for the boys and girls club, we can hold down our costs \nif we can use volunteers.\n  The problem that Senator Coverdell is trying to deal with is the \nfollowing: You have a volunteer working at the front door checking \npeople in. You have a professional staff person working in the back of \nthe facility, say the\n\n[[Page S3781]]\n\nweight room, who might not be providing sufficient supervision and as a \nresult some young person who is lifting weights, drops the weights on \nhis leg, breaks his leg, and sues.\n  The professional employee at the boys club probably does not have \ndeep pockets. The boys club of Bryan-College Station, where I am from, \nis not a rich organization. But the volunteer, working in the front, \nwho by definition of being a volunteer is able to give their time \nvoluntarily might have substantial assets. Under Texas law, they could \nbe held liable. In this situation, you might end up having a volunteer, \nwho never went into the weight room and who simply was there helping \ncheck people in, be the only one with deep pockets. Some knowledgeable \nand aggressive lawyer could end up suing the volunteer for something \nthey had nothing to do with.\n  Here is what the Coverdell bill does, and it does it very simply. No. \n1, it recognizes the contributions that volunteers make and defines the \nreason we want to encourage voluntarism. Then it sets out some very \nsimple principles about liability. That is, it relieves volunteers from \nliability for harm caused if: No. 1, the volunteer was acting within \nthe scope of their responsibility; No. 2, if a license or training was \nrequired for the job the volunteer was doing and the volunteer indeed \nhad the license or the required training; and, No. 3, if the harm was \nnot caused by willful or criminal misconduct or gross negligence.\n  So, it sets out some simple common-sense criteria which requires that \nvolunteers meet the training requirements and to be carrying out their \nfunction for which they volunteered in a responsible manner. The bill \nalso bars the awarding of punitive damages against a volunteer and, in \na very important provision of the law, it sets out proportional \nliability for noneconomic damages. Under this bill, if you have a \nvolunteer who has deep pockets and who is simply checking people in at \nthe front of the building, and has nothing to do with what is going on \nin other parts of the building, then if a lawsuit should be filed, they \ncould be liable only for an amount proportionate to their involvement \nin causing the harm.\n  In addition, there are many safeguards in this bill which have been \ndiscussed at some length in this debate. States have the ability to opt \nout of this if they choose to do so. I do not believe they will choose \nto do this because basically what we are trying to do in this bill is \nto encourage voluntarism by limiting liability, by assuring people that \nif they are willing to put up their time and their talent and their \nmoney to help other people, and if they are willing to volunteer to try \nto help their community, as long as they do their job in a reasonable \nand responsible manner, then they are not going to end up being dragged \ninto a courtroom.\n  I want to address one part of the opposition to this bill. This is a \nvery tiny step, in my opinion, in the right direction toward legal \nliability reform. This is a tiny step in the direction of beginning to \ndo something about runaway litigation in America. I believe that the \nopposition to this bill really springs from those who do not want any \nlimits on legal liability. I would just simply ask my colleagues to \nlook at the limited nature of this bill, to look at the fact that \nAmerica is a great beneficiary from volunteer activity by our citizens, \nand that one thing that has tended to happen as Government has done \nmore and more is that volunteers have been crowded out into doing less \nand less in our communities. I believe that we are all losers for that \ndecline in voluntarism.\n  People who, 25 years ago, routinely volunteered to do things, now, in \nsome cases, fear to do them because of legal liability. Two weeks ago I \nvisited a school, a charter school in Texas, called the Dallas CAN \nAcademy. This was the first charter school in my State. It is run \nalmost exclusively by volunteers.\n  It has a very small professional staff which runs a mentoring program \nwhere business and professional people come in and serve as mentors to \nkids who have dropped out of school because they have had some sort of \nproblem. These kids have come back to this special charter school and, \nwith the mentoring program, in about 80 percent of the cases are able \nto graduate from high school--and a not insignificant number of them \nend up going on to college. The secret of this program is voluntarism.\n  This little program in Dallas, TX, pays $15,000 a year in liability \ninsurance to protect its volunteers. That is $15,000 a year that could \ngo to helping kids. That is $15,000 a year that might make it possible \nfor 15, 20, 30, or 50 more kids to graduate from high school and to \nhave an opportunity to get on the playing field of life.\n  What the Coverdell bill will do is, by setting standards of reason \nand responsibility, it will dramatically reduce the liability cost of \nthis charter school. It will make it easier to get people to coach \nyouth soccer and little league. It will get more people involved, and I \ncan say as a person who was very actively involved in volunteering in \nyouth sports when I was a college professor, that the volunteer gets \nmore out of it than the people who are the beneficiaries of \nvoluntarism.\n  We are trying to make it possible for millions of Americans to help \ntens of millions of Americans, but the benefits do not just go to the \npeople who are the targets of this voluntarism, the benefits go to the \npeople who volunteer as well. The Coverdell bill tries to limit a real \nimpediment to voluntarism. The legal costs of people being liable for \nthings they did not cause is driving away hundreds of thousands of \nvolunteers.\n  I want to congratulate Senator Coverdell. This is a very important \nbill, and I hope our colleagues will not let this whole political issue \nof legal liability and the interests of lawyers versus people who are \nsued interfere with what is a straightforward, reasonable, and limited \nbill. I strongly urge that this bill be adopted.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas once \nagain for making a very cogent statement on this piece of important \nlegislation. I thank him for coming to the floor.\n  How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield the balance of my time to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 1 minute.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent to have 5 minutes in morning \nbusiness rather than taking from Senator Coverdell's time. So if the \nSenator wants to finish on his bill for a minute, then I would like to \nask unanimous consent for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield back my time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 5 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/29/senate-section/article/S3778-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3781-S3782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WELFARE REFORM AND WAIVER REQUEST FOR TEXAS\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to talk today about welfare \nreform. Now you may say, ``My goodness, why are you talking about \nwelfare reform? We passed that last year.''\n  It is true, Congress passed welfare reform last year. We said to the \nStates, ``We want you to run your own programs. We're going to send you \nless money so that you will have the ability to be more efficient and \nmake up for the dollars that we are not sending you from the Federal \nGovernment by efficiencies in your State programs.''\n  We said to the States, ``We're going to cut the strings. You're not \ngoing to have to come to Washington every time you turn around. And \nthat will give you the ability to enact the programs that your States \nneed to operate in a more efficient way.''\n  Mr. President, you would have thought that everyone would have said, \n``Hallelujah, we are going full steam ahead.'' Well, Mr. President, the \nStates said, ``Hallelujah, we're going full steam ahead.'' The problem \nis, this administration is thwarting the attempts of State after State \nto do the job we asked them to do.\n\n  Mr. President, today the State of Texas has been waiting for 170 \ndays, 5 months, for a clearance to run its welfare program in a more \nefficient way. The Governor of Texas has said it is costing our State \n$10 million a month because they are waiting for Federal approval so \nthat they can go out and\n\n[[Page S3782]]\n\nget bids. Public sector, private sector, whoever gives the best bid for \nthe taxpayers of Texas and America, would be able to bid on \nconsolidating the administrative offices for welfare services so that a \nwelfare recipient would be able to go in to one place and get whatever \nthey needed for their particular needs at that particular time. They \nmay be able to get food stamps, AFDC, Medicaid, disaster assistance, \ncommunity care, in-home and family support. All of these things would \nbe in one place.\n  The State of Texas is looking for public-private partnerships. They \nare looking to the public sector and the private sector to say, come in \nand bid on these programs. The State of Texas believes they can save 10 \nto 40 percent of the $550 million they now spend to administer these \nprograms. That is $200 million a year for the taxpayers of Texas and \nthe taxpayers of America.\n  Mr. President, I talked to the Secretary of HHS. I said, ``What more \ncan Texas do?'' She was very forthright. She said, ``Texas has done \neverything it was supposed to do. Everything is set. It is on the \nPresident's desk.''\n  Mr. President, why is the President making this decision in the first \nplace? I am afraid it is because a political aspect to this has \nemerged. And that is, some of the unions do not want the ability for \nour State to go out and get bids on public-private partnerships.\n  Mr. President, I am all for unions being able to have free market \naccess and free ability to go out and get jobs. But when a union says, \n``We don't want you to be able to do things more efficiently because we \nmight not be able to compete,'' I am saying that is wrong. It is time \nfor the President of the United States to do what Congress said was the \nlaw of the land and which he signed into law, which he agreed to do, \nand that is let the States run the welfare programs. Part of the way \nwelfare reform is going to work is for the States to be able to do the \njob more efficiently without strings from Washington. It saves taxpayer \ndollars for all Americans and for the States that are trying to do \ntheir job better.\n  Mr. President, we have a dilemma here. Congress has acted, and the \nPresident has signed the bill. He has agreed with Congress that it is \nin everyone's best interest for the States to run their own programs. \nThe proposal of the State of Texas is along the lines of what many \nother States are looking at. Wisconsin, Arizona, and other States are \nlooking at these kinds of efficiencies.\n  Mr. President, I hope they will be able to do this. I hope so, \nbecause Congress has spoken and the President has spoken, and we have \nsaid the same thing: ``Be more efficient. Use taxpayer dollars more \nwisely.'' What is the holdup?\n  I ask President Clinton, what is the holdup? We have a reasonable \nproposal. It is innovative. It meets the needs of Texans. Why not \napprove it? Five months and Texas has lost $10 million for every month \nthis has not been able to go forward.\n  Mr. President, this is an emergency for my State. Our legislature has \n1 more month of its session. We must act if the President is not \nwilling to do the job. So I am announcing that I am going to try to do \nthis congressionally if the President does not act or if the President \nturns down the reasonable request by the State of Texas. Because, Mr. \nPresident, the President of the United States cannot thwart the will of \nCongress when he has signed a bill. When it is the law of the land, he \ncannot go around it with regulations, with Executive orders, thumbing \nhis nose at what the law is. He was a Governor. The President of the \nUnited States understands how important it is for States to be able to \nhave the ability to run their own programs.\n\n  I am going to ask today the President of the United States to approve \nthe waiver request for the State of Texas which has been sitting on his \ndesk for 5 months. If he is unwilling to do that, I am serving notice \nthat I will do everything in my power to congressionally require this \napproval.\n  The second choice is not the best. I would rather work with the \nPresident to do what is right here. But we are beginning to see a \npattern: Wisconsin coming in, asking for legislative relief; Oregon \ncoming in, asking for legislative relief. That is not the way to do it. \nBut the buck stops here. Congress passed the law. If the administration \nis going to thwart the law of the land, Congress must act.\n  We must take these waivers one at a time and make these decisions. I \nwould prefer that the President and the administration do what is right \nand do what is their responsibility to do and grant these waivers. If \nthey do not, however, it is the responsibility of Congress to step in \nand say, this was our intent and it is the law of the land.\n  Mr. President, Texas is losing $10 million a month; $50 million to \ndate. It is not right. We are doing in Texas what Congress told us to \ndo. There should be no barrier to doing that. I ask the President \ntoday, grant the waiver. That is the proper way to work with Congress \nand with the States and it is in everyone's best interest.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/29/senate-section/article/S3781-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL 2:15 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have said earlier today I do not \nthink this is an appropriate response to the bipartisan appeal from \nPhiladelphia, to be filibustering very narrow legislation to help \nvolunteers respond to the call by four former Presidents and a former \nChief of Staff. But there will be plenty of time to talk about that. I \nknow that the senior Senator from Texas has 5 minutes on another \nmatter. So I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed up to 5 minutes \nto cover that, and then we will return to the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Texas will be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me join my colleague in expressing my \ndisappointment that at the very moment where we have our former \nPresidents urging voluntarism, the Senate, on a partisan vote, is \nblocking our effort to remove legal liability constraints that limit \nthe willingness of people to volunteer. So I am very disappointed that \nwe did not get the job done, and I trust that this will not be the end \nof this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/29/senate-section/article/S3782-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TEXAS WAIVER FOR WELFARE SERVICES CONSOLIDATION\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to raise an issue today and in the \nprocess urge the administration to move ahead and grant a waiver to the \nState of Texas to consolidate their office whereby they provide access \nto services like AFDC, food stamps, WIC, Medicaid, and other public \nservice programs.\n  In an effort to innovate and save money, the State of Texas, under \nthe leadership of our Governor, has come up with the idea of allowing \npublic/private partnerships, such as EDS and the Texas Department of \nHuman Services and Lockheed/Martin and the Texas Workforce Commission, \nto bid for the opportunity to move toward a more efficient provision of \nwelfare services in out State.\n  The bottom line is the State of Texas has put together a proposal to \nuse private technology with the public sector to unify the eligibility \nand application processes for a number of welfare benefits. The State \nof Texas can save $200 million a year in State taxpayer funds that can \nbe used for education or for public assistance or for law enforcement, \nand they have asked the administration to sign off on a waiver to let \nthe State adopt this procedure, saving $200 million, and the President \nhas steadfastly refused to grant a waiver. Over and over and over \nagain, we are seeing delays from the White House.\n  If the White House does not move ahead and grant this waiver so that \nTexas can operate its AFDC and Medicaid programs efficiently, then \nSenator Hutchison and I are going to have to move on the floor of the \nSenate to pass a law to mandate that this waiver be granted.\n  It is outrageous for the President to continue to give speeches about \nwelfare reform, to talk about giving States the ability to innovate and \nto try new methods to provide better services and to save costs, save \nmoney, and then turn right around and refuse to grant a waiver that \nwould dramatically improve the efficiency of the system in Texas that \nwould make it easier for people who are truly needy to get assistance.\n  What is the issue? By moving to a public/private partnership and \nsaving $200 million, some State bureaucrats and the unions who \nrepresent them are afraid they might lose their jobs. Even though Texas \ncould save $200 million and even though millions of beneficiaries would \nbenefit from greater efficiency, the President is afraid to take on a \nspecial-interest group by granting this waiver. In this case the \nspecial-interest group is organized labor.\n  This is exactly the kind of activity we encouraged in our welfare \nreform bill which passed on a bipartisan basis. This is exactly what \nthe President says every time he speaks on welfare reform. The State of \nTexas is trying to be efficient and save money, and they cannot get the \nWhite House to say yes or no.\n\n  Basically, what I am saying to the White House today is this: say yes \nor no, and get on with making the decision. If you are not going to \nallow the State of Texas to carry out the mandate of welfare reform, if \nyou are not going to allow them to save money, if you are not going to \nallow them to operate their programs efficiently, then the Congress is \ngoing to have to act to grant this waiver.\n  It makes absolutely no sense for the administration to refuse to say \nyes or no. This is a clear-cut question: Is the power of special \ninterests within the White House so dominating and so overwhelming that \nwhen a State tries to operate under the new welfare reform bill, when a \nState tries to save $200 million annually of the taxpayers' money, and \nwhen a State tries to improve services by bringing the private sector \ninto the process, it is prevented from doing so? Should we let one \nspecial interest keep all those good things from happening? That is the \nquestion that the President is going to have to answer in deciding \nwhether to grant this waiver. I want to urge the President to grant the \nwaiver and to do it soon.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding the \ntime.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 minutes as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/29/senate-section/article/S3783-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3783-S3784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF ALEXIS HERMAN\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue that is \nimportant to many Rhode Islanders and I believe touches on the \ncredibility of this body. I would like to add my voice to the voice of \nmany of my colleagues in support of Alexis Herman as the Secretary of \nLabor. The appointment of Alexis Herman was approved by the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee unanimously on April 10, almost 3 weeks ago. \nThis unanimous vote came after an appropriately arduous examination of \nMs. Herman's record. She spent months successfully completing a far-\nreaching questionnaire submitted by the majority. She subsequently came \nbefore the committee and spent hours testifying as to her past \naccomplishments and her vision for the Department of Labor. She \ncompleted these tasks successfully, and a full vote of the Senate was \noriginally scheduled for April 16.\n  Yet, that vote has now been placed on indefinite hold. I believe this \nreflects poorly on this body. We have asked Ms. Herman to defend her \nrecord and outline her agenda for the Department of Labor. She has done \nthat. Indeed, she has performed that task well enough to gain the \nunanimous support of our committee. We now owe her the courtesy of \nconsideration by the full Senate. Not only do we owe this courtesy to \nMs. Herman, but we have a duty to hard-working men and women in this \ncountry to have their interests adequately represented in the Cabinet \nof the President of the United States. Every day policy decisions \naffecting workers go unaddressed because there is no Secretary.\n  While some may take financial stability for granted in today's \neconomy, we in Rhode Island certainly do not. The Department of Labor \nhas played a consistent and productive role in helping Rhode Island to \ncope with the economic challenges that it faces. We need a Secretary of \nLabor to help us continue in these efforts.\n\n  Economically, Rhode Island has been hard hit by changing economic \nconditions and defense downsizing.\n  In the late 1980's and early 1990's we lost over 10 percent of our \nmanufacturing jobs due mostly to defense downsizing but also to changes \nin the economy. These effects continue to plague our economy. \nThankfully, the Department of Labor, under the leadership of then \nSecretary Reich, was there consistently to provide assistance in \nlessening the burden of this impact on working Rhode Islanders. For \nexample, in December of 1995, Rhode Island's largest grocery store, \nAlmacs, declared bankruptcy immediately before Christmas. This \nbankruptcy resulted in Rhode Island's single largest layoff, over 2,000 \nworkers, immediately before the 1995 holidays. The private sector \ncommitted what they could, volunteering food, holiday gifts and job \nplacement services, but the former employees faced severe hardship.\n\n[[Page S3784]]\n\n  Then the Department of Labor stepped in to assist. They provided a \ntotal of $4.3 million to retrain 90 percent of the former Almacs \nworkers who did not find employment in other grocery stores. This \nassistance came about because I was able to directly share the hardship \nof my constituents with the Secretary of Labor. Indeed, because the \nCongress had shut down the Federal Government at that time, several \nadditional hurdles had to be overcome to help the people from Almacs.\n  Thankfully, because of the work of the Secretary, those hurdles were \novercome and my constituents were provided the services they \ndesperately needed and, indeed, deserved.\n  Just as in 1995, I am afraid that we are again confronted with a \ncallous disregard for the working people of this country. They deserve \na Secretary of Labor. Ms. Herman deserves a vote. Let us get on with \nthis process. If you will, vote against her, but give her the \nopportunity to have her case heard here on the floor of the Senate and \nthe decision made, not by inaction, but by the votes of the men and \nwomen of this body.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/29/senate-section/article/S3783-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3784-S3797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          VOLUNTEER PROTECTION ACT OF 1997--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, just for clarification, before the \nSenate is a motion to proceed to S. 543. I would like to clarify for my \ncolleagues, given the scope of the legislation, the importance of it, \nand timeliness of it, I am not eager to turn the aftermath of this \ncloture vote into a time that we substitute for morning business. I \nhope the remarks--and we, of course, sanctioned the previous remarks of \nthe Senator from Texas and the Senator from Rhode Island--but I would \nbe inclined to object to remarks for the next hour or so, not relating \nto the subject before the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I might continue then, for a moment. The time for this \ndebate ran out before our lunch recess. I was commenting on an article, \na very balanced article that appeared in the ABA section of Business \nLaw, with regard to what the Voluntary Protection Act is trying to \naccomplish. I had just read this point, that ``As publicity about \nlawsuits and the insurance crunch raised volunteers' apprehension, \ntheir willingness to serve waned.''\n  The point is, we have documented evidence that a growing number of \ncitizens in our country who have traditionally engaged in something \nthat is uniquely American, it truly is--and I might add that as a \nformer Director of the U.S. Peace Corps I had a chance to witness this \nand listen to it and hear it reiterated around the world--that \nvoluntarism, as we describe it in America, is unique and it is an \ninvaluable treasure for American people.\n  Here we have a situation that developed in the 1980's, where, \nsuddenly, lawsuits directed at a volunteer, in search of more financial \nmeans or whatever, became highly publicized. So, obviously, it made a \ngood Samaritan, somebody trying to step forward, someone trying to be a \ngood American, nevertheless conscious of his or her prudent \nresponsibility to protect their family, to protect the assets and the \nvaluables that were there for the security of their family. As much as \nthey wanted to volunteer, they had to suddenly be aware of, ``Is this a \nthreat to my own family?''\n  I mentioned earlier this morning Terry Orr, who played for the \nWashington Redskins, was in the Capitol the other day and recounted the \nexperience of joining the team and of senior players immediately taking \nhim and putting him in the breach, so to speak, of voluntarism. It is \nsomething he wanted to do. Then, as his career grew and he matured in \nit, he turned to the rookies coming behind him and said: ``Look, this \nis important work for the youth of the Capitol city.'' And he was \nstruck by the response.\n  The response was, ``What is my liability? Am I putting my family at \nrisk here?'' It was a whole new sequence or reaction to asking for \nvolunteers. That is what this sentence means, ``As publicity about the \nlawsuits and insurance crunch raised volunteers' apprehension, their \nwillingness to serve waned.''\n  This 12-page piece of legislation--this is not a 1,500-page bill. \nThis is not overhaul of Medicare. It is 12 pages. Its effort is \ndirected at putting some protective buffer around people who want to \nstep forward and be volunteers and reduce the level of fear that they \nwould have with regard to the welfare of their own family.\n  It goes on to say, ``Even though reports of actual judgments against \nvolunteers remain scarce, the specter of a multimillion dollar claim \ncasts a deep shadow.'' So what is being said here is you do not have to \nhave a lot of judgments. You do not have to have a litany of cases that \ngo against volunteers. You only have to have the specter or possibility \nof the risk to be public, and suddenly the volunteers are very, very \ncautious about what they do and what they do not do.\n\n  ``Several surveys conducted during this period revealed that many \norganizations suffered board resignations''--which is what we alluded \nto earlier today--``and volunteer recruitment difficulties''--which I \njust talked about in the case of Washington Redskin player Terry Orr. \n``The lawyer on the board, a nonprofit's staff role, was often the \nfirst to resign.'' I have experienced this myself. My guess is the \nPresident has experienced this issue.\n  I told this story earlier today--over the weekend, I was down at \nRobins Air Force base and it was raining badly. So we were trying to \nget from the aircraft to the car. I misjudged where the corner of the \ncar door was, which is what has caused this mark across my forehead. As \nI got on in the car, the Air Force Colonel say, ``Gosh, I hope you are \nnot going to sue the Air Force.'' Which is just--it permeates our \nsociety, the question of fear of lawsuits.\n\n       Faced with the prospect of charitable organizations closing \n     their doors and potential volunteers staying home, \n     legislators sought to offer protective warmth from the chill \n     of potential liability. On the national level, U.S. \n     Representative John Porter, Illinois, dramatized the problem.\n\n  This is the point I want to make. This morning the other side talked \nabout how suddenly this new idea was thrust on the Senate. It had not \nhad the appropriate length of debate or hearings and that sort of \nthing. Like this is a new idea that has been around. Listen to this:\n  ``On the national level, U.S. Representative John Porter, Republican, \nIllinois, dramatized the problem in 1985''--Let's see, now, that is 12 \nyears ago--``by assigning bill number 911 to his proposed Volunteer \nProtection Act.'' Eleven years ago, and Lord knows how many thousands \nof volunteers who have not shown up in the 12 years, or how many \nhundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent in an effort to try to \nrespond to this that therefore did not go to help a child, an elderly \nperson, a sick person, a person that has suffered from one of these \nfloods that we have been talking about earlier today? Who knows how \nmany people have not volunteered for that board or went out and coached \nLittle League Baseball? Good grief, 1985, for a very narrowly defined \neffort to protect this unique quality in American government--or in \nAmerican life, the volunteer.\n  ``His proposal,'' Mr. Porter's, ``was a Federal bill designed to spur \nState adoption of volunteer protection laws. As has been mentioned by \nthe other side, in 1990, President Bush released a model act and called \nfor State-by-State adoption. By then, though, each State legislator had \nalready addressed the matter at least once and few were eager to tackle \nit again.''\n  The other side tried to allude to a lapse on our side of our role in \nfederalism. They were suggesting we had forgotten our interest in State \nmanagement of issues. But, as Senator McConnell said when he came to \nthe floor, this is a national issue. It has State ramifications, but it \nis a national issue. These hundreds of organizations, some of which I \ncited this morning that are supporting the Volunteer Protection Act, \nare national organizations and they are looking for national relief. \nThey are interactive across State borders. They are dealing with \norganizations who represent multistate jurisdictions. Then it goes on \nto say, this article: ``The blame falls largely on the patchwork nature \nof volunteer protection laws, which vary tremendously throughout the \nUnited States. To facilitate analysis and comparison, the\n\n[[Page S3785]]\n\nnonprofit risk management center compiled them in a publication.''\n\n  The article draws on that analysis. Mr. President, the Volunteer \nProtection Act does recognize the role of the States. And in those \ncases in which all the parties are of a single State, the State has the \noption and authority to opt out of this legislation if the case is at \nall related to citizens of the same State.\n  It also allows the States laws that are more protective of the \nvolunteers to stay, in effect, without change or preemption. But this \narticle itself points very directly at the difficulties faced by the \npatchwork nature of volunteer protection laws as they exist today.\n  Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor. I see the Senator from \nIndiana has arrived and would like to comment on the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for \nyielding and, more important, thank him for his leadership on this \nissue. I listened, as the Presiding Officer for the past hour, to his \nremarks about the irony of the voluntarism conference taking place in \nPhiladelphia at the same time the U.S. Senate is attempting to secure \napproval to go ahead and debate--not vote on but just debate--the \npassage of legislation that will make voluntarism more acceptable to \nthe American people and provide an incentive for people to volunteer.\n  I had the privilege of being designated as a delegate to that summit \nconference in Philadelphia, and as a delegate attended various \nmeetings, shared time with the President and former Presidents who were \nthere, along with Colin Powell, and Ray Chambers, and others who were \ninstrumental in putting that together.\n  The whole thrust of the meeting, the whole thrust of the summit, the \nfactor that drew all of our current living Presidents to this summit, \nwas the idea that we needed to stimulate and do whatever we could to \nencourage Americans to take a more active role in solving some of the \nproblems that our families face and in contributing their time and \ntheir resources on a volunteer basis to help particularly those in \nneed.\n  The thrust was directed toward children, children that were falling \ninto what we describe as an at-risk category, children without fathers \nat home, children without the opportunities that many children in \nAmerica enjoy.\n  The goal--2 million children reached by the year 2000--is an \nambitious goal, one which will require considerable commitment on the \npart of the American people. Yet a number of organizations were there \nthat pledged their commitment to reach that goal, a number of \ncorporations pledging their efforts to ensure and help their employees \nparticipate in reaching that goal, whether it is mentoring a fatherless \nchild in an organization like Big Brothers/Big Sisters or working \nthrough Boys Clubs, Girls Clubs, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, various \nliteracy programs, teaching a child to read, juvenile delinquency, drug \nabuse, teen pregnancy, all of these human problems that require not the \nhand of big Government--we have tried that, and it has been wanting--\nbut involves the personal commitment on the part of individuals working \nwith those children.\n  One of the most encouraging things about that summit was that there \nwas a widespread recognition on the part of people from both parties, \ndifferent points on the ideological spectrum and political spectrum. \nThere was a consensus that big Government was not the solution, that \nour, in many cases well-motivated, efforts in the past to reach out \nthrough the mechanism of Government to address these human needs had \nnot succeeded, and that while no one felt comfortable with simply \nabsolving ourselves of all responsibility, hoping that the so-called \nfree marketplace of social interaction and community support would fill \nthe gaps, clearly there was a consensus that the solution did not lie \nin more funding for various Government agencies, more Government \ninvolvement, but the solution lay in individuals making commitments to \nhelp kids in need, to help organizations in their communities that were \nhelping children in need. And this was a very uplifting occasion.\n  As I said, our former Presidents and our current President was there. \nWe had Republicans and Democrats speaking from the platform, \norganizations that are doing extraordinary work today in our \ncommunities all across America. But the bottom line was, in order to \naccomplish the task ahead, we need more volunteers. We need more people \nto commit time to join up with a child in need or a family in need or \nan organization that is there to serve those people in need. We need to \nrecognize those who are already making those sacrifices in \nvolunteering, and we need to encourage more to do it.\n  Anyone who has been involved in volunteer work understands that the \nbenefit exceeds the sacrifice, if we can even label it a sacrifice; \nthat the recipient of the volunteer's efforts obviously is supported \nand helped; but the rewards, not money rewards, but the intangible \nrewards that come to the volunteer are very, very significant.\n  So out of all of this, I am confident, we have come to a time when \nthere is a renewed interest in supporting our neighbor, supporting \nthose in need, providing effective compassion, expanding the role of \nvolunteer community organizations and charitable organizations, \nexpanding the role of the church and encouraging its work in dealing \nwith some of these problems.\n  But one of the key impediments to that involvement of voluntarism \nthat we are trying to encourage has been what I would call almost a tax \non voluntarism. That tax is the result of lawsuits, many of which are \nfrivolous, that have been filed against organizations or against boards \nof directors of organizations or of volunteers. It is a discouragement \nand a disincentive for individuals to volunteer.\n  The Senator from Georgia referenced that. The first response to a \nbump on the head or a trip on a step is, ``I hope you're not going to \nsue us,'' because we seem to be in a pattern of litigation in what has \nbeen described as the world's most litigious society. It seems that for \nmany the first thought is, ``How can I collect? Who can I sue?'' Well, \nit is one thing if individuals are covered by insurance policies; it is \nanother if they either are not covered or those insurance policy \npremiums have risen to the point where organizations are finding it \ndifficult to pay the premium.\n  Over just the past few years, liability premiums for volunteer \nassociations have risen 155 percent. So organizations like Little \nLeague and Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, volunteer \nfire departments, and all the myriad number of volunteer associations \nand groups that provide so much important help to people in this \ncountry are finding themselves squeezed, squeezed by higher liability \npremiums, squeezed from their ability to attract people to serve on \ntheir boards, to attract volunteers to work in the work of the agency.\n\n  We need to recognize that every dollar that is devoted to increased \nliability premiums means that it is a dollar less that goes to meet the \nneeds that the organization or the individual is attempting to address.\n  Congress has attempted to address this in piecemeal fashion. I was \nproud to lead the effort last year to pass the bill that provided \nliability protection for doctors and nurses that volunteered their time \nto those in poverty that did not have insurance. Senator Santorum \npassed a bill that provided restaurants that donate food to homeless \nshelters, food banks and soup kitchens some protection from liability.\n  But essentially what we are talking about here today is a bill that \nwould expand the scope of liability protection to the numerous agencies \nand literally hundreds of thousands of volunteers who are not now \ncovered or who find that the premiums are prohibitive for liability \ncoverage.\n  Of course, there are protections in the bill here. We are not \nexcusing people from negligence. We are not excusing people for willful \ninjuries or criminal misconduct. If a suit is warranted, the suit can \nbe brought. But what we are saying is that there ought to be some \nprotection against frivolous lawsuits, there ought to be some \nprotection against honest mistakes, there ought to be limitations on \nliability to those who actually bear the responsibility for the injury, \nand not this, what we call joint and several liability, that flows to \nevery member of the organization, every member of the board\n\n[[Page S3786]]\n\nwhich allows lawyers to simply find the deepest pockets or the richest \npockets to sue, and so if one member of a board commits an act which \nwarrants an action against that individual, all members of the board \nfind themselves involved in the lawsuit.\n  As I said, liability insurance can be purchased, but the rising cost \nof that has been prohibitive, and it drains dollars away from the \ncentral purpose of that organization. In many cases we have people who \nare not covered by insurance, yet they want to volunteer their time.\n  Mr. President, just a little bit ago--I think it was just a week or \nso ago--Lynn Swann, who is a former member of the Pittsburgh Steelers \nand is in the National Football League Hall of Fame, testified before \nthe House on the impact of increasing insurance premiums and the \nproblem of liability coverage for Big Brothers/Big Sisters.\n  Lynn Swann is a national spokesperson for Big Brothers/Big Sisters of \nAmerica. I had the privilege of serving on that national board with \nLynn. He has dedicated an extraordinary amount of time and effort to \npromoting the concept of mentoring and promoting Big Brothers/Big \nSisters as an organization that has been established now for nearly 100 \nyears in mentoring children on a one-on-one basis.\n  Lynn testified before the House indicating that the inability to pass \nliability coverage for volunteers was providing a disincentive to \nattracting volunteers to be Big Brothers or Big Sisters. Currently, \nthere are 100,000 individuals in this country who have volunteered \ntheir time on a consistent basis--not a one-time only, but a consistent \nbasis--to mentor and be a Big Brother or Big Sister to a child from a \nfatherless family, to a child who needs someone to come alongside, to \nbe with them, to help them with homework or just to listen to them on \nthe phone or to incorporate them in some of their daily activities, to \nbe a friend, to be a Big Brother, to be a Big Sister.\n  But there are 40,000 young people on the waiting list because we do \nnot have enough Big Brothers, Big Sisters to match those on the waiting \nlist. One of the reasons is that agencies have not been able to attract \nenough people because people are concerned about frivolous lawsuits or \nliability actions taken against them that they know they are probably \ngoing to have to pay or settle to some extent just to keep from having \nto spend 2 or 3 or 4 years in court dragged out through an expensive \nlegal process.\n  So we go back to the original point. At a time when this Nation's \nattention is focused on the concept of voluntarism and how it can \nsupport those genuinely in need, how it can provide help for children \nat a time when former Democrat and Republican Presidents and our \ncurrent President are meeting in Philadelphia to promote and encourage \nand ask and plead with individuals and corporations and businesses and \nentities in America to do more, the U.S. Senate is voting to not allow \ndebate on a strictly--I guess it was strictly a partisan vote. There \nwas a clear division between the Republicans and Democrats on this \nissue. They were voting to not even allow debate and amendments to go \nforward to move to final passage of this particular legislation.\n  So on the one hand, our Nation's attention is focused on the plea of \nPresident Clinton, former President Bush, former President Ford, and \nformer President Carter to get more involved, to volunteer, to support \nagencies that are reaching out to children in need, calling for 2 \nmillion additional volunteers by the year 2000.\n  Yet at the very same time the U.S. Senate is saying, no, we are not \ngoing to remove impediments to voluntarism, we are not going to adopt \nsensible measures to protect those who give voluntarily of their time \nto serve the needs of our communities and serve the needs of our fellow \ncitizens, we are not going to do anything to take away any barriers \nthat might be in place that are identified as limiting the size and the \nscope of the volunteer effort.\n\n  It is just such a disconnect, just such an irony that our President \nis in Philadelphia urging us to become more involved in that spirit of \nvoluntarism that I was privileged to experience in Philadelphia over \nthe last 2 days, and that it is now clouded over with a deep, dark \ncloud that basically says, no, we are going to protect the lawyers, we \nare going to give the lawyers more protection than we are going to give \nthe volunteers, we are going to make somebody who volunteers for Girl \nScouts or Boy Scouts or Big Brothers/Big Sisters or any of a number of \norganizations and wants to give their time to the board, we are going \nto say that you are jointly and severally liable, if somebody on that \nboard makes a mistake, we are going after the guy with deep pockets, we \nare going after the guy with all the money.\n  So good people who want to give their time and effort to volunteer \norganizations and volunteer help find themselves restricted and limited \nbecause they may not have control over an individual on a board that \ndoes something that brings a lawsuit, that allows every member of that \nboard to be swept up in that lawsuit.\n  We are providing a disincentive to those citizens and volunteers who \nwant to give of their time, who want to provide the support that \nchildren need in this country by saying, ``Do not forget about the \nlawsuit liability. Watch out for the trial lawyers.''\n  We are losing people, 40,000 young people on the waiting list for a \nBig Brother or Big Sister, and we cannot reach out to volunteers with \nany assurance that they will be protected from sometimes some of the \nmost frivolous, meaningless, but yet effective lawsuits filed against \nthem.\n  Are we foreclosing the right of someone to go after criminal \nmisconduct or willful actions? Absolutely not. That protection is \nprovided in the legislation that we are debating. What we are trying to \ndo is make it easier for people to be good neighbors, to be good \ncitizens. What we are trying to do is to provide a recognition that as \nGovernment necessarily scales back its effort at providing help for \nhumans in need--which has been an extraordinary effort. I am not \nquestioning the motivation of those who attempted it. It just simply \nhas not produced results.\n  There is a recognition across the spectrum now between Democrats and \nRepublicans that we need to find better alternatives, that we need to \nsupport the role of the church, we need to encourage the role of the \nchurch, parish, and synagogue, of charity, of volunteer charity \norganizations, of volunteer associations, of PTA's, of all of the \ngroups that are working now in our community--including the Salvation \nArmy, on and on it goes--who want to do more but need help to do more. \nThey need our involvement, No. 1. They need our funds, No. 2. But No. \n3, the least we can do is remove an impediment to voluntarism when \nsomeone's lawyer says better not be involved with that group because, \nas you know, while it is purely a voluntary act, if something happens \nto some member of the board, this whole board can be sued. Every one of \nyou will find your name on a summons. Every one of you will find your \nname as defendants in a lawsuit. Every one of you will have to pony up \nfor money to pay the attorneys. These guys will squeeze us for years \nuntil we settle, and maybe there is no liability at all, but we cannot \nafford the time. We cannot afford the ultimate money. So we will simply \nput a settlement out and everybody has to kick in. So people are \ndiscouraged from exercising some of their best instincts.\n  This legislation makes a great deal of sense. I hope my colleagues \nwho did not support the cloture motion, the motion to allow us to go \nahead and proceed with this legislation, I hope they will weigh that \naction against what is taking place in Philadelphia. I hope they will \ntake the opportunity, as I just did in our reading room back here, to \ngo and look at the stories and pictures in a whole number of newspapers \nfrom across the country--the Los Angeles Times, the Boston Globe, the \nSt. Louis Post-Dispatch, the Chicago Tribune, and on and on it goes, \nUSA Today--on the front page of every paper out there. A lead item on \nall the news stories last night was the Philadelphia summit, the \nPresident's gathering, organizations pledging, individuals committing \nto a new spirit of voluntarism that, hopefully, will sweep across this \ncountry, hopefully will reach out to those 40,000 kids and Big Brothers \nand Big Sisters that are waiting for a match that can change their \nlife, that can make a difference in their lives. For all those who want \nto expand the board, expand the participation and expand the number of \nvolunteers, I\n\n[[Page S3787]]\n\nhope they will go and read the headlines and look at the pictures. I \nhope they will look at the pictures of the kid waiting for the Big \nBrother/Big Sister match, for the involvement of organizations that can \nhelp their family, for the encouragement of groups like Habitat for \nHumanity and others that are making some an extraordinary difference in \nour world today. We want to do more. We want to do better. We want to \nexpand that effort.\n  What is stopping us? The trial lawyers--the trial lawyers who will \nnot even let us go ahead and debate the bill and vote on the bill. A \ncloture motion has to be filed to prevent a filibuster. Because of a \nstrict party-line vote, which escapes me why every member of the other \nparty feels it necessary to prevent this at the same time their \nPresident is urging, in an eloquent address--one of the best addresses \nI ever heard President Clinton give. I am not often standing at the \nlectern praising the President, but it was an extraordinary address to \nthe thousands that were gathered yesterday in Philadelphia. It was a \nplea for support.\n  Here we are trying to provide one measure of support to remove one \ndisincentive to voluntarism, to serving on a board of directors. As I \nsaid, I am on the national board of Big Brothers and Big Sisters. We \nhave discussed this. Lynn Swann comes down and testifies and says we \ncan put more kids together with more mentors, but one of the things \nthat is holding us back is the liability we expose volunteers to and \nthe extraordinary increase in insurance premiums over the past several \nyears because of all these lawsuits. So every dollar that Big Brothers \nand Big Sisters worked so hard to achieve to provide a match between a \nBig Brother, Big Sister and a little brother and a little sister, every \ndollar that has to go to pay the increased liability premiums is a \ndollar that cannot go to provide for a match or support a match.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will reconsider and allow us to go forward with \nthis. If it needs to be amended, we should amend it. If it needs to be \nmodified, we should modify it. But do not stop it from even being \ndiscussed, debated, and voted on, particularly at a time when our \nPresident and our former Presidents and our Nation is saying, ``We want \nto do more. We need to do more. We must do more.'' We should not throw \na bucket of cold water on what I think is a noble effort, a necessary \neffort, to address some of the basic human needs in this country.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the generosity of the Senator from \nGeorgia in allowing me to address the Senate. I again commend him for \nhis efforts, and hope that when we get to the next cloture vote we can \ndo better than we did today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  First of all, let me just say to my colleague from Indiana that I \nreally appreciate much of what he said, and I also appreciate his \npassion. I do not know anybody more committed to this whole idea of \nvolunteer citizen action and helping people. I deeply respect him for \nit.\n  Mr. President, I think that one of the things I want people to know \nwho are watching this debate is that there are some other things going \non in the Senate right now that are extremely important. This piece of \nlegislation, I think, can be debated and people can deal with the \nsubstance of it, but at the moment, just speaking for Minnesota, and I \nknow there are other Senators that feel very strongly about this in the \nDakotas, we have a disaster relief bill we are trying to get through \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. President, I think one of the stumbling blocks right now--and I \nam really sorry that my colleague from Georgia is faced with this, \nbecause I think it has nothing to do with him at all--with the disaster \nrelief bill, on the one hand you have people like Chairman Stevens of \nthe Appropriations Committee pushing hard to help. I am sure of that. \nBut you now have a proposal--and I am not sure who exactly is playing \nthis game, and it is a game--to attach a continuing resolution on to a \ndisaster relief bill. Mr. President, I think that is the problem we are \nfaced with.\n  The whole issue of liability, the whole question of what kind of tort \nreform there might be in relation to nonprofits and citizen volunteer \nefforts is important. We should get to that legislation. We should vote \nit up or down. I am pleased to debate it. But at the moment I say that \nI think the business of the Senate and the House is to get the \nassistance to people who have really been faced with a real disaster in \ntheir lives. People in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, everybody that \nlived in the city had to vacate. People are not going to be able to get \nback on their own two feet. They will not be able to repair their \nhomes. They will not be able to start their businesses again. This is a \nlife-or-death issue. I do not think I am being melodramatic. We were so \nhopeful there would be action.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Stevens for his work, and certainly Senator \nByrd for his work, but now we have a development which, essentially, \nled to the committee today essentially having to call off its business. \nIt is this proposal that comes from somebody, or somebodies, to attach \na continuing resolution.\n  Now, for people who are listening to this debate and wondering what \nis that all about, let me just be clear about it. What this continuing \nresolution would do is, it would essentially attach on to a disaster \nrelief bill 98 percent of this budget, although if you look to next \nyear, it amounts to a 7-percent cut. In other words, rather than having \nup-or-down votes on appropriations bills, having an honest debate about \nwhat our priorities are or are not, some people would like to play this \ngame of attaching on to what was supposed to be a disaster relief bill \nto provide assistance to families who were waiting for this assistance, \nwho are hoping for this assistance, who are paying for this assistance, \nnow we have this new effort which would put into effect cuts in the \nPell grant program--I will not even go through all the statistics--\nwork-study program, education for disadvantaged children, literacy \nprograms, National Institutes of Health programs, Head Start, senior \nnutrition, the list goes on.\n  Mr. President, in all due respect, I do not know whose proposal this \nis, but I think it is a cowardly way--and I am pleased to debate \nanybody who wants to debate me--it is a cowardly way of loading junk on \nto a disaster relief bill.\n  Mr. President, again, I give all the credit in the world to people \nlike Senator Stevens, who is in there pitching for us, but I do not \nknow who decided to do this, but it is really crass. Mr. President, the \nPresident has already said that he would veto such a piece of \nlegislation because, as President of the United States of America, he \ncannot go back on a commitment he has made to people, the commitment he \nhas made to Pell grants and higher education, the commitment he has \nmade to Head Start, the commitment he made to nutrition programs for \nsenior citizens, he cannot put, through the back door, cuts in those \nprograms.\n  I make a plea, and I would like to have a discussion with my \ncolleague from South Dakota about this. I would like to make a strong \nplea to colleagues. Please join the efforts of Senators like Senator \nStevens, who is in there pitching for us. Please understand there are \npeople in the Dakotas and Minnesota who are really praying for help, \nwho believe we will come through for them, who believe we will be able \nto help their families, who believe we will be able to help them get on \ntheir own two feet so they have a chance to rebuild their lives. Please \ndo not attach this junk on to what is supposed to be a disaster relief \nbill. The business of the Congress right now ought to be to pass this \ndisaster relief bill and get the assistance to people who need it.\n  I just ask my colleagues, the Senator from North Dakota and the \nSenator from South Dakota, what you are hearing from your own States?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, if the Senator from Minnesota would yield for a \nquestion. Mr. President, I spoke earlier this morning, and it is not my \nintention to upset anybody who might have another agenda, except to say \nthat the most significant agenda at the moment is to deal with a lot of \nfolks who have been put flat on their backs by an act of God they \ndidn't expect or request--by floods, fires, and blizzards. In the State \nof North Dakota, for example, in Grand Forks, ND, an entire city \nevacuated. I was in the middle of a town in a boat, a town of 50,000 \npeople in which nobody\n\n[[Page S3788]]\n\nlived. Water was up to the eaves trough in some of the houses. You \ncould barely see the tip of the roof. It was the most remarkable thing \nI have ever seen. It was a most devastating circumstance--except for \nloss of life. Thank God, we didn't have much loss of life.\n  Family after family are losing their homes, their personal property. \nMany of them lost everything they had. But they haven't lost hope. Part \nof the hope is that we will do what is necessary to extend a helping \nhand to folks, to say that you are not alone, the rest of the country \ncares about you. As we have done with others around this country, in \nfires, floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, and other disasters, we have \nsaid here is some significant help to get you on your feet and help \nrebuild and recover and give you some hope.\n  To the Senator from Minnesota, I ask this: We have had tens of \nthousands of people in North Dakota displaced as a result of the \nfloods, and the resulting fires as well. I assume that the similar \ncircumstance exists--in East Grand Forks, the entire city was \nevacuated. I know the Senator has some numbers on evacuations. But is \nit not the case that Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota probably \nsuffered the most significant natural disaster we have had in the \nhistory of our three States?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague--and I am pleased to take \nquestions from both of my colleagues--he is quite right. It is a \nnightmare. It is something that nobody ever could have predicted, and \neverybody had to be evacuated from East Grand Forks. In other towns, \nlike Breckenridge or Ada, not everybody in the town had to leave, but \nin Ada, the school is destroyed and has to be rebuilt. People had to be \nevacuated from a nursing home. There was a tremendous amount of damage. \nThe community center was essentially destroyed. In Breckenridge, I met \nsmall business people who said, ``We need start-up grant assistance.''\n  Again, I say to my colleagues, I understand the importance of this \npiece of legislation that is on the floor. But at this point in time, I \nthink the first priority ought to be to get this disaster relief to \npeople. I believe we operate by the rule, Mr. President--I always have \nas a Senator--that it is ``there but for the grace of God go I.'' I \nhave always voted for disaster assistance for other States because I \nknow something like this could happen to people in Minnesota. We count \non people being there with us. I don't want this to be something that \nis symbolic. We need to get assistance to people--not 100 percent \nreplacement, but at least something to help them get back on their own \ntwo feet.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. First, the Senator from Minnesota has done yeoman work \nin trying to bring relief to the tremendous, catastrophic disaster that \nhas taken place in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota over the \nrecent months. We have 125,000 people rendered homeless in those States \ncurrently. I have visited all three States, and I have seen families, \neven those who can get back into their homes, who have no sewage, have \nno water, the roads are broken up. They are doing dishes in campers and \nusing port-o-johns that are temporarily installed in the front yard, \nand sandbags are everywhere. It is chaos in so many of these areas. \nLivestock have been lost, equipment has been lost, buildings have \ncollapsed under the weight of snow, culverts are out of place, bridges \nare down. The loss is a mess through this part of the northern Great \nPlains. It has been a disaster that has visited 22 States, although the \nSenator and I are most familiar with the problems, obviously, of \nMinnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. We have tremendous urgency \nfor assistance, as this country has always done during times of this \nlevel of distress.\n  It appears that if extraneous language is added to this disaster \nlegislation, for which there is broad-based bipartisan support, that \nwill jeopardize the passage of the legislation and, even if it were to \npass, would subject it to a veto and we would be back to square one. \nTimeliness will have been lost and we will have delayed the level of \nassistance that is so badly needed on an urgent basis.\n  I ask the Senator from Minnesota, does it appear to the Senator that \namong the most egregious things trying to be added or forced on to this \nlegislation are proposals that, while they are referred to as a 98-\npercent CR, which to many people would sound reasonably innocuous, but \nthe real consequence of that would be, would it not, over the coming \nyear that we would in fact see college aid cut by $1.8 billion, 400,000 \nstudents would lose Pell grants, 52,000 children would be cut from Head \nStart, we would have to end the Crop Insurance Program--one of the very \nvehicles that is being used to provide some level of relief for the \nfarmers and ranchers who have been badly hit by this disaster--200,000 \nveterans would lose medical care, 700,000 mothers and infants per month \nwould lose Women, Infants and Children Nutrition Program services, \nIndian health services would be cut, there would be 500 fewer air \ntraffic controllers and 173 fewer security officers hired for purposes \nof air security. Is it not correct that not only would we have to buy \ninto this, but I would have to ask the Senator from Minnesota, \nprocedurally, is it not also correct that we would not be permitted a \nvote up or down and there would be no debate on policy initiatives of \nsuch enormous consequence if we were to allow this kind of extraneous \nlanguage onto the emergency legislation that we so badly need to pass \nimmediately?\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Well, Mr. President, in response to my colleague from \nSouth Dakota, first of all, he is quite correct about what this \ncontinuing resolution would mean in personal terms for people in our \nStates. Actually, if you look at a 98-percent cut--we can see where \nother cuts have taken place. As a matter of fact--and my colleague \noutlined some of the figures--let's translate it into personal terms \none more time. I do not believe that people in South Dakota or \nMinnesota or others across the country are interested in reductions in \nfinancial aid and Pell grants so that higher education can be more \naffordable. I do not believe that. We have been reading about and \ntalking about the very early years being so important in the \ndevelopment of the brain, that we have to make sure children at a very \nyoung age have adequate nutrition. Do you know what? We can't play \nsymbolic politics with children's lives. If we are going to be \nespousing that, we better make the investment. I don't think people \nwant to see cuts in nutrition programs for children.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. If the Senator will yield, would the Senator agree that \nthere is an appropriate time and place for a debate about whether Head \nStart should be continued or whether crop insurance should be continued \nor nutrition programs should be continued and at what level, and that \nthe timeliness of that debate ought to be in the context of the \nappropriations process, rather than doing an end-run on the normal \nprocess and tying it to this badly needed legislation?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from South Dakota that that is \nprecisely the case. I was simply trying to make the argument that I \nbelieve these cuts are not acceptable to people in the country, and \nthis is not an intellectually honest or policy-honest way of doing it. \nWe can have the debate on all these appropriations bills and we can \nhave up-or-down votes and be accountable. I think this is a very \ncowardly way--and that is a pretty strong word to use--or a back-door \napproach to try to make cuts in some of these programs that are so \nimportant to the lives of the people we represent, and it is just \nadding junk onto what should be a straight disaster relief bill.\n  Let's not play around with the lives of the people in the 22 affected \nStates. I invite any of my colleagues, I say to my colleague from South \nDakota, before you do something like this--and, again, I know Chairman \nStevens has tried to be in there pitching for the people in our \nStates--before you play this kind of game, come on out and look into \nthe faces and eyes of some of the people. They are like refugees. The \npeople in our States are like refugees. They are homeless and are \ntrying to get back home and are trying to repair their homes. They are \ntrying to move back into their homes with their children. Why play this \nkind of game with their lives? Let's bring this disaster relief bill \nbefore the Senate, and let's get the assistance out there to people who \nneed it.\n\n[[Page S3789]]\n\n  If my colleagues then want to propose reductions in Pell grants and \nnutrition programs for senior citizens and reductions in the Women, \nInfants, and Children Program, and in all of the veterans benefits, go \nahead and do it. We will debate it all. But this is an effort to \nessentially close off debate, not be accountable. I say to my colleague \nfrom South Dakota, the political part of it that I think is worst of \nall is those who are playing this game--and I hope it is very few, so \nthey will back off--know the President will veto it. He would have no \nother choice. But then people are still waiting back in our States.\n  So we urge our colleagues to please not go forward with this \nproposal. I cannot say anything more important right now. I say to my \ncolleagues from Georgia and Wyoming, it is not the debate you and I \nwill really soon finish up. But I know if you were out here and it was \nyour States, you would be saying the same thing. Please, just get a \ndisaster relief bill through, and then whatever you want to add or \ndebate by way of priorities on the budget, or wherever you want to cut, \nor whatever, we can debate that. But don't do it on a disaster relief \nbill. Please don't add this continuing resolution onto a disaster \nrelief bill. Please don't junk it up. Leave it the way it is. Let's try \nto get the best possible assistance program through the Senate and the \nHouse. Let's try to get relief to these people.\n  These people are really down. But in our States we have seen the \nworst of times bring out the best in people. It is just amazing. We \nwere talking about volunteer efforts. It is amazing the number of \npeople who were sandbagging and who have taken strangers into their \nhomes, and the number of people who have done food drives, and the \nnumber of people who are helping in every possible way. But it is \nreally hard; it is really hard when you have been flooded out of your \nhome, when you have had to leave your community. We need to give these \npeople some hope now. The best way to give them hope is to try to get \nsome of this assistance to the people.\n  The reason I speak with some indignation is that I thought we were \ngoing to be able to move forward. I hoped we would be able to move \nforward Thursday in the Appropriations Committee. There are two \ndifferent issues. No. 1, we have to make sure we have categories of \nassistance that provide the help to individual people. We have to have \nthe flexibility and we have to give enough money to help people get on \ntheir own two feet to rebuild their lives. No. 2, we have the threat of \nadding a continuing resolution, which is a huge mistake. It is playing \ngames with disaster relief. It is playing games with the agony of \npeople. It is playing games with the pain of people. It is playing \ngames with families in our States. It is profoundly mistaken, it is \nprofoundly wrong, and I hope whoever is thinking about doing this will \nplease not do it.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia for letting me \nspeak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to make it clear that the \nproposal that is before the Senate is a motion to proceed to S. 543, \nwhich is the Volunteer Protection Act. I will work right off the \ncomment of my colleague from Minnesota that we should not be playing \npolitics or symbolism for something that is as central and fundamental \nas trying to respond to people in need. The very volunteers he talks \nabout, this legislation applies to them. In fact, the Senator from \nKentucky earlier today referred to the problems involved with his \nfloods. As you know, my State suffered a 500-year-level flood from \nHurricane Alberto, 200 miles long and 200 miles wide, as it marched \nthroughout the State. I hearken to the point that the Senator made, \nthat sometimes the worst of times produces the best in people. I don't \nthink anyone has ever been through any of these that have not seen, \nwith great admiration, the spontaneous response of neighbor to \nneighbor, American to American.\n  The legislation before us ought to be managed, in my judgment, in \nabout 2 to 4 hours. It is 12 pages long. Its concepts have been before \nthe Senate for 12 years. Yet, we are in a filibuster over whether to \neven be able to debate legislation that, certifiably, is directed at \nthe very people the Senator from Minnesota is talking about, and that \nis the thousands upon thousands of volunteers from his State and from \nother States. That is another key point. I know right now--I don't know \nthe number--that there are thousands of volunteers in your State and \nothers' that don't live there. They have come from other States, which \nis the very point that we have been making. The context of parameters \naround the protection of good people just trying to respond is a \nnational issue.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If the Senator will yield for a question, I want to \nask this question of the Senator because I have to leave soon. I didn't \nwant to walk out because he makes a very important point. Would the \nSenator agree with me that it would be best if we could come together \nas two parties and work out these disagreements when it comes to what \nis going to be on the disaster relief bill or when it comes to Alexis \nHerman or judicial appointments, that we can work out an agreement and \nstop basically leveraging different pieces of legislation? I don't \nagree with the Senator on some substantive grounds. But I am sorry the \nSenator is caught up in this. I mean that sincerely. Would he agree \nwith me that we really have to come together and work these things out? \nBecause I understand the Senator's conviction about this particular \npiece of legislation, but I also hope that the Senator will understand \nmy conviction about the mistakes of now adding a continuing resolution \nand trying to put into effect all sorts of budget cuts onto a bill that \nshould be a disaster relief bill. Does the Senator agree that we need \nto get away from all of this?\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I think there has been great discussion in this 105th \nCongress, I say to my colleague from Minnesota, about a bipartisan \neffort. That does require a give and take. Right now, it would appear \nthat in several quadrants that is difficult to achieve. I have served \nin the legislative body an extended period of time, and I think what \nthe Senator points to is always the laudable goal and what all of its \nMembers should reach for. I am sure the Senator from Minnesota will \nagree. I am not surprised that, from time to time, very powerful \ninterests and emotions cause these kinds of strenuous areas. I commend \nthe Senator for being attentive to the needs of his State. It is \nexactly what he should be doing. I have been there myself. I hope that \nas we move through the week, the resolution of the issue which he \naddresses can be accorded. I appreciate the interest in the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Georgia. I say that I am \ninterested. I don't agree with him, but I understand exactly why he \nwants to move forward.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I understand your caveat.\n  Mr. President, we have been joined by the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nwho, I might say, has been at the forefront of a concept called the \n``renewal alliance.'' Even before this legislation was put together, \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania and others--and I have been pleased to be \na small part--have been engaged nationally, not just in Pennsylvania, \nin reaching out, just as this summit did in Philadelphia, and tapping \nthe compassion of the American volunteer on all levels to confront some \nof the most difficult problems with which our country is beset. It is \nentirely appropriate, and I am very pleased that he would take time to \ncome to the floor and talk about what the Volunteer Protection Act \nmeans and does for the very effort that he and these other Senators are \npursuing.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). The Chair \nrecognizes the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia for his kind words and congratulate him on many counts. \nNo. 1, for this piece of legislation. And while this piece of \nlegislation has been around in various forms for quite some time, one \nthing it never had on its side was Paul Coverdell in a leadership role.\n  One thing I found out about this place is things happen when people \nhave the energy, the enthusiasm, a good plan, a good game plan and a \nwillingness to work hard to bring the issue to the fore, and Paul \nCoverdell does\n\n[[Page S3790]]\n\nthat with every issue I have ever seen him engage in. He has taken this \nissue and plucked it out of obscurity and driven it to the front here \nat a very appropriate time.\n  And so the Senator's sense of timing is magnificent in bringing it up \nhere at a time when many of us, who just yesterday were in Philadelphia \nat the volunteer summit, were very moved by what was going on there, \nexcited about the opportunity. I had a tremendous opportunity \npersonally to have a good, long talk with Harris Wofford, who, as you \nknow, I succeeded in the Senate. We had a really delightful \nconversation about how this is a project that, while we may be apart on \nvery many things, we can find common ground on and work together on. In \nfact, we worked together a lot on the summit, to make sure that a lot \nof the small organizations, small charitable organizations and \nnonprofits were included. We understood the significant role that they \nplay in the nonprofit community of America, the volunteer community of \nAmerica.\n  So we saw a lot of coming together--right, left, Republican, \nDemocrat--in Philadelphia. It was a wonderful experience. Bringing this \nbill to the floor was a hope, I guess, on the Senator's part, and \ncertainly on mine, that we would see that spirit continue in the new \nCapitol of the United States, not where it all started in Philadelphia.\n  It is unfortunate that we had a failure with this cloture motion \ntoday just to move to the bill. I think it is in some ways disturbing. \nWe have in a sense solidarity going on on a subject that is at the core \nof who we are as America. I think we had a coming together, an \nunderstanding of the need for all of us to go beyond ourselves and look \nto each other and look at our brothers and our sisters and our \nneighbors, at their needs and the needs of our communities in \nfulfilling the promise of America. That was so clear in Philadelphia \nand yet becomes somewhat murky and cloudy here on the Senate floor, of \nall places, where it should be critically clear that is in fact the \nprerequisite to success in America.\n  It is disturbing, but I am confident, as I am sure the Senator from \nGeorgia is, with continued effort we will bring to the American public, \nas we try to do this afternoon and hopefully will do in the next \nseveral days, the importance of this particular piece of legislation in \nmaking what is going on in Philadelphia a reality.\n  I heard the Senator from Georgia, the Senator from Indiana, the \nSenator from Kentucky, and others talk here about the importance of \nthis legislation to so many nonprofit organizations all across this \ncountry. I could speak for Pennsylvania because that is where I have \ndone the majority of visiting nonprofit organizations that serve the \nneeds of communities, the team mission in the city of Chester in \nDelaware County, where I was just a few weeks ago, and I asked about \nthe issue of the costs associated with liability insurance.\n\n  The director there told me that his costs have skyrocketed in the \nlast few years and now he is paying tens of thousands of dollars for \nliability coverage for his board, just a nonprofit board of well-\nmeaning people in the city of Chester who want to serve in a capacity \nof helping, promote, organize, run, operate a mission in the city of \nChester which has gone under some very tough times over the last \nseveral years. They are expending thousands and thousands of dollars on \nliability coverage to protect themselves and their board members, and \nthey have trouble getting board members and, frankly, have trouble \nsometimes, as I have heard from many other shelters and many other \nplaces, getting people to make a commitment, whether it is a volunteer \ncommitment, whether it is a commitment of resources of some sort, \nwhether it is equipment or loaning people a car or other things. They \nare scared to death of getting sued; we have become so litigious as a \nsociety.\n  The Senator from Georgia has come forward with a great idea of saying \nlet us at least focus on something that is noncontroversial, the human \ncapital involved in serving our fellow citizens, the volunteer, whether \nit is the volunteer board member or the volunteer out there, big \nbrother or sister or someone else. I would think of all the proposals \nthat we have put forward--in fact, just last year we put forward a \nproposal in the same kind of genre. We had a bill which was called the \nEmerson Good Samaritan Food Bank, named after Bill Emerson, a late \nCongressman from Missouri, who was a tremendous champion for hunger in \nAmerica, for feeding of the children of America. Shortly before he died \nlast year, the bill passed in the House, and I was privileged enough to \ncarry that bill here to the Senate and finally pass it on the last day, \nbut I will tell you it took weeks, maybe even months--my memory is a \nlittle faded right now, but maybe even months--to get that bill which \npassed unanimously in the House even to be voted on here on the Senate \nfloor. One Senator or another kept putting holds on this bill.\n  This bill was very simple. It said if you give food to a food bank, \nwe are going to raise the standard from negligence to gross negligence. \nA lot of States have done similar kinds of measures, some have not. \nThis was a voluntary thing. We had a statute on the book--it was not a \nstatute, but it was a suggestion to States with language to do this. It \nwas not a law that required them to raise the standard from negligence \nto gross negligence. The special interests lobby that has been debated \nhere often on the Senate floor today found one Senator after another to \nblock it, to try to amend it, to gut it, to do everything they could. \nAnd finally several of us got together and said certain things aren't \ngoing to happen around here that did not happen before we left, that if \nit did not get through, we were going to get up on the floor and start \nexposing Members of the Senate who were putting holds on this bill and \ntell them, you want to feed the hungry but you do not want to allow \nthose who process food and who sell food, whether it is in restaurants \nor grocery stores, to give it, because surveys showed 90 percent of the \npeople, companies, organizations that refused to give food to food \nbanks refused because they were afraid of legal liability, yet not one \nperson had ever been sued, not one person had ever been sued or taken \n$1 out of any lawyer's mouth. And yet they still held the bill up.\n\n  Well, now we are talking about areas that people actually do get \nsued, and so we have the special interests out in force to stop this \npiece of legislation. And they were successful in convincing enough \nMembers on the other side of the aisle to do just that. I think that is \nunfortunate.\n  This issue goes beyond the issue of just voluntarism in its broadest \nsense. I think you have to understand--and again this has been \nhighlighted in Philadelphia but I think needs to be highlighted here--\nthe importance of voluntarism and community organizations, what Dan \nCoats refers to as the mediating institutions in our society, those \nthat are the buffer between the individual and the Government, those \njust in free association to help each other out in our own communities \nto solve our problems and to be that sort of close-knit group that \nreally makes things happen on a local level. Those mediating \ninstitutions, those nonprofit groups, those civic associations are so \nimportant for our survival as a country.\n  We are a great country for a lot of reasons, but I can tell you that \nmost people do not think we are a great country because we are the \ngreatest superpower, we are the greatest economic power, we have the \ngreatest, most powerful Government. Most people come to this country \nbecause they want to get out of a country that has a powerful \ngovernment that dictates to them. They come to this country because \nthey want to freely associate and raise their family and have the \nfreedom to work where they want and solve their own problems in a \ncommunity setting. Voluntarism is key to making that happen.\n  It is so important for us as a society to recognize, to lift up the \nvolunteer as really the unique thing about America, the unique thing. \nThe unique instrument by which we govern ourselves is that small \norganization that solves most of the problems in our community. Not the \nbig Government, but those small, local organizations with the volunteer \nparticipating that solves the problem but does even something more. It \nbrings out the best in the individual, the volunteer.\n  Most of the people here volunteer for one thing or another in their \nlives.\n\n[[Page S3791]]\n\n How many people, when they volunteered, left that assignment, that \nmission, that duty, and as they are walking out say, ``You know, I \nhelped somebody. But, you know, I got more out of it, I am sure, than \nthat person that I helped got out of it.''\n  See, voluntarism is not just about helping somebody else. It is about \nunderstanding more about yourself, it is about broadening your own \nhorizons. It is about a real fundamental understanding of what your \npurpose is as an individual in our society. So, to the extent that we \nput barriers up to people experiencing that growth, their own personal \ngrowth, as well as a barrier to meeting real human needs, we are all--\nthose who need the help and those who are not participating in \nhelping--both lose. And what we have seen, and you have heard all the \nnumbers and all the statistics--you have seen how this problem, this \nbarrier, is a real barrier. This is not something that we cooked up and \nsaid, ``Gee, let us just throw something out here to really honk off \nthe other side.'' This is a real barrier.\n  We heard Lynn Swann talk about it from Big Brothers and Sisters. We \nheard Terry Orr, former Washington Redskin, talk about it from Little \nLeague. And Senator Coverdell has read letter after letter at hearings, \nand others--we know the volunteer organizations tell us, plead with us \nto give them some breaks here. They need this relief if they are going \nto serve their duty, their mission, as well as ennoble the people who \nvolunteer, get us to connect with each other.\n  One of the great things, and reasons I am so excited about the \nProject for American Renewal and the Civil Society Project that Senator \nCoats and Senator Coverdell and Senator Ashcroft and Senator Abraham \nhave been working on here in the Senate, and Congressmen Watts and \nTalent--I want to mention Senator Hutchison, who has been very \ninvolved--and Congressman Pitts--I could go on. But the most exciting \nthing, in focusing in on trying to empower the local communities, the \nnonprofit organizations, to do more, is--yes, they do it better. No \nquestion. They are more caring, more compassionate. They do it better, \nthey do it cheaper, much more efficiently. They are volunteers. They \nhave people who do this because of real motivation, inner motivation--\nin many cases spiritual--but true, true inner compassion, not because \nit is a paycheck. Not to say those who do it because it is a paycheck \ndo not have compassion. But that volunteer spirit just comes through \nand people understand it. That is important.\n  But the most important thing that it does in my opinion is it \nreconnects us. One of the things I really fear about our society is we \nare becoming less and less connected to each other. You know, you can \nsit in front of a computer terminal right now and basically live your \nentire life without having to move. You don't have to go outside. You \ndon't have to know who your neighbors are, or the people down the \nstreet, or go to church. You can do it all through television or \nthrough your computer.\n  So we end up, as a society, that people--I am all for individualism. \nI think individualism is great. But, you know, we hear so much about \nindividual rights and individual freedoms and all that stuff, we forget \nabout the responsibility that we have to each other and our neighbors. \nThis is a way to begin.\n  All these things are in Senator Coverdell's legislation. I have \nintroduced several pieces of legislation along the same lines that I \nhope someday we can bring up. I have not brought them up on this bill \nbecause I think this is so important that we move this forward, but we \nhave other pieces of legislation I have introduced to encourage people \nto participate, to connect again, to get outside of that door. There \nare people who need you and, whether you know it or not, you need them.\n\n  To the extent we, here, in the U.S. Senate can remove a barrier, can \nsay: Look, don't be afraid of helping. Don't be afraid of asserting \nyourself. Don't be afraid that someone, Big Brother or big lawyer is \nover your shoulder, looking down at you, analyzing everything you say \nand do. Go out there and follow your heart, do what you know is right \nfor your community and for the kids. The summit focuses so much on \nkids. A lot of the folks we are going to be helping are kids or the \nelderly--people in need.\n  So, what Senator Coverdell is doing, what we are trying to do with \nthe Renewal Alliance, is to empower those local groups to bring down \nthe barriers that stop them from serving more people, to bring down the \nbarriers that are almost in front of people's doors so they do not go \nout and minister to the needs of their neighbors much less--I should \nnot even say that. In some cases they do not even bother to know who \ntheir neighbors are. They just do not want to get involved. ``There are \nall sorts of things that can happen to me if I get involved.''\n  We have to be a country that stops thinking like that. Look, I am not \nsuggesting people do not have legal rights, that if they are harmed \nthey should not have rights and recourses. And we preserve that in this \nlegislation. We are saying, if you are grossly negligent or you are \nreckless in your conduct, you can be sued. And the organization, no \nmatter whether the conduct was negligent or grossly negligent, could \nstill be sued. It is just the individual volunteer, if they happen to \ndo something maybe they should not have, or said--I said something I \nshould not have. I did not mean any harm. It was not reckless, but I \njust threw a baseball at somebody and the kid didn't look.\n  Hopefully, I will not get sued. I did not mean to hit the kid. But, \nbelieve it or not, people get sued for that. It is those kinds of \nactions, those kinds of lawsuits that have such a chilling effect on \nthe human nature that is so typically American, to give, to go out and \nmeet the needs of the people.\n  So, I congratulate, again, the Senator from Georgia for his \ntremendous leadership. I cannot say enough, that this bill is where it \nis today and we are moving forward with this, because of his energy, \nhis enthusiasm, his vision in moving this forward. I stand ready to \nhelp him every step of the way to make this happen. I think this is \nimportant in bringing down those barriers. It is important in building \na better, more civil, more responsible, more compassionate, more \nconnected society. To the extent we can make some little contribution \nhere in the U.S. Senate, we should do so and we should do so \nimmediately.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. If the Senator will yield for a moment; earlier this \nmorning there was discussion, almost because we are Republicans, about \nthe national application of the act. And of course we have explained \nthe national proportions of it, that volunteers are mobile. They are \ngoing into Minnesota and North Dakota right now. These organizations \nhave national application.\n  The Senator mentioned the Emerson Act. For a point of clarification, \nthat legislation, which you struggled through and you were fighting the \nsame kind of forces that we are here, had national application.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is correct; it was.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. In other words, we have established the precedent in \nthis area.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. In the past year, I might add, we passed it by \nunanimous consent; without an opposing voice, in the end, to getting \nthis legislation passed. It had national application. The reason is it \nwas clearly understood that these products travel, just like volunteers \ndo, over State lines. There are companies that are multinational, not \nonly multistate but multinational companies that produce goods, food \nproducts. If there was a chilling effect on one side, they would \nprobably have a uniform policy against it. So we understood the nature \nof the goods involved and, obviously, Members on the other side of the \naisle understood it also and went along on a unanimous vote and it was \nsigned by the President.\n\n  So, it is now law. I can tell you from the experience that I have \nhad, talking to those at the soup kitchens and food banks, \ncontributions are up. And I am somewhat surprised, because most of the \nplaces I go to, oddly enough, do not even know we passed the law. Most \nof those at the soup kitchens and food banks do not even know they can \nnow tell the grocery store or restaurant or pizza parlor, that maybe \nhas some extra pizza there at the end of the day\n\n[[Page S3792]]\n\nor whatever, that they can ship it over here and you do not have to \nworry about a serious legal liability.\n  It has gone up. It is just by some of the folks who happened to pick \nit up. I just suggest, for, hopefully, those listening here, and for \nthose Senators in particular listening, we did something in \nPennsylvania as a result of that just recently, where we sent a letter \nout to all the different food banks and soup kitchens in my State to \ninform them of the legislation, to encourage them. And, in fact, I even \noffered to write the different grocery stores, food processors, and the \nlike in my State, to encourage them.\n  We have a duty here, as leaders in our community, to try to \neffectuate that change. But, it was a long answer to the Senator's \nquestion, but I do so because I want to emphasize, not only did this \npass bipartisanly, signed by the President, but it has already had a \npositive impact even in the first 2 months, the proportions of which I \ndon't think we know yet because I don't think the information has been \ndisseminated to all the parties who could benefit from this knowledge.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The reason I asked the question was, first, to deal \nwith the question brought up this morning about the importance of \nnational policy with regard to--I mean, the summit was not about \nvolunteers in Pennsylvania. The summit was about volunteers in America. \nThis legislation is designed to protect volunteers in America.\n  I will close with this and yield to the Senator from Missouri. \nImagine, if you would, Senator, what will happen when Little League \nBaseball and United Way and the American Red Cross can stand up and \nsay, ``come on, volunteers. We have removed a major impediment for you \nto come forward.''\n  Given your example, you can imagine. We will be freeing up America to \nget back to what it has always done so well, volunteering, and \nresponding to that eloquent address you heard in Philadelphia from \nPresident Clinton.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania \nand the Senator from Georgia for talking about very important things \nthat relate to the way in which we will operate as a nation, whether we \nsink or swim, whether we survive or succumb in the next century. I do \nnot think Washington is the answer to the problems of this country. I \ndon't think it is Wall Street. I think it is Main Street. It is how we \nrespond to issues as people, what the character of America is.\n  I believe we have the right character in this country. It is \nhistorically understood; it has been recognized by people around the \nworld. Other countries don't solve problems the way Americans do, and, \nfrankly, they don't solve them as well as we do. They reserve to \nGovernment, to the heavy hand of bureaucracy, so many things that we \njust like to roll up our sleeves and attend to ourselves.\n  We have to be careful that our system of resolving disputes does not \nimpair our capacity to release the energy and the creativity of the \nproblem-solving nature of the American people.\n  Over the last 30 or 40 or 50 years, we have seen a constant creep of \nGovernment and of rules about dispute resolution that has made it \nharder and harder for individual citizens to be involved in doing good, \nwhich is really the character of this great country.\n  Alexis de Tocqueville, whose ride through America 150 years ago is \nbeing celebrated by C-SPAN this year--as a matter of fact, they are \nduplicating it--put it this way: America was great because her people \nwere good. It wasn't because we had the corridors of the bureaucracy in \nWashington well populated, or it wasn't because the Congress was a \nparticularly strong or effective body. It was because people were good. \nHe talked about the fact that people formed associations and formed \ngroups and alliances for almost every purpose in this country because \nfree people, when they see a need, meet the need. That is what we want \nAmerica to be.\n  We have had so many problems recently where we found that our system \nfor litigation has made it hard for people to solve problems. As a \nmatter of fact, the Gallup organization conducted a poll in which it \nfound that one out of every 10 charities surveyed said they have had \ntrouble with litigation and it has caused people to refuse to serve on \ntheir boards of directors and the like.\n  Frankly, a number of States responded to that poll, and they enacted \nprotection for the people who are on the board of directors of the Red \nCross, or the board of directors of the United Way. That was an \nappropriate thing to do to protect those individuals. But the average \nneighbor of mine is not on the board of directors of the Red Cross. My \naverage neighbor and my own activity have more often been just in the \nvolunteering capacity, doing the work, driving the Meals on Wheels. I \nhave driven Meals on Wheels routes over and over again. I wasn't on the \nboard of directors.\n  It strikes me that it is appropriate to protect the folks on the \nboard of directors, but how about the volunteer? It is OK to protect \nthe silk-stocking folks in the boardroom, but how about the person on \nthe front line? How about the coach of the Little League, one of the \ncases I previously mentioned, that was shocking to the conscience of \nthe American people. As a matter of fact, it still almost strikes me as \nbeing humorous, the case in Runnemede, NJ, 15 years ago.\n  The coach sent the kid from shortstop to left field. The mom \nprotested: ``He's a born shortstop, not a left fielder.'' A fly ball \ncame. The kid missed it, the ball hit him in the eye, and the coach got \nsued.\n  Mr. President, we cannot have the value of male role models --and we \nneed them desperately in our cities and our communities --and the \ndiscipline and sense of teamwork that sports provide to help people \ndevelop and have a situation where a mom can say, ``Well, my son plays \nonly shortstop and not left field, and if you put him in left field, \nyou'll be the victim of a lawsuit.''\n  I have also talked about the fellow who was the Scout leader in the \nNorthwest, with the Cascade Pacific Council, and the boys who were \nplaying touch football. I suppose they must have proven he was \nnegligent for allowing the boys to play touch football. I don't think \nour Scoutmaster could ever get us ratcheted down below flag football. \nWe wanted to play tackle football. Here the restraint had been \nexercised to play touch football, and the scoutmaster ends up with a $7 \nmillion judgment against him, because he cared enough about the young \npeople of his community to volunteer. Yes, the courts did reduce the \njudgment from $7 million to $4 million. Well, for most folks, $4 \nmillion isn't much better than $7 million.\n\n  It reminds me of the first time I got sued. I called my wife Janet. I \nsaid, ``Good news and bad news.''\n  She said, ``What is the bad news?\"\n  I said, ``We've been sued.''\n  She said, ``What is the good news?\"\n  I said, ``Well, it is for $65 million.''\n  It wouldn't make much difference if it was for $650, we didn't have \nit.\n  The point is, you have folks willing to volunteer, to extend \nthemselves, to reach out and say, ``We care for those beyond our own \ncircle,'' and this is what makes America America. American communities \nare not defined by boundary lines and streets. They are not defined by \ngeography and statute books. They are not defined in the property \nrecords. American communities are defined in the hearts of Americans \nbecause they are groups of people who love each other. That is probably \na word some people would blanch at, someone saying on the floor of the \nSenate that we love each other. But that is what we mean when we say, \n``I'll help your son or daughter be a part of the team or scout \ntroop,'' or ``I'll help them be a part of the soccer team. I love this \ncommunity, and I'm willing to invest myself in it.''\n  What is the price tag for investing yourself in a community now? We \nhave a legal system that may make the price tag your own children's \ncollege education, or your car, or your house. A $4 million judgment \nfor being a Scout leader and for somehow not stopping a touch football \ngame among boys? That is a pretty stiff price tag to pay.\n  I am reminded of the case in Evanston, IL. The Junior League wanted \nto set up a shelter for battered women. No insurance company would \ninsure them. What happened? The shelter didn't happen. The insurance \ncompany said, ``You have to run the shelter for 3 years before we will \nextend coverage. Because of the litigious nature of our society\n\n[[Page S3793]]\n\nand everybody suing everybody, even the people you are trying to help \nturn around and sue you, and since our court allows it, we won't insure \nyou until you have had 3 years of experience showing us you can run the \nshelter and what the risks will be.''\n  We are still waiting for the 3 years of experience, but we don't have \nthe shelter. We are out of whack, and we need to readjust this. We need \nto put it back in a framework where ordinary citizens can offer \nthemselves. This isn't something that is localized or just a tiny \nfraction of the country. It is all across the United States of America.\n  Here is a statement from the president of the United Way of San \nFrancisco. I believe this was a couple of years ago:\n\n       As fear of lawsuits drives away volunteers, it does more \n     than threaten or lower the number of people available to \n     charity. It threatens to bureaucratize organizations known \n     for their hands-on approach. It would replace the personal \n     touch with the impersonal touch of organizations afraid to be \n     different.\n\n  Here is an interesting article, entitled ``A Thousand Points of \nFright?'' Not a thousand points of light. We do need for people to be \npoints of light. I didn't think a thousand points of light was corny. I \nthought it was the character of America. I thought it reflected what is \ngreat about this country, the fact that we care for each other, we \nliterally love each other enough to put aside some of our own \nambitions, to set aside some of our own time to make some sacrifices. \nBut should we make the sacrifice the ultimate sacrifice? Should we make \nit so that you have to risk everything that you and your family stand \nfor?\n  The article says:\n\n       Lawsuit fears are dampening enthusiasm for volunteers, and \n     the White House is beginning to take notice.\n\n  I am grateful the White House is beginning to take notice. I was in \nPhiladelphia on Sunday and on Monday, and I commend the President. I \nthink inspiring us to be the very best we can be and to help each other \nin this culture is inspiring us to be what we ought to be as Americans. \nBut it takes more than inspiration, especially in the context of \nlitigation, where we might face the potential that we would make it \nimpossible to provide for our own families, to see to it that our \nchildren have what they need, just because we cared enough about our \ncommunity to do something special, something extra.\n\n  The proposal before us says if you want to volunteer, we will provide \nan opportunity for you to do so in a context of reasonability. It \nsimply says you are not going to be responsible for harm while you are \ndelivering those services in a reasonable way. It does not relieve the \norganizations of responsibility. It just says that the volunteer \nhimself or herself will not have to give up his or her family's \npotential in the next weeks, months, years, or decade or so, or \nwhatever it is that would result from an extraordinary judgment.\n  Over and over again, whether it is the ``A Thousand Points of \nFright?'' article, whether it is the president of the United Way of San \nFrancisco, whether it is the story about Runnemede, NJ, and the Little \nLeague or the story about the Cascade Pacific Council and the \nScoutmaster with the $4 million judgment, we know there is a problem, \nand we ought to do something about it.\n  We know there have been some things done, mostly to protect people in \nthe board rooms and on the foundation governing bodies. But what \nhappens to the average American who is not on the board but just a \nperson who cares enough to give some of his own time or her own time, \nthe most valuable thing?\n  Perhaps more, in terms of the children of America--and the conference \nin Philadelphia focused on children--the thing that we lack the most is \nnot money. The thing we lack the most for children is relationships. \nThe Government has been spreading a lot of money around for a long \ntime, but the kids are without role models, they are without \nrelationships, they are without the opportunity to learn from adults. I \nthink it is time for us to begin to provide a context in which that \nrelationship can reappear, and that is what this bill is all about.\n  This bill relieves volunteers of liability for acts which they would \nconduct in the course of doing what they were asked to do by charitable \norganizations. As it relates to the charitable organizations \nthemselves, it establishes rules that would limit the kinds of cases in \nwhich there would be punitive damages and limits certain kinds of joint \nand several liability which provides a basis and a context in which we \ncan expect to elicit far more help for people who need help in America.\n  It seems to me that that is something we ought to pursue, and I think \nit is consistent with what the business of this body, representing the \npeople of America, ought to talk about.\n  So I am pleased to commend Senator Coverdell of Georgia for \nsubmitting this outstanding legislation, and I hope, as we work to make \nit an avenue for helping people help each other, that we will do the \nkind of job which will allow us to look back with gratitude on people \nwho are able to help one another without the threat of a legal system \nmaking it impossible for them to serve.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary status at the \nmoment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question before the Senate is the motion \nto proceed.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I will speak for a few moments on the \nmotion to proceed.\n  Mr. President, I would like to comment, if I can--I was sitting here \nactually thinking about some other remarks--but I want to comment on \nthe remarks of the distinguished Senator regarding voluntarism and sort \nof the special spirit of America that we talk about, which many of our \ncolleagues in the Senate fall back on as a place to suggest we can deal \nwith a lot of these problems of children.\n  I heard my colleague say that it is really not a problem of money, it \nis not a problem of resources; what we need is this special spirit, we \nneed to tap into this spirit.\n  Mr. President, I am all for tapping into that special spirit, but I \nhave to tell you, in too many communities that I visited, it is also a \nquestion of resources.\n  I mean, I went to the middle school in Charlestown the other day with \nthe drug czar and asked a bunch of kids in the middle school, aged 10 \nto 14 years old, what time they leave school. They said, ``Well, we \nleave school at 1:30 or 2 o'clock in the afternoon.'' And then I asked \nthem, ``Well, how many of you are home alone with nothing to do, with \nnobody at home, no parent between the hours of 2 o'clock and 6 or 7 in \nthe evening?'' And 50 percent of the hands went up, Mr. President.\n  I then asked, ``Well, how many of you have access to an afterschool \nprogram, Boys or Girls Club, parenting, or some sort of program?'' \nWell, they did not. More than 50 percent of the very same kids who had \nto go to a home that had nobody home raised their hands.\n  You know, we can talk about the special spirit of America, and we can \ntalk at great length about the capacity to be able to tap into \nvoluntarism. But first of all, volunteers have to be organized. \nVolunteers have to be trained. I mean, volunteers cannot just show up \none day and say, ``Hey, I'm qualified to take care of a kid who is an \ninfant or a toddler or kids in the middle school'' and not know how to \nshow up at the school, not know what to do, not even know if there is a \nprogram for them. Somebody has to work through that process.\n  In a lot of communities we are lucky enough to have some entities \nthat try to do that. But I can show you a lot of communities where, \ndespite the fact that they have the entities that are trying to do \nthat, they are just absolutely overwhelmed by their lack of private \nresources and private commitment and private individuals to be able to \nreach out and grab these lives and bring them back from the precipice.\n  I do not want the Government doing it. I am not suggesting that we \nare better off having some big Government program come down and do this \nfor those things. But I am suggesting that unless you empower some of \nthose entities at the local level with the resources necessary, this is \nall one great farce. It is a masquerade.\n  In Brockton, MA, we have 22,000 kids under the age of 18. We have a \nconverted armory in Brockton that is their Boys and Girls Club. I have \nbeen there many times talking to their peer leaders who tell me that \nfor the 2,000\n\n[[Page S3794]]\n\nkids who get access to it, it is very helpful. But then you ask the \nquestion, the really pregnant question, what happens to the 20,000 kids \nwho do not get access to it? And the answer is, they are hanging around \nthe streets.\n  So, you know, I mean, does anybody in America believe that \nvoluntarism is going to rescue a generation where almost four-fifths \nare out there, outside of access to these kinds of entities? And to \nmake matters worse, I can take you to school district after school \ndistrict where they have shut the library or it is part time, where \nthey no longer have a sports program, they no longer have arts and \nmusic, and they no longer have even some remedial programs for some of \nthese kids. I can take you to schools where they Xerox materials \nbecause they do not have books.\n  So we can talk about sort of, you know, all this, quote, ``thousands \nof points of light'' and other kinds of things. But the fact is--I am \ngoing to say a lot more about this in the next days--the fact is, there \nare some fundamental responsibilities that we have to try to deal with \non these things, and we are not living up to those responsibilities. I \nwould like to empower the YWCA, the YMCA, the Boys Club, \nthe YouthBuild, City Year, and thousands of organizations and entities \nout there.\n\n  But, Mr. President, we cannot meet the demand. And not one of them \nhave sufficient resources--not one of them. You can go to YouthBuild in \nBoston and find 80-some kids coming out of the court program, coming \nout of gangs, coming off the streets, the very thing they are talking \nabout. Some adult is finally coming into their life to give them some \nkind of affirmation, some kind of self-esteem for the first time in \ntheir lives, but it is happening because of a dollar that has been \ndecided to be spent here. And for the 80 kids who are in the program, I \nwill show you 400 who are not. So you can decide, you know, how you are \ngoing to decide telling which 400 get what, which 80 get what.\n  For all the rhetoric in this country, the bottom line is, Mr. \nPresident, we are not living up to our obligations in order to provide \nthe fundamentals of child development and child growth. And that is the \ngreat debate for this country.\n  We have one child every 8 seconds who drops out of school.\n  We have one child every 10 seconds who is reported neglected or \nabused.\n  We have one child every 34 seconds born low weight.\n  We have one child every 2\\1/2\\ minutes arrested.\n  We have one child every, I think, 2 hours or 2\\1/2\\ hours shot by \ngunfire.\n  And we have one child every 4 hours who commits suicide.\n  And what do we do? Well, we kind of are talking about it. We have \nthis big thing going on in Philadelphia that will heighten some \nparticipation, I have no doubt. Some additional people will come and \ntake part in some additional alternatives.\n  But there is no way we will sufficiently rescue a generation where 33 \npercent of the children of this country are currently born out of \nwedlock. It will take a massive intervention in the lives of rural and \nurban dispossessed and disenfranchised in order to help pull that back \nfrom the brink. The alternative is, we can wait 10, 15, or 20 years and \npay $55,000 per prison cell, or $25,000 per drug treatment program, or \ndeal with the disabilities that come from children who do not get to \nsee a doctor when they have asthma when they are young so they wind up \nwith permanent disabilities here or any of the permanent disabilities \nthat come from the lack of medical attention.\n  And 10 million kids in America have no medical care whatsoever. We \nare talking about children.\n  Half the kids who have no medical care who have asthma never see a \ndoctor.\n  A third of the kids who have an eye infection or ear infection never \nsee a doctor.\n  And we are the only industrial country on the face of this planet \nthat treats its children this way. Notwithstanding the fact that we \nhave seen the gross domestic product of this Nation double since 1969, \nwe have seen child poverty increase by 50 percent.\n  So as we go on in this debate, Mr. President, I intend to come to \nthis floor and make certain that we deal with the realities of what are \nhappening to the children of this country. I cannot think of anything \nmore important. And I think this is an important part of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I want to take a little bit of time this afternoon to talk \nabout voluntarism, the subject we are debating on the floor this \nafternoon, and to add to that a discussion about the supplemental \ndisaster appropriations bill that we will hopefully take up this week, \ndealing with the flood waters of northwest Minnesota and northern North \nand South Dakota.\n  I think it is a shame a bill that is so plain and so simple and so \nnecessary as the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997, or S. 543, has been \nstopped from coming to the floor of this Senate for debate. I think it \nis kind of ironic when you look at what has been going on in \nPhiladelphia over the weekend, the talk of voluntarism.\n  You do not have to attend a conference in Philadelphia to find \nvoluntarism, Mr. President. If you want to discuss that subject, you \nneed to look no further than those Minnesota communities that have been \nso devastated by flood waters. In the Midwest we consider ourselves \nindependent. We proudly celebrate our differences, yet we also take \ngreat pride in knowing that when our communities call on us, that we \nare very quick to come together. We have seen that happen so many times \nduring the flooding.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues talk against this bill on \nvoluntarism and how really we need a program of training because you \nhave to have people trained in order to come in and perform adequate or \ngood volunteer work. That might be true in some cases, but that does \nnot get to the heart or the point of this bill. There is not much time \nto do on-the-job training when there is an accident, when somebody is \ncaught in a burning car, when they have fallen off a bridge, or another \ndisaster has befallen them such as the flooding of Minnesota.\n  In Moorhead, the dedication of our young people impressed me as they \nworked alongside their parents and neighbors in filling sandbags \nagainst the rising waters. They did not get training for that ahead of \ntime. That was on-the-job training, something they had to do at the \ntime. In East Grand Forks, an army of volunteers fed the hungry, found \nshelter for the homeless, and comforted thousands more as the Red River \nswallowed an entire community. People have been evacuated from their \nhomes, people were moved out of nursing homes and hospitals. This was \nall done on an emergency basis, by volunteers who offered their help \nand their time. Again, they do not have time for training. They react \nto the situation that is needed.\n  In Ada, Mr. President, when the easiest thing in the world would have \nbeen to give up what seemed to be a hopeless battle against the rising \nriver, nobody gave up. Over and over again, I witnessed simple acts of \nfellowship, demonstrations of stewardship, and above all, voluntarism, \nneighbors helping neighbors, and was reminded of the spirit that \nbrought us together as communities and that will keep these communities \ntogether, I believe in the future.\n  Voluntarism is a lofty goal and it usually shows itself in times of \nemergency, but you cannot just pass it by mere legislation. The anguish \nthat rose every day with the flood waters has not been confined to \nthose communities along the Red River or the Minnesota River. That pain \nhas been felt in every corner of my State, and Minnesotans have \nresponded with a tremendous outpouring of not only sympathy, but real, \ntangible offers of help. The volunteers were there when we needed them. \nThe telephones at the Red Cross and the Salvation Army have been \nringing constantly as people asked where can they send donations. \nThousands have called the State's emergency operation center to sign up \nas volunteers for the long weeks of cleanup to come. Scout troops are \nalso pitching in, churches are taking up special offerings, schools and \nfamilies from parts of the State not touched by the floods have offered \nto host students without homes and teachers without classrooms. That is \nthe spirit of voluntarism that Americans are capable of.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor to argue and to urge my \ncolleagues to support the supplemental\n\n[[Page S3795]]\n\ndisaster appropriation, again, that we hope to take up yet this week in \nthe Senate. The breadth of the flooding in Minnesota and the Dakotas \nhas been difficult to comprehend. If you have not been there, if I had \nnot seen it, I would not have believed that a pair of raging rivers \ncould produce such widespread devastation. The cost has been enormous, \nboth in the financial costs which may run well over $1 billion just on \nthe Minnesota side, and the emotional and personal costs to our fellow \nMinnesotans, many of whom watched their homes, farms, businesses, and \nbasically their possessions just literally washed away.\n  I inspected the flood damage last week with President Clinton and \nalso the week before with Vice President Gore. Without hesitation, they \nall assured me that the taxpayers of this Nation would stand with the \npeople of Minnesota today and they would be there and remain with us \nuntil every family that had lost a home would have a home, and every \nlife that had been turned upside down would somehow be righted again. \nAgain, we cannot make everybody whole, but we need to be able to be \nthere with whatever help and assistance we can afford. Senate majority \nleader Trent Lott made a similar pledge last Friday when he met with \nGovernor Carlson of Minnesota and myself to talk about the promises \nthat Washington has made, and promises we will make sure it lives up \nto.\n\n  It is imperative we bring the disaster aid legislation to the floor \nand we pass it this week. There are thousands upon thousands of \nAmericans who are depending on us to meet our responsibilities and also \nto deliver the aid that we have promised.\n  To avoid Government's possible disruptions in future funding, we \nshould also have a good Government contingency plan in place to make \nsure that the Government has the ability to continue supporting in the \nareas that it can, with aid and other supports. This is the way to \nensure that the needs of our flood victims in Minnesota will be met now \nand will be met in the near future and in the long run. After all, the \naid we are promising, the aid that we will debate this week on the \nfloor, $488 million that the President has requested for the Midwest \nflooding and the Red River Basin will only be 20 percent or 25 percent \nof what the long-term aid and dollars are going to be.\n  If we do not reach agreement that we will be able to keep the \nGovernment running to assure that the Government will be there in \nOctober, in November, they could be without the Government assistance \nthey are depending on. This is good Government. It would help to take \npolitics out of the process, because if we cannot come to terms on a \nbudget agreement down the road, we cannot afford to have our flood \nrelief efforts halted because of that.\n  Now, this is not playing games with the flood victims, as we have \nheard the charges here on the floor today. It would cost no money. We \nare not asking for additional money. We want to put in place a process, \nand this should have been there last year, it should have been there 2 \nyears ago, and it should be there next year if it is needed, this is \nnot playing games with any of the flood victims, with their families, \nor their possessions or their future. This is to help guarantee that \nthe aid and the help and the supplies will be there.\n  It is an effort to take politics out of the process, because if the \nbudget debate that we have this year does not result in a total budget, \nwe do not want any part of this Government to shut down. We want to \nmake sure that the Government is up and running and that nobody--no \nGovernment service, no Government program, no Government employee, no \npeople relying on those type of services--will be held hostage.\n  I am right now disturbed by the political gamesmanship that is \nalready being played, talking about this, going on, while our \nconstituents are out there waiting for aid, emergency aid, short-term \nfunds and long-term, that we need to pass this bill immediately this \nweek. It is the responsible thing to do, again, because the disaster \naid today nor the Federal services, and again the programs and \nemployees that we should keep funding, must not be held political \nhostage in the near future. So we have to make sure that we pass some \nreasonable and some good Government contingency plans along with this. \nI hope it is part of this bill. I hope it has overwhelming support to \nensure that these obligations are met.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I take a few minutes to talk about the Volunteer \nProtection Act and to respond to some of what I considered to be \nunjustified criticisms of the act which we have heard on the floor in \nrecent hours.\n  As I mentioned yesterday when we began this debate, the Volunteer \nProtection Act will give our volunteers and nonprofit organizations who \nrely on volunteers some much needed relief from frivolous lawsuits that \nare filed based on the actions of volunteers.\n  All too often, while we ought to be protecting and encouraging \nvolunteers--which President Clinton, Colin Powell, former President \nBush, and others have done such a commendable job of encouraging in \nPhiladelphia this week--we are, instead, permitting them to be \nsubjected to baseless, abusive and unwarranted lawsuits. I spoke about \nmany such lawsuits yesterday. I have also heard about others from \ncommunity groups, nonprofit organizations, and volunteers in Michigan, \nand about various excesses along these lines.\n  Today, I respond to those who criticized this desperately needed \nlegislation and to talk about some specific provisions of the bill \nwhich would address any concerns that might have been raised with \nrespect to volunteer protection legislation.\n  Perhaps most disturbing to me is that some opponents of this \nlegislation tried to characterize it by claiming it would protect white \nsupremacist groups and other hate groups. That charge is entirely \nunfounded. It represents an attempt by those who oppose all civil \njustice reform to distort this legislation.\n  I have to ask, Mr. President, how people could reach this conclusion. \nFrankly, I have to say that I find it offensive, as an advocate of this \nlegislation, to have anybody suggest that we would permit such \nlegislation to be brought to this floor.\n  First, by its own limiting terms, this bill covers not-for-profit \norganizations that are organized and conducted for public benefit and \noperated primarily for charitable, civic, educational, religious, \nwelfare, or health purposes. Not every not-for-profit organization is \norganized for the public benefit and operated primarily for charitable \npurposes. I think it is clear that hate groups, even where they are \nnot-for-profit organizations, are not organized for the public benefit \nand operated for charitable or civic purposes. Accordingly, they would \nnot be subject to the limitations in this bill.\n  Second, the bill goes even further than that to ensure that hate \ngroups will not be covered. The bill explicitly excludes from its \ncoverage cases in which the misconduct constitutes a hate crime or in \nwhich the misconduct constitutes a civil rights violation. Thus, even \nif the defendant was associated with a group that was found to be a \nnot-for-profit organization covered by the bill, there would be no \nlimitation on the liability of the individual or the organization for \nhate crimes or civil rights violations.\n  Given the careful drafting of these provisions, it is simply a \nblatant mischaracterization to suggest that this bill would protect the \nKu Klux Klan, hate groups, white supremacist groups, or any other \nhorrible organization. Frankly, I find it very disturbing to even have \nthis legislation associated with such hateful groups. Those groups \nwould not be sheltered from liability, and any suggestion that they \nwould, I think, is just plain wrong.\n  I also say, Mr. President, that using the kind of logic that could \nsomehow link this legislation to such groups would allow us to say that \nif we provide benefits under Medicaid to people who belong to hate \ngroups, we are trying to consciously subsidize white supremacist or \nhate group members. You could do that with any legislation. But we have \ngone the extra mile in this legislation to try to preclude those who \nare involved in hateful activity from being in any way protected by it.\n  I also want to respond to another criticism of this legislation. It \nhas been suggested that we should leave this\n\n[[Page S3796]]\n\narea to the States. I agree wholeheartedly that the States should be \ninvolved in offering legal shelter to voluntary and charitable \nactivities. The Volunteer Protection Act has in fact been carefully \ndrafted by Senators Coverdell, McConnell, myself, and others to ensure \nthat we permit the States to do so and that we strike the right balance \nof Federalism.\n  For example, in order to permit States to provide their own \nprotections to volunteers, section 3 of the bill clearly provides that \nthe Volunteer Protection Act will not preempt any State law that \nprovides additional protections from liability relating to volunteers \nor nonprofit organizations. Thus, while the bill will set a standard in \nStates without volunteer protections, it will permit the States to do \nmore.\n  Section 4(e) of the bill further provides that a number of State laws \nconcerning the responsibilities of volunteers and concerning liability \nfor the actions of volunteers will not be construed as inconsistent \nwith the act. I would like my colleagues to consider those limitations.\n  First, a State law that requires a nonprofit organization or \nGovernment entity to adhere to risk management or training procedures \nwill not be inconsistent with the Volunteer Protection Act.\n  Second, State laws that make the organization or entity liable for \nthe acts of the volunteer to the same extent that an employer is liable \nfor the acts of its employees will continue to have full effect.\n  Third, any State law that makes a limitation of liability \ninapplicable if the volunteer was operating a motor vehicle, vessel, or \naircraft will also continue in force.\n  Fourth, also continuing to have effect will be any State law making \nliability limits inapplicable in civil actions brought by State or \nlocal government officials pursuant to State law. That provision \nensures that State and local officials will be permitted to enforce \nState law.\n\n  Fifth, the bill specifies that State laws will not be affected where \nthey make a liability limitation applicable only if the nonprofit or \nGovernment entity provides a secure source of recovery for individuals \nwho suffer harm as a result of actions taken by a volunteer on behalf \nof the organization or entity. That means that, in any example that \nopponents of this bill bring up and in any other case that occurs, the \nStates will have the power to ensure that any injured parties will be \ncompensated for those injuries.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep these points in mind as we debate the \nmotion to proceed and when we get to the final point of actually \nconsidering the bill.\n  The Volunteer Protection Act, I also add, Mr. President, includes one \nother significant protection to ensure the proper respect for \nfederalism. That is the State opt-out provision.\n  This bill explicitly provides that a State may opt out of the \nprovisions of this bill in State court cases involving parties from the \nState. Under the opt-out provision, a State may elect to forego the \nvolunteer protections in the bill, provided that a State enacts \nlegislation in accordance with the State's constitutional and \nlegislative processes. That legislation must cite the opt-out provision \nin the Federal legislation, clearly state an election to opt out, and \ncontain no other provisions.\n  This ensures that States will opt out when they really do intend to \ndo so and that volunteers will not be deprived of volunteer protections \nwithout the appropriate consideration of the issue by the State.\n  As I have stated before, I do not believe that any State will opt out \nof the provisions of this legislation, and I know of no State that \nintends to do so. Rather, the provision was included by the drafters, \nby those of us who support the legislation, as a matter of principle \nout of respect for the States.\n  Mr. President, I feel very strongly about litigation abuses in this \ncountry, and very strongly about fostering charitable and volunteer \nactivities. President Clinton, General Powell, and others involved in \nthe summit in Philadelphia are absolutely correct that we need to \nencourage the sense of community and charity that makes us so great as \na nation.\n  I encourage my colleagues to consider this legislation in all its \ndetail. It has been crafted very carefully by those of us who developed \nthe Senate bill. We sought to strike just the right balance with the \nStates and to offer protection only to the many worthy activities that \nshould be protected, while at the same time protecting the rights of \nthose who are victims. I commend Senators Coverdell and McConnell, as I \nhave from the beginning, for their efforts, in the hope that we can \nproceed to the consideration and passage of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I will close by saying, as I did yesterday, that we \noften talk in this country about the extent to which the sense of \ncommunity that binds us together has eroded in recent years. I think \nthat is the case, and it is why so many of our constituents ask us to \ntry to take action to rebuild the fabric that binds us together. I \nthink the sense of community in America breaks down in no small measure \nbecause we have stopped looking at one another as neighbors and friends \nand we look at each other as potential plaintiffs and defendants. I \nbelieve this would not be any greater a case than when it comes to the \nactivities of charitable organizations, whom we seek to address with \nthe Volunteer Protection Act. If we do not take action to try to give \nvolunteer organizations a greater opportunity to do their good deeds, I \nthink we really will have set back efforts to build a stronger American \ncommunity.\n  For that reason, I sincerely hope our colleagues will join us in \nsupporting this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nhis many contributions--not just the comments today, but the many \ncontributions he has made on behalf of the act and on behalf of the \noutreach I spoke of earlier to involve citizens, and the renewal \nalliance, and all of the other work he has done. I appreciate him being \nhere.\n\n  Before he leaves, I want to thank him also for specifically referring \nto the suggestion, which I characterized as ``very disappointing'' this \nmorning, that this legislation somehow gave undue protections to the Ku \nKlux Klan. I thought introducing that in an attempt to make some \nlegitimate criticism of this legislation was inappropriate. I am \nappreciative that you would come with your legal background and point \nout, as I have tried to do--perhaps not as effectively as you have--how \ntotally inaccurate that assertion was. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, if I might take a moment, we are discussing a proposal \nto bring the Volunteer Protection Act before the Senate. We are trying \nto get to the point where we can consider the legislation, and there is \na filibuster being conducted to prohibit it.\n  It has been said all day long that it is of the utmost irony that the \nparty of the President, who spoke so eloquently yesterday in \nPhiladelphia on behalf of voluntarism, is consciously engaged in \nobstructing and preventing even the debate--we are not to the point of \nvoting--about the Volunteer Protection Act, whose sole purpose is to \nmake it more possible for volunteers to respond to the request of \nPresident Clinton, President Bush, President Carter, and President Ford \nfor America to step forward.\n  Mr. President, just to read from a press release, it says:\n\n       Together with President Clinton, former Presidents, 30 \n     Governors, 100 mayors, participated in a conference on \n     volunteering. General Powell said, ``As many as 15 million \n     young Americans need mentoring to help them overcome the \n     adversities they face. They are at risk of growing up \n     unskilled, unlearned, or even worse, unloved.'' General \n     Powell said, standing outside Independence Hall, the \n     birthplace of this Republic, ``They are at risk of growing up \n     physically or psychologically abused. They are at risk of \n     growing up addicted to the pathologies and the poisons of the \n     street. They are at risk of bringing children into the world \n     before they themselves have grown up. They are at risk of \n     never growing up at all.''\n  Mr. President, we have heard from Little League Baseball, from the \nRed Cross, from boys clubs and girls clubs, from United Way, from \nformer athletes who provide excellent role models for our young people. \nJust 2 weeks ago, Terry Orr of the Washington Redskins, standing before \nthe world, said that he cannot get volunteers to do the very work that \nGeneral Powell is alluding to here with inner-city kids, without first \nconfronting a barrage of questions from the volunteer he is trying to \nrecruit, the current rookies, without\n\n[[Page S3797]]\n\nhaving to confront that rookie's attorney to determine how much risk is \nthe volunteer going to face, how much threat is there to the assets of \nthat volunteer's family.\n  This legislation before the Senate, being filibustered before the \nSenate--and just another word on that. We have heard all day long about \nthe holding up of the nomination of Alexis Herman. We have heard about \nthe supplemental bill. We have heard about everything except allowing \nus to move forward with a 12-page bill that very simply makes it \npossible for a volunteer not to be free of willful or reckless activity \nor gross negligence but to be free of making just a mistake or omission \nin the act of being a volunteer--12 pages long. You would think we were \nrewriting the Constitution of the United States.\n  It was suggested, well, this was brought up just because of the \nvolunteer summit. Right. That is exactly why it is on the calendar \ntoday, so that there can be a congressional response to the call of the \nNation's leaders, so that Americans can respond to the call of \nAmerica's leaders. And I just find it unconscionable on two points, \nthat we had an extended presentation which somehow would allege the \nauthors of this legislation were protecting the Ku Klux Klan of all \nthings. And I think a reading of any learned attorney would agree with \nthe presentation by the Senator from Michigan that the legislation is \ncarefully drafted. There would not be any protection to that kind of \norganization. And then that we would be confronted with a filibuster to \nkeep us from trying to help fulfill the dreams and wishes of the summit \nand reinforce America's commitment to voluntarism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/29/senate-section/article/S3784-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, every one of us here in the Senate are very \nprivileged to be able to do what we do at the request of the citizens \nof our State and with their trust. And we often get a lot of credit and \noccasional brickbats for it. But the truth is, none of us could do what \nwe do without the capacity of able staff. We are all blessed with that. \nIt is the way that we succeed, knowing what we know when we vote or \nbeing able to pursue some legislation that we pursue.\n  I have been particularly blessed to have an individual work on my \nstaff since I arrived in the U.S. Senate, a person who came as my \nscheduler when I arrived in 1985, and who, until this day, was my \nscheduler. When I arrived here 12 years ago as a new Senator and began \nto assemble a staff, I was extraordinarily lucky to be introduced to a \nperson by the name of Patricia Gray, Pat Gray as she is known to those \nwho have worked with her here in the Senate.\n  She came to me as a professional's professional, Mr. President. She \nhad come to Washington a number of years before having been initiated \ninto public service by one of the all-time great Senators, Paul Douglas \nof Illinois. After arriving in Washington, she worked for Senator \nDouglas, for Senator Hubert Humphrey, for the Democratic Congressional \nCampaign Committee, for a host of Democratic Presidential campaigns \nover the years, and for some other congressional offices.\n  She took important time off during her career at various points to \ngive birth to and to raise two sons, and worked in both nonprofit and \nfor-profit private sector organizations.\n  A complete recitation of her extraordinary career would require a \nseparate speech. But let me just say that it was my extraordinary good \nfortune 12 years ago to have Pat Gray be willing to take a place in my \noffice and help to create order out of chaos.\n  I realize there are a lot of people on the outside who might wonder, \nnot having worked in close proximity to someone in public life, or even \nsomebody as a high private official, why somebody would need sort of a \nfull-time professional scheduler, and in the case of some offices I \nsuppose more than one person. But literally, as all my colleagues know, \nit is a very special talent to be able to make people feel good who you \nhave to say no to. And you have to say no.\n  It is a very special talent to be able to balance the scores of \ninvitations with the schedule here, which we can never quite determine, \nto be able to balance the when and if as a Senator--you might be able \nto appear--without making people feel somehow that you are either \nindifferent or lack caring with respect to their concerns or desire to \nhave you come. And we, all of us, receive hundreds of invitations, not \nonly by the week, but by the days sometimes.\n  It is extraordinarily hard to contend with the need to balance 5 or \n10 committee meetings in the course of a week, overlapping with votes \nthat occur whenever they might occur, and to keep all of the people \nhappy who you are trying to balance as that schedule changes. I really \ncannot think of a tougher job, while simultaneously trying to enhance \nan individual Senator's ability to be able to meet their legislative \nagenda, not to mention as all of us struggle so much with a personal \nlife, our home agendas. So the absence of that very, very special \ntalent is literally the absence of order and capacity in a Senate \noffice.\n  For these past 12 years, Pat has applied her remarkable storehouse of \ninformation that she brought with her to Washington about the Congress, \nabout\n\n[[Page S3798]]\n\nlife here, about those who animate both this city and this institution. \nShe readily acquired the same degree of sophisticated knowledge about \nmy State of Massachusetts and those who animate our State and our \npolitics and our lives. And she learned my preferences and patterns in \npersonal and family needs and incorporated those into the schedule \nprocess. That is a very potent package, Mr. President. It is one for \nwhich many elected officials, for that competence, would give their \nright arm and leg in an effort to find that kind of person.\n  But I want to emphasize something. She brought a great deal more to \nthe job than simply her capacity to be able to run the schedule. It is \na special skill and it is a special knowledge. But I would like to just \nvery quickly mention a couple of other very special traits.\n  First, she, among many people--and I have been blessed to have scores \nof people who have worked for me since I have been in the Senate--has a \ndeep constitutional commitment to the principle that anything worth \ndoing at all is worth doing well. No matter how long it took, no matter \nhow early she had to come in in order to make it work, no matter what \nthe complexity of the scheduling matter of which I or other staff \nmembers were depending on her to see us through, she saw it through.\n  I cannot begin to relate the number of days, Mr. President, on which \nwhen I arrived in the office--and I often arrive early--I found Pat \nthere, the first person in the office and often, I might say, the last \nperson to leave on the same day.\n  When I was flying out of Washington to Boston or elsewhere in the \ncountry, she was at her phone until she knew the plane had taken off, \nuntil she knew there was no delay, no cancellation, no crisis to \nrearrange. All who dealt with her and those who work in my office and \nthose who work in other Senate or House offices or elsewhere in \ngovernment, constituents in Massachusetts, and all others, knew her to \nbe an utterly and remarkably dependable person.\n  It was her responsibility to make certain people understood. And \nbecause it was her responsibility, they did understand that they could \ndepend on her. That is a very special brand of devotion, and I would \nrespectfully suggest different probably from a lot of the mores that \ncurrently circulate at large in our country.\n  I also want to underscore that she did not just stumble into \ngovernment by accident. This was not a place where she had to find a \njob. This was not a place where she wound up because she did not have \nthe talent to find any kind of work anywhere else. This was a place \nthat she worked for more than a quarter of a century with a purpose \nbecause she believed devoutly in the ability of this place to make a \ndifference in the lives of other people and in the ability of the \ndemocratic government, and more importantly, the fundamental \nresponsibility of a democratic government to serve people.\n\n  Unlike those who hold the philosophy that government is just somehow \ninherently incapable of ever helping somebody, she believes intently \nthat bureaucracy aside, government has the ability, well delivered, \nefficient, and well thought out, to be able to help people to do things \nfor themselves, not to do things for them. I think that she also shares \na deep belief that corporately good things can happen that improve the \nquality of life that individuals sometimes simply cannot do on their \nown.\n  She believes that government has, just as individuals have, a very \nspecial obligation to those who do not share the good fortune that \nothers enjoy, and she particularly always shared and I think her work \nfor Hubert Humphrey and Muriel Humphrey and Paul Douglas, and I hope \nshe will feel for me, were part of her commitment to the impoverished, \nthe illiterate, sick, elderly, the disabled, and those for whom life is \nhard in many ways, that others never know or know only in mild terms.\n  This foundation energized Pat Gray, and I think over all the years \nthey gave her a stamina and the ability to persevere even when others \nwould have thrown up their hands and walked away. It led her to spend \nher entire career in public service, when she really could have chosen \na dozen other courses.\n  Recently, and to my benefit, Mr. President, that commitment caused \nher to remain at her post even after she was entitled to full \nretirement benefits. Her dedication to improving government, to making \nit work better, for the benefit of those who need and depend on its \nwide variety of services, is visible to everybody who ever came in \ncontact with her. She knows that every person who works in government, \nregardless of his or her specific position or responsibility is a part \nof the whole, and therefore the effect of the whole, and she has been \ndetermined that her contribution would be measured as positive.\n  Finally, Mr. President, Pat has been nothing if she has not been \ntenacious. Surrender is simply not a word in her lexicon. If she \nbelieves it is her duty to accomplish something, all of us in my \noffice, or in offices around her--including I might say, at peril \nseveral times learned--it is best not to inadvertently be standing \nbetween her and her goal. When it came to keeping that schedule, \ndespite the uncontrollable interruptions, despite all the forces that \ntugged at it, no one could have mustered or demonstrated greater energy \nor commitment than she did.\n  It is a blessing, Mr. President, at the right time, after a lifetime \nof work, to leave the workplace for the pleasures of her retirement. \nBut that time has now arrived for Pat. So, no longer every week will \nshe have to leave her husband Ken, himself a veteran of public service \nwith Senator Douglas, Senator and Vice President Humphrey, Senator \nStevenson, Senator Tydings, several Presidential campaigns, and a \nnumber of other posts, who has been retired for a couple of years, no \nlonger will she have to leave him in their home on the side of Old Rag \nMountain in the Blue Ridge in order to commute here for long days in \nthe office and short nights in an Arlington apartment. No longer will \nshe be unable to join him in Colorado at their mountain cabin for the \nfew weeks of the summer that she gets, as she did forgo on occasion \nbecause of the Senate schedule. Ultimately her friends, her family, and \nabove all, her garden that she cherishes will be the winners for this \nmoment.\n  In my office, we will take a very, very special pleasure in knowing \nthat she will be enjoying this well-earned time so much. After her many \nyears of contribution to the U.S. Senate and to the country and to my \nState and to my office personally, we wish her, as I know everyone who \nhas come in contact with her in the Senate and in Washington does, we \nwish her well. She has made her mark and we should all wish that we \ncould live a life as clearly committed and devoted as hers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Muriel Humphrey be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 29, 1997.\n       Dear Pat: How I wish I could be with you on this very \n     special occasion. However, although I cannot be with you \n     personally, I am pleased to have this opportunity to express \n     to you my hearty congratulations and sincere best wishes as \n     you retire after many years of dedicated public service.\n       Pat, I want you to know how grateful I am to you for all \n     you have done for Hubert and me. We could always depend on \n     your expertise, your loyalty, your friendship and support \n     throughout the years, and that meant a great deal to us. You \n     contributed substantially to whatever success we enjoyed and \n     you were there to encourage us in times of struggle and \n     challenge. You are truly a part of the Humphrey family!\n       It is certainly appropriate that your many friends and \n     colleagues gather to honor you on this special occasion. I \n     add my voice to theirs in wishing you all the very best for a \n     long, happy and fulfilling retirement.\n       Again, Pat, congratulations!\n           Warm regards,\n     Muriel Humphrey Brown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/29/senate-section/article/S3797-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3798-S3799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to enhance taxpayer value in auctions conducted by the \nFederal Communications Commission; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                         the reserve price act\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, for most Americans a buck doesn't go very \nfar. A dollar will not buy a cup of coffee at Starbucks, it will not \nbuy a comic book at the 7-11, it will not buy a package of batteries at \nthe True Value store, or even a gallon of gas at the Amoco station. \nBut, at the FCC, a buck will buy a radio license to serve the city of \nSt. Louis.\n  On Friday, the FCC completed an auction of radio spectrum which \nshould cause every American taxpayer to be concerned. This action \nyielded less than 1 percent of the amount anticipated. Rather than \nraising $1.8 billion as the Congress had expected, the FCC brought in \nonly $13.6 million.\n  Perhaps worse of all, several licenses were awarded to bidders for \nthe incredible sum of $1. That's well below the bargain basement. Mike \nMills of the Washington Post aptly observed that a sign should be put \nin front of the FCC auction headquarters advertising ``everything for a \nbuck.'' One bidder won four licenses at a dollar a piece. Those \nlicenses combined would allow services to reach 15 million people. \nAnother bidder won the right to serve St. Louis, one of the largest \ncities in America for $1. It is as if we had returned to the days of \nlicense lotteries. That's one heck of a way to stretch a dollar.\n  Radio spectrum is a national asset. It must be prudently managed. The \ntaxpayers count on the Federal Communications Commission to allocate \nspectrum among and between various uses to assure that the public \ninterest is served and to assure that those uses do not interfere with \neach other.\n  In 1993, the Congress enacted legislation which revolutionized the \nway radio frequencies are allocated. After years of debate, the \nCongress took the step to authorized the Federal Communications \nCommission to use auctions to allocate licenses for radio spectrum. It \nwas built on the premise that investors would pay for the right to \noffer new wireless communications services.\n  Prior to 1993, licenses were awarded by lottery or by a comparative \napplication process. In both cases, license winners would often sell \ntheir licenses soon after acquiring them to others for substantial \nsums.\n  To cut out the middle man and give taxpayers a return from the \nvaluable rights they were awarding, the Congress ordered the FCC to \nconduct auctions to award radio spectrum licenses.\n  In general, this approach has worked very well. It has proven to be \nan efficient means of allocating scarce resources and it has reaped \nbillions of dollars of deficit reduction for the American taxpayer.\n  Unfortunately, something went wrong in this last auction. One problem \nwas that the auction rules did not establish a minimum bid or a reserve \nprice. That's how some lucky bidders won valuable licenses for a buck.\n  Mr. President, I offer legislation today which will help ensure that \ntaxpayers are protected in future FCC auctions. The importance of this \nlegislation is heightened by the increasing congressional reliance on \nspectrum auctions in telecommunications and budget policy. The \nPresident's budget alone relies on $36 billion of revenues from \nspectrum auctions.\n  The Reserve Price Act requires the FCC to set a minimum price for \neach unit auctioned. If no one bids the minimum, then what is not sold \nwill be re-evaluated and placed in the next scheduled auction. With a \nreserve price system, taxpayers will be guaranteed that national assets \nare not sold for a song.\n  The Chairman of the FCC reportedly said that the reason for the \ndisappointing return from Friday's auction was the ``the Congress got \nto greedy'' with spectrum revenues. Perhaps, this auction was rushed. \nBut with reserve prices, even a rushed auction would not have to be a \ndisastrous auction.\n  I urge my colleagues to review and support the Reserve Price Act. The \nAmerican taxpayer deserves as much.\n\n[[Page S3800]]\n\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the text of the Reserve Price Act \nand a copy of Mike Mills' Washington Post article entitled ``Latest \nLicense Action Disappoints FCC'' be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S.663\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Reserve Price Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RESERVE PRICE.\n\n       In any auction conducted or supervised by the Federal \n     Communications Commission (hereinafter the Commission) for \n     any license, permit or right which has value, a reasonable \n     reserve price shall be set by the Commission for each unit in \n     the auction. The reserve price shall establish a minimum bid \n     for the unit to be auctioned. If no bid is received above the \n     reserve price for a unit, the unit shall be retained. The \n     Commission shall re-assess the reserve price for that unit \n     and place the unit in the next scheduled or next appropriate \n     auction.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 26, 1997]\n\n                 Latest License Auction Disappoints FCC\n\n\n    total comes up short of expectations in bargain-basement bidding\n\n                            (By Mike Mills)\n\n       They might as well have changed the sign at the FCC Auction \n     headquarters to ``Everything for a Buck.''\n       Congress had expected the Federal Communications Commission \n     to pull in about $1.8 billion in its latest auction of a \n     slice of the airwaves, this one for companies that want to \n     offer wireless voice and data services. But when the bidding \n     stopped yesterday, the FCC found it had raised less than 1 \n     percent of that amount, only $13.6 million.\n       It was by far the most disappointing yield to date in the \n     auction program. In other bidding since the program began in \n     July 1994, winners have pledged about $23 billion to the \n     Treasury Department, far higher than initial projections.\n       The FCC blamed yesterday's poor showing on Congress, saying \n     it didn't give the agency or the industry enough time to \n     prepare for the latest auction. But the low bids also might \n     be a sign that the market for airwave licenses is becoming \n     glutted, some analysts said.\n       Either way, bargain-basement prices awaited the handful of \n     communications companies that cared to participate. McLeod \n     Inc. of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, actually bid $1 each for four \n     licenses in the Midwest covering areas with a 15 million \n     population--and won. Nobody countered its bid in 29 rounds.\n       ``It was a fortunate opportunity,'' said Bryce Nemitz, \n     McLeod's vice president of corporate relations. ``There \n     wasn't any way for us to gauge the true value of those \n     licenses, so we bid the minimum.'' The company plans to use \n     the licenses for wireless utility meter reading, he said.\n       According to FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt, Congress got too \n     greedy last summer when it passed a law ordering the FCC to \n     quickly auction this chunk of frequencies by April 15, and to \n     make sure the money got to the Treasury by Sept. 30.\n       The deadline gave the industry little time to prepare, \n     Hundt said. Equipment makers had no idea what the frequencies \n     could be used for. Potential bidders had difficulty raising \n     bidding money in capital markets.\n       ``We were right when we told the industries and Congress \n     there wasn't enough lead time for this auction,'' Hundt said.\n       But there were other problems. In February the FCC \n     announced restrictions that limited users of those \n     frequencies from offering certain mobile services because \n     they might interfere with a new satellite-based radio \n     service. And earlier this week, the FCC also said the new \n     license owners would have to accept other restrictions to \n     avoid interference with other services.\n       Those limitations might have curbed interest in bidding, \n     but they didn't seem to bother the winners. BellSouth Corp. \n     was the top bidder, spending $6 million for 22 licenses. It \n     plans to offer wireless television service using the \n     licenses.\n       Other firms aren't sure how they'll use the licenses. ``It \n     just got rushed to the market so soon that people just didn't \n     have time to get themselves together,'' said Thomas Sullivan \n     of TeleCorp, which won a St. Louis license for $1 and two \n     others for $60,000.\n       For Congress, the $1.786 billion shortfall won't directly \n     affect any spending programs. But it will be a factor when \n     bean-counters next tally up the budget deficit, sources at \n     the Congressional Budget Office said.\n       Some analysts suggest the auctions are a sign that the \n     auction process may be running out of steam. Some bidders who \n     paid surprisingly huge sums for wireless telephone licenses \n     earlier last year are now having big troubles raising the \n     money to pay for them. That spooked investors in a subsequent \n     auction last year for similar licenses, in which bidding fell \n     below expectations.\n       The broadcasting lobby, which has so far successfully \n     avoided auctions of TV and radio licenses, and the results \n     make their case for killing the auction program.\n       ``These sub-par receipts confirm what we have been saying \n     for months,'' said Dennis Wharton, spokesman for the National \n     Association of Broadcasters. ``Spectrum auctions have clearly \n     reached a point of diminishing returns.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Ried):\n  S. 664. A bill to establish tutoring assistance programs to help \nchildren learn to read well; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                    the america reads challenge act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to introduce President \nClinton's America Reads Challenge Act. Today is the closing day of the \nPresident's summit for America's future. The summit's organizers and \nparticipants have sent a clear call about the importance of \nvolunteerism and community involvement. The America Reads Challenge Act \nresponds to that call and will provide volunteer tutors to help all \nchildren read well by the end of the third grade.\n  Reading is a fundamental skill for learning, but too many children \nhave trouble learning how to read. If students don't learn to read in \nthe early elementary school years, it is virtually impossible for them \nto keep up later. According to one study, 40 percent of fourth grade \nstudents don't attain the basic level of reading, and 70 percent don't \nattain the proficient level.\n  Research shows that reading skills are developed not only in the home \nand in the classroom, but also in communities and libraries. Sustained, \nquality reading experiences outside the regular school day and during \nthe summer can raise reading levels when combined with high quality \ninstruction. Only 30 minutes a day of reading aloud with an adult can \nenable a child to make real gains in reading. Adults also serve as role \nmodels for young children.\n  The America Reads Challenge Act is intended to help all students \nlearn to read--and read well--by the end of the third grade. It would \nprovide Parents as First Teachers challenge grants. Recognizing that \nparents are the best first teachers, it supports programs and \nactivities that help parents increase the reading skills of their \nchildren.\n  In addition, the act will provide America's Reading Corps grants to \nStates and communities to help them establish or enhance literacy tutor \nprograms. Some 25,000 reading specialists and tutor coordinators, \nincluding 11,000 AmeriCorps members, will participate in programs to \nmobilize 1 million volunteers to tutor 3 million children.\n  The America Reads Challenge Act will provide $1.7 billion over the \nnext 5 years to the Department of Education. It will also authorize the \nappropriation of $200 million a year from fiscal year 1998 through \nfiscal year 2002 to the Corporation for National Service. The act also \nbuilds on efforts of pre-school and elementary school programs, such as \nHead Start and title I, to help improve children's basic skills.\n  I strongly support President Clinton's America Reads Challenge Act, \nand I hope it will receive the broad bipartisan support it deserves. \nEvery child can learn to read, and every child deserves a chance to \nlearn how to do it. No child should be left out or left behind.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I join my colleagues Senators Kennedy \nand Murray in cosponsoring this important new initiative.\n  The goal of this legislation is to launch a campaign to ensure that \nevery child in our Nation can read independently by the end of the \nthird grade. I believe that this is a worthwhile goal, which will have \na wide-ranging impact on our Nation.\n  We need to help our young children learn to read. It's the \nresponsibility not only of parents but of schools, communities, civic \ngroups, libraries, and business leaders. Some 40 percent of all \nchildren are now reading below the accepted level on national reading \nassessments.\n  This is a national crisis. Tens of thousands of students cannot read \nat the basic level. If students can't read well by the third grade, \ntheir chances for later success fall dramatically. These same students \nare likely to drop out of school; they will have problems with \ndelinquency; and they will have fewer job options.\n\n[[Page S3801]]\n\n  I believe that the America Reads initiative will go a long way in \nproviding much needed resources to parents, schools, and State and \nlocal communities to help our children learn to read.\n  This bill would establish a corps of 1 million volunteer tutors and \ngive States additional resources to hire 30,000 reading specialists to \ncoordinate the corps volunteer tutors who will work with teachers, \nprincipals, and librarians to help children succeed in reading.\n  I support mobilizing thousands of volunteers, but I also believe that \nthe training and screening must be adequate, especially when we place \nanyone in our Nation's classrooms. These are issues that my colleagues \nand I will be addressing.\n  We also want to help parents. This bill establishes Parents as First \nTeachers challenge grants, which invests in success by \nsupporting effective and proven local efforts that assist parents who \nrequest help to better work with their children.\n\n  The President has also called upon colleges and universities across \nthe country to dedicate half of their new work study funds to support \n100,000 college students to serve as reading tutors. Already hundreds \nof colleges and universities across the country have pledged to have \ntheir work study students help children learn to read. In my State of \nMaryland, Anne Arundel Community College, Bowie State University, \nFrostburg State University, and the University of Maryland at College \nPark have all committed to the America Reads initiative.\n  We also want accountability. This legislation will use the \nimprovements in the National Assessment of Educational Progress [NAEP] \nto provide an annual measure of the reading performance of 4th graders \nand their progress toward meeting the reading challenge.\n  Both the Corporation for National Service and the Department of \nEducation will oversee and manage this program. The Corporation for \nNational Service has the expertise to pull together the AmeriCorps \nvolunteers and has the infrastructure in place to help mobilize the \nvolunteers. The Department of Education has the knowledge and resources \nto really make this program accountable.\n  I support utilizing the resources that we already have in place with \nAmeriCorps. I know that thousands of AmeriCorps volunteers across the \ncountry are already in the schools tutoring children. In Maryland, \nAmeriCorps volunteers are already in public schools tutoring and \nmentoring students.\n  And, companies too are leading the way with innovative methods of \nteaching our children to read. Sylvan Learning Center, which is \nheadquartered in my State of Maryland, is a company that has been \nhaving great success with its methods to help children learn to read. \nSylvan operates tutoring centers across the country. The centers have \nproduced measurable results with children. The centers are community-\nbased facilities. The student to teacher ratio never exceeds 3:1. \nSylvan's approach consists of individualized instruction, variety, a \ncreative motivational system, and parent and teacher involvement. It is \nan approach that works and can be one of the models that we use for the \nAmerica Reads Program.\n\n  Why does this approach work? Because specialists can tailor a program \nto meet an individual student's needs. In many overcrowded classrooms \nacross our country, it's simply impossible for a teacher in charge of \n30 or 40 students to give one student who's having problems extra \nattention.\n  I don't believe that America Reads is a substitute for in-school \ninstruction nor is it a substitute for parental involvement.\n  What we're talking about providing is individualized after school, \nweekend, and summer reading tutoring for nearly 3 million children a \nyear from kindergarten through third grade [K-3] who want and need \nextra help. This will supplement the learning that is taking place \nduring classroom hours. What's more important is that this tutoring \nwill take place at no cost to parents and students.\n  I know that there has been criticism about having a literacy program \ndirectly aimed at children in K-3. I have to disagree with this \ncriticism. Schools cannot do it alone. Many public schools simply do \nnot have the resources to give students the one-on-one attention they \nneed.\n  We have to launch a large-scale effort to tackle our Nation's youth \nliteracy problem. I believe we need to mobilize and train volunteers to \ncome into the schools to help our children learn to read. I believe we \nneed to hire reading specialists to help our Nation's children. \nTeachers cannot do it alone. And parents need our help.\n  When 40 percent of our Nation's children cannot read on level by the \nthird grade, we must ask ourselves as a nation what we're doing wrong \nand how we can correct it. This is a widespread problem that crosses \ngender, racial, and religious lines.\n  As the Nation begins to enter the 21st century, we cannot have our \nyoung people--our future--lagging behind in basic skills. This affects \nour Nation as a whole. It affects our Nation's productivity. It affects \nour work force. When these children become adults, they will not have \nthe basic skills needed to survive.\n\n  Reading is an ongoing activity. And, if we want our children to \nsucceed, if we want to promote work force readiness, and if we want to \nraise academic standards in our schools, then we have to reach our \nchildren in their early stages of development.\n  I hear from teachers, administrators, and counselors in my State \nabout the dismal crisis in public schools. Many children come to school \nfrom impoverished backgrounds. Many children come to school either \nabused themselves or the witness to domestic abuse in the home. With \nall of these obstacles, it's even more difficult for teachers to teach \nand for students to learn to read.\n  That's why I am supporting this bold, new initiative. The idea is to \nuse the resources that our Nation already has--libraries, volunteers, \nstudents, businesses, and civic organizations--to help our most \nprecious resource--our youth. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERREY:\n  S. 665. A bill to monitor the progress of the Telecommunications Act \nof 1996; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n             the telecommunications act progress report act\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Department of Justice has \napproved the merger of the Bell Atlantic and Nynex Corporations. While \nthis is a matter within the discretion and jurisdiction of the \nDepartment, I rise to express my concern and disappointment with this \ndecision.\n  With this merger, two strong potential competitors with two vibrant, \nrich markets have combined.\n  Bell Atlantic/Nynex will control more than 25 percent of all access \nlines in the United States and would serve 26 million customers. The \nmerger is the second largest in U.S. history and the new company will \nrank among the 25 largest U.S. companies.\n  A little more than a year ago, the Congress enacted landmark \nlegislation to open telecommunications markets to competition, preserve \nand advance universal service and spur private investment in \ntelecommunication infrastructure. Over the last year, the Federal \nCommunications Commission has worked overtime to implement the new law. \nIt has been a daunting task.\n  While the FCC struggles with implementation of the new law, it is \nimportant to remember that a key part of that legislation did not rely \non regulation, it relied on the marketplace. The idea was to unleash \npent up competitive forces among and between telecommunications \ncompanies.\n  This transaction replaces the urge to compete with the urge to merge.\n  To unshackle the restraints of the modified final judgment which \ncontrolled the break up of AT, the Congress gave regional Bell \noperating companies instant access to long-distance markets outside of \ntheir local service regions and access to long-distance markets inside \ntheir regions when they opened their markets to local competition as \nmeasured by the bill's competitive checklist.\n  In addition to responding to the lure of long-distance markets, \nregional Bell operating companies and other local exchange carriers \nwere expected to covet each other's markets. The attraction of serving \nmarkets like New\n\n[[Page S3802]]\n\nYork City, Baltimore, and Washington, DC, with local and long distance \nproducts was to be a key catalyst for breaking down barriers to \ncompetition. Who knows better what is needed to compete for local \nexchange customers in a new market better than another local exchange \ncompany?\n  With this transaction, local competition and long-distance \ncompetition is lost. In addition, potential internet, video and broad-\nband competition has disappeared.\n  The promise of the new law was that competition, not consolidation \nwould bring new services at lower prices to consumers. Where \ncompetition failed to advance service and restrain prices, universal \nservice support would assure that telephone rates and services were \ncomparable in rural and urban areas.\n  When large telecommunications companies combine, they not only \neliminate the potential of competition with each other in each other's \nmarkets, but they create a market power which may be capable of \nresisting competition from others. They also create the possibility of \nan unequal bargaining power when they compete with or deal with small, \nindependent and new carriers.\n  A strong role for the Department of Justice was my No. 1 cause when \nthe full Senate considered the Telecommunications Act. I supported \nfinal passage of the law because the conference committee bolstered the \nDepartment's authority as compared to the Senate version of the bill. \nThe legislation relied on the existing, strong antitrust powers of the \nDepartment of Justice. It also removed the FCC's ability to bypass \nDepartment of Justice antitrust review.\n  As we measure progress against promise, it is vitally important that \nthe Congress have sufficient information to assure that those powers \nare sufficient to promote competition, affordable prices and universal \nservice.\n  Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to monitor the \nprogress of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. This bill instructs the \nNational Telecommunications and Information Administration, in \nconsultation with the Federal Communications Commission, the Department \nof Justice, other executive branch agencies and State regulatory \nutility commissions to issue an annual report to the Congress on \ntelecommunications services in America.\n  The report would review available information and consider at a \nminimum the level of competition, the provision of universal service in \ntelecommunications markets, mergers among telecommunications providers \nand their effect, employment in the American telecommunications \nindustry and the affordability of residential rates for \ntelecommunications services. The report will also make legislative and \npolicy recommendations to the Congress and the President.\n   Mr. President, I believe that if properly implemented, the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996 can deliver on its promises of \ncompetition, affordable rates, universal service, jobs, and investment. \nI am not prepared to recommend major change to the 1996 law, but I am \nprepared to argue for a higher level of competitive vigilance by this \nCongress and the executive branch.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 666. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, with respect to \nStates that do not give full faith and credit to the protective orders \nof other States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n  FULL FAITH AND CREDIT FOR PROTECTIVE ORDERS ISSUED IN OTHER STATES \n                              LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation that will help ensure that States live up to their \nresponsibility to give full faith and credit to protective orders \nissued in other States.\n  In the 1994 Crime Act, as part of the Violence Against Women Act, \nCongress passed a provision requiring states to enforce the protection \norders issued in sister States.\n  What this means, Mr. President, is that if a woman has secured a \nprotective order against her husband in New Jersey, and then goes to \nPennsylvania to stay with her parents and her husband follows her, \nPennsylvania is obligated to enforce the New Jersey protective order.\n  This is common sense, it will protect the lives and well-being of \ncountless threatened women, and is the law. However, for some reason \nStates have been disregarding their legal obligation to enforce these \norders.\n  Mr. President, it seems that the only way to get the States to live \nup to this obligation is to threaten some of their Federal funding.\n  Accordingly, the bill I am introducing today allows the Attorney \nGeneral to withhold 10 percent of all formula Byrne grant crime \nfighting funds given to a State if it is failing to enforce out-of-\nState protective orders. Although I believe that these funds are an \nimportant crime prevention and crime fighting tool, it has become clear \nthat there must be some mechanism to ensure that States live up to \ntheir responsibilities to victims of domestic abuse.\n  Mr. President, violence against women is one of our country's most \nheinous and pressing crimes. Every 12 seconds a woman is battered. \nAbout 10 times more women are victimized annually by domestic violence \nthan are diagnosed with breast cancer. These figures reflect only \nreported crimes--the actual incidence rates are even higher.\n  According to the FBI, domestic violence is the single most common \nsource of injury among women ages 15 to 44, more common than auto \naccidents, muggings, and rape by a stranger combined.\n  Protective orders are an important device in combating domestic \nviolence, and protecting women who have already been battered from \nfurther harm. But they are only effective if they are enforced.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support the bill, and \nask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 666\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FULL FAITH AND CREDIT GIVEN TO PROTECTIVE ORDERS.\n\n       Section 2265 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d) Formula Grant Reduction for Noncompliance.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Beginning with the second fiscal year \n     commencing after the date of enactment of this subsection, \n     and in each fiscal year thereafter, if a State is not in \n     compliance with subsections (a) and (b), the Attorney General \n     shall reduce by 10 percent the amount that the State would \n     otherwise receive for that fiscal year under subpart 1 of \n     part E of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \n     Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3751 et seq.).\n       ``(2) Redistribution of amounts.--In any fiscal year, the \n     total amount remaining for distribution under subpart 1 of \n     part E of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \n     Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3751 et seq.) by operation of \n     paragraph (1), shall be distributed on a pro rata basis among \n     States that--\n       ``(A) are eligible to receive a grant under subpart 1 of \n     part E of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \n     Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3751 et seq.); and\n       ``(B) are in compliance with subsections (a) and (b) of \n     this section.''.\n\n

ROLLAND C. LOWE\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I commend Dr. Rolland C. \nLowe, the new president of the California Medical Association. Dr. Lowe \nis the first Asian-American elected president in the organization's \n147-year history.\n  Dr. Lowe started his distinguished career at the University of \nCalifornia at Berkeley, where he attended undergraduate school. After \ncompleting his undergraduate work, he studied medicine at the \nUniversity of California at San Francisco. He completed a medical \ninternship at San Francisco General Hospital and a surgical residency \nat UCSF.\n  Dr. Lowe has been a trailblazer for many years. In 1982, he was \nelected the first Asian-American president of the San Francisco Medical \nSociety. For the past three decades, Dr. Lowe has been a distinguished \nmember of the medical community. Since 1965, Dr. Lowe has served on the \nclinical faculty at UCSF and has practiced medicine in San Francisco's \nChinatown. Dr. Lowe is a former chair of the board of trustees at \nChinese Hospital in San Francisco and he continues to participate as an \nactive board member. At Chinese Hospital, Dr. Lowe also served as the \nchief of surgery and the chief of staff. He has worked hard to provide \nlow-income immigrants with high quality health care.\n  Dr. Lowe has a long history with not only the medical community, but \nwith the California Medical Association as well. He has been active in \nthe CMA for many years, and has served on the board of trustees of the \nCMA since 1987, chairing it from 1994 to his election. He has been a \ntireless advocate of better health care for the Chinese American \ncommunity.\n  Dr. Lowe's goal as president of the California Medical Association is \nto get physicians more involved in their communities. He has said, ``In \nable to be good patient advocates, doctors need to understand their \ncommunity.'' In this era of managed care, Dr. Lowe's commitment to re-\nestablishing a personal relationship between doctor and patient is \nespecially commendable. Looking at Dr. Lowe's history of service tells \nus that he is the right man to accomplish this goal. He has devoted his \nenergies not just to medicine, but more broadly to his community. He \nhas worked to provide decent housing for the elderly in San Francisco, \nthrough redevelopment of the old International Hotel for use as a \nsenior housing and community center. Dr. Lowe is the founder and Chair \nof the Lawrence Choy Lowe Memorial Fund, which is a charitable and \ncivic foundation in Chinatown.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the town of Nottingham on its 275th anniversary. On May 10, \n1997, at the 275th anniversary celebration, the Nottingham Historical \nSociety and the anniversary committee will be reading the Royal Charter \nof May 10, 1722, which founded the town of Nottingham.\n  When the charter was formally issued in 1722, there were 132 persons \nwho were allowed to draw lots of land to establish the town. Now, \nNottingham is a quaint New England town of 3,002 people, still \ndedicated to the Yankee ingenuity that formed the town in colonial \ntimes.\n  Nottingham was at the forefront of America's industrial history. In \n1727, the townspeople decided to build the first sawmill on the \nTuckaway River which was the beginning of 17 water powered mills for \nthe purpose of sawing lumber, grinding grain, and fulling, a process of \ncleansing and working up a nap on rough, woolen homespun cloth.\n  The rugged land was too rocky for the planting of crops and the land \nhad to be cleared to allow the family's provisions to be raised, and to \nprovide winter food for the livestock. Charcoal was produced for sale \nin the seacoast towns like this one; it was used as the fuel in the \nfurnaces for making iron and for heating and cooking in city \nfireplaces. The ironmills along the two-mile streak--also known as New \nPortsmouth--required large amounts of charcoal, too, for building \nfurnaces and making iron. The name of today's Smoke Street still \nindicates how much charcoal was produced in the former Summer Street of \nthe 1700's.\n  In spite of the hardships of nature in the cold northeast, Nottingham \nstarted to grow. By the late 1760's the Nottingham Square included a \nschool house, a church, a meeting house, and a store. Landowners were \nbuilding homes which were substantial. The Butler Inn, for example, and \nmany other colonial and federal style homes remain in good condition \ntoday.\n  Nottingham also has a place of honor in our Nation's military \nhistory. Gen. Henry Dearborn led Nottingham in the march of the \nMinutemen to the Battle of Bunker Hill in the American Revolution. \nThree other brave Revolutionary War generals, Joseph Cilley, Thomas \nBartlett and Henry Butler, remained in Nottingham to become leading \ncitizens and many of their descendants are still actively involved in \nthe improvement of Nottingham today.\n  During the Civil War, Nottingham residents provided many able-bodied\n\n[[Page S3805]]\n\nmen to fight and supplied the Union Armies with food and clothing. From \nthe Civil War to the gulf war, many members of Nottingham's families \nhave served their country proudly and honorably in all branches of our \nNation's services.\n  Nottingham's residents today serve in professional, semiprofessional, \ntrade, and service occupations. Though individualistic, these \ntownspeople are family-oriented and prudent. They always strive for the \nbetterment of their community and are willing to contribute their time \nand talents on behalf of their neighbors.\n  I congratulate all the dedicated and patriotic residents of \nNottingham on this historic milestone and wish them an enjoyable year \nof celebration and remembrance. They all should be very proud of the \ntown's heritage and 275 years of distinguished history. I send them my \nbest wishes for continued success and prosperity. Happy Birthday, \nNottingham.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/29/senate-section/article/S3804-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3805-S3807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               WE NEED THE CWC TO CONFRONT ROGUE NATIONS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, with the active participation of the \nPresident and his National Security Council and other foreign policy \nand national security representatives, Senator Biden, the Foreign \nRelations Committee ranking Democratic member and his staff have worked \ndiligently to remove as many of the objections and doubts about the \nChemical Weapons Convention held by a number of Republican Senators as \nthey possibly could remove. Working together, they sought to do this by \nproviding official data and information about the convention, about \nDefense Department plans, and about intelligence sources and methods; \nby obtaining official commitments from the President; and by \nnegotiating conditions to the treaty. This negotiating effort centered \non Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Helms and his staff and Senate \nMajority Leader Lott and his staff as well as other Senators who have \nvoiced major concerns about the treaty.\n  I believe the evidence is unassailable that the effort to negotiate \nconditions acceptable to both treaty proponents and opponents produced \ngreat progress--in fact, a degree of progress few thought was \nattainable when the process began. As a result, this afternoon the \nSenate has unanimously agreed to 28 conditions that address a sweeping \nrange of treaty facets.\n  One measure of how successful this effort has been is that yesterday, \nformer Senate majority leader and 1996 Republican Presidential nominee \nBob Dole announced that, given the assurances and insurance those 28 \nconditions provide, he now supports the convention and believes it is \nin our Nation's national security interest to ratify it and participate \nin its ongoing efforts to eliminate chemical weapons from this Earth.\n  Senator Dole was clear in noting that the treaty remains imperfect in \nhis mind, a fact that comes as no surprise to treaty proponents but \nstill is loudly professed to be a shocking fact by some treaty \nopponents.\n  But despite the herculean effort that has resulted in agreement on 28 \nconditions to the treaty, Senator Helms and some other Senators have \nbeen relentless in insisting on 5 other conditions. While the stated \npurpose of each of these conditions appears on the surface to be \nlaudable, and that stated purpose could be readily embraced by \nvirtually every Senator if not every Senator, ranging from stalwart \ntreaty proponent to stalwart opponent, the practical effect of four of \nthese conditions in the form in which their drafters insist on them \nwould be to prevent the United States from ratifying the CWC, even if \nthe Senate were to vote 100 to 0 for ratification with any of these \nconditions attached to the resolution of ratification the Senate \napproved.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, these proposed conditions to which \ntreaty proponents could not possibly agree, which are contained in the \nsubstitute resolution authored by Senator Helms along with the 28 \nconditions to which the agreement of both treaty proponents and \nopponents was secured, have come to be known among treaty proponents as \nthe killer amendments.\n  This afternoon, under the terms of the unanimous-consent agreement \nthat governs Senate action on the CWC, the Senate will take up these \ndisputed conditions one at a time. Treaty proponents will move to \nstrike each of them, and the Senate will vote on each of those motions \nto strike.\n  It is not possible to overemphasize the importance of these motions \nand the vote on them, Mr. President. Because regardless of what is said \nabout the rationale for insisting on these disputed conditions, Mr. \nPresident, the fact is that the United States will be unable to ratify \nthe CWC now or any time in the immediate future--and quite possibly \nnever--if the effort to strike any one of them from the resolution \nfails. That is the gravity of what we will be doing on the Senate floor \nfor the next 5 or 6 hours.\n\n  The first of the disputed conditions that we will take up is \nCondition 30, titled, somewhat antiseptically, Chemical Weapons in \nOther States. The text of this condition is quite short. Let me quote \nit verbatim:\n\n       Prior to the deposit of the United States instrument of \n     ratification, the President, in consultation with the \n     Director of Central Intelligence, shall certify to the \n     Congress that countries which have been determined to have \n     offensive chemical weapons programs, including Iran, Iraq, \n     Syria, Libya, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, \n     China, and all other countries determined to be state \n     sponsors of international terrorism, have ratified or \n     otherwise acceded to the Convention.\n\n  Now let me translate that text into simple English. Under the terms \nof that condition, were it to be attached to the resolution of \nratification and the Senate were to pass it in that form, regardless of \nhow many votes the resolution receives, and regardless of the strong \nsupport of the President of the United States for ratification, the \nUnited States could not formally ratify the Convention or be a part of \nits efforts to remove chemical weapons from the Earth until and unless \nthe President could and did certify to the Congress that all the rogue \nnations of the Earth had first ratified the Convention or formally \nagreed to abide by its provisions.\n  Mr. President, I certainly applaud those who drafted this condition \nfor the objective they seek. There is no Senator who more fervently \nwishes than this Senator that Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, North Korea, \nChina, Cuba, and Sudan--and, in fact, all nations on the Earth--will \nratify the CWC and fully abide by all its provisions. Were that to be \nthe case, Mr. President, the world would be a far, far safer, \nhealthier, and more stable place for the human race.\n  Indeed, were that to be the case, the effect would be so profound \nthat the CWC probably would no longer be needed, because we would have \nreached the unreachable, achieved the unachievable. We would have \nreached a near-Utopia.\n  But the hard, cold fact, Mr. President, is that while one or two or \neven more of these nations, some of which are often referred to as \nrogues, may ratify the CWC, and, if they do, we certainly hope and \nexpect they will abide by its terms and destroy their chemical weapons \narsenals and foreswear the production of any more chemical weapons, it \nis a safe bet that several of these nations will not ratify the \nConvention in the foreseeable future.\n  That absolutely cannot come as a surprise to anyone in this Chamber. \nI do not believe a single Member of the Senate could look me in the eye \nand make a genuine claim that he or she is surprised to learn that most \nclose observers of these nations do not believe that several of them \nwill ratify the CWC anytime soon.\n  Indeed, much of the 10 years during which the Reagan administration \nand Bush administration negotiating teams spent in exhausting and \nexhaustive negotiations to develop this treaty was spent to structure \nsanctions that will apply to trade in chemicals conducted by nations \nthat do not ratify the CWC, in the full expectation that some if not \nall of these very nations will not ratify it. Think about it, and it \nwill be painfully apparent. The CWC was not carefully negotiated and \ncrafted to apply principally to those nations that ratify it and \ngenuinely want to rid the Earth of all chemical weapons, though, of \ncourse, we must hold all nations accountable. It was negotiated and \ncrafted to apply the pressure of world opinion, diplomatic pressure, \nand economic pressure on recalcitrant nations whose\n\n[[Page S3806]]\n\nleaderships flaunt the civilized norm and equip themselves with these \nhorrific weapons, and where even this pressure does not attain reformed \nbehavior, to make it as difficult as possible for those nations to \ncarry on their deadly efforts--to isolate them in all possible ways.\n\n  The Senator from North Carolina is absolutely correct when he says \nthe rogue nations, or at least some of them, have these materials. In a \nnumber of cases, I am convinced they will continue to produce them, \nChemical Weapons Convention or no Chemical Weapons Convention. But the \nissue before the Senate is how can we best try to pressure them to \nreform their behavior. How do we make it as difficult as possible for \nthem to continue to do that? It is not, I assert, by means of this \ncondition. It will not directly have that effect. And, more \ndestructively, it will prevent U.S. participation in the CWC, period.\n  Plainly, Mr. President, the authors of this condition know that if \nthe condition we now are debating is not defeated, they have succeeded \nvia the backdoor when they could not succeed through the front door in \npreventing U.S. ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. That \nis an outcome that must not be permitted.\n  This condition has other destructive consequences. Let me note a few \nof them.\n  First, this condition places control of a critical U.S. foreign \npolicy and national security decision wholly in the hands of other \nnations, and not just any other nations. It places total control of \nwhether the United States will ever ratify the CWC and participate in \nits vital efforts to rid the Earth of chemical weapons in the hands of \nthe very group of nations that are led by those who are our avowed or \nde facto adversaries--our enemies if you will. What kind of sense does \nit make to give control of this key U.S. decision to any other nation, \nmuch less to any one of these nations? And yet this is the unintended \nconsequence of action by Senators who in every other circumstance most \nvehemently insist that U.S. sovereignty must never be weakened or \ntrampled.\n  Second, this condition either fails to recognize or ignores the \nreality that at midnight next Tuesday--April 29--the Chemical Weapons \nConvention takes effect with or without U.S. participation. The \nquestion of whether the Convention is the best that can be designed is \nnot the salient question at this point. The principal question now \nrelevant is whether the United States, its people, and its security \ninterests are better served by being a part of the Convention and \nworking from within its organization to pursue abolition of the world's \nchemical arsenals, or to remain outside the Convention, which already \nhas been ratified by 74 nations and is sure to be ratified by others of \nthe over 160 signatories.\n\n  If we fail to ratify, which emphatically will be the result of \nfailing to strike this killer condition, guess which nations the \ncompany of which the United States ignominiously will join? Mr. \nPresident, in bitter irony, the United States, which under Presidents \nReagan and Bush initiated, animated, and led the effort to negotiate \nthis Convention, will join the company of precisely the group of \nnations this condition identifies as the world's villains and rogues. \nRather than continuing to provide global leadership and rallying the \nworld's community of nations to establish a new standard of behavior \nwhich proscribes all chemical weapons and engineers effective movement \ntoward reducing them dramatically and ultimately, we hope, eliminating \nthem entirely, we turn a sharp 180 degrees in the opposite direction, \nand refuse to be a part of this critical effort. In my judgment and the \njudgment of other people, U.S. prestige and respect around the world \nwill be tragically tarnished. The ability of the United States to \neffectively lead the community of nations in myriad ways will be \nseverely damaged. Our national credibility will suffer a serious blow.\n  Third, those who insist on this killer condition have claimed that \nthey cannot countenance U.S. participation in the CWC because they are \ncertain that some nations will not participate in it or, if they do \nratify it, they will not abide by its terms--notably, they believe, \nincluding the nations listed in this condition or at least some of \nthem. As the Senator from Delaware noted earlier, as he quoted \nSecretary of State Albright, this is analogous to saying that we should \nhave no laws because we are certain that some people will break them.\n  Mr. President, I want to note what three of our most respected voices \nin this country with respect to national security affairs have said in \nagreeing that the United States should ratify the Chemical Weapons \nConvention and specifically addressing the linkage of our actions on \nthe CWC to those of the outlaw states that is made by Condition 30.\n  Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of United States and coalition \ntroops in Desert Storm, said, ``I am very, very much in favor of the \nratification of that treaty,'' referring, of course, to the CWC. ``We \ndon't need chemical weapons to fight our future warfares. And frankly, \nby not ratifying that treaty, we align ourselves with nations like \nLibya and North Korea, and I just as soon not be associated with those \nthugs in this particular manner.'' I think that is a pretty strong \nstatement about precisely what this condition would do.\n  Gen. Colin Powell, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who \nserved in that role during the Bush administration and during the \nDesert Storm operation, has already been quoted by my colleague. He, \ntoo, made it very clear that we should insist on this linkage.\n  Former Assistant to President Reagan and Secretary of State James A. \nBaker III said:\n\n       [S]ome have argued that we shouldn't commit to the treaty \n     because states like Libya, Iraq, and North Korea, which have \n     not signed it, will still be able to continue their efforts \n     to acquire chemical weapons. This is obviously true. But the \n     convention, which . . . will go into effect in April \n     whether or not we have ratified it, will make it more \n     difficult for these states to do so by prohibiting the \n     sale of materials to non-members that can be used to make \n     chemical weapons. . . . It makes no sense to argue that \n     because a few pariah states refuse to join the convention \n     the United States should line up with them rather than \n     with the rest of the world.\n\n  Mr. President, that is not company that I want our Nation to be in. \nIt would be a step that would have precisely the opoposite effect of \nthat sought by its authors. Our failure to ratify the CWC will give any \nnation in the world all the cover it needs to fail to ratify. One need \nnot have a great imagination to know what will result. When those \nnations that have ratified seek to point the finger of opprobrium at \nnonparticipants, very few will fail to respond that the United States \nhas determined that it does not support this treaty or what it is \ndesigned to accomplish.\n  Accepting this killer condition is playing right into the hands of \nthe rogue nations that want no limits on their macabre chemical \nactivities. I would think that reality would send shivers up and down \nthe spines of all who recoil at the idea of troops from one or more of \nthese rogue nations employing an instantly fatal gas against American \ntroops, or an aerosol compound that leads to the slow, wretched, \nexcruciating death of thousands of American service men and women.\n  If we in the Senate do not remove this killer condition, we will be \nknowingly driving a stake through the heart of the first successful \neffort in human history to declare that manufacture or possession of \nchemical weapons is illegal under international law and to put \nunremitting pressure on those nations. Over time, if the United States \nputs its full weight behind the CWC effort as an active participant, \nthe nations that refuse to participate will be shut out of the market \nfor many dual use chemicals that can be used to make both chemical \nagents and commercial products as harmless as writing ink. Such nations \nwill find it considerably more difficult to produce or acquire chemical \nweapons. This will produce cumulative pressure to join the community of \nnations by ratifying the treaty and living up to its requirements.\n  To those who say that is not sufficient, or that it will happen too \nslowly, or that there will be cheaters in the treaty as well as \nnonparticipants, I say what is your alternative that will work more \nsurely or more rapidly? The reality is that those who are insisting on \nthis killer amendment have no alternative, much less one that will work \nmore surely or rapidly.\n\n[[Page S3807]]\n\n  It must be remembered that currently it is not even illegal to make \nor stockpile chemical weapons, and there is no other effort on the \nhorizon to make these actions illegal or to effectively halt them. If \nthe United States chooses not to ratify this treaty after leading the \nworld to it, you can rest assured the community of nations will not be \nrunning to us to seek our leadership in some new effort to do that.\n  In addition to all the reasons I have cited for rejecting this killer \ncondition, it is both appropriate and accurate to add every reason \nadvanced by dozens of Senators of both parties during yesterday's and \ntoday's sessions for ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention. Because \nthe only practical effect of this condition is to make it impossible \nfor the United States to ratify. Everything else that is said to \njustify accepting this condition is eyewash, window dressing, \ncamoflage.\n\n  Only one thing about this condition matters, I say to all my \ncolleagues. If this condition is not defeated, the ratification of the \nChemical Weapons Convention is.\n  There can be no hiding from this central truth. Reasonable people can \ndiffer on substantive or policy grounds. Some Senators, albeit for \nreasons I believe are not meritorious or even logical, may conclude \nthat they do not believe the United States should ratify the CWC. \nPresumably those Senators, whose number I hope is very, very small, \nwill vote against the resolution of ratification. But no Senator can \nclaim with veracity that he or she wants the United States to ratify \nthe CWC now or in the foreseeable future, and participate in its vital \nactivities to rid the world of chemical weapons, while voting to retain \nthis condition. The two are mutually inconsistent, mutually \nincompatible. To place it in the vernacular, that does not compute.\n  I urge all my colleagues to consider and understand the gravity of \nthe vote we are about to take. Those who support the CWC must vote to \nstrike this condition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/29/senate-section/article/S3805-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RABBI IRWIN GRONER AND ADAM CARDINAL MAIDA\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to two \nnotable religious leaders from my home State of Michigan, Rabbi Irwin \nGroner and Adam Cardinal Maida. Rabbi Groner and Cardinal Maida are the \nrecipients of the 1997 Dove Award, sponsored by the Ecumenical \nInstitute for Jewish-Christian Studies.\n  The Dove Award was created in 1994 to recognize Christian and Jewish \nreligious leaders who work to promote closer relationships between the \ntwo communities. I have worked closely with both men throughout my \ncareer, and have been grateful for their advice, guidance, and \nfriendship.\n  Rabbi Groner leads Congregation Shaarey Zedek in Southfield, MI. An \ninternationally recognized spiritual leader, Rabbi Groner serves as the \npresident of the Michigan Board of rabbis and is a member of the board \nof governors of the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit and the \nRabbinic Cabinet of the United Jewish Appeal. His writings on spiritual \nand social issues are published monthly in the Jewish News and appear \nregularly in periodicals of the Conservative Jewish Movement. From 1990 \nto 1992, Rabbi Groner served as the president of the Rabbinical \nAssembly, an international association of 1200 conservative rabbis. He \nwas the first clergyman to be named to the Judicial Tenure Commission \nof Michigan.\n  Adam Cardinal Maida arrived in Detroit in 1990 as archbishop of the \nArchdiocese of Detroit. In 1990, he was elevated to the College of \nCardinals by Pope John Paul II. Cardinal Maida has put commitment to \nyouth into action by joining Baptist, Episcopalian, and Lutheran \nleaders in creating cornerstone schools, which offer \ninterdenominational educational programs to children in Detroit. \nCardinal Maida has continually attempted to break down the walls which \nexist in our society, emphasizing the importance of voluntarism, \nreaching out to Detroit's Hispanic community and working with political \nleaders to craft solutions to a number of social problems.\n  In 1992, Rabbi Groner, Cardinal Maida, and Episcopal Bishop R. \nStewart Wood founded the Religious Leaders Forum, which encourages \nChristian, Jewish, and Muslim leaders to share their views on issues of \nconcern. Activities like this have not only provided Rabbi Groner and \nCardinal Maida with opportunities to work together, but they have \ncemented a personal friendship as well. Together, they are building \nbridges for people of the Christian and Jewish faiths to cross.\n  It is a real honor to recognize the achievements of these remarkable \nmen. I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Rabbi Irwin Groner \nand Adam Cardinal Maida as they receive the 1997 Dove Award from the \nEcumenical Institute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/29/senate-section/article/S3807-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3807-S3808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. PAUL KAMINSKI\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, for the past 2\\1/2\\ years, \nmembers of the Senate Committee on Armed Services have been privileged \nto work with Dr. Paul G. Kaminski, who is serving as the Under \nSecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology. Dr. Kaminski has \nled the Department of Defense through the most significant reform of \nthe Nation's defense acquisition system in 50 years. I believe it is \nappropriate for the Senate to recognize the outstanding service \nrendered the Nation by Dr. Kaminski on the occasion of his retirement \nfrom Federal service later this spring.\n  During his tenure as the Defense Acquisition Executive, Dr. Kaminski \nestablished the broad outlines of the technologies and systems that \nwill form the cutting edge of this Nation's defense capabilities well \ninto the next century. His scientific counsel and leadership were \ninstrumental in charting a course ahead for a system of systems \nincluding this Nation's national security space systems, heavy bomber \nforce, air mobility force, ballistic and cruise missile defense, \ntactical air forces, and attack submarine fleet.\n  Dr. Kaminski ushered in a new era--a renaissance--in armaments \ncooperation with our friends and allies around the world. His vision, \nforesight and diplomacy have provided this Nation and our international \npartners with a broad spectrum of collaborative efforts and \nopportunities that include cooperation with Germany and Italy to \ndevelop a medium extended air defense system; cooperation with France, \nGermany, Italy, and Spain to develop, produce, and field an \ninteroperable multifunctional information distribution system; and \ncooperation with the United Kingdom, Norway, and the Netherlands on the \ndevelopment of a revolutionary new joint strike fighter.\n  As steward of the Nation's defense acquisition system, Dr. Kaminski \nhas guided the defense acquisition establishment through a period of \nrevolutionary change and reform. He has changed the way our acquisition \nsystem supports America's soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. \nThrough establishment of integrated product teams--composed of war \nfighters, testers, trainers, doctrine writers, acquirers, and their \nindustry contractors--Dr. Kaminski has dramatically improved the way \nweapon systems are developed, produced, and fielded. Perhaps Dr. \nKaminski's greatest accomplishment is the pride and professionalism he \nhas reinvigorated in the acquisition work force supporting our war \nfighters. The American people can take comfort in the fact that the \nU.S. defense acquisition work force is the very finest in the world. \nOur people are willing to think ``out-of-the-box'' and pushing hard to \nbe better.\n  Dr. Kaminski has been responsible for initiating a wholesale re-\nengineering of the DOD logistics system. He recognized that for the \nrevolution in U.S. military affairs to proceed--the DOD needed a new, \ncompatible logistics support concept. His approach was to substitute \ninformation and fast transportation for inventory. As a result of his \nleadership and vision, logistics response times have improved \nsignificantly and inventories have been reduced dramatically.\n  His reputation is well known in Congress--to those who have worked \ndirectly with him and even many who have not. He is highly respected as \nan individual of integrity, vision, scientific brilliance, and that \nrare trait of objectivity about what he is involved in. His work will \ncontinue to have a very profound and lasting impact upon the Nation's \nsecurity for many years to come. The Nation owes a debt of gratitude to \nDr. Kaminski. It has been my\n\n[[Page S3808]]\n\ndistinct pleasure to be associated with this exceptional public servant \nin conjunction with my duties on the Armed Services Committee. I wish \nhim well and anticipate that his coming years in the private sector \nwill further contribute to the security of this Nation. My best wishes \nto Paul, his lovely wife Julia, and his two children Laura and Garrett, \nas they mark this special milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/29/senate-section/article/S3807-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SENIOR CITIZENS HOME EQUITY PROTECTION ACT\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last Friday, April 25, the Senate \npassed by voice vote the Senior Citizens Home Equity Protection Act \nwhich will enable the Department of Housing and Urban Development to \nprotect seniors against aggressive and unethical practices by firms who \ncharge senior homeowners exorbitant fees for obtaining a home equity \nconversion mortgage. I was not able on that day to voice my support for \nthis legislation, and I want to do so today. I commend Senator D'Amato \nand the other cosponsors of this legislation for their swift and timely \naction on this important piece of legislation. I also want to thank \nSecretary Cuomo for bringing the problem which this legislation \naddresses to our attention.\n  The FHA home equity conversion mortgage program, implemented in 1989, \nhas given 20,000 senior homeowners the opportunity to turn the valuable \nequity in their homes into direct cash payments. This borrowed equity \ncan be used to satisfy any number of needs, and in the case of seniors, \nescalating medical costs colliding with fixed-incomes often make \nadditional financial resources a necessity. Seniors who obtain reverse \nmortgages have median incomes of only $10,400. The ability of low-\nincome seniors to access their home equity and increase their incomes \nis essential for enabling many seniors to continue living in their own \nhomes.\n  This legislation is necessary to protect vulnerable seniors who have \nbeen unscrupulously targeted by certain estate planning services who \ncharge fees of 6 to 10 percent of the cost of the reverse mortgage \nloan. Many homeowners are simply unaware that the process of receiving \na reverse mortgage through the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment is actually free. HUD recently revealed that seniors have \nbeen bilked for thousands of dollars by unregulated companies that have \ntaken a Federal program intended to serve one of our most vulnerable \npopulations and used it for exploitation and financial gain. S. 562 \nwill provide important safeguards for seniors by requiring that the \nmortgagor receives full disclosure of any costs pertaining to the \norigination of a reverse mortgage. Additionally, the Secretary of HUD \nwill be empowered to impose restrictions and prohibit firms from \ncharging excessive fees.\n  Again, I would like to extend my appreciation to Senator D'Amato and \nthe rest of my colleagues for their swift action that will ensure \nsenior homeowners will be no longer be victimized by exploitive reverse \nmortgage tactics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/29/senate-section/article/S3808-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, APRIL 30, 1997\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.
