Under the previous order, the Senator from \nLouisiana, Ms. Landrieu, will now read Washington's Farewell Address.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n\nTo the people of the United States.\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those, out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you, at the same time, to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken, without strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest; no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness; but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been \nmuch earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country, you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust, were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government, the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset, of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience, in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and, every day,\n\n[[Page S798]]\n\nthe increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more, that the \nshade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. \nSatisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my \nservices they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, \nwhile choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, \npatriotism does not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is to terminate the career of \nmy political life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend the deep \nacknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved \ncountry, for the many honors it has conferred upon me; still more for \nthe steadfast confidence with which it has supported me; and for the \nopportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable \nattachment, by services faithful and persevering, though in usefulness \nunequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country from these \nservices, let it always be remembered to your praise, and as an \ninstructive example in our annals, that under circumstances in which \nthe passions, agitated in every direction, were liable to mislead \namidst appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging--in situations in which not unfrequently, want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism,--the constancy of your \nsupport was the essential prop of the efforts, and a guarantee of the \nplans, by which they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this \nidea, I shall carry it with me to my grave, as a strong incitement to \nunceasing vows that heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of \nits beneficence--that your union and brotherly affection may be \nperpetual--that the free constitution, which is the work of your hands, \nmay be sacredly maintained--that its administration in every department \nmay be stamped with wisdom and virtue--that, in fine, the happiness of \nthe people of these states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made \ncomplete by so careful a preservation, and so prudent a use of this \nblessing, as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the \napplause, the affection and adoption of every nation which is yet a \nstranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger, \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me, on an occasion like the present, \nto offer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your \nfrequent review, some sentiments which are the result of much \nreflection, of no inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me \nall important to the permanency of your felicity as a people. These \nwill be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only see in \nthem the disinterested warnings of a parting friend, who can possibly \nhave no personal motive to bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an \nencouragement to it, your indulgent reception of my sentiments on a \nformer and not dissimilar occasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people, is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence; the support of your tranquility at home: your \npeace abroad; of your safety; of your prosperity; of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But, as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed; it is of \ninfinite movement, that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth, or choice, of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism, more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have, in a \ncommon cause, fought and triumphed together; the independence and \nliberty you possess, are the work of joint counsels, and joint efforts, \nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest.--Here, every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nunion of the whole.\n  The north, in an unrestrained intercourse with the south, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry.--The \nsouth, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the \nnorth, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning \npartly into its own channels the seamen of the north, it finds its \nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \ndifferent ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the \nnational navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime \nstrength, to which itself is unequally adapted. The east, in a like \nintercourse with the west, already finds, and in the progressive \nimprovement of interior communications by land and water, will more and \nmore find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from \nabroad, or manufactures at home. The west derives from the east \nsupplies requisite to its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of \nstill greater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure \nenjoyment of indispensable outlets for its own productions, to the \nweight, influence, and the future maritime strength of the Atlantic \nside of the Union, directed by an indissoluble community of interest as \none nation. Any other tenure by which the west can hold this essential \nadvantage, whether derived from its own separate strength; or from an \napostate and unnatural connection with any foreign power, must be \nintrinsically precarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts, greater strength, greater \nresource proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value, they must derive from union, an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves, which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government; which \ntheir own rivalship alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues, would stimulate \nand embitter.--Hence likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the union as a \nprimary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford\n\n[[Page S799]]\n\na happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and full \nexperiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union, affecting \nall parts of our country, while experience shall not have demonstrated \nits impracticability, there will always be reason to distrust the \npatriotism of those who, in any quarter, may endeavor to weaken its \nhands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations,--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourself too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations: they \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head: they have seen, in the \nnegotiation by the executive, and in the unanimous ratification by the \nsenate of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthe event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states, unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the union by \nwhich they were procured? will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such they are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute; they must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay, by the adoption of a constitution of government, \nbetter calculated than your former, for an intimate union, and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government.--But the constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower, and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character, with the real design \nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberations and \naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this \nfundamental principle, and of fatal tendency.--They serve to organize \nfaction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force, to put in \nthe place of the delegated will of the nation the will of party, often \na small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and, \naccording to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the \npublic administration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous \nprojects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome \nplans digested by common councils, and modified by mutual interests.\n  However combinations or associations of the above description may now \nand then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time \nand things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and \nunprincipled men, will be enable to subvert the power of the people, \nand to usurp for themselves the reigns of government; destroying \nafterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority, but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be \nto effect, in the forms of the constitution, alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system; and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments, as of other human institutions:--that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country:--that facility in changes, upon \nthe credit of mere hypothesis and opinion, exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion: and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable. \nLiberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is, indeed, little \nelse than a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of fraction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular references to the founding them on geographical \ndiscrimination. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind.--It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism.--But this leads at length to a more \nformal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which \nresult, gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose \nin the absolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the chief \nof some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his \ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation \non the ruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it in \nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils, and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother; forments occasional riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access \nto the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus \nthe policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and \nwill of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in \ngovernments of a\n\n[[Page S800]]\n\nmonarchial cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, if not with \nfavor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the popular character, \nin governments purely elective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged. \nFrom their natural tendency, it is certain there will always be enough \nof that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there being constant \ndanger of excess, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion, \nto mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a \nuniform vigilance to prevent it bursting into a flame, lest instead of \nwarming, it should consume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those intrusted with its \nadministration, to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment, to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominate in the human heart, is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the \npublic weal against invasions of the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern: some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes.--To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \nmodification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, \nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the constitution \ndesignates.--But let there be no change by usurpation; for through \nthis, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the \ncustomary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent \nmust always greatly overbalance in permanent evil, any partial or \ntransient benefit which the use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked, where is the security for property, for reputation, \nfor life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which \nare the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? and let us \nwith caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained \nwithout religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect, that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or \nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere \nfriend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the \nfoundation of the fabric?\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions, in time of peace, to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should co-operate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind, that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper object (which is always a choice of difficulties), ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt but, in the course of time and things, the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it; can it be that Providence has not connected the \npermanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan, nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others, should be excluded; and that, in \nplace of them, just and amicable feelings towards all should be \ncultivated. The nation which indulges towards another an habitual \nhatred, or an habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a \nslave to its animosity, or to its affection, either of which is \nsufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy \nin one nation against another, disposes each more readily to offer \ninsult and injury, to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be \nhaughty and intractable when accidental or trifling occasions of \ndispute occur. Hence, frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and \nbloody contests. The nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, \nsometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the best \ncalculations of policy. The government sometimes participates in the \nnational propensity, and adopts through passion what reason would \nreject; at other times, it makes the animosity of the nation's \nsubservient to projects of hostility, instigated by pride, ambition, \nand other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace often, sometimes \nperhaps the liberty of nations, has been the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest, in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the \nenmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the \nquarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate inducements or \njustifications. It leads also to concessions, to the favorite nation, \nor privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the \nnation making the concessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought \nto have been retained, and by exciting jealously, ill will, and a \ndisposition to retaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are \nwithheld; and it gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens who \ndevote themselves to the favorite nation, facility to betray or \nsacrifice the interests of their own country, without odium, sometimes \neven with popularity; gilding with the appearances of virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils!--Such an attachment of a small \nor weak, towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be \nthe satellite of the latter.\n\n[[Page S801]]\n\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence, (I conjure you to \nbelieve me fellow citizens,) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake; since history and experience prove, that foreign \ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But \nthat jealously, to be useful, must be impartial, else it becomes the \ninstrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense \nagainst it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive \ndislike for another, cause those whom they actuate to see danger only \non one side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on \nthe other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, \nare liable to become suspected and odious; while its tools and dupes \nusurp the applause and confidence of the people, to surrender their \ninterests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is, \nin extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith:--Here let \nus stop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none, or a \nvery remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her \nfriendships or enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people, under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon, to be \nscrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the \nimpossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard \nthe giving us provocation, when we may choose peace or war, as our \ninterest, guided by justice, shall counsel.\n  Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our \nown to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any \nportion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable \nto public than private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. \nI repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed in their \ngenuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would be \nunwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments, on a \nrespectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, and a liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended \nby policy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy \nshould hold an equal and impartial hand; neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce, but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in \norder to give trade a stable course, to define the rights of our \nmerchants, and to enable the government to support them, conventional \nrules of intercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual \nopinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time \nabandoned or varied as experience and circumstances shall dictate; \nconstantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for \ndisinterested favors from another; that is must pay with a portion of \nits independence for whatever it may accept under that character; that \nby such acceptance, it may place itself in the condition of having \ngiven equivalents for nominal favors, and yet of being reproached with \ningratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to \nexpect, or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an \nillusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to \ndiscard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish; that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions, or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations, but if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism; this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far, in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided \nby the principles which have been delineated, the public records and \nother evidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have, at least, \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April, 1793, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice, and by that of your representatives in both houses of \ncongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfuenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination, with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound, in duty \nand interest, to take a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct, it \nis not necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without any \nthing more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions, and to progress, without \ninterruption, to that degree of strength, and consistency which is \nnecessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own \nfortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence; \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service, \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it, which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations; I anticipate with pleasing expectation that in which I \npromise myself to realize, without alloy, the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking, in the midst of my fellow citizens, the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\n                                                  GEO.

As previously \nannounced, no rollcall votes will occur during today's session of the \nSenate. However, Members should be prepared for votes during Tuesday's \nsession of the Senate. Also, by previous consent, on Wednesday, \nFebruary 25, at 11:30 a.m., the Senate will proceed to the \nconsideration of the veto message to accompany H.R. 2631, the military \nconstruction appropriations bill, with 2 hours of debate in order and a \nvote occurring on the veto message upon the expiration or yielding back \nof that time. However, our former colleague, Senator Ribicoff, passed \naway, and it is my understanding that a few of our colleagues intend to \nattend his funeral on Wednesday morning in New York. Therefore, I now \nanticipate the vote with respect to the veto message to occur at \napproximately 3 p.m. We will notify all Members as to the votes on \nWednesday, February 25, after consultation with the minority leader.\n  As Members are now aware, there are a number of important issues that \nwe hope the Senate will be able to address prior to the Easter recess. \nTherefore, all Members' cooperation is appreciated on the scheduling of \nvotes and floor action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S802-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to reiterate \nthe pressing need for early Senate action on S.1173, the highway bill, \ncommonly referred to as ISTEA II. The federal-aid highway program \nexpired on September 30, last year. In November, Congress passed a \nshort-term extension of the program, but we included in that stop-gap \nmeasure a deadline for enacting a new highway bill this year. And I \nremind my colleagues, the deadline of May 1 is fast approaching. The \nclock is ticking; the calendar is running. After May 1, 1998, no state \nwill be able to obligate any federal highway funds unless a new highway \nbill has been signed into law by that time.\n  So, Mr. President, at this point, there are exactly 40 session-days \nremaining--including today--until the clock strikes midnight on May 1 \nand every state's ability to obligate federal highway funds is suddenly \nand indefinitely cut off. The longer the Senate waits to take up the \nlegislation, the more likely it is that the federal-aid highway program \nwill lapse and road work in many states will slow to a trickle or come \nto an abrupt halt. Unlike past delays in reauthorizing the highway \nprogram, the obligation of highway funds will not go forward after that \ndate, if there is not new authorizing legislation enacted by Congress \nin the meantime. Mr. President, that means that unlike those past \nreauthorizations of the highway program, this year it will come at the \nheight of the construction season. As a result, construction workers \nare likely to be laid off, at a time of the year that many of them \ndepend upon their largest paychecks to come in to help them and their \nfamilies.\n  And these lay-offs will not be mere statistics, Mr. President. We are \ntalking about the loss of real jobs for real people who have real \nfamilies. There are thousands of road construction workers around the \ncountry whose jobs are in greater and greater risk each day that we \ndelay action on the highway bill. We in the Congress have an obligation \nto those workers and their families, our constituents, to beat the May \n1 deadline and prevent those lay-offs and work stoppages from \noccurring.\n  Let me describe just how important this highway legislation is for \nthe construction industry. According to the most recent biennial report \nof the U.S. Department of Transportation on the condition and \nperformance of the nation's highways, federal, state, and local \ngovernments combined invest approximately $39 billion annually in \ncapital improvements to our roads and bridges. That is a lot of money. \nThat is $39 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. Federal funds \naccount for 44% of that investment. That means, in little more than two \nmonths, almost half of all the funds spent on road construction in this \ncountry will dry up--disappear--and the results will be unfortunate for \nmany who work in road construction and related industries. Construction \nlaborers and employers, those who supply construction materials and \nequipment, thousands employed at engineering and design companies--\nthese people and their families face an uncertain future because of the \nCongress' failure to act promptly on this very important highway bill.\n  Even now, the approaching May 1 deadline is having a disruptive \nimpact on road construction in some states, and the disruptions will \ngrow exponentially if the deadline comes and passes without enactment \nof a new highway bill. For instance, the state of Missouri has \nannounced it will stop bid-lettings in April, Illinois and Ohio will \nfollow suit on May 1, and the Tennessee Department of Transportation \nhas told contractors that the state will delay all federally-funded \nhighway projects beginning in March, when they will run out of \navailable intrastate maintenance money. They will run out of resources \nfrom other Federal programs soon thereafter.\n  So the State of Missouri will let its last Federal contract in March. \nAs I have already indicated, the State of Ohio will stop bid-letting on \nor around May 1, and the State of Illinois has reported that in the \nApril-to-June timeframe it will be required to defer over one-quarter \nof a billion dollars in planned Federal projects.\n  As states announce delays in project bid-lettings, contractors know \nthey will have more difficulty in finding work for their employees and \nmaking payments on their machinery and facilities. If Congress has not \nenacted a new highway bill by May 1, contractors across the country \nwill have to begin laying off their employees as projects are \ncompleted. According to officials at the Associated General \nContractors, most companies will not begin rehiring construction \nworkers until at least a month after new legislation is enacted. \nFurthermore, companies will stop using their concrete, pipe, steel, \ncement, asphalt and guardrail suppliers and won't use them again until \n45-60 days after new legislation becomes law.\n\n  In addition, if the federal highway program is left unfunded for a \nnumber of months, the employees of the construction companies will \nattempt to find employment elsewhere, I should think. They have to \ncontinue to put bread on that table for a wife and for children. If \nthey are successful in gaining other employment, the construction \ncompanies will have to hire new employees, often requiring expensive \nand time-consuming job training.\n  If new federal highway funds are not available after May 1, much of \nthe summer construction season will be gone. If there is no new highway \nbill until September, the entire fall construction season will be lost, \nand since winter road construction is nearly impossible in many of our \nnorthern tier states, construction and related industries in those \nstates may be out of\n\n[[Page S803]]\n\nwork until spring, 1999. How many companies will survive the loss of \nincome for that lengthy period of time, Mr. President? What effect will \nit have on the families of construction workers left unemployed because \nof our inaction, our delay on the highway bill?\n  Remember, construction does not operate like an assembly line that \ncan be stopped and started again on short notice. The design and \nconstruction of highway projects are carefully planned months in \nadvance. Projects to be constructed in September generally must be \nplanned early on and funded by May.\n  And if our inaction on the highway bill cripples the construction \nindustry, what effect will it have on the national economy?\n  Mr. President, the last Census of the Construction Industry tallied \n572,851 construction companies with a total employment of 4.6 million \npersons. The industry's annual estimated payroll is $118 billion, and \nconstruction companies work on projects valued at approximately $528 \nbillion a year in the United States. Clearly, crippling the \nconstruction industry will have a ripple effect on our overall economy.\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation has estimated that every one \nbillion dollars invested in highway construction creates 42,100 jobs. \nPassing the highway legislation by May 1 will release to the states \nbillions of federal highway dollars, creating and preserving hundreds \nof thousands of jobs across the country. But the clock, Mr. President, \nis ticking, and those jobs are put at greater risk with each passing \nday.\n  Already, uncertainty about future highway funding is affecting the \neconomy. I am told by people in the construction industry that \ncontractors are putting off hiring and purchasing decisions until they \nhave a clearer idea of how much federal highway funding there will be \nand when it will become available. And if highway contractors aren't \nhiring or buying, other firms aren't selling. Therefore, jobs are \nthreatened in construction-related industries, too.\n  With so much at stake, the Senate should delay no longer. I implore \nthe leadership to call up the highway bill now. The deadline is looming \nand a lot of work lies ahead before we can send a bill to the \nPresident's desk for his consideration and signature. We should be \ndebating the bill today while the Senate is not preoccupied with other \nmatters. With only 40 session-days remaining, every day counts for \nthose thousands of Americans whose livelihood depends on the \nuninterrupted flow of federal highway funds.\n  Let us fulfill our responsibilities, and our obligation to those \nworking Americans, without further delay. We should begin debating \nISTEA now.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I applaud the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his comments on ISTEA. I note--he may have noted this before I came \non the floor--that the Washington Post today had an article by Eric \nPianin speaking of the problems specifically, in the State of Vermont \nin getting this ISTEA money through. In our State--this also occurs in \nMaine and, obviously, in parts of the beautiful State of West \nVirginia--we have a very early fall and extremely late spring and heavy \nsnows in between. We have a fairly short construction season.\n  I hope that the majority leadership of both bodies will get this bill \nup, get it voted on, take the amendments up, vote them up, and vote \nthem down to get it over with so that States--whether it is West \nVirginia, or North Dakota, or Vermont, or Arizona, or any other State \nrepresented by Senators now on the floor--could get on with this.\n  I hate to think of the amount of money that would be wasted if this \nis delayed much longer, and then we have to scramble to get the \ncontracts out. It is taxpayer dollars that get wasted where interests \nare not taken care of.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has been on the floor several times \nalready on this. He has certainly been diligent in meetings with other \nSenators off the floor. And I commend him for doing this. He is doing a \nservice to the country.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Certainly.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished senior \nSenator from Vermont for his remarks. They are both timely and \nappropriate. I deeply appreciate his contribution to this colloquy.\n  Vermont, like West Virginia--and like many other States, as he has \npointed out--has a short construction seasons, especially when we think \nof winter, and spring, fall, and winter again.\n  So the time is now. And I feel greatly emboldened and encouraged by \nthe comments of the distinguished Senator from Vermont. He is a \nstalwart supporter of all things that benefit his State, and the other \nStates of the country.\n  I thank him very much.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from West Virginia. \nI have had the privilege of serving with him for nearly a quarter of a \ncentury. He, of course, has served much longer than I. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to use my \nfull morning business time normally allotted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S802-5", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S803-S805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IRAQ AND THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, dueling for the lead on the front page of \nevery newspaper in this country over the past month have been two \nstories: Whether the United States will send American soldiers into \nbattle with Iraq, whether people will die in Iraq on both sides, or \nwhether the President of the United States had an affair months ago \nwith a former White House intern. Fueled by what have been titillating \nleaks and innuendo, the story of the alleged affair and Special \nProsecutor Kenneth Starr's investigation has, more often than not, \nstolen the lead.\n  I have spoken before about the high volume of information that \napparently originates from prosecutor Starr's office. The press has \ncited as sources ``several Federal investigators,'' ``one official \ninvolved in the discussions,'' or ``sources close to independent \ncounsel Kenneth Starr,'' and ``government officials.'' Whether or not \nthe material concerns matters before the grand jury may be relevant to \nwhether a criminal violation occurred, but the distinction is of no \nrelevance as a matter of prosecutorial ethics. It is prosecutorial \nethics that I am concerned about.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, \nwho shares with me a former career as a prosecutor--a career both of us \nare proud of--knows that a prosecutor's case should be tried in court \nand not the press. When I spoke about Mr. Starr earlier, Senator \nSpecter came to the floor on January 27 to repeat Mr. Starr's \n``emphatic denial'' that his office was in any way responsible for \nthese stories, as Senator Specter had a perfect right to do. But less \nthan 2 weeks after that denial--the denial made by Mr. Starr--Mr. Starr \nacknowledged, on February 5, his ``regret that there have been \ninstances, so it would appear, when that [grand jury secrecy] rule has \nnot been abided by,'' and announced that he was initiating an internal \ninvestigation to determine whether his office was responsible for the \nleaks. Perhaps his ``emphatic denial'' was too hastily put.\n\n  We will see if Mr. Starr pursues that internal investigation of his \nown office with anything even approaching his zealous pursuit of the \nPresident and the First Lady.\n  One of the most disturbing spectacles we have seen from Mr. Starr's \ninquest is that of a mother being hauled before a grand jury to reveal \nher intimate conversations with her own daughter. And she is, of \ncourse, not the only one. According to press accounts, Monica \nLewinsky's close friends have had to fly in from California to testify, \nat whatever expense that might be, to hiring lawyers, and so forth. \nBystanders--people who just happened to be standing there--at White \nHouse events where both the President and the former intern were both \npresent have also been given grand jury subpoenas, as have those who \nused to supervise her work or work alongside the former intern. In this \ninvestigation, even the possibility of gossip based upon gossip, \nhearsay based upon hearsay, is enough\n\n[[Page S804]]\n\nto bring you into the chambers of Kenneth Starr. For witnesses, this \nmay be a matter of having to spend all the money you have saved for a \ncollege education, your children's education, or anything else, to pay \nfor lawyers, if there is even a possibility that you might have been \nsomewhere in the area and might have known something--even though you \nare not alleged to have done anything wrong, even though nothing wrong \nwas alleged to have happened while you were standing there.\n  But, as a father, no tactic was more shocking than the treatment that \nMr. Starr gave the mother of the former White House intern at the \ncenter of this controversy. Every single parent wants to be able to \nprovide comfort and advice to a son or a daughter who is in trouble or \nin need of solace. No attorney, no doctor, no clergymen, no \npsychotherapist, no spouse would, in most States, be faced with the \nawful choice of the mother caught in the machinations of Mr. Starr's \nexpanding investigation. Her choice, as I understand it, was refuse to \ntestify--refuse to say what confidence she had shared with her own \ndaughter--and, if she did refuse, be faced with contempt proceedings, \nincluding possible jail time. She would either go to jail or betray her \nchild's confidences.\n  This is the United States of America. This is not the Star Chamber of \nhundreds of years ago. This is not the Spanish Inquisition. No child, \nno matter what their age, expects his or her conversations with a \nparent to be disclosed to prosecuting attorneys, compelling a parent to \nbetray his or her child's confidence is repugnant to fundamental \nnotions of family, fidelity, and privacy. Indeed, I can think of \nnothing more destructive of the family and family values, nor more \nundermining of frank communications between parent and child, than the \nexample of a zealous prosecutor who decides to take advantage of close-\nknit ties between mother and daughter, of a prosecutor who said, if a \nmother loves a daughter and a daughter will go to a mother to talk to \nthat mother, then we are going to grab the mother. Great family values, \nMr. President. Great family values, Mr. Starr.\n\n  As one law professor said, ``I want my child to be able to come to me \nand share anything in the world. Neither of us should be fearful in the \nback of our minds, that if I'm hauled in front of a grand jury, I'll \neither have to hurt my child or put myself in legal jeopardy.'' If my \nchild were in trouble and chose, as I hope that child would, to come to \nme, I would be loathe to have to refer my child to an attorney or \npriest or psychiatrist, because they have a privilege, and say, ``You \ncan't talk to your own father or your own mother.'' Family bonds of \nblood, affection, loyalty and tradition deserve as much protection as \nthe professional relationships of trust that are already protected by \nlegal privileges.\n  Frankly, I can tell you right now if a child of mine confided in me, \nno grand jury, no prosecutor, no runaway special counsel would get me \nto talk about my child. I would tell that special prosecutor, ``Have \nyou no shame? Have you no shame?'' I would go to jail before I would \never disclose one word that a child of mine said to me. That is the \nfeeling this Vermonter has. And that is the feeling of the shame of a \nprosecutor who would force a mother--a mother--to talk about what her \ndaughter may have told her. It is awful.\n  Four States already have adopted or recognized some variant of the \nparent-child privilege. One Federal circuit to consider whether a \nparent-child privilege should be recognized in Federal proceedings, \nrefused to recognize this privilege stating:\n\n       The legislature, not the judiciary, is institutionally \n     better equipped to perform the balancing of the competing \n     policy issues required in deciding whether the recognition of \n     a parent-child privilege is in the best interests of society. \n     Congress, through its legislative mechanisms, is also better \n     suited for the task of defining the scope of any prospective \n     privilege. . . . In short, if a new privilege is deemed \n     worthy of recognition, the wiser course in our opinion is to \n     leave the adoption of such a privilege to Congress. In re \n     Grand Jury Proceedings, 103 F.3d 1140 (3d Cir. 1996).\n\n  The third circuit is right to let Congress consider this important \nissue. We in Congress should take up this challenge since we apparently \ncannot trust the sound judgment of certain prosecutors. I am going to \nhave a bill which will be a start.\n  We have to assume the reason we have not had legislation on this \nbefore is that prosecutors showed some discretion. A prosecutor is the \nmost powerful position, usually, in government. He or she can decide \nnot only when to bring a prosecution but when to withhold, whether to \ninitiate an investigation or whether to withhold. Prosecutors generally \ndo not think of bringing parents in and browbeating them. But I am \ngoing to ask for a study to see what legislation we might have to \nprevent abuses in this area.\n  Perhaps we should also confirm in legislation that there is a Secret \nService privilege. On this issue I am glad the Justice Department has \napparently concluded there is such a privilege. Presidential security \nand privacy demand such a privilege. Imagine if there were no such \nprivilege. The challenge to this privilege could result in changing the \nway our President and other officials, including foreign dignitaries, \nare able to be protected. To avoid being witness to private conduct, \nwill security details be forced to change where they stand, where \nofficers are placed, how many officers are assigned, and so on? Without \na privilege, will officers on security detail be forced to carry \nlitigation insurance to pay for attorneys when they are called upon to \ntestify as to what they observed? We should not be forcing officers to \nchange the way they carry out their duties simply to avoid being called \nupon to testify by investigators of unprecedented zealotry.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I might have 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is troubling to me, I have been \napproached by law enforcement officers within our FBI who speak about \nbeing concerned that they may be assigned to the special prosecutor's \noffice because they are going to be asked to look into things they \nnormally never would have looked into as law enforcement officers; that \nthere is a reputation that this special prosecutor's office has of an \noverconcentration on private sexual conduct of people--and not just the \nPresident but others as well--that they are going to be asked to look \nat things that as trained professional law enforcement people they \nusually do not look at.\n  I have also been approached by Secret Service agents who talked to me \nabout the fact that they have been called upon to protect foreign \ndignitaries and others and now ask, are they going to be in a situation \nwhere they don't dare come close because they may overhear something of \npersonal conduct and may then be called upon to testify to it? Do they \nhave to worry that in carrying out their own duties they may find \nthemselves bankrupted paying lawyer fees later on? This is a matter of \nsome concern. I hope the feelings of these people are not widespread, \nbut they may well be.\n  I have supported the independent counsel statute in the past, but \nnever before have I been so disturbed by the tactics, judgment, and, at \nminimum, the appearance of partisanship by an independent counsel as I \nhave by those of Mr. Starr and his staff. At a time when we need an \nindependent counsel with the confidence of the American people, we do \nnot have one.\n  For example, although a highly respected independent counsel, Robert \nFiske, had concluded that Vincent Foster's death was a result of \nsuicide, Mr. Starr, prodded by Richard Mellon Scaife and other right-\nwing activists, reopened that investigation. He spent years doing it. \nHe spent millions of dollars of taxpayers' money doing it. He dragged \nthe Foster family and friends through that experience again. He made \npeople again have to hire lawyers. Then what happens? He reaches \nexactly the same conclusion that Mr. Fiske did before, but doing the \nbidding of someone else.\n  Mr. Starr publicly justifies his rush to secretly tape Monica \nLewinsky to expand his Whitewater land deal investigation because a \nclose friend of the President helped her find a job. If the source of \njob offers can prove influence, then Kenneth Starr is in deep trouble \nand probably he should consider resigning. Just 1 year ago, Mr. Starr \naccepted a job offer for a teaching position funded largely by Mr. \nScaife, the same well-\n\n[[Page S805]]\n\nknown conservative publisher and financier who thought that the Foster \ncase should be reopened, who has helped publicize allegations of \nwrongdoing by the President. Who knows what the status of that job \noffer is now?\n  In order for people to have confidence in the results of an \ninvestigation, that investigation must be nonpartisan and perceived to \nbe nonpartisan. That is not the case when it comes to Mr. Starr. My \nfriend from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, as a former prosecutor, \nfully appreciates that principle as well. I understand he, too, has \nquestioned the wisdom of having Mr. Starr head an investigation into \nthe alleged affair since his activities have raised such an appearance \nof partisanship. I again urge Mr. Starr to do what is in the interests \nof the country and to consider whether his judgment has been so \naffected, whether he is now so driven to achieve a result, that he \nshould reconsider his own role in the process.\n  The Senator from Vermont must conclude that Prosecutor Starr has not \nused his power responsibly and has failed his duty. Kenneth Starr is \nnot the impartial, neutral and independent prosecutor the American \npeople need now and the President, as would any American, deserves.\n\n  I predicted that his investigation may mark the death knell of the \nindependent counsel statute. Before it is reauthorized, we ought to \ntake a hard look at safeguards and accountability here. To have a \nnation on the brink of war preoccupied with affairs of the bedroom \nrather than of state is an abomination. More time has been spent on \nweekend talk shows talking about a White House intern than on the \nPresident's decision whether to use force against Iraq.\n  The good news is that while the rest of the country may be distracted \nby whom Mr. Starr will next drag before his grand jury, the President \nand his administration are properly focused on speaking to the American \npeople about the circumstances that brought us to the brink of battle. \nThe administration's preparations for battle surely helped bring about \nthe proposed agreement the United Nation's Secretary General Kofi Annan \nhas reached with Iraqi officials, and I remain hopeful that diplomacy, \nbacked by the commitment to use force, will result in a peaceful \nresolution of this standoff. I look forward to reviewing the details of \nthat agreement.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their forbearance, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S803-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE HIGHWAY BILL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the \npresentation by Senator Byrd, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, on the subject of the highway bill and his desire, and the \ndesire of so many others in this Chamber, to see that the piece of \nlegislation that authorizes spending on highways and roads, the \nbuilding and repairing of our country's infrastructure, be brought to \nthe floor of the Senate, be debated and go to conference so that we can \nget this bill done and tell the Governors and the other people in this \ncountry who are waiting for this Congress to do its work that we have \nfinally finished the job. This is not some idle piece of legislation \nthat either may or may not be enacted into law. The Congress has a \nresponsibility to deal with the issues of this country's \ninfrastructure, especially bridges and roads and safety on our \nhighways, and all of those issues are in the body of this legislation.\n  This legislation was supposed to have been enacted by this Congress \nlast year. Now we are told by some that last year's business must wait \nuntil we have considered next year's budget. That is preposterous. We \nshould bring that bill to the floor now. We were told it would be the \nfirst item of business on the Senate calendar when we reconvened in \nJanuary. It was not. Today we will take up campaign finance reform. I \nam pleased that we are going to do that. But we should take up, \nexpeditiously, the highway bill, debate it and pass it and get it to \nconference.\n  The highway bill, investing in our country's infrastructure, is about \njobs, economic expansion, retaining and creating a first-class \ntransportation system. For a first-class economy to exist, it must have \na first-class transportation system, and that is what this issue is \nabout. Every day, people pull up to the gas pumps and put some gasoline \nin their automobiles. When they do so, they pay money, through a tax on \nevery gallon of that gasoline, that goes into a trust fund that is to \nbe used in the highway bill that we are required to authorize. The \ntaxes are already paid. The question is, will we use that money to \ninvest in this country's bridges and roads? Those who are driving \naround this country know there is plenty yet to do. There is a big job \nahead of us, and the quicker we get this legislation out of the \nCongress the better for this country.\n  So, I appreciate the Senator from West Virginia, the Senator from \nMontana, the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, and others who have \nrepeatedly come to the floor of the Senate saying this is not a \npartisan issue, this is not about parties; this is about investment in \nour country and that we finish the work we didn't get done last year \nand bring this important piece of legislation to the floor and pass it \nas soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S805-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S805-S806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to turn just for a moment to \nthe issue of campaign finance reform which we will take up this \nafternoon at 3 p.m. This is an issue, also, that was discussed some \nlast year and, by agreement, is to be brought to the floor of the \nSenate this afternoon. Since our last discussion on this issue, I want \nto call my colleagues' attention to two pieces of information in the \nnewspaper dealing with the two special elections to the Congress that \nhave been held in the interim period. One was in New York, a special \nelection to fill a vacancy in New York. It says:\n\n       RNC [Republicans National Committee] Invests Heavily in \n     ``Issue'' Attack Ads; $800,000 spent in New York House race.\n\n  It's not hard to figure out who won this race. Mr. President, \n$800,000 of outside money called ``issue ads,'' unregulated by the \ncurrent rules on campaign finance--corporate money, unlimited \nquantities of money from any given source stuck into a big pot and then \nsent into a district by a political party. And it is declared, under \ncurrent circumstances and with current court decisions, that this is \nnot a part of the investment in those races. This nearly $1 million, \nwith other funds included, was brought into the system in the form of \nissue ads--sham ads that were clearly direct 30-second advertisements \nexpressly waged for one purpose, and that was to attack and destroy a \ncandidate of the other party. This was done, by the way, with a legal \nform of cheating made possible by today's campaign finance law and \ncurrent court decisions permitting issue ads, not so thinly disguised, \nto be waged in unlimited quantity using unlimited corporate money, \nunlimited individual money and undisclosed so that no one, no one in \nthis country, will discover where the money came from. That is what is \nwrong with this current system.\n\n  We just had more recently a race in California. Same result; \ndifferent amounts. Two different groups, large amounts of money coming \ninto so-called issue advertising. Do they have a right to do this? Yes, \nthey do. But do they have a right to wage advertisements in political \ncampaigns with money that can come in huge blocks donated by \ncorporations or very wealthy people to the tune of $50,000, $100,000 or \n$500,000 and then go into a State and use it in a political race in a \nFederal election and never have to disclose where the money came from? \nI don't think that's fair.\n  If anybody on the floor of the Senate, given what we have seen in the \nrecent races in this country, can stand and say, ``Gee, campaign \nfinance reform, there's nothing wrong here, things are just fine,'' if \nanybody can honestly stand on the floor of the U.S. Senate and say \nthings are just fine, we have no problems with campaign finance reform, \nI submit that they have not watched what is happening around the \ncountry.\n  We passed a piece of campaign finance reform legislation in 1974, and \nthe rules since 1974 have been bent and twisted and people have gone \nunder them and over them, and the result now, not only because of what \nhas happened with those rules but also because\n\n[[Page S806]]\n\nof some court decisions, is that we have a campaign finance system in \ntotal chaos.\n  I come to the floor today to support the McCain-Feingold bill which \nwill be voted on this week by the U.S. Senate. We have some Members of \nthe Senate who have stood and said, ``We intend to filibuster; we don't \nthink that anything should be passed by the Congress; we believe \nanything that Congress does limits someone else's speech.'' And, in \neffect, I guess they are saying there ought not be any rules.\n  We are told somehow that money is speech in politics: The more money \nyou have, the more speech you have, the more you are able to speak. \nSome of us believe that there ought to be in politics campaign finance \nreform that begins to set some reasonable limits on what kind of money \nis spent in political campaigns. We think that the current regime of \ncampaign finance is just completely spiraling out of control, and we \nthink the McCain-Feingold bill, while not perfect, is a good piece of \nlegislation for this Congress to enact.\n  Mr. President, I also intend to offer, if I am allowed in the context \nof these debates, one additional piece of legislation I would like to \nmention just for a moment. Federal law currently provides that all \ntelevision stations must offer candidates for Federal office the lowest \nrate on their advertising rate card for commercials for a certain \namount of time preceding the election. To repeat, under current law, we \nsay candidates are entitled to the lowest rate on the rate card for \npolitical advertising for a certain period prior to the election.\n  Everyone has a right to put on the air what they wish to put on the \nair about their opponent. In politics, unlike most other forms of \ncompetition, the normal discourse is to say, ``There's my opponent. \nLook at what an awful person that opponent is. Let me tell you 18 awful \nthings about my opponent.'' Is that the way you see airlines advertise? \n``Look at my competing airline over here. Let me tell you about how \nawful they are, how awful their maintenance record is.'' I don't think \nso. Is that the way automobile companies advertise? No. It is the way \npeople in politics advertise because it has worked.\n  My point is this. I am going to offer an amendment that says we will \nchange the Federal law that requires the lowest rate on the rate card \nfor the 60 days prior to elections. We will say that the television \nstations are required to offer that lowest rate only to television \ncommercials that are 1 minute in length and only in circumstances where \nthe candidate appears on the commercial 75 percent of the time.\n\n  Why do I do that? Because I would like candidates to start taking \nsome ownership of their commercials instead of the 30-second slash-and-\nburn commercial that the candidate never appears on. Oh, everybody has \na right to continue to run those. However, we are not required, in my \njudgment, to tell television studios they must offer the lowest rate \nfor these kinds of ads.\n  Air pollution in this country is a problem. We have been concerned \nabout air pollution for some long while. One form of air pollution in \nthis country is the kind of political commercial that has been very \nsuccessful. I don't deign to suggest now we can ban it. We can't. Free \nspeech in this country and free political speech allows anybody to do \nanything they want in their campaigns in a 30- or 60-second ad.\n  But I believe we ought to give an incentive for those who put \ncommercials on the air during political campaigns that say to the \nAmerican people, ``Here's what I stand for, here's what I believe, \nhere's what I want to fight for as we debate the future of this \ncountry,'' in which the candidate himself or herself asserts positions \nthat they think ought to be a part of public discourse and public \ndebate. It seems to me we ought to try to provide incentives for that \nby saying the lowest rate card in campaigns, the lowest rate on the \nbottom of the card, will go to commercials that are at least 1 minute \nin length and on which the candidate appears 75 percent of the time.\n  I don't know if we are going to get to that. I intend to offer it as \nan amendment.\n  First and foremost, I rise to say I support the McCain-Feingold bill. \nI think Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have done a good job. Is it \nperfect? No. It is an awfully good start to try to bring some order and \nestablish some thoughtful rules to a campaign finance system that is \nnow a mess.\n  I want to be involved in the debate in the coming hours, when I hear \npeople stand on the floor of the Senate and say, ``Gee, we think the \ncampaign finance system is wonderful,'' because I want to ask them what \nthey have been reading, what they have been watching. Not the campaigns \nthat I have seen, not the reports that I have seen about campaign \nfinance awash in soft money, awash in issue ads financed by soft money \nflying all over the country to pollute the air waves, that never allow \nthe American people to understand who was the donor, who put in half a \nmillion dollars to go after this or that candidate. That has become a \nperversion of fair rules and fair standards in campaign finance reform, \nand I hope when we pass McCain-Feingold we will finally begin to make \nsome order and some thoughtful response to campaign finance reform.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk about 2 issues, and I \nwant to talk about them briefly.\n  First of all, I would like to talk about this past weekend. I feel as \nif I speak on the floor of the Senate with a sense of history. \nSecretary General Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, \nsaid when he went to Iraq that he considered this to be a sacred \nmission. I think he was right. I think it was very important and is \nvery important for our country and the international community to have \nresolve with Saddam Hussein and to make it clear that it is extremely \nimportant that there be unhindered inspection so that we, in fact, know \nwhat exactly is going on in Iraq and, for that matter, for other \ncountries, I wish it would be the same in terms of development of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n\n  Mr. President, I have to say this from the floor of the U.S. Senate. \nI believe as a Senator that war is always the last option. When you can \ntalk instead of fight and when you can work out a peaceful solution and \nwhen diplomacy works and where there is a nonviolent resolution to a \nconflict, the world is better off for it. We should have no illusions, \nthough sometimes people come to the floor of the Senate and people talk \nto each other and we get all pumped up and we talk about going to war \nand how awful Saddam Hussein is. I certainly agree he is a very cruel--\nvery cruel--man. But, Mr. President, there is no question that if \nmilitary action was to be necessary, a lot of innocent people would \ndie. One child, one mother, one civilian in Iraq is one too many. One \nof our soldiers is one too many.\n  I am prayerfully thankful that Saddam Hussein seems to have \nunderstood the importance of these demands and, most important of all, \nbecause of the strong position that our country has\n\n[[Page S807]]\n\ntaken and also because of the very, very skillful diplomacy--very \nskillful diplomacy--of the Secretary General, I would like to thank the \nSecretary General for his effort.\n  We haven't dotted all the i's and crossed all the t's, and we have \nnot seen the specifics, but I believe as a United States Senator that \nhis mission was a sacred mission. I am very hopeful that we will have a \npolitical settlement. I am very hopeful that diplomacy will have \nworked, and I think the world will be better for that. Whenever we can \navoid loss of life, let's first do that.\n  So we all wait to see. From what I have read, from what I have heard, \nand the Secretary General is a man who is very careful with his words, \nwhen he says he believes this will be acceptable to the United Nations, \nto the Security Council, I don't think he would have said that unless \nthere is good cause for it.\n  So I am very hopeful that this will be acceptable to the Security \nCouncil, and we will have a resolution to this conflict without having \nto go to war, without having to take military action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S806-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me briefly talk about this campaign \nfinance reform bill that is coming to the floor. By the way, this, I \nthink, will be the business of the Senate this week. This is a core \nissue. This is the core problem, and this is going to be a real \nimportant debate for our country. I think it should be very clear to \neverybody in the country where all of us stand.\n  I know we have differences. Probably the Chair and I have differences \non this issue. But I can't help but believe that we can't get some good \nthings done together, because I can't but believe that any of us who \nhave been through these campaigns just hate this system. It is just \ncrazy.\n  I remember when I ran in 1990 in Minnesota the first time around. It \nwas as if the only thing that mattered was how much money you had in \nterms of who gets to run, in terms of whether you have a viable \ncampaign, in terms of who wins, in terms of what issues get discussed, \nin terms of who the people are who have access to the Congress all too \noften, as opposed to so many of the people who don't.\n  This is a core issue, and if you believe that each person should \ncount as one and no more than one in a representative democracy, all \nthe ways in which big money have come to dominate politics severely \nundercut our democracy. As a matter of fact, I think it is part of what \nhas led to this serious decline of participation of our citizens which \nreally can only lead to decline of our democracy.\n  So there are many concerns that people have, and they care about a \nlot of issues that are important to themselves and their families. But \nthe problem is, they don't believe that their concerns are of much \nconcern in the Halls of the Congress or, for that matter, the White \nHouse, because they believe that the political process in Washington, \nDC, has become so dominated by big money and special interests.\n  How important it is that we at least take some steps toward \neliminating some of this corrupting influence of this big money and try \nto begin to make these campaigns sane, try to begin to make these \ncampaigns at least a little bit more of a level playing field.\n  The Washington Post had an editorial today:\n\n       McCain-Feingold is already a limited bill.\n\n  I agree. I wish we had the clean money-clean election option passed \nby Maine and Vermont, but McCain-Feingold is a very important step \nforward.\n       For lack of votes, the original proposals meant to clean \n     out the stables of congressional campaign finance almost all \n     have been dropped. Congress's indignation with regard to \n     financing of presidential United States campaigns somehow \n     does not extend to the financing of its own.\n\n  Well, I would just ask people in Minnesota and people in the country: \nPlease be vigilant. Please keep an eye out on our work. Do not let the \nU.S. Senate block reform. And do not let the U.S. Senate pass some \npiece of legislation that has that made-for-Congress look with a great \nacronym which pretends to do so much and ends up doing so little.\n  That is the worst of all cases. I'd just as soon we not do anything \nas opposed to passing something which we claim will make an enormous \ndifference but really does not and will just add to the disillusionment \nof people in our country.\n  So I just say, this will be an important week. This is going to be an \nimportant debate. I hope we will get some things done.\n  For my own part, if the majority leader will let us, I will have a \nset of amendments that will apply to the Congress. I will have a set of \namendments that will apply to our campaigns which will be an effort to \nbegin to go after some of the influence of big money in congressional \ncampaigns along with some of the other things that we will be talking \nabout, like soft money.\n  If I cannot bring those amendments to the floor in this debate, I \nwill bring these amendments to the floor in the next bill that comes up \nor the following bill that comes up, because I do not think there is \nany more important issue that is facing this country.\n  So to Minnesotans and to people in the country: Please hold all of us \naccountable. Do not let people get away with blocking reform. Do not \nlet any of us get away with passing some piece of legislation which has \nno teeth and makes really no difference at all. Make sure that we take \nsome steps in this U.S. Senate that will at least get some of this big \nmoney out of politics and at least move us a little bit more toward \nelections as opposed to auctions going to the highest bidder.\n  Mr. President, I think that I have about run out of my time. I yield \nthe floor to my colleagues from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S807-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S807-S811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ABRAHAM RIBICOFF\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate an extraordinary life. \nWe in the U.S. Senate have lost a former colleague and a leading light \nof the U.S. Senate--Abraham Ribicoff.\n  Abe Ribicoff, Mr. President, was born and raised in New Britain, CT. \nHe was the son of poor Polish immigrants. Yet this humble son of \nConnecticut rose to become one of our State's and our country's most \ndistinguished public servants. He served in this body for 18 years--\nbeginning in January of 1963 and retiring in 1981.\n  One of the highest honors I have had in public life, Mr. President, \nwas to succeed Abe Ribicoff in the U.S. Senate, and I take great pride \nin the fact that in 1981 Abe Ribicoff placed my name in nomination for \nthis office.\n  Abe Ribicoff believed fervently that the highest calling one can have \nin American life is public service. He obeyed that calling as few \nAmericans ever have. He is the only person in our Nation's history to \nhave served as a State legislator, a municipal judge, a U.S. \nRepresentative, a Governor, a Presidential Cabinet Secretary, and a \nU.S. Senator.\n  But to appreciate Abe Ribicoff, it is important to understand that he \ndid more than occupy an impressive collection of public offices. What \ndistinguished Abe Ribicoff from his peers, from his predecessors, and \nfrom those who have come after him is not the number of offices he \nheld, but the manner in which he held them. Abe Ribicoff brought to his \nlife's work integrity, candor, high principle, an unshakeable faith in \nAmerica's Government, and a deeply held belief in the goodness and \ndecency of our people.\n\n  Abe Ribicoff had the rarest and most important of all qualities we \nseek in public leaders--courage in the public arena. Time and again, in \nways large and small, he demonstrated a commitment to principle even in \nthe face of fierce opposition. He was willing to fight for what he \nbelieved to be right. And he fought hard, though always--always--in a \ndecent and honorable manner.\n  In Abe Ribicoff's politics, there was no place for meanness, no place \nfor personal attacks. He understood the importance of public opinion, \nbut he never relied on polls to shape his political decisions. He was \nguided not by emotion, not by numbers, but by judgment, by reason, and \nby principle.\n\n[[Page S808]]\n\n  One of the defining moments in his public life took place in 1968 at \nthe Democratic National Convention. Here was a man, Mr. President, a \nfirst-term Senator, not unaware that he was confronting the entire \nnational leadership of his party, willing to take a stand and make a \nvery, very public display and call for civility in our society.\n  In doing so on that day, he appealed, in my view, to what is best \nabout our Nation and ourselves--our capacity for tolerance and \nunderstanding; our belief that in a truly civilized society we live by \nthe rule of law, not by the rule of force; that in fact it is right \nthat makes might.\n  In this moment, the world learned what we in Connecticut had long \nknown, that Abe Ribicoff was a national gift.\n  His entire career stood above all for the belief that America is a \nland of limitless opportunity and equal justice.\n  He abhorred discrimination in all its forms, and he knew it in his \nown life. During his campaign for Governor in 1954, an ugly whispering \ncampaign questioned whether Connecticut was ready for a Jewish \nGovernor. Abe Ribicoff answered from the heart. In a famous address in \nConnecticut, Abe Ribicoff said:\n\n       In this great country of ours, anybody, even a poor kid \n     from immigrant parents in New Britain, could achieve any \n     office he sought, or any position in private or public life, \n     irrespective of race, color, creed, or religion.\n\n  The voters of Connecticut, Mr. President, answered that they agreed \nwith their Governor-elect.\n  Even when he himself was not touched by the sting of discrimination, \nhe acted to do what was right. In 1956, a young Senator from \nMassachusetts was mentioned as a possible Vice Presidential candidate. \nIronically, many Catholics, mindful of the discrimination that still \nexisted against them, questioned whether America was ready for an Irish \nCatholic in the White House after what had occurred to Alfred Smith in \n1928.\n  Abe Ribicoff, speaking to the Irish Catholic leadership of the \nDemocratic Party, took exception.\n\n       I never thought [he said] I'd see the day when a man of the \n     Jewish faith had to plead before a group of Irish Catholics \n     about allowing another Irish Catholic to be nominated for the \n     position [of Vice President].\n\n  In no small measure, Mr. President, it was Abe Ribicoff's faith--\nfaith in his country and faith in a candidate that propelled John \nKennedy to the Presidency just a few years later.\n  Once again, Mr. President, in 1976, questions were raised about \nwhether a southern Governor and a born-again Baptist believer could \nserve as President of the United States. Without a moment's hesitation, \nthis Connecticut Yankee said yes. Judge the man, judge his ideas, but \ndo not judge his personal faith.\n  Abe Ribicoff lived most of his professional life at the highest, most \naustere and auspicious levels. He knew his share of Governors, of \nSenators, of Presidents. But lest we forget, Mr. President, he also \nknew struggle. He knew hardship growing up among the shops and mills of \nNew Britain, CT. And he knew discrimination and he knew defeat, having \nlost his first campaign in the Senate by a slim margin.\n  But even as he rose to the very top of public life, he never forgot \nabout those that he served. He knew that all principles are in the end \nempty letters and hollow rhetoric if they are not connected to people's \nlives. The instrument of Government, the laws of the land mean little \nif they do not help ordinary citizens surmount obstacles and obtain \ntheir noblest aspirations.\n  At a time when Medicare was described as ``socialism,'' Abe Ribicoff \nknew that it embodied the obligation of a compassionate society to care \nfor its elderly. When some called civil rights laws an affront to \n``States rights,'' he knew that they could make the promise of equal \njustice a reality for millions of Americans. When others said that a \nGovernor and a Senator should not spend his time fussing about highway \nsafety, he knew that a tough approach to speeding and drunk driving \nwould save lives and spare families immeasurable grief and sorrow.\n  We have spoken of Abraham Ribicoff as a public servant, but he was \nmuch more than that. He was also a husband and a father. To his wife \nCasey and to his family we convey our deepest sorrow.\n  He was also a teacher. I consider myself extremely--extremely--\nfortunate to have been able to call on him many, many, many times since \nhe left office in 1981 for his advice and counsel and guidance and just \ngood old political conversation. No one--no one--in this world of \npolitical life could have had a better mentor than I did in Abe \nRibicoff.\n  Mr. President, I want to close with a reading from Hebrew text. It \ncaptures, I believe, the essence of this man whose passing we all mourn \ntoday. Let me quote it:\n\n     A good name is to be chosen above wealth, and character \n           rather than silver and gold.\n     Blessed is the one who bequeaths a good name to his \n           descendants.\n     There are three crowns: the crown of Torah, the crown of \n           priesthood, and the crown of royalty,\n     But the crown of a good name excels them all.\n     Even a long life ends too soon, but a good name endures \n           forever.\n     Blessed is he whose noble deeds remain his memorial after his \n           life on Earth is ended.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield to my good friend and colleague, Senator \nLieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and thank my friend and senior \ncolleague from Connecticut. I thank him for his eloquent and moving \ntribute to Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff whose passing yesterday we mourn \non the floor of the Senate today. I would like to just add a few words \nto my colleague's extraordinary statement.\n  Mr. President, as Senator Dodd has referred to that critical moment \nin the 1954 campaign of Senator Ribicoff for Governor of Connecticut, \nwhen there were expressions of bigotry, of anti-Semitism, and Senator \nRibicoff at a turning point in his own career rose to challenge those \nwhispers directly in the eloquent words that Senator Dodd has spoken in \nwhat has become known in Connecticut political lore as Abe Ribicoff's \n``American Dream Speech.'' In the bottom line of it was Senator \nRibicoff saying, ``Abe Ribicoff believes in the American dream.'' And \nindeed he did. The extraordinary life that he led that ended yesterday, \nafter 87 years, is a testament to the vitality of the American dream.\n  Mr. President, there are many other great civilizations and \ndemocracies in the world, but I must say the more that I have the \nopportunity to visit them the more I come back home appreciating how \nunique this great country of ours is, how we have created here an ethic \nof mutual respect, of a fairness of opportunity that has allowed people \nwho are capable, who are willing to work hard to rise to the highest \nlevels in our society, whether it is in the public sector, the private \nsector, in the arts, sports, whatever.\n  In that moment of crisis, in a campaign that, if he had lost, \nprobably his public career would have ended, Abe Ribicoff stood up and \ndirectly confronted and challenged those who did not believe in the \nAmerican dream, who were prepared to stimulate an effort against him \nbecause of his religion, to say that he believed in the American dream \nand had confidence that the people of Connecticut did. Also, of course, \nthey vindicated that confidence on election day.\n  His father was an immigrant from Poland--Polish, Jewish--came to New \nBritain, CT, worked at first as a peddler, then as a factory worker, \nand raised a son and other distinguished members of the family who rose \nto extraordinary and proud heights.\n  Abe Ribicoff worked for everything he achieved. He had--if I may \nborrow from a phrase that my colleague mentioned earlier--he had a \nregal quality to him. It is a remarkable thing to say, when you think \nof the humble origins from where he came, but it was within himself, \nhis dignity, his intelligence, his civility, his honor and integrity \nthat those qualities remarkably in the hurly-burly of the political \nlife that we lead remained intact.\n  He worked his way forward, ultimately graduating from the University \nof Chicago Law School. He came back to Connecticut and began to \npractice law. And very soon he went into public life.\n\n[[Page S809]]\n\n  As Senator Dodd said, he has a record that as far as we know is \nunequaled in America because of the extraordinary range of offices he \nheld--State legislator, judge, member of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, Governor, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare \nin the Kennedy Cabinet, and then the capstone to his career, 18 \nextraordinarily distinguished and productive years as a U.S. Senator.\n  I want to comment on a few of those periods of his life and end with \na personal word. When Abe Ribicoff became Governor of the State of \nConnecticut, he led an administration that constituted a turning point \nin the history of our State and, in many ways, pointed the direction \nfor the future of the Democratic Party. As I have been thinking over \nthe last 24 hours of some of the accomplishments that characterized Abe \nRibicoff's career, it seems to me he was a ``new Democrat'' before \nanybody thought of the term.\n  In Connecticut, where the party had most of its strength in the \ncities, Abe Ribicoff and others--including my colleague's distinguished \nand beloved father, Senator Tom Dodd--reached out from the cities to \nthe suburbs, to the smaller towns, and broadened the reach of the \nDemocratic Party in our State. In doing so, he not only achieved \npersonal success and paved the way for partisan success in the future \nthroughout the State but served with the public and the public interest \nin Connecticut mightily.\n  Abe Ribicoff as Governor was a fiscal conservative. He believed in \nbalancing the budget. He believed in governmental reform. He focused on \npublic safety questions such as highway safety. He never hesitated to \nwork across party lines. During his 6 years as Governor, there were \ntimes when the Republican Party controlled one or, I believe, both \nHouses of the State legislature. He had a guiding principle that he \nadopted and articulated that carried him very well, right through the \nSenate years. It is what he described as the integrity of compromise. \nHe said, in this business of politics there is nothing dishonorable and \ncertainly not dishonest about compromising your initial position to get \nsomething done. What is the value, he would say, of holding to that \ninitial position as strongly as you originally felt if just moving a \nlittle bit--as long as it is not against your conscience and your \nprinciples--allowed you to do something for the people.\n  He had a distinguished, very popular career as Governor, winning a \nvery close victory in 1954, then going on to win an enormous landslide \nin 1958. As Senator Dodd has said, he played a pivotal role, along with \nour State Democratic chairman, John Bailey, in the election of JFK as \nPresident, there, again, as my senior colleague has said, giving \nanother testament to Abe Ribicoff's belief in the American dream.\n  President Kennedy asked Senator Ribicoff to become a member of the \nCabinet, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. He served there \nwith distinction. He did some of the early work that led to the \nMedicare Program, which today is so critical to so many millions of \nAmericans to provide decent health and is itself one of the reasons the \naverage lifespan of the American people is longer today than it was \nbefore Medicare started.\n  The truth is, as he said to those of us who were privileged to know \nhim and as he said after his retirement from public life, that the year \nand a half as a member of the Cabinet were not the happiest years of \nhis career. In fact, they were probably the least satisfying. He was \nvery honest about it. He said, ``I'm used to being my own man. I was \nGovernor, I was a Member of Congress. I'm used to being my own man, \ninstead of having to support positions that are someone else's that I \nreally didn't support or having to oppose other positions that I really \ndid support.''\n  He served with distinction but not with pleasure and took the \nopportunity to run for the U.S. Senate in 1962. That, I think, was the \nmost productive and the most satisfying time of his remarkable career. \nHe was again ahead of his time here. He worked on subjects like \nenvironmental protection before the great burst of activity in that \narea occurred in the 1970s. He had a hearing and invited the mother of \nthe environmental movement, Rachel Carson, after she published her book \n``Silent Spring,'' to testify before his committee. From that \ntestimony, he worked on pesticides and other threats to the environment \nand public health. He continued the work that he started at HEW and \nplayed a leading role in the passage of the Medicare Program, serving \nas a member of the Finance Committee. He continued the work he had done \nin Connecticut on highway safety and did some very important \nlegislative work to raise the standards for automotive safety of the \nAmerican people. He was a great believer in free and fair trade and a \nstrong supporter of the kind of governmental stimulus to the private \nsector that creates economic growth. He was very much in that sense a \nperson of the Senate.\n\n  He worked very easily and comfortably across party lines. Again, \nremembering the integrity of compromise in a body of 100 people with a \nlot of strong opinions, you need people who are bridge builders, and \nSenator Abe Ribicoff built some extraordinary bridges that have so \ndramatically improved the quality of American life.\n  Mr. President, if I may end on a personal note, Senator Ribicoff was \nfor me a hero, an inspiration, and a mentor. In 1954, when he first ran \nfor Governor, I was a kid in Stanford, CT, beginning to develop an \ninterest in politics. I was taken by his strength, by his independence, \nby the way he carried himself. Because he and I shared the same \nreligion--both members of a minority religion--I wondered how he would \nfare. In some sense, he tested in a most public way the faith that my \nown dear parents gave me that this is a great country, this is a \ncountry of opportunity; people will judge you not by how you worship \nbut by how you work, how you conduct yourself, what you propose to do.\n  Of course, in that election in 1954, the people of Connecticut \nvindicated Abe Ribicoff's faith, my parents' faith and in that sense \ngave me that faith at a critical time in my own life.\n  In the 1960s, as a college student, I had the great opportunity to \nwork for Senator Ribicoff for two summers. This is sometimes what \nhappens to Senate interns. We end up in the field of our dreams, as it \nwere, here in the U.S. Senate, first in 1962 on his committee, his \nCampaign Finance Committee, working in the State, and then in the \nsummer of 1963 as one of his first summer interns. We developed, I \ndon't even want to at that stage call it a friendship, but he was a \nmentor, he was a teacher. I learned an enormous amount from him and \nwill forever be grateful that when a few years later, in 1970, I \ndecided to tackle public office as a State senator, he was gutsy enough \nand supportive enough to endorse me. It happened to be a Democratic \nprimary against an incumbent, so it was quite a boost for a youngster, \nrunning without previous officeholding experience, to receive the \nsupport of the distinguished U.S. Senator whom I have talked about in \nterms of compromise and the integrity of compromise.\n  While it was true he was a moderate man in many ways, and that helped \nhim to build the coalitions that made things happen for his \nconstituents and for the American people, Abe Ribicoff's moderation was \nnot a mushy vacuum moderation. It was full of principle; it was full of \nsubstance. As those of us who knew and loved him also can tell you, he \nwas capable of leaving that moderation to go to periods of white heat \nwhen he felt strongly about something and was prepared to step out on \nthose occasions, regardless of what the political conventions would \nhave told him to do. The most dramatic, well-known example is the \nremarkable, courageous speech at the 1968 Democratic National \nConvention that Senator Dodd referred to.\n  Abe Ribicoff was a towering figure who served with honor and great \nresult. It is a source of great personal pride and no small amount of \nhumility that I have the opportunity to stand here as a U.S. Senator \ntoday to express my own sadness at his passing and my own pride at the \ngreat career that he had and, finally, to offer my condolences to his \nbeloved wife Casey, to his children Peter and Jane, to his stepson \nPeter, and to his six grandchildren. Your father, your grandfather, \nserved America with great distinction and served in a way that should \ngive hope to the millions of others out there who may be, as he did \nlong ago, forming their own American dream.\n\n[[Page S810]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I commend my colleague for his eloquent statement and his \nremembrances of Abe Ribicoff.\n  On behalf of both of us, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed some very fine comments from today's editions of the \nHartford Courant and the New Britain Herald, his hometown newspaper. \nThey did excellent jobs in capturing the career and the essence of Abe \nRibicoff.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Hartford Courant, Feb. 23, 1998]\n\n                      Abraham Ribicoff Dies at 87\n\n\nwas congressman, governor, cabinet member and u.s. senator in 4 decades \n                           of public service\n\n  (By Charles F.J. Morse--Special to The Courant and David Lightman--\n                        Washington Bureau Chief)\n\n       Abraham A. Ribicoff, a storybook politician whose rare mix \n     of talent, timing and luck took him from a boyhood dream in \n     New Britain to a distinguished third term in the United \n     States Senate, died of heart failure Sunday at the Hebrew \n     Home in Riverdale, N.Y.\n       He was 87.\n       One of the state's most accomplished Democrats, Mr. \n     Ribicoff was Connecticut's first and only Jewish governor and \n     one of its longest-serving senators. And he became known \n     nationally as President Kennedy's first secretary of health, \n     education and welfare and later as the man who stood up to \n     Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley during the tumultuous 1968 \n     Democratic National Convention.\n       ``Abe Ribicoff served Connecticut and our nation with great \n     distinction, style and elegance. He is truly one of the great \n     leaders of the 20th century,'' U.S. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, \n     D-Conn., said Sunday. ``He displayed courage and conviction \n     throughout his life, and he was a symbol for what public \n     service can and should be. He will be sorely missed.''\n       Mr. Ribicoff left Washington in 1981, declining to run for \n     a fourth Senate term. He went to New York to practice law, \n     ``the generalist in a firm of 400 specialists,'' he would \n     jest.\n       In a 1992 interview, he explained why he returned to his \n     Cornwall Bridge home and sometimes took on the two-hour \n     commute to midtown Manhattan instead of staying in Washington \n     to enjoy elder-statesman status.\n       ``I always felt that once a person no longer has power, he \n     should get out,'' Mr. Ribicoff said from his Park Avenue \n     office, ``Nothing is as sad as seeing a person who used to \n     have power have none.''\n\n\n                        strong-willed gentleman\n\n       Mr. Ribicoff always had a keen sense of timing. He was a \n     craftsman of the political surprise.\n       On the eve of his election as governor in 1954, feeling the \n     closeness of his challenge to incumbent Republican Gov. John \n     Davis Lodge, and hearing some anti-Semitic undercurrents, Mr. \n     Ribicoff went on television and winged it from the heart, \n     telling of his American dream:\n       ``In this great country of ours, anybody, even a poor kid \n     from immigrant parents in New Britain, could achieve any \n     office he sought, or any position in private or public life, \n     irrespective of race, color, creed or religion.''\n       No one can measure the impact of that 11th-hour emotional \n     candor, but he won the election by a slim 3,200 votes.\n       ``He was a true leader and a leader in many ways that were \n     first,'' former Gov. William A. O'Neill said Sunday.\n       O'Neill recalled Mr. Ribicoff as an old-fashioned gentleman \n     who nonetheless had strong will and fought for what he \n     believed in.\n       ``He was a very strong man, a firm man, yet a very \n     compassionate person who looked out for those who could not \n     look out for themselves,'' O'Neill said. ``As far as \n     political courage, he had all you needed of that.''\n       Mr. Ribicoff was born in New Britain on April 9, 1910, son \n     of Samuel and Rose Sable Ribicoff.\n       He put himself through New York University and married Ruth \n     Siegel of Hartford before attending the University of Chicago \n     Law School. The couple had two children, Peter Ribicoff of \n     New York City and Jane Bishop of Del Mar, Calif.\n       Ruth Ribicoff died on April 12, 1972. He married Lois \n     ``Casey'' Mathes of Florida the following August.\n\n\n                            an early crusade\n\n       Mr. Ribicoff's public career spanned 42 years. He lost an \n     election only once.\n       His first elective office, won in 1938, was a seat from \n     Hartford in the state House of Representatives. From there he \n     moved on to a Hartford Police Court judgeship. He was elected \n     to Congress, from the 1st District, in 1948 and as governor \n     in 1954.\n       After winning the state's highest office by a hair, Mr. \n     Ribicoff later issued an executive order mandating 30-day \n     license suspensions for drivers convicted of speeding. \n     Thousands lost their licenses.\n       During 1956, the first year of its enforcement, 10,346 \n     licenses were suspended for speeding, as compared to only 372 \n     suspensions in the same period during 1955. In the same year, \n     traffic deaths were reduced by 38 from the 1955 total.\n       The anti-speeding crusade could have cost the gutsy young \n     governor dearly. ``Unless public officials have the guts to \n     see it through, nothing will work,'' he responded to his \n     political critics. ``We need tough, hard measures if we are \n     to save lives.''\n       Connecticut's highway deaths continued to drop, and Mr. \n     Ribicoff's stature soared. It rose even higher with his \n     handling of the catastrophic floods that hit the state in \n     August 1955. Four years later, he was re-elected by a \n     landslide.\n       During that period, his timing served him well again. He \n     was one of the first to urge John F. Kennedy, a Roman \n     Catholic, to run for president. He always considered his \n     support of Kennedy one of the most important moments of his \n     political career.\n       ``Kennedy said time and time again the first man who \n     thought he could be president was Abe Ribicoff,'' Mr. \n     Ribicoff recalled in a 1979 interview. ``In 1950, I said that \n     Kennedy would be the first Catholic president of the United \n     States. In Worcester, at the Massachusetts Democratic \n     Convention of 1956, I proposed Jack for vice president. I \n     nominated him in Chicago.''\n       U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said Sunday, ``The \n     Kennedy family has lost a good and trusted friend.''\n       The late Jack Zaiman, The Courant's political writer for \n     most of Mr. Ribicoff's career, recalled ``a charmed political \n     life. It seemed that whatever he did, and however he did it, \n     it turned out right.''\n       The people knew him instantly. He became the best-known \n     political name in Connecticut, until Ella T. Grasso.\n       In a 1985 remembrance piece, Zaiman wrote that Mr. Ribicoff \n     formed an ideal political relationship with John M. Bailey, \n     the late state and national Democratic chairman. The two had \n     met by chance, as young Hartford lawyers who happened to have \n     rented offices in the same building at 750 Main St.\n       ``Ribicoff always made it appear as if he were above \n     politics,'' Zaiman wrote. ``He was, so he wanted the world to \n     know, a grand independent. No politician would run him or \n     tell him what to do. But, underneath, he worked with Bailey \n     and the professional Democratic politicians. He used them; \n     they used him. He got what he wanted. He gave them, in the \n     main, what they wanted. It was the best of all worlds for \n     Ribicoff.''\n       Perhaps no other political figure in the state influenced \n     so many historical changes:\n       The first and only Jewish governor of his state.\n       The transformation of Connecticut from a Republican to a \n     Democratic state.\n       The end of county government.\n       The first successful state constitutional convention, which \n     changed the structure of the General Assembly in 1965.\n       The joint Ribicoff-Bailey sponsorship of Kennedy, the first \n     Roman Catholic elected president.\n\n\n                            his only regret\n\n       The Kennedy victory was Mr. Ribicoff's springboard to \n     Washington. He was mentioned for U.S. attorney general but \n     was named secretary of health, education and welfare, \n     resigning as governor on Jan. 21, 1961.\n       His resignation as governor was his only regret. He \n     acknowledged the excitement of the times; being asked to \n     become part of the new Kennedy administration was too hard to \n     resist, but in retrospect, he said, in 1992, ``I always felt \n     badly about it; felt I didn't fulfill my agreement with the \n     people . . . I still do.''\n       In 1962, he was elected to the Senate, succeeding retired \n     U.S. Sen. Prescott Bush, father of President Bush. \n     Ironically, he succeeded the only man who ever beat him at \n     the polls. Mr. Ribicoff had vainly challenged Prescott Bush \n     in 1952 at the tail end of his second term as congressman.\n       Mr. Ribicoff's best-remembered national moment came not in \n     the Senate, but in Chicago, live on national television, from \n     the podium of the 1968 Democratic National Convention. He had \n     been expected to simply step up and nominate U.S. Sen. George \n     S. McGovern of South Dakota for president.\n       That he did. Then he threw away the script and said, ``If \n     George McGovern were president, we wouldn't have to have \n     gestapo tactics in the streets of Chicago tonight.''\n       As he spoke, he looked directly down at the city's \n     legendary Mayor Richard J. Daley, whose police were gassing \n     and mauling young anti-war protesters in full view of the \n     network cameras.\n       Daley shouted back from his seat on the floor. No \n     microphone picked up his words, but the cameras caught his \n     red faced anger and some of the more obvious profane insults \n     formed by his lips as he glowered at Mr. Ribicoff on the \n     rostrum.\n       When the uproar died down, Mr. Ribicoff's gaze returned to \n     Daley and he added: ``How hard it is . . . how hard it is to \n     accept the truth.''\n\n\n                            greatest moments\n\n       Of all that he did or said during his career, Mr. Ribicoff \n     used to talk of that Chicago moment as the one with the \n     greatest impact. Film of it still is often included as part \n     of retrospectives of the '60s.\n       ``I really didn't know what I was going to say. I was just \n     appalled at what we were seeing on television. I felt that \n     what was going on out there was the real issue facing the \n     party and the country,'' he recalled.\n       McGovern later offered Mr. Ribicoff the vice presidential \n     spot on his ticket. Mr. Ribicoff declined.\n       ``I didn't lust for that type of office, I didn't want to \n     run all over the country doing\n\n[[Page S811]]\n\n     the chicken circuit and making political speeches, and I \n     liked the Senate,'' he said.\n       In 1976, Charles Kirbo of Atlanta, President Carter's \n     personal friend and adviser, felt out Mr. Ribicoff about \n     running for vice president. The answer was no, again.\n       In the Senate, he listed his major accomplishments as \n     joining John Stennis, a conservative southern Democrat, to \n     insist on equal enforcement of new school desegregation \n     regulations in the North and South; the creation of a \n     Department of Education and the revision of foreign trade \n     regulations.\n       Perhaps his greatest test came in 1978, when President \n     Carter proposed the sale of advanced American warplanes to \n     Egypt and Saudi Arabia, over strong objections by Israel, the \n     American Jewish lobby and American Jews.\n       In an unusual secret Senate session Mr. Ribicoff supported \n     the sale, warning his colleagues that the Soviet Union was \n     threatening the entire Middle East and its oil supply, and \n     that America had to have friends there in addition to Israel.\n       He saw lifelong friends turn on him as the pressure \n     mounted.\n       But he led Carter's supporters to the controversial victory \n     and said he felt completely vindicated by subsequent events \n     in the area, including the Camp David accords.\n       During a Democratic fund-raiser in Hartford on Oct. 28, \n     1978, Carter acknowledged it.\n       ``Our commitment to Israel, our allegiance to Israel, is \n     unshakable,'' Carter said. ``Sometimes there are nuances or \n     complications or facts that can't be revealed at the time. \n     But over a period of weeks, I think you have always seen that \n     when Abe Ribicoff votes in Congress for a controversial \n     issue, like for instance, the sale of F-15s to Egypt, it \n     seems to some that he may have made a mistake or I have made \n     a mistake in advocating it.\n       ``But we would never have induced President Sadat to come \n     to Camp David had it not been for that vote,'' Carter said.\n\n\n                          Knowing When to Quit\n\n       On May 3, 1979, Mr. Ribicoff summoned the press to his \n     Washington office for what was expected to be a routine \n     announcement that he was seeking re-election.\n       ``As [former Senate Majority Leader] Mike Mansfield said,'' \n     Mr. Ribicoff told the gathering, `` `There is a time to stay \n     and a time to go.'\n       ``I've watched them come and go and I have admiration for \n     the men who know how to go out at the top of their careers. A \n     person who's been in power a long time should know how to \n     step aside and open up the political process.''\n       He had ended it--once again unexpectedly--at the top of his \n     form. His announcement stunned his party and his colleagues.\n       ``Most people stay one term too long,'' he said later, \n     convinced his timing had been right.\n       ``There is no such thing as a unreplaceable person. . . . \n     Everyone is replaceable,'' he said.\n       When Mr. Ribicoff retired from the Senate in 1981, he \n     jointed the New York law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays \n     & Handler. But he continued to advise presidents, governors \n     and Congress.\n       In the 1990s, he would discuss how his brand of politics \n     seemed worn. Civility was no longer an important character \n     trait; nastiness was. When Democrats returned to Chicago for \n     their convention in 1996, Mr. Ribicoff wanted nothing to do \n     with it. Ironically, the man best remembered for engaging in \n     harsh intraparty warfare had found today's politics too \n     harsh.\n       ``Everybody in politics today plays dirty,'' Mr. Ribicoff \n     said in a 1996 interview. ``Everybody wants to say bad things \n     about everything.''\n       What he did in 1968 was spontaneous and heartfelt, not \n     calculated to win political points. Today's politicians use \n     their tempers as weapons to win poll points, and Mr. Ribicoff \n     wanted none of that.\n       ``I'm not a politician anymore,'' he said.\n       Mr. Ribicoff would continue working in New York, though he \n     contracted Alzheimer's disease in later years.\n       When Mr. Ribicoff retired from the Senate, Sen. Edward M. \n     Kennedy, his longtime friend and ally, and former Senate \n     Minority Leader Howard H. Baker Jr., R-Tenn., led the Senate \n     tributes.\n       Kennedy said Mr. Ribicoff would be remembered ``by all of \n     us as a colleague who was both loved and listened to as a \n     skillful leader on all the sensitive issues of foreign and \n     domestic policy we face together.''\n       Baker said Mr. Ribicoff had been ``a giant of the U.S. \n     Senate.''\n       His Connecticut colleagues at the time, Republican U.S. \n     Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., praised him as a ``great friend \n     and a valued mentor.\n       ``A government already comprised of too few Ribicoffs \n     honestly can't stand the loss of Connecticut's senior \n     senator,'' Weicker said.\n       Looking back over his life, during a 1986 interview, Mr. \n     Ribicoff said it was not a piece of legislation but people \n     who made the greatest impact on him--the people of \n     Connecticut during the floods of 1955.\n       ``I saw the grandeur of the whole state in the faces of the \n     average citizen, their leaders and how they acted,'' he said, \n     ``Everyone pitched in, Connecticut came together. That's a \n     memory I will always treasure.''\n       Besides his wife and two children, he leaves a stepson, \n     Peter Mathes, and six grandchildren.\n       The funeral will be at 11 a.m. Wednesday at Temple Emanu-\n     El, 1 E. 65th St., at Park Avenue, in New York City.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the New Britain Herald, Feb. 23, 1998]\n\n                  Abe Ribicoff, NB Native, Dead at 87\n\n       New York (AP).--Abraham A. Ribicoff, a former U.S. Senator \n     and governor of Connecticut who served as secretary of \n     Health, Education and Welfare in the Kennedy administration, \n     died Sunday. He was 87.\n       Ribicoff, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, died at a \n     nursing home in Riverdale, N.Y., said ABC's Barbara Walters, \n     a family friend.\n       Ribicoff, a Democrat, had a public service career that \n     spanned more than four decades.\n       ``Connecticut and the nation have lost a patriot,'' \n     Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland said in a statement Sunday. \n     ``Abraham Ribicoff was one of the greatest leaders in \n     Connecticut history. Beyond having served in all three \n     branches of government, he stood for what was right \n     regardless of the personal consequences.''\n       Ribicoff began his career as a state legislator in the \n     Connecticut General Assembly and went on to serve as a \n     municipal judge, a congressman, governor of Connecticut, a \n     member of Kennedy's Cabinet, a member of the United States \n     delegation to the United Nations and, for the last 18 years \n     of his career, a U.S. senator.\n       As a senator, Ribicoff gained national prominence at the \n     1968 Democratic National Convention, when he made a \n     blistering speech criticizing Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley \n     for the strong-arm tactics used to control protesters.\n       ``I don't think anyone involved in politics will forget his \n     speech out in Chicago,'' Connecticut Democratic Party \n     Chairman Ed Marcus said Sunday. ``He certainly left his mark \n     on the political landscape of this country.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Former Connecticut Gov.

He helped win national acclaim for \n     Connecticut when he instituted a program to suspend the \n     driver's licenses of speeders. The program helped decrease \n     highway fatalities.\n       Ribicoff retired from the Senate in 1981 to join the New \n     York law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler, but \n     he didn't stay out of politics entirely and remained a \n     popular adviser to presidents, governors and congressional \n     committees. He chaired a Reagan administration commission on \n     military base closings and testified before a panel on \n     political campaign reform.\n       Ribicoff clearly enjoyed his status as an elder statesman.\n       ``I've been around the track a lot,'' he said in a May 1993 \n     interview. ``I had the best of the years (in politics) and I \n     don't want a single year back.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the public \ninterest contributions of the radio and television broadcasters in my \nhome state of Minnesota. As a former broadcaster, I appreciate their \nefforts in our communities, and their accomplishments should not be \noverlooked.\n  Last month, I reflected upon how radio has become an influential \nmedium in the lives of many Americans throughout its 78 years of \noperation in the United States. As my colleagues know, January was \nrecognized as ``National Radio Month.'' Today, I wanted to highlight in \nbroader terms, the extraordinary influence and unselfish nature of both \nradio and television broadcasts.\n  Broadcasts over the 12,200 radio stations in the U.S. serve a variety \nof purposes. Radio communicates with listeners during time of \nemergency, informs them of noteworthy community events such as \nfundraising drives, educates them about developing stories and current \nevents, and entertains during long drives across our states. Americans \nlisten to the radio an average of three hours and twelve minutes on \nweekdays, and four hours and 42 minutes on weekends.\n  Similar to the listening power of radio, television has also become a \nvital part of our daily lives. Since the\n\n[[Page S812]]\n\nfirst television broadcast test in the U.S. took place during the \n1920s, this medium has evolved and grown from approximately 36 \nbroadcast television stations in 1948 to more than 1,550 stations \nacross the country today. According to the National Association of \nBroadcasters, 98 percent of U.S. households currently own television \nreceivers. And television is the main news source for 70 percent of the \nAmerican public.\n  Mr. President, many of our country's radio and television stations \nhave participated in public service to their communities, not only out \nof statutory obligation for the licenses they receive, but because they \nhave become part of their communities' way of life. I am proud of a \nrecent Minnesota Broadcasters Association survey of station executives \nin which all 16 commercial television stations and 50 percent of the \n242 radio stations responded. As impressive as these findings are, I am \nsure they represent only a microcosm of the public interest \ncontributions of our nation's broadcasters.\n  I was pleased to learn that radio and television stations across \nMinnesota raised more than $19.4 million for charities between June \n1996 and June 1997, including $65 million in donated air time for \nPublic Service Announcements. The hundreds of public service \nannouncements broadcast each week highlighted such issues as AIDS \nawareness, disaster relief, safety campaigns, drunk driving, and drug \nand crime education programs.\n  Additionally, of those stations surveyed, 100 percent of television \nstations and 95 percent of radio stations have helped charitable causes \nor needy individuals through fund-raising and other types of support.\n  I know my constituents who suffered through the midwest floods of \n1997 are grateful to those stations in Minnesota who were involved in \nlocal news broadcasts, public service announcements, public affairs \nprogramming, and off-air campaigns to aid disaster victims.\n  A typical example of the Minnesota broadcasters' efforts during last \nyear's spring floods is how Minnesota radio and television stations \nworked together with their listeners to raise $1.6 million to help and \nassist the flood victims. These stations also produced a video titled \n``Beyond the Flood,'' donating the profits to the hundreds of thousands \nof Minnesotans who had their lives disrupted by the floods.\n  Mr. President, the statistics I have cited do not tell the whole \nstory. There have been hundreds of examples of how Minnesota's \nbroadcasters have provided extraordinary local public service to \ncommunities around Minnesota.\n  Additional past noteworthy accomplishments that come to mind include \nefforts by WJON-AM and its two sister stations in St. Cloud to raise \nmoney to buy bulletproof vests for the police departments. Its goal was \n$50,000, but ultimately raised $75,000. And stations 92 KQRS-FM and \n93.7 KEGE-FM in Minneapolis have worked with Minnesota Job Services to \nset up a free interactive telephone hotline to connect employers with \nqualified applicants. Amazingly, this service registers 10,000 calls \neach month.\n  Finally, some of my colleagues in the Senate have advocated that \nCongress or the Federal Communications Commission mandate ``free'' or \nfurther discounted air time for political candidates. While I share the \nconcern of many of my colleagues over the decreasing level of voter \nparticipation over the last few years, I believe proponents of this \nidea should more closely examine the level to which broadcasters are \nalready raising the political awareness of the electorate through news \ncoverage and free debate time. In 1996, two-thirds of Minnesota radio \nstations and four in ten television stations offered free air time to \npolitical candidates, with many of those stations actually holding the \nevents.\n  Many more stations aired a local political affairs program or segment \ndealing with the local elections, and special segments profiling \ncandidates and their positions on the issues. And nearly all of the \nstations surveyed appealed to their audiences to vote, whether through \npublic service announcements, public affairs programming or the news. \nThese efforts by Minnesota's broadcasters have helped to restore the \npeople's faith and participation in our democracy.\n  Through disaster relief efforts, holiday safety initiatives, fund-\nraising drives, school announcements, public affairs programming, and \nweather emergency information, Minnesota broadcasters have demonstrated \ntheir commitment and dedication to public service.\n  I am proud to say that in some instances, these efforts have been \nrecognized by the Minnesota Broadcasters Association through their \n``Media Best Awards'' and by the National Association of Broadcasters \nannual ``Crystal Radio Awards.''\n  I applaud the leadership shown by all of Minnesota's stations, and am \npleased to have shared their accomplishments with the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S811-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S812-S814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               OMB'S STUDY OF THE NORTHEAST DAIRY COMPACT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express concern at the \ncontinued efforts of some Members of Congress to use dairy farmers and \nconsumers as vehicles for political manipulation.\n  Late in the day on Friday, February 12, the Office of Management and \nBudget released a study requested by Congress which is reported to be \nan analysis of the economic effects of the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact. Unfortunately, it appears only to be a masterful work of \npolitical manipulation that skillfully avoids answering the core \nquestion of what actually is the impact of the Northeast Dairy Compact. \nAs a watered-down compromise, the report sheds little light on the \nplight of dairy farmers both inside the Compact region and around the \nnation. Meanwhile, the New England milk tax continues to take its toll \non the most vulnerable consumers.\n  Senator Feingold and I were the authors of the amendment which \ndirected OMB to undertake an unbiased, independent study of the direct \nand indirect economic effects of the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact. Did we receive an unbiased study? Hardly. I was informed that \nCompact supporters had plenty of input. Lacking the same political \nclout, opponents did not. What the American people have received is a \nsanitized product of regional politics. It's one more example of this \nadministration's failed dairy policy.\n  The OMB has made it painfully clear that they had neither the time, \ndata, nor resources to produce a meaningful analysis. This is not a \nlegitimate excuse for producing a report with exorbitant levels of \n``statistical uncertainty.'' We attempted to work with OMB in \naddressing the issue of the inadequate time frame for conducting a \nmeaningful study. At the beginning of the year, OMB asked for my \nassistance in requesting a time-extension before the release of the \nreport. I worked with them to obtain the short extension they \nrequested, in the interest of not rushing through the project. This was \nthe only time an extension was requested even though I made it clear I \nwould work with them in obtaining further extensions as necessary.\n  So, why did OMB wait until the week before the initially scheduled \nrelease of the study to inform us that not enough time had passed to \nproduce a significant, decisive report? If OMB could see there still \nwas a problem with insufficient data due to the limited time the \nCompact has been in effect, they should have made a formal request for \nan extension.\n  There was no attempt to seek an extension to allow a meaningful \nstudy, only a veiled attempt to get this request off their plate--even \nif it resulted in an inferior product compromising the integrity of \nOMB. Aren't the best economists in the government at OMB? This study \nquestions that presumption.\n  The attitude in a staff briefing conducted by OMB three weeks ago was \nthat it did not want this task, and sought to get rid of it as soon as \npossible. We expect OMB to conduct professional and unbiased studies. \nApparently, that is not possible.\n  Even without a decent report, we all know the Compact hurts \nconsumers. Milk prices have increased an average of 17 cents a gallon \nthroughout New England. Those most adversely impacted include low-\nincome families, children, and elderly residents on fixed incomes.\n  Over the past year, a number of newspaper articles have appeared in \nthe New England region that have questioned the legitimacy of the \nCompact. I ask unanimous consent that a\n\n[[Page S813]]\n\nsampling of these be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Legislative Gazette, Nov. 3, 1997]\n\n               Group Concerned About Raising Milk Prices\n\n                            (By Elysia Nest)\n\n       Cookies will just have to go without it. And morning coffee \n     just won't be the same.\n       If Gov. George E. Pataki's newly appointed dairy task force \n     agrees to artificially raise the price of milk to aid the \n     state's ailing dairy farmers this week, low-income families \n     will be hit the hardest, according to John Schnittker, senior \n     economist for Public Voice for Food and Health Policy. \n     Schnittker warned that boosting the price dairy farmers \n     receive for milk will cost the state's consumers $91 million \n     over the next 12 months. That's an increase of 21 cents a \n     gallon.\n       Also, the organization opposes the possibility of New York \n     joining in the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact for fear \n     that it would raise prices for consumers without enhancing \n     the long-term viability of small dairy farmers.\n       The revenue would continue to flow to the largest \n     producers, who would in turn produce more milk, further \n     shutting out the smaller farms. The Compact allows New \n     England to receive a price for milk that is about the price \n     set by the federal dairy program. This price is currently \n     $16.94 per 100 pounds of milk.\n       Farmers are getting less for their milk. People are paying \n     more. Schnittker sees danger signs ahead.\n       ``The governor's dairy task force should reject attempts to \n     get a quick fix to these problems,'' he said. ``A price \n     increase will harm the pocketbooks and the health of New \n     York. The low-income consumer will be hit the hardest. It \n     robs families of purchasing power. Dollars that are needed \n     for groceries will be spent on milk.''\n       But Rick Zimmerman of the New York Farms Bureau said Public \n     Voice is a front group for dairy farmers. ``They are farmer \n     advocates,'' he said, ``not consumer advocates.'' Zimmerman, \n     however, said there is a short-term answer to the problem.\n       ``This is an opportunity for the governor to institute an \n     emergency price increase for fluid milk that could prove of \n     some assistance.'' While the length of time that an \n     artificial price increase may be implemented is dictated by \n     state law at 90 days, Zimmerman said it may be just what the \n     state needs to get the dairy farms back on track.\n       Peter Gregg, spokesman for the Department of Agriculture \n     and Markets, said he has complete faith that the dairy task \n     force will do what needs to be done.\n       Still, Michele Mitola, director for New York Citizens for a \n     Sound Economy, said an artificial price increase would barely \n     help farmers at all. It would just be another consumer tax \n     increase.\n       ``It is bad enough that the federal government has set \n     prices for milk; to allow the state to artificially raise the \n     price higher amounts to nothing but a tax increase for the \n     state's consumers,'' she said. ``As with any consumption tax, \n     the burden will be greatest on those at the lowest end of the \n     income scale. The governor is trying to sustain an industry \n     on the backs of the state's consumers. This is the equivalent \n     of corporate welfare, and consumers should not be forced by \n     the government to pay above-market process to sustain any \n     industry.''\n       In addition to the financial strain higher prices would \n     cause, Public Voice estimates the loss in purchasing power to \n     New York food stamp recipients under the plan to exceed $11 \n     million over 12 months, Also, New York taxpayers will pay $5 \n     million more for school meal programs.\n       The assistance plans would also hit the New York \n     metropolitan area hard, since it has a large urban \n     population. Over the next 12 months, the analysis found, \n     downstate residents can expect to pay $49 million in higher \n     milk costs under the plans.\n       The New York State Public Research Group (NYPIRG) is also \n     concerned. It opposes ``over-order'' pricing, regardless of \n     whether it is accomplished through administrative action by \n     the Department of Agriculture and Markets or through \n     participation in the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.\n       ``There is little reason to believe that an increase in \n     dairy support will provide help to the small family farms \n     that truly in need,'' said Russ Haven, legislative director \n     for NYPIRG. ``If anything, non-targeted assistance in the \n     form of dairy price support will widen the disparity between \n     large and small milk producers.\n       So while ``milk may do a body good,'' unless the dairy task \n     force can come up with a fair compromise between farmers and \n     consumers, many consumers will just have to go without it.\n       ``If the governor truly wanted to help family farmers \n     without hurting consumers, he would focus more on further \n     lowering their tax burden and removing unnecessary \n     constraints that increase the cost of doing business in the \n     state,'' said Mitola.\n       The 14-member dairy task force is expected to meet this \n     week.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    [From the Record, Nov. 31, 1992]\n\n              Consumer Groups: Let Market Set Milk Prices\n\n                          (By Kenneth Lovett)\n\n       Albany.--If the government sets higher milk prices for \n     farmers, consumers are likely to pay more at the grocery \n     store but New York's small dairies aren't likely to be any \n     better off, two consumer advocacy groups charged yesterday.\n       ``It would be nothing more than a milk tax on consumers,'' \n     said John M. Schnittker, a senior economist with Public Voice \n     for Food and Health Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based think \n     tank.\n       Public Voice and New York Citizens for a Sound Economy, a \n     Westchester-based advocacy group, said the industry and \n     consumers would be better off letting the free market set the \n     price of milk.\n       If really interested in helping small dairies survive, the \n     state should continue to lower the cost of doing business in \n     New York, offer property tax relief for farmers and other \n     direct incentives, they said.\n       ``Sixty years of federal intervention into milk pricing has \n     done nothing but accelerate the trend of fewer farms and \n     smaller farms that have been replaced by larger ones,'' \n     Schnittker said.\n       Though declining, agriculture is still New York's and the \n     Mid-Hudson's No. 1 industry.\n       Dairy farmers have long complained that the federally-set \n     milk prices are too low to offset the steadily increasing \n     cost of running their operations. The wholesale price of milk \n     is about $12 per 100 pounds for New York farmers or $4.50 \n     less than a year ago.\n       Gov. George Pataki last week formed a task force to develop \n     recommendations to help farmers without hurting consumers.\n       Among the options being explored is whether the state \n     should temporarily raise milk prices paid to farmers above \n     the federally set rate. By law, New York's agriculture and \n     markets commissioner can increase the rate if petitioned by \n     35 percent of the state's milk producers.\n       Another option supported by many farmers is to have New \n     York join the six New England states in the Northeast \n     Interstate Dairy Compact, which would allow them to charge \n     more for their milk. The states now in the compact are \n     receiving $1.31 more per hundred pounds for their milk than \n     New York farmers.\n       Consumer groups are urging both options be rejected. The \n     study that Public Voice released yesterday predicted raising \n     the price paid to farmers would translate to about 21 cents a \n     gallon more for milk. The average upstate milk price per \n     gallon is now $2.24.\n       But it's not just consumers who would suffer, he said. The \n     higher prices would encourage larger farms to up production, \n     thus allowing them to benefit significantly more than smaller \n     farmers. According to the study, 53 percent of the revenue \n     taken in from the increase in prices would go to only 18 \n     percent of the producers. For the largest 400 dairies that \n     would mean annual subsidies averaging $45,000 per farm.\n       But farming interests say the consumer groups are only \n     working to scare people. They say increased milk prices will \n     be one way to make it easier for small farmers to compete.\n       They also argue that costs to consumers won't necessarily \n     increase just because farmers are paid more.\n       Rick Zimmerman, New York Farm Bureau director of \n     governmental relations, noted that the price of milk over the \n     past year has not dipped as much as the price paid to \n     farmers.\n       ``It is unfortunate that the general public is being scared \n     by a group that pretends to exist for the best interest of \n     New York consumers,'' Zimmerman said. ``The facts are clear. \n     Public Voice is--merely a front for milk processors who find \n     it in their best interest to keep the farmers milk price as \n     low as possible.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Dec. 2, 1997]\n\n                     N.E. Milk Tax Hits Needy Hard\n\n                          (By Kevin G. Honan)\n\n       In the last several months consumers throughout New England \n     have seen their milk prices increase an average of 17 cents a \n     gallon. The reason for the increase is the Northeast \n     Interstate Dairy Compact, which sets a minimum price that \n     dairies must pay farmers. The minimum is currently $1.46 a \n     gallon, or 13 percent above the federally set national \n     minimum.\n       Because of this surcharge on milk prices. New England \n     consumers have paid an extra $16 million for milk since July. \n     Massachusetts consumers were hit hardest, paying $7.4 million \n     of the increase. According to a study by a Washington \n     agricultural policy group, the compact's milk tax will add \n     $32 million to Massachusetts consumers' grocery bills by \n     September 1998.\n       The compact is designed to protect New England dairy \n     farmers, yet the benefits to the state are minimal, because \n     Massachusetts has only about 350 dairy farmers, less than \n     one-tenth of the New England total. Additionally, \n     Massachusetts consumers will pay almost half of the entire \n     New England milk tax, yet 88 percent of the state's $27 \n     million in milk tax revenues will benefit out-of-state \n     farmers. By next September, membership in the compact will \n     cost Massachusetts consumers more than $90,000 in milk taxes \n     per Massachusetts dairy farmer.\n       There must be a better way to help farmers in need than a \n     milk tax that places financial stress and unfair burden on \n     hundreds of thousands of working people, especially lower-\n     income families, children, and elderly\n\n[[Page S814]]\n\n     residents on fixed incomes, who need milk at affordable \n     prices.\n       At a time when many low-income families are being hurt by \n     severe cuts in food stamp benefits, the compact's milk price \n     increases are especially distressing. The purchase power for \n     food stamp recipients decreased by more than a half-million \n     dollars in the first three months after the compact's \n     decision. Over the coming year, the compact will cost the \n     state's poorest residents more than $1 million in lost \n     purchasing power.\n       Government programs that provide food benefits for children \n     are also particularly vulnerable. National statistics show \n     that children are the biggest milk consumers. In fact, while \n     children constitute only 29 percent of the U.S. population, \n     they drink 49 percent of all milk sold. In Massachusetts, \n     over the first three months alone, the increased expense for \n     school lunch programs, which provide many children with the \n     one nutritious meal they have each day, was $400,000. By \n     September 1998, the compact will cost school lunch programs \n     statewide almost $2 million.\n       Massachusetts Commissioner of Agriculture Jay Healy, a \n     member of the Compact Commission, recently proposed an \n     amendment to exempt school lunch programs from the milk tax, \n     but that attempt was rejected by other commission members.\n       I recognize that the compact's goal is to help subsidize \n     New England dairy farmers, but penalizing the low-income, \n     elderly, and children is not the best method. Increased \n     training and tax relief programs are among the options we \n     should consider. Alternatives to the compact are necessary \n     and could involve initiating lending programs with banks for \n     preferential interest rates to small farmers, or creating \n     tax-relief initiatives on land transfers, so families are not \n     penalized when farms are transferred from one generation to \n     the next.\n       It is now in the hands of the five Massachusetts members of \n     the Northeast Dairy Compact Commission. At the December \n     compact meeting, the Massachusetts delegation should offer a \n     motion to rescind their previous vote in favor of the milk \n     tax. Low-income families, children, and senior citizens \n     cannot afford to bear this burden.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Opposition to the Compact is growing among state \nlegislators from the New England area. One state may even be attempting \nto pull out of the Compact. Those regions with the most to lose are \ndensely populated and have fewer dairy farmers relative to other \nregions. The result is an effective subsidization by urban consumers.\n  A milk tax that burdens financially stressed working families--\nespecially those of lower-income, who rely on reasonable and affordable \nmilk--is wrong. It is high time we put an end to partisan, regional \npolitics which block real, long-term, assistance for dairy farmers.\n  I intend to continue my efforts to oppose the Northeast Dairy \nCompact. This will include fighting to obtain a comprehensive, \ninformative study on its effects and consequences.\n  Mr. CLELAND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Assist International donated medical equipment to a site in \nMongolia which was then approved by the World Health Organization to \nperform open heart surgery. The Hewlett Packard Foundation donated the \nmedical equipment in the Black Lion Project in its goal to ease human \nsuffering internationally. Finally, the Chamber of Commerce of Erie, \nPennsylvania, has joined together with the other organizations and has \nraised the funding for transportation, installation, and training costs \nof this project. Specifically, I commend the Erie Area Chamber of \nCommerce for this cooperative effort and for holding the third annual \n``Aid to Africa'' banquet to raise funds for humanitarian projects.\n  The Black Lion project is an example of the compassion and generosity \nthat other countries appreciate and admire in the United States.

Mr. President, with the death of Roger Stevens earlier \nthis month, the nation lost one of its greatest leaders in the arts. \nRoger Stevens was the Founding Chairman and unstoppable visionary for \nthe John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Just inside the \nentrance of the Center is a bust of Roger Stevens with those words \ninscribed to him.\n  Roger Stevens was a real estate magnate who loved the excitement, \nenergy and creativity of American theater. During his lifetime, he \nproduced hundreds of plays and musicals, including\n\n[[Page S815]]\n\nmany of the nation's all-time favorites such as ``West Side Story,'' \n``Les Miserables,'' and ``Annie.''\n  It was Roger Stevens whose efforts and extraordinary ability created \nWashington's national cultural center which was later named for my \nbrother, President Kennedy. The Kennedy Center today is truly the house \nthat Roger built, and it is a wonderful living memorial to my brother. \nIt presents the finest in the performing arts on its stages, and it is \nan extraordinary success. Washingtonians and an estimated million \nvisitors to Washington each year enjoy its performances and educational \nprograms.\n  In St. Paul's Cathedral in London, there is a tribute to its great \narchitect, Christopher Wren. It says, ``If you would see his monument, \nlook around you.'' The Kennedy Center is a monument to Roger Stevens' \ntoo.\n  I know that my brother would be very proud of the Center which bears \nhis name. All of us who value achievement in the arts treasure the \nCenter's continued pursuit of Roger's dream--that Washington will be a \ngreat center for the performing arts and that the Kennedy Center will \npresent the best in plays, symphonies, ballets and operas from across \nthe country and around the world. Roger Stevens made it possible for \nall of us to share in that dream--and the nation owes him a tremendous \ndebt.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the tributes to Roger Stevens at a \nmemorial service on February 4 at Oak Street Cemetery Chapel in \nGeorgetown be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tributes were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Tribute by Marta Istomin\n\n       I came to the Kennedy Center in January 1980 and worked \n     closely with Roger Stevens some 10 years and our friendship \n     lasted 'til the end. It was much more than friendship from my \n     part--it was admiration, affection and respect, and the \n     realization of the privilege of being near such an \n     extraordinary personality--from whom I learned so much.\n       Many have spoken and written about Roger's lifetime \n     achievements. I can only speak first hand about those later \n     years when he was involved in the development of the artistic \n     dream of making the Kennedy Center a genuine National \n     Cultural Center--raising the awareness of what true Art \n     means--as compared to just anything that carries the label of \n     Performing Arts--and we need to know the difference! A Center \n     that would be a place where the best expression and \n     excellence of American Arts would be appreciated and \n     encouraged--while presenting the best from around the world.\n       At the Kennedy Center--the house that Roger built--there \n     was an incandescent spirit within those walls--not only on \n     the stages but before the performances were ever on stage. \n     The ideas, the preparation, the challenges, the excitement! \n     It was Roger that instilled that spirit. He was a passionate \n     believer and supporter of many projects--not only for the \n     Theater--but for all forms of arts. One of his extraordinary \n     gifts was for recognizing creative talent and for bringing \n     together the best artists. As an example, when he served as \n     first chairman of the National Council on the Arts, he \n     assembled such council members as: Agnes De Mille, Ralph \n     Ellison, John Steinbeck, George Stevens, Sr., Gregory Peck, \n     Oliver Smith, Leonard Bernstein, Isaac Stern, William \n     Pereira, Minoru Yamasaki, David Smith, and Philip Hanes.\n       This tells us the all encompassing vision he had for \n     culture in America.\n       I can tell you what working with him was like.\n       If he believed in you--he gave you full reign to pursue \n     your goals, and, while observing their development one could \n     feel supported and understood. When there was a project that \n     he might not be completely familiar with, he would listen--\n     look at the budget and finally ask: ``Do you believe in it? \n     Is it worthwhile for this Center? . . . then, go for it.'' If \n     there was something that did not succeed, there would be no \n     blame. Let's learn from it and go to the next project.\n       It was a very personal kind of leadership. He inspired \n     others by his dedication and his intuitive genius in \n     recognizing excellence. Unless he was traveling for fund-\n     raising or scouting for new projects all over the world, he \n     was day and night at the Center--hardly ever missing a \n     performance. His curiosity and thirst for knowledge were \n     constantly fed by extensive reading.\n       He loved to attend rehearsals. He would drop into every \n     office--asked questions. His memory was prodigious, \n     especially for numbers and budgets. During his era there was \n     no need for long memos, strategy meetings or management \n     meetings. He simply led the way--without too many words. We \n     understood, the work was done, and wonderful programs were \n     given. Everything fell into place. He elicited the best in \n     each of us.\n       In moments of detente, he would enjoy good laughs, \n     conversation, a glass of good wine, reports on artistic \n     ventures and gossip about artists. He loved to talk to \n     artists, staff, stagehands and volunteers--he would be \n     informed about everything.\n       Roger radiated a quality that was powerful but benign. The \n     power to make things happen through the humble, plain and \n     complete dedication for his cause.\n       His generosity was as his commitment--enormous.\n       My husband Eugene would make him laugh when he mimicked his \n     way of approaching big donors. He would say ``Look it.'' \n     ``There is this great project. I'm giving X thousand dollars \n     towards this play-opera. This is important for our Cultural \n     Center, to work for everybody's sake. Will you join me?'' And \n     so they did. But it was Roger who gave first, and usually the \n     most, and they followed.\n       I recall that a beautiful Monet painting, one of the \n     Nymphea Series hung in the living room of the Stevens' home. \n     One day it disappeared. ``Where's the Monet?'' ``I sold it. \n     We needed the money at the Center,'' without even a sign of \n     regret. That was Roger! That was his extraordinary \n     leadership.\n       But there is another side of Roger which was perhaps less \n     evident to the public. The personal shining star of his \n     life--Christine. One day I was waiting for him at his office \n     looking at a beautiful picture of Christine that he always \n     had on his desk. I said, ``She is truly a beautiful woman.'' \n     He said, ``Oh . . . so beautiful outside and inside,'' and \n     his eyes filled up as he spoke. Both he and Christine have \n     been missionaries. He was a leading champion for the Arts in \n     America. Christine's mission has been first and foremost the \n     companionship and care of Roger over a whole lifetime and \n     their daughter Christabel. She also embraced humanitarian and \n     humane causes for which she works tirelessly. Because of \n     their example, many have been made aware of how determined \n     dedication can affect our world. They celebrated their \n     wedding anniversaries on New Year's Day and at the \n     celebrations on New Year's Eve at the Kennedy Center, and \n     later on in our home. Christine would always wear a white \n     orchid given to her by Roger. Theirs was a true love story \n     for 60 years.\n       Roger you will remain in our minds and hearts.\n       You remain as a shining inspiration for generations to \n     come.\n       Your life achievements will always be cause for \n     celebration.\n       And, we loved you!\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   Tribute by William McCormick Blair\n\n       I knew Roger for forty-six years. He was a warm and \n     wonderful friend and one of the most decent and honorable \n     people I've ever known.\n       He is gone now but his long and luminous life has left us \n     with indelible memories.\n       I had the enormous privilege of working closely with Roger \n     during the Adlai Stevenson years when he was one of our most \n     effective fund-raisers. He didn't change over the years--back \n     then the same unassuming and modest nature, completely \n     without pretense.\n       Roger used to say to me that if I could block off a \n     luncheon he would produce five or six people, each of whom \n     would contribute $50,000 to the campaign--a significant sum \n     in those days--and produce he did. I remember standing with \n     him in the fields outside Adlai's house in Libertyville and \n     watching the private planes circling like angels before \n     landing to disgorge the contributors. And in New York, when \n     on occasion the networks would refuse to put Adlai on \n     national TV until the money was in hand, we went to Roger, \n     who would invariably say, ``Don't worry, I'll take care of \n     it.''\n       The ``Don't worry, I'll take care of it'' approach carried \n     over to the turbulent years during which the Kennedy Center \n     was constructed. There were difficult times and innumerable \n     provocations, frustrations with architects, contractors, \n     performers, playwrights, etc., to say nothing of endless \n     trips to the Hill seeking funds, but Roger was unfailingly \n     generous, considerate, good humored, and kind--and he made it \n     all work.\n       I remember his first heart attack--he called me from New \n     York at six or seven in the morning telling me that he knew \n     he had had a heart attack in his apartment, had gotten \n     dressed and walked over to Lenox Hill Hospital, from where he \n     was calling. He asked me to reschedule or take over some \n     meetings, but admonished me not to call Christine, saying it \n     was too early to bother her and that he would call her in an \n     hour. So typically considerate, as always.\n       Dear Christine, together with your independent spirit, you \n     combined over the years a thoughtfulness, enthusiasm and \n     warmth of friendship which you brought to everyone, and a \n     devotion to Roger so tender, so thoughtful, so full of \n     consideration and kindness that it would be hard to suggest \n     an equal.\n       Horace Greeley once said, ``Fame is a vapor, popularity an \n     accident, riches take wind, and those who cheer today will \n     curse tomorrow. Only one thing endures--character.''\n       And it was his character that was Roger's ultimate \n     strength.\n       So with unmeasured gratitude we remember the impeccable \n     dignity and integrity that were the hallmarks of his life. \n     For all of us, and particularly for Christine and Christobel, \n     there are those wonderful memories. It is also for the little \n     things we remember as well as the ones the obituaries have \n     been listing, that we send our love back to Roger.\n       Robert Ingersoll could have had Roger in mind when he said \n     of a friend, ``He added to\n\n[[Page S816]]\n\n     the sum of human joy, and were everyone to whom he did some \n     loving service to bring a blossom to his grave, he would \n     sleep tonight beneath a wilderness of flowers.''\n\n                  Tribute by Senator Edward M. Kennedy\n\n       There's a famous saying that all men are dust, but some are \n     gold dust. And that's how we thought of Roger--a golden \n     friend, one of the finest friends our family ever had.\n       Roger was an easy friend to love. He was a quiet, modest \n     man; but his low-key manner disguised energy, passion and \n     ability of the highest order. These three priceless qualities \n     earned him enormous success in his brilliant career. But even \n     more important, they earned him the enduring respect and \n     genuine affection of the countless people whose lives he \n     touched.\n       He was well-known for saying very little, and equally well-\n     known for mumbling--a lot. But if you paid close attention, \n     you realized he was talking about ``West Side Story'' or a \n     thousand other creations that his mind's eye could so clearly \n     see, and the rest of us would come to see in due course as \n     well.\n       He was pre-eminent in real estate by profession, especially \n     for his legendary purchase and sale of the Empire State \n     Building--Roger never did anything small. But as we all know, \n     his heart and soul were with the theater.\n       So it was inevitable that Jack and Jackie and Roger would \n     find each other. Frankly, they came together like a magnet. \n     From his first days in public service, Jack had been deeply \n     committed to a leading role for the arts in the nation's \n     life. As my brother said near the end of the 1960 campaign, \n     ``There is a connection, hard to explain logically but easy \n     to feel, between achievement in public life and progress in \n     the arts. The Age of Pericles was also the age of Phidias. \n     The Age of Lorenzo de Medici was also the Age of Leonardo da \n     Vinci. the Age of Elizabeth was also the Age of Shakespeare. \n     And the New Frontier for which I campaign in public life can \n     also be a New Frontier for American art.''\n       So it was natural and inevitable that Jack would give Roger \n     the assignment of establishing a national performing arts \n     center here in Washington. Roger was a man after Jack's \n     heart--the difficult you do immediately, the impossible takes \n     a little longer.\n       Roger simply said, as he always did. ``I'll take care of \n     it.'' And the rest is history--the house that Roger built, a \n     quarter mile from here--the beautiful living memorial to my \n     brother.\n       In a sense, I inherited Roger from Jack. I often kidded \n     Roger that he was a modern Robin Hood--robbing his friends to \n     support the arts.\n       His special gift was not just constructing a building, or \n     planning the endless series of hit plays and musicals that \n     bore his special stamp. Roger enriched the entire nation by \n     instilling a higher appreciation across America for the \n     possibilities of artistic achievement. He had a remarkable \n     eye for the best emerging playwrights and the best unknown \n     actors. He gave them a chance and a stage, and he gave the \n     nation a higher level of greatness.\n       Roger succeeded where others failed because he would never \n     allow himself to be distracted by the mean-spirited. He had a \n     determination that could overcome any obstacle or criticism. \n     He was never burdened, some might add, by any sense of \n     reality, which made him all the more endearing and \n     successful, when many others would have failed.\n       Above all, it was Roger and Christine together--they \n     brought a new era of grace to Washington and new sense of \n     achievement that reflects the best of the human spirit. We \n     miss you, Roger, and we always will.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk for just a few minutes about \na long-term goal of many Senate Republicans, and I think most \nAmericans. And that is fundamental tax reform.\n  Our Tax Code contains the accumulation of 85 years of various special \ninterest provisions, and provisions that have just been added through \none tax bill or another. And it has become more complicated, more \ndifficult, and more unfair with every passing year.\n  Since the Federal Government first started taxing Americans' income, \nthe tax beast has grown, and the power of the tax collector along with \nit. That is why we need IRS reform, and why we will have an IRS reform \nbill on the floor of the Senate by the end of March so that we can pass \nit before April 15th of this year. It certainly is overdue. But we have \nfound a lot of the problems that we have suspected really do exist and \nin many ways are worse than the worst horror stories we have heard.\n  We now have a system in which the Federal Government takes one dollar \nout of every five dollars that you earn. And the IRS uses its coercive \npowers to pry into every aspect of financial life and personal life. It \nhas gotten totally out of control.\n  The copy of the Tax Code that I have here contains thousands of pages \nin very small print, and weighs 6\\1/2\\ pounds. How could the average \nworking small businessman, farmer, rancher, or individual be expected \nto cope with and understand all that is in these two very large \nvolumes?\n  The IRS has an annual budget now of $7.7 billion. We spend five times \nmore to pay tax auditors to harass hard-working citizens than we spend \nto clean up Superfund waste sites.\n  It really doesn't make sense.\n  It is important that we in Congress admit that we are part of the \nproblem because every time we have good intentions we pass another tax \nbill that reduces taxes--hopefully, in most instances. But it doesn't \nmake it simpler. In many ways it quite often makes it more complicated.\n  The Congress writes the tax law. And almost every time we pass a tax \nbill we make the code more complex, increase the burden on the \ntaxpayer, and make it harder to enforce.\n  For all of these reasons, America needs fundamental tax reform.\n  Incremental tax cuts are good. And I hope we can have some this year. \nAnd I am glad we were able to take a small step toward reducing the \ntaxpayers' burden last year in the very critical areas of capital \ngains, estate tax, and families with children.\n  To go where we really need to go, however, we must force the Congress \nto act.\n  To make fundamental tax reform happen, we need a ``forcing event,'' a \ndeadline.\n  I firmly believe that Congress will never commit itself to replacing \nthe Tax Code with something simpler, flatter, and growth-friendly, \nunless we create our own deadline.\n  For that reason, I want to announce today that I will ask Budget \nCommittee Chairman Domenici to put a sense-of-the-Senate provision in \nthis year's budget resolution that the current Tax Code should be \nterminated as of December 31, 2001.\n  I am also an original cosponsor of Senator Hutchinson's bill, S. \n1520, The Tax Code Termination Act.\n  In addition to the sense-of-the-Senate provision in the budget \nresolution, we will vote on legislation like Senator Hutchinson's bill \nthis year.\n  It creates the deadline to force Washington and the American people \nto make some hard choices but to make the right choices.\n  We will then be able to see who is serious about replacing our rat's \nnest Tax Code, and who wants to defend the current tax system.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S816-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S816-S817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MARKING THE SIXTY-SIXTH BIRTHDAY OF SENATOR EDWARD M. KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate has been blessed with the \npresence of many fine men and women over the past two centuries. Many \nof the great figures in our country's history played their parts before \na Senate backdrop. Names such as Daniel Webster, Henry Clay and John C. \nCalhoun leap to mind.\n  I should say, incidentally, that I have been unable to find any piece \nof legislation, certainly any major piece of legislation, that carries \nthe name of Webster, Clay or Calhoun. They did not achieve their \ngreatness by introducing legislation and by seeing it enacted, but they \nspoke to the great issues of the day and spoke with fervor and \ncourageously and with great vision.\n  But there are speakers, thinkers and leaders in more recent times as \nwell, and I think of Robert Taft of Ohio, renowned in his day for his \nintegrity and intelligence; I think of Georgia's erudite, gentlemanly \nRichard Russell; and of the wise, capable Mike Mansfield\n\n[[Page S817]]\n\nfrom Montana. To these names I would like to add, today, one of my most \nesteemed colleagues and best friends in the Senate family--Edward M. \nKennedy, who, on yesterday, celebrated his 66th birthday.\n  Oh, to be 66 again!\n  From my perspective, of course, turning 66 places one in the \nspringtime of one's life. What is truly remarkable about Senator \nKennedy is that, despite his relative youth, he ranks third in \nseniority in the Senate. Indeed, having begun his senatorial career at \nthe tender age of 30, there is no reason why Senator Kennedy may not \ngrace this chamber with his presence for another 35 years (although I \nassure my colleague that, while he may have the upper hand on me in \nyears, I am in no rush to relinquish my seniority to him!).\n  But Senator Kennedy's career is not adequately measured in years. \nRather, if we are to fairly and truthfully evaluate the career of the \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts, we must reckon with the hard work, \nthe legislative skill, and the undiminished idealism that have been the \nhallmarks of his Senate tenure. I shall elaborate on each of these \npoints in turn.\n  I begin with hard work. For, far from relaxing upon his well-deserved \nlaurels, Senator Kennedy continues to put many of his far younger \ncolleagues to shame with his willingness to put in long hours. I for \none have always found it doubly fitting that Senator Kennedy is the \nranking member (and former Chairman) of the Senate Labor Committee. For \nthe Senator is not just a passionate advocate of the causes of working \nmen and women; he is also one of the most industrious members of this \nbody, and a man whose tireless labor continues to inspire others. \nSenator Kennedy knows well that, as Thomas Edison pointed out several \ngenerations ago, ``there is no substitute for hard work,'' and his \nsuccess as a legislator owes much to his energy and dedication.\n  This brings me to my second point: the remarkable legislative acumen \nof my dear friend from Massachusetts. Senator Kennedy first ran for the \nSenate in 1962 under the slogan ``He can do more for Massachusetts,'' \nand he has certainly more than lived up to those words. Massachusetts \nand the rest of the country owe a debt of gratitude to Senator Kennedy. \nI will not try to recite all of his legislative achievements. Though \nmany may consider me an orator of the old school, I have no intention \nof delaying the business of this body for the many hours that such a \nrecitation would require. Instead, let me just point out a few of his \nmore recent achievements, such as AmeriCorps, the School-to-Work \nOpportunity Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and the Job Training \nPartnership Act (and subsequent amendments). Few Senators have been as \nsuccessful and as skillful as Senator Kennedy at passing bills. Never \ncontent simply to endorse the efforts of his colleagues or to introduce \na bill for the sole purpose of providing fodder for a self-serving \npress release, Senator Kennedy brings to each of his legislative \nendeavors the diligence, savvy, and bipartisanship that have made him a \ngreat lawmaker.\n  Finally, I wish to salute Senator Kennedy's idealism. Throughout his \ncareer, Senator Kennedy has fought for a simple premise: that our \nsociety's greatness lies in its ability and willingness to provide for \nits less fortunate members. Whether striving to increase the minimum \nwage, to ensure that all children have medical insurance, or to secure \nopen access to higher education, Senator Kennedy has shown time and \ntime again that he cares deeply for those whose needs greatly exceed \ntheir political clout. Unbowed by personal setbacks or by the terrible \nsorrow that has been visited upon his family time and time again, his \nidealism burns forth as resolutely and indefatigably as the torch \nburning over the grave of his brother, President John F. Kennedy.\n  And so, Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to wish my good \nfriend and beloved colleague, Ted Kennedy, a happy, healthy 66th \nbirthday.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S816-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S817-S832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PAYCHECK PROTECTION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Under the previous order, the \nhour of 3 p.m. having arrived, the Senate will now proceed to the \ncampaign finance reform legislation. The clerk will report the bill.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1663) to protect individuals from having their \n     money involuntarily collected and used for politics by a \n     corporation or labor organization.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, spring has come early to Washington this \nyear, and the Senate's return to the subject of campaign finance will \nstrengthen the impression that we have already entered the television \nrerun season. The evening news, I fear, for the next few nights will \nseem like a replay of events from last fall when two irreconcilable \npoints of view met on the Senate floor and reached a stalemate.\n  We agreed to try again at some time before March 6, and so, pursuant \nto that agreement, I have laid down a bill that embodies the most \nimportant campaign finance reform of all: paycheck protection. The \nbill, S. 1663, is at the desk.\n  It is as simple as this: No one should be forced to make a political \ncontribution. That is pretty elementary, and overwhelmingly Americans, \nincluding union members, agree with that. No one should be compelled by \na union or a corporation or a Congress to give their hard-earned \ndollars to a candidate or a campaign. And yet, millions of our fellow \nAmericans are held up like that, not at the point of a gun but through \nmisuse of their union dues.\n  I am the son of a shipyard worker, a pipefitter, a pipefitter union \nmember, and even, as I understand it, temporarily a union steward. I \ngrew up in a blue-collar family. I grew up with my father going to work \nin a shipyard, and I am very sympathetic to how they work--the \nconditions they used to have to work in and the fact that those \nconditions are better now.\n  But I know my father would have objected strenuously to his union \ndues being taken and used for political purposes with which he did not \nagree. Diverting workers' earnings to campaign coffers of some favorite \npoliticians in some other part of the country, that certainly is a \nlegitimate concern. No matter who does it, we shouldn't be allowing \nthat to happen.\n  If we are serious about reforming the Nation's campaign finance laws, \nthis is the place to start, by protecting workers' paychecks.\n  This bill before us, which is largely the work of my colleague from \nOklahoma, Senator Nickles, is the gate through which campaign finance \nreform must proceed if it is to proceed at all. Whatever our respective \nviews on other aspects of the campaign finance debate, support for \npaycheck protection is a litmus test of whether we are serious or \nwhether we are credible.\n  Opponents of paycheck protection have created quite a stir about \nother problems they perceive with campaign finance reform. They remind \nme of the overly zealous policeman writing a ticket for a car parked \njust 3 inches too close to a fire hydrant while a brutal mugging takes \nplace right behind his back. In fact, the workers of America are mugged \nevery time they are forced to contribute to candidates and to causes \nthey do not support.\n  The bills that have thus far been called ``campaign finance reform'' \nwould not do a thing about that, but, golly, they would sure write \nparking tickets.\n  This Senate over the past 2 years has been able to reach consensus on \na lot of difficult issues. It hasn't been easy. We have worked hard \nreaching consensus, agreeing to welfare reform and last year the budget \nagreement and tax reductions. It took weeks, it took months, it took \nsacrifice, it took give and take. That atmosphere has not developed \nwith campaign finance reform. You would think we could reach a \nconsensus, but the consensus is not there yet. Both sides have to want \nconsensus, and a consensus would have to do five things:\n\n[[Page S818]]\n\n  First, respect the constitutional rights of every American to engage \nin the political process as those rights were enunciated by the Supreme \nCourt in Buckley v. Valeo. We don't need less participation by \nAmericans at all stages of life and in all avenues in elections; we \nneed more participation. We shouldn't be trying to restrict their \nexpression; we ought to be encouraging it to take advantage of every \nopportunity to express themselves and express their views on issues \nand, yes, on candidates, and not sometime far off removed from an \nelection when people are not paying attention. As a matter of fact, I \nthink one of the things we ought to do is shorten the length \nof campaigns and compact them if we can, but there is a little problem \nwith that, too. That would be my desire, but how do you do it \nconstitutionally?\n\n  Second, encourage greater participation by citizens in the political \nprocess.\n  Third, ensure that any and all contributions to a campaign are \nabsolutely voluntary.\n  Fourth, restrict the power of Government officials to meddle in \ncampaigns and to intimidate citizens who participate in them.\n  And fifth, and last, safeguard America's elections from foreign \ninfluence.\n  All of us should be able to rally around those very basic principles, \nI think. Unfortunately, though, many in this Chamber don't seem to want \na consensus. What they want is an advantage, an unfair advantage for \nsome candidates, some special interests, and some contributors, but not \nfor all.\n  Sure, let's be real honest. Democrats would like to limit \ncontributions from groups that support Republicans, but if you talk \nabout any kind of fair restriction on their supporters, oh, no, that's \nnot fair. They want to tilt the Nation's campaign laws and, in the \nprocess, discourage citizen involvement in Government. Their \nlegislation would make it more difficult for Americans to hold \naccountable their elected officials. That is hardly the way to restore \ntrust in government or respect for those who lead it.\n  More rules and regulations will not do the job. Our elections are \nalready swamped with rules and regulations. They are so complicated \nthat virtually every congressional campaign now needs a battery of \nelection law attorneys to guard against inadvertent violations.\n  Every campaign now has to have a CPA to make sure you get all these \nfilings done properly and that you get the addresses and the \nemployment. You better have some good legal advice and you better take \nevery possible precaution to make sure that you are dotting every ``i'' \nand crossing every ``t,'' because there are going to be some people who \nwill be pawing through everything you do.\n  I have voted for some of the campaign finance laws in the past. I \nvoted for the FEC, thinking maybe it would get better, and it has \ngotten worse. We have been limiting participation. We have been making \nit more difficult for candidates to be able to raise the money to get \ntheir message out, and there are a lot of people I figure who would \nlike to really put elections in the control of the national news media, \nthe national broadcasters, certain limited organizations.\n  I have said here before, if I were at the mercy of the major \nnewspaper in my State and the biggest television station in my State, I \nwould be trying lawsuits in Pascagoula, MS, and making a lot more \nmoney, but I was able to get out and get my message across in spite of \nthe opposition of the establishment, the courthouse gangs, and the news \nmedia with their prejudices. I was able to go directly to the people. \nWould the proposal that we have heard--McCain-Feingold--help that? No. \nIt would cut that off.\n\n  All the laws already on the books did not prevent, by the way, the \nmost blatant, the most egregious, the most offensive disregard of the \nlaw in the last Presidential campaign. I mean, this idea of ``stop me \nbefore I do it again,'' I do not think should sell.\n  The first thing we should do with our campaigns in America is to \ncomply with the laws on the books. That is where the problem was. The \nlast election, you know, did not have problems because we had people \nwho were doing things that we could stop with this bill; they were \nviolating the law. That is what caused the problem.\n  Foreign contributions are illegal. Many of the problems that we saw \nin the last election were illegal. Now some people say, ``Well, we've \ngot to stop the efforts of people to help the parties.'' I thought we \nwere supposed to help the two-party system in America. We should \nencourage the two-party system. We should encourage parties to get \nvoters to turn out to the polls. We should encourage groups to support \ncandidates of their choice--not discourage it.\n  The outcome, of course, that we had from the last Presidential \ncampaign was a morass involving everything from Vice Presidential phone \ncalls and Native American casinos to illegal fundraising at religious \ninstitutions. All of those things were probably against the law anyway.\n  When key Democratic fundraisers flee the country to avoid \nquestioning, it is no wonder their beneficiaries would like to change \nthe subject away from the enforcement of current law. But enforcing \ncurrent law is precisely the way that we should begin the debate on \nthis campaign finance reform issue today.\n  If current law needs to be streamlined or clarified or simplified, \nlet us do it. But let us do it while encouraging greater participation \nby more people in politics, and let us do it constitutionally.\n  The amendment that will be offered by Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold will take us in the wrong direction, in my opinion, toward \nmore controls, more restrictions, and less accountability. We should go \nthe other way. We should try to replicate on a national scale the \nspirit of a town meeting in which every person is free to speak, free \nto complain, and free to hold accountable those in positions of power.\n  The bill I have presented advances that goal by protecting workers' \npaychecks against political abuse. Let us agree to do this today and \nthen explore other possible accords. If we can take this one step, this \nmodest step, it could be the one that would break the dam and allow us \nto do some of the other things that we probably could agree to. But, \nno, it is said that this is a poison pill--a poison pill--when the \nAmerican people know it is the right thing to do, when union members \nsupport it overwhelmingly, when what we are really talking about is \nvoluntarily agreeing to have your money used.\n  That is a very American thing we are trying to do, I think. We should \nstop the confiscation of workers' earnings for the benefit of \npoliticians. Then we can finish campaign finance reform in a true sense \nand move on to other matters the American people want us to deal with.\n  Let me just say that we are going to have a full debate on this \ntoday, tomorrow, Wednesday; and there will be votes on it as we agreed \nto last year. But I want to remind my colleagues that after this, we \nhave pending some really important issues, including issues involving \neducation in America, highway construction in America, NATO \nenlargement, a budget resolution, supplemental appropriations to \nprovide funds for the situations in Bosnia and Iraq, and to make a \ndecision about how to deal with IMF.\n  We are talking about Internal Revenue Service reform, maybe even some \ntobacco settlement legislation. All of that, and it has to be done \nbefore the end of April. We have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of \nwork to do on issues that people really care about. Education is a \nperfect example. A decent infrastructure is another example. In my own \nState of Mississippi, we have gotten an unfair share of the highway \nfunds for 40 years. It is time we changed that.\n  We should give this debate fair time. And we can do that this week as \nwe promised. But we have a lot of really important issues that we need \nto take up that will directly affect people's lives in America for \nyears to come. I hope that after a reasonable time, unless we can find \nsome broader consensus that I do not see that would include paycheck \nequity for workers, then we should move on to other very important \nissues.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my good friend and leader how much I \nappreciate his leadership on this issue. Your\n\n[[Page S819]]\n\nspeech was, of course, right on point. We have many important things to \naccomplish for the people of the United States that they care about \ndeeply. I think the leader was right on point when he made the \nobservation that the last thing we want to do is to diminish the \nability of Americans to participate in the political process. So I \nthank my good friend and leader for his outstanding work on this \nsubject.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I thank the leader for kicking off this debate on campaign finance \nreform.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the following members \nof my staff be granted floor privileges for the duration of our debate \non campaign finance reform: Mary Murphy, Bob Schiff, Sumner Slichter, \nKitty Loos, and Diane Welch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I and the senior Senator from Arizona, \nthe senior Senator from Tennessee, and the Presiding Officer, and many \nof the rest of us have been looking forward to this moment for a number \nof months--the return of campaign finance reform to the floor of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  This is an important occasion because, when we left the issue last \nfall, we clearly were in somewhat of a stalemate. Some people wanted \nmore than anything else to say that is it, the campaign finance reform \ndebate of the 105th Congress is over and done with and we will not see \nit again. They wanted to call a halt to this debate and let us go to \nthe 1998 elections changing absolutely nothing about the current \nsystem.\n  But others, including myself, thought that our consideration last \nfall of this issue had not been sufficient, that the American people \ndeserved more from this Senate than parliamentary tricks and poison \npills, that campaign finance reform is essential to the future of our \ndemocracy, and that we cannot afford to once again sweep this problem \nunder the rug.\n  The sweeping has already begun anew. And it is vigorous sweeping. It \nis coming in the form, not this time of a poison pill amendment, but a \npoison pill bill. The underlying bill to which we will have the McCain-\nFeingold bill attached as an amendment is the same thing as the poison \npill amendment. The majority leader made no pretense in this regard. It \nis simply the antiunion poison pill bill, as if that is the only issue \nthat is involved in the question of campaign finance reform.\n  The idea that the entirety of campaign finance reform can be \nsummarized in just the question of what happens to union dues is \ncompletely untenable. It is an untenable notion to any American that \nthe whole problem with the campaign finance reform system is related \nonly to labor unions.\n  Surely, that is part of the problem. But what about corporations? \nWhat about groups spending incredible amounts of money on ads that are \nnot really issue ads at all; they are just phony campaign ads? What \nabout multimillionaires buying Senate seats? What about all of these \nthings?\n  I do not think anyone in America really believes that this whole \ntopic is summarized and encapsulated in the mere question of what \nhappens with union dues. It is also incorrect to suggest that the \nMcCain-Feingold bill does not address that issue. It does in fact \ncodify, put into statute, what the U.S. Supreme Court has said ought to \nbe done and what is the law with regard to union dues, and it does so \nby codifying what is actually said in the so-called Beck decision.\n  So, Madam President, for all these months, after all this discussion \nof this issue for well over a year, all that the majority leader's bill \ndoes is say: We have to address this problem of union dues. I do not \nthink anyone in America believes that.\n  We just learned a few hours ago, Madam President, that that was going \nto be the entire contents of the leader's bill. Over 4 months after we \nagreed that he would lay down the first bill in the debate and after an \nentire year of scandals and revelations and accusations and \ninvestigations, the entire bill that is before us at the moment \nconsists of one narrow provision--one provision--the so-called Paycheck \nProtection Act. All this time the Republican leadership has not been \nable to come up with even one thing about this current campaign finance \nsystem that it wants to change other than that--not one--as if nothing \nelse has occurred in the country that might trouble Americans a little \nbit about how much big money is awash in their system in Washington, \nDC.\n  The leader's bill does not even mention disclosure. It says nothing \nabout fundraising on Federal property. It does not say a word about \nforeign money. It lets the soft money system off the hook entirely.\n  I guess, from the point of view of the majority leader, all is well \nin the campaign finance world except for that one question: What about \nthose union dues? Of course, we in effect knew this was his position \nanyway. The majority leader calls our current system of unlimited \ncontributions in the political parties by corporations and unions and \nwealthy individuals ``the American way.''\n  Frankly, Madam President, although I am not surprised at the \nproposal, I am disappointed. Although all the pundits have been saying \nfor the past few months that the Republican opponents of McCain-\nFeingold were just going to try to bring about the same deadlock that \nwe had before, I guess I hoped, without reason, that we might have a \nreal debate here about two different bills, about two different \nvisions, about two different real, comprehensive ideas about how our \ncampaign financing system should work.\n  McCain-Feingold has been out there now for over 2 years. It has been \nanalyzed and criticized and, of course, vilified in many ways, but at \nleast it is out there. The so-called Snowe-Jeffords amendment has even \nbeen out there for the past week in draft form. Already some groups are \nattacking it. At least they have something to attack. At least the \nsenior Senator from Arizona and I put our bill out there for people to \nreview and consider. And at least Senators Snowe and Jeffords are \ntrying to reach a compromise and are willing to let people have a look \nat what they are proposing.\n  But, again, the leadership here has given us nothing new to look at \nall. Instead, all we get is merciless criticism of President Clinton's \ncampaign fundraising for the last year and yet not a hint of a \nsuggestion about how we could have changed that system that both \nPresidential campaigns abused. In fact, the very things that the leader \nwas just describing as troubling about the President's campaign, in \nmost cases, I think almost everyone would have to concede was legal. \nThe raising of huge amounts of soft money is entirely legal. The \nleader's bill does not even mention the problem, as if nothing happened \nin 1996. Apparently the goal is, once again, just to tie this body in \nknots, not with a poison pill amendment, but now with a poison pill \nbill, the goal of which is to attack only one player in the system, the \nlabor unions.\n  Madam President, I did note that one commentator this morning said \nthat campaign finance reform is going to go down again in a prearranged \nstandoff. I remember being told at the beginning of last year the bill \nwould never come up, it was dead on arrival, it would never see the \nlight of day, and certainly that it would never come back this year. \nBut this notion of a prearranged standoff is something that I cannot \naccept from our point of view.\n  Well, there is no prearrangement on our side. We are ready to fight \nfor reform, because that is what the American people want us to do. I \nthink we have some reason to hope that we will have the votes to defeat \nthe majority leader's attack on unions if he does in fact bring that up \nagain for an up-or-down vote.\n  The majority leader is not going to be able to rely on his poison \npill bill to defeat campaign finance reform this time. I hope that \ngives the American people some hope that we can finally achieve \nmeaningful reform this year.\n  Madam President, a lot has happened in the world and in the country \nsince we last debated this issue last October. Current events and \nbreaking news are always unpredictable and sometimes distract us from \nthe very important task we have at hand.\n\n[[Page S820]]\n\n  I want to agree with the leader that there are many other issues that \nrequire our earnest attention this year. But my first message today \nwith regard to our priorities is that the allegations here in \nWashington with regard to certain personal issues and issues involving \nthe White House are serious and they have to be taken seriously. But \nlet us not let one potential scandal become an excuse to ignore an \nobvious and clear scandal. That clear and proven scandal is the record \nof the 1996 elections and the virtual destruction of the post-Watergate \ncampaign finance reform. Today, Madam President, we are in grave danger \nof letting that happen.\n\n  Campaign finance reform is a difficult enough topic to get people \ninterested in, anyway. It can be very arcane and this other alleged \nscandal which has piqued the public's interest could distract the \npublic and the Senate and end up becoming one of the biggest gifts to \nthe money-driven status quo that has ever occurred.\n  We have to recommit ourselves to the issue of cleaning up the \npolitical money system. That is why we are here today. I think there \nare two questions we have to answer. First, how is the American \npolitical system supposed to work? Whom is it supposed to serve? How \none answers both of those questions depends on one's vision of American \ndemocracy. One vision, the one I share and I bet most of us share, that \nthis is supposed to be a representative democracy. Our Government, our \npolitical process, and a good part of our common social and cultural \nheritage are all based on the premise that we are all to be treated \nequally under the law. It says so on the facade of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt Building, ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' It is implied in our \nNation's motto, e pluribus unum, ``out of many, one.'' It is clearly \nthe driving principle behind our Constitution and behind this basic \nconcept which has been summarized in the notion of one person, one \nvote, and the foundation of our whole electoral system.\n  Madam President, that vision of America and our democracy, a \nrepresentative democracy, assumes that every American by his or her \nbirthright has an equal role to play in this system. But there is \nanother vision and that is a vision that does away with this notion of \nequality, ``one person, one vote,'' and replaces it with a system that \nI have come to see and refer to as ``corporate democracy.''\n  Now, what do I mean by that? I want to return again to a story from \nmy younger days, as I mentioned before, because I think it illustrates \nthe difference between representative democracy in one person, one \nvote, and the notion of a corporate democracy, which is what I think we \nare becoming. When I was 13, a relative of mine gave me one share of \nstock in our great Janesville, WI, company, the Parker Pen Company. My \nrelative wanted me to learn something about how our economy worked, and \nmore specifically about how the stock market worked. I think that share \nwas worth about $13. My father told me in addition to owning a stock \nand getting the massive dividends that $13 share of stock would \nproduce, I also owned a small piece of the company, and therefore, I \nwas entitled to a vote at the company's stockholder meeting.\n  Now, already at age 13 I was interested in the political process and \nI sort of equated the idea of a shareholders meeting with voting at an \nelection, so at that age I could hardly wait to get to the shareholders \nmeeting and cast my ballot. I asked my father a follow-up question, \n``When is the stockholders' meeting? When do I get to cast my vote?'' \nHe laughed, and said ``I better tell you something, the number of votes \nyou get depends on how many shares you have. It is not one person, one \nvote. It is how many bucks you have invested in the company.'' He said, \n``You don't have the same vote and the same power as everyone else \nbecause it is a corporation. It is properly based--because it is a \ncorporation--on how much money you are able to put into the \ncorporation.'' He said, ``You can go to the stockholders meeting, Russ, \nbut your vote won't count for very much.''\n  Needless to say, that dampened my excitement a little bit, but it \nhelped me understand how a corporation works. The people with the \nlargest stake in the business get the most say in how the business \noperates. That is how it should be. That is how it should be in a \ncorporation. That is the basis of our system.\n  But that is not, Madam President, the way our democracy should work. \nWe are all supposed to have the same opportunity in the democratic \nprocess. Now, some of us may have a larger interest in a particular \npolicy or piece of legislation, but we are all supposed to be vested \nwith an equal share of power in the process by which we appoint people \nto set policy and to vote on legislation.\n  Madam President, the current campaign finance system is fueling the \ntransformation of our representative democracy into a corporate \ndemocracy, creating a political system that allots power in direct \nrelation to the amount of money an individual or an interest group can \ncontribute.\n  Let's not completely ignore those hearings that were held earlier \nlast year by the senior Senator and chairman from Tennessee. Remember \nthe testimony of Roger Tamraz who said not only that he had given \n$300,000 in soft money legally--remember the words of the majority \nleader, ``the problem is only what is illegal''--$300,000, legally to \ngo to a coffee at the White House, but that next time he would do \nbetter. He would get into some serious money and contribute, instead, \n$600,000. He said he felt after his earlier experience that he needed \nto pay that kind of money to participate, to get access, and in his own \nwords, ``to level the playing field'' with his competitors. He felt he \nneeded to pay $600,000 so he could have equal share in the political \nprocess.\n\n  There is a question here of what that means not only for our \npolitical system but what does it mean for our free enterprise system? \nOne of the great ironies for me in serving on both the Judiciary \nCommittee where we work for the most part on domestic laws and then \nworking on the Foreign Relations Committee is that we have an \nopportunity to look at the issue of international bribery.\n  Under American law, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, American \nbusiness men and women are not allowed, under penalty of law and fines \nand imprisonment, to give bribes under that law to foreign companies \nand to foreign countries. But here in America, with a soft money system \nthat is perfectly legal, these same business men and women have become \nthe fall guys of the American political system who are called up and \nasked to give outrageous sums of soft money so they can enter a \nparticular room to apparently be on a ``level playing field'' with \nothers who have been pushed to do the same.\n  Madam President, there has got to be a different vision, a different \nvision than paying for nights in the Lincoln Bedroom or to have coffee \nwith the President or going down to Florida to have lunch with a \ndistinguished leader of the majority party for $50,000 and having him \nstand up and look out at the crowd and say this is the ``American \nway.''\n  In case anyone thinks that the motive of the people who give these \nkinds of soft money contributions is simply public spirited or perhaps \nthat we could regard them as a bunch of people who are trying to buy \ninfluence that are constantly being swindled because they are getting \nnothing for it, you can rest assured that these contributions one way \nor another do affect public policy.\n  There have been a number of embarrassing examples. One is the case of \nthe Federal Express Corporation. Another antiunion express carrier \nprovision was inserted in the aviation bill. That provision, Madam \nPresident, had been defeated at every turn, at every opportunity, in \nevery committee, on every floor vote, when it had been attempted, in \nCongress. This provision was supposed to make it more difficult for the \nemployees of the Federal Express Company to organize their union, and \nthe Federal Express Corporation makes no denial about this. In the \nwaning days of the session, the Federal Express Corporation gave each \nparty $100,000 in soft money, and the provision almost within a few \nhours found its way magically into a conference committee report. After \nthis was jammed through the Congress, the very impressive CEO of \nFedEx--who I give credit to for his ingenuity in creating FedEx--came \nto see me and said, ``You people in Washington set this game up this \nway and I\n\n[[Page S821]]\n\nwill play it and I will play it hard as long as that is the way it is \nset up.'' I can't fault him for that. That is the way the system is set \nup.\n  Madam President, I think you know, as they say, the rest of the \nstory. We had a UPS strike, and while that strike went on, while the \nunionized company was in a very difficult position and difficult \nnegotiations, the FedEx Corporation obtained a 10 to 15 percent share \nof the business that used to go to UPS. That is a very good return for \nonly $200,000 of soft money.\n  The 1996 Telecommunications Act covered a huge field from cable to \ncellular service to long distance. There was massive lobbying involved. \nIt was the biggest overhaul of our communications law since 1934, and a \nCenter for Responsive Politics analysis showed that cable companies, \nlocal telephone companies, and long distance companies gave more than \n$12 million in soft money and PAC contributions just during the 1996 \nelection cycle.\n  When the bill finally passed in February 1996, all these corporate \nconcerns supported it while consumer groups opposed it. There was very, \nvery little in the way of consumer protections in that bill. Today, \ncable rates continue to go up, and merger mania has hit all parts of \nthe telecommunications industry. We have yet to see any of those \nproconsumer effects of competition that the corporate donors who so \nstrongly supported the bill had promised us at the time.\n  One more example, the B-2 bomber. Apparently, the Department of \nDefense doesn't really want the B-2 bomber anymore. There are questions \nabout its effectiveness, including the possibility that it may not work \nvery well when it gets wet. Yet the Congress added this past year $331 \nmillion in this year's bill to keep it going.\n  Northrup Grumman made $877,000 in PAC contributions and soft money \ncontributions during that 1996 election. Its PAC gave $84,500 to House \nMembers from January 1 to May 31, 1997.\n  There are other examples. There are many examples, but these are \nexamples I have had a chance to witness in the last couple of years and \nthey concern me. Lobbyists and other representatives have gotten the \nmessages that some members expect contributions from lobbyists if they \nwant to be heard. Some rely on the stick, saying ``put up or shut up.'' \nOthers hold out a carrot, such as those who would write a letter to \npeople inviting them, if they contribute a certain amount of money, to \nsort of a club atmosphere where they have been promised the rewards of \n``leadership, friendship, effectiveness and exclusivity'' in return for \na contribution.\n\n  In other words, our democracy has become a huge bazaar for very \npowerful traders. It is bizarre to watch it played out in the middle of \nour country's great symbol of democracy. Some of us are willing to \nfight for reform as long as it takes. Some say this is nothing more \nthan a couple of Senators pretending to be like Sisyphus, pushing a \nrock up a hill.\n  But many issues take time. Tax reform has to be done over and over \nagain to make it work. The post-Watergate reforms were difficult to get \nthrough but the fact is they worked pretty well for quite a few years. \nIt has been 24 years since Watergate. Thomas Jefferson said there \nshould be a revolution in America every 20 years. That is not such a \nterrible statement on our system if we have to fix our campaign finance \nlaws every 20 years or less.\n  Madam President, this is the third year in a row we have made this \neffort and we will keep fighting for this until we give the American \npeople a campaign finance system that does not turn them away from \nparticipating, it doesn't turn them off on participating in our great \ndemocracy.\n  I can't really talk about this issue without paying tribute to my \nsenior partner in this effort, the senior Senator from Arizona, who is \nreally the courageous one here. I am the one who is in the minority. It \ntakes a lot more courage to buck this system for a member of the \nmajority. He initiated our relationship for working together on many \nreform issues and I am grateful to him for having allowed me the chance \nto work with him on this issue.\n  When we got to the point of campaign finance reform after having \nsuccessfully passed the gift ban and a number of other efforts, it \nbecame pretty clear this would be the hardest of all, changing this \naddiction to money in this town would be the hardest of all. So our \nbill has gone through several transformations due to political \nnecessity, but it remains a strong and unique bipartisan compromise. It \nis not the Feingold bill. I tried the Feingold bill and got no \ncosponsors. That is a good bill, but it involves public financing, and \nthere isn't majority support for that approach.\n  This was an exercise, instead, in seeing if people of different \nphilosophies could come together and put together the first bipartisan \neffort of its kind in 11 years. McCain-Feingold in the form presented \nas an amendment at the next procedural point has several key \ncomponents. It simply bans these unregulated soft money contributions, \nthese huge contributions that are primarily funneled to the political \nparties. This is the piece President Clinton focused on correctly and \nrightly in his State of the Union Address. He said if you vote for \nMcCain-Feingold you are voting against soft money; if you don't, you \nare supporting the current system.\n  In our bill, we have the beginning of mechanisms to try to encourage \npeople to voluntarily limit how much they spend, at least of their own \npersonal wealth, in the base bill. We also require much greater and \nmore immediate disclosure of campaign contributions, electronic filing, \ndaily filing of campaign contributions, and a prohibition on accepting \ncontributions from people who have not disclosed their profession.\n  We heard a lot of opponents of our bill in the last debate talk about \nthe need for prompt and complete disclosure. Madam President, that is \nexactly what we have in our bill, the strongest disclosure provisions \nto date. We also strengthen the FEC's enforcement powers, and we \nclarify and strengthen the ban on raising money on Federal property and \non foreign contributions to elections. Now the current McCain-Feingold \nbill doesn't do everything that I would like to do on campaign finance \nreform. I don't think it even does everything that the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona wants to do. And so if we do have the opportunity as the \ndebate goes on, we will offer the McCain-Feingold challenger amendment.\n\n  Our amendment would ask Senate candidates to voluntarily limit their \noverall spending by getting most of their campaign contributions from \ntheir own home State, limiting their PAC fundraising and restricting \ntheir spending from their own personal wealth. In return, they would \nreceive the benefit of reduced-cost television time. So we hope to get \nto that point, and we are optimistic.\n  We expected fierce opposition to our bill in the past, and we got it. \nWe knew from experience that many Members of the Senate are comfortable \nwith the current campaign finance system and they don't want to change \nit.\n  We tried this in 1996 before people really got a good, clean look at \nthis system, and we didn't get terribly far. When we failed to break a \nfilibuster in 1996, the Senator from Arizona turned to me and said, \n``This thing is going to take a scandal.'' I said, ``John, you're too \npessimistic, we'll get it through.'' Well, he was right and I was \nwrong.\n  But we got a scandal. In 1997, we moved this issue much further. \nAfter the hearings conducted by the senior Senator from Tennessee and \nthe revelation of many of the things that went on, we got 53 votes on \nthe floor of the Senate; but we still faced a filibuster and a series \nof arguments that, in my view, can't withstand scrutiny.\n  I see that the Senator from Tennessee has entered the Chamber as \nwell, and the Senator from Kentucky has risen to speak. At this point I \nwill yield the floor and I will complete my remarks at another point.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The measure before us today is the Paycheck Protection \nAct, authored by the distinguished majority leader and the assistant \nmajority leader. The Paycheck Protection Act is predicated on a \nfundamental tenet of any truly free society--that no person should be \nforced to support a cause or a candidate.\n  It is really quite that simple. Thomas Jefferson, perhaps, best \nenunciated this\n\n[[Page S822]]\n\nprinciple with a characteristic eloquence that we will likely hear \noften during the course of this debate, and it certainly merits \nrepetition.\n  Mr. Jefferson observed:\n\n       To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the \n     propagation of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and \n     tyrannical.\n\n  Sinful and tyrannical as it is, union bosses do it every day. \nMillions of Americans are on the receiving end of this tyranny as a \nportion of their paychecks are confiscated and used to advance a \npolitical agenda with which many of them disagree. That fact, Mr. \nPresident, should not be in dispute.\n  Ten years have passed since the Supreme Court's Beck decision in \nwhich the Court ruled that workers who are forced to pay union dues as \na condition of employment cannot be forced to pay dues beyond those \nnecessary for collective bargaining. Yet, most union workers still have \nno relief. Their unions provide them with little or no information of \ntheir rights.\n  A national survey last year revealed that most union workers are not \neven aware of their rights under the Beck decision. Even more \ndeplorable, many union workers' efforts to exercise their \nconstitutional rights under Beck have been met with intimidation and \nwith stonewalling. In a telling illustration, a union worker testified \nbefore Congress in 1997, just last year, that ``almost immediately the \nlies started: anti-union, scab, freeloader, and religious fanatic were \nlabels ascribed to me,'' said a union member. That poor fellow had to \nresort to a lawsuit to get his union dues reduced in accordance with \nBeck.\n  The onus, Mr. President, should not be on the workers. It should not \nbe the workers' burden to pursue an after-the-fact refund or to wait \nuntil the end of the year and have to jump through hoops to get \nreturned to him or her money that should not have been taken in the \nfirst place.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle are understandably alarmed \nat the prospect of their most powerful, aggressive and well-funded ally \nlosing a significant portion of the political war chest after workers \nare freed from the compulsory dues tyranny.\n  Mr. President, we know what happens. Washington State voters, back in \n1992, by an overwhelming margin--70 percent, by the way, supported \nthis--approved a referendum to make it illegal for unions to extract \ndues for political purposes without obtaining prior written approval \nfrom union workers. After this emancipation, only 82 of Washington \nState's public employee union members gave the union permission to take \ntheir money for political purposes. Prior to the voters' action, 40,000 \nWashington State employees had been forced to stand by helplessly as a \nchunk of their paychecks were confiscated and used without their \nconsent to advance the political causes of the union bosses.\n  The number of Washington State teachers union members contributing \neven a modest dollar amount to the union bosses' political fund dropped \nfrom 48,000 down to 8,000. Now, all politicians who benefited from the \nunion largess, a largess born of forced contributions, intimidation, \nand a conspiracy of silence, will understandably tremble at the \nprospect of losing it.\n  For them, the sounds of paycheck protection roaring down the \nlegislative tracks must be terrifying indeed. Nationwide, over 80 \npercent of the American people support a Federal Paycheck Protection \nAct.\n  But I am certainly not so naive as to think union workers will see \nthis freedom coming out of Washington, DC, because President Clinton \nwould surely veto it. The union bosses have been so generous to the \nClinton-Gore campaigns over the years that the Lincoln Bedroom probably \nfeels like home.\n  Fortunately for America's union workers, they may well see relief in \nthose States with the referendum process or political leaders less \nbeholden to union bosses than is the President of the United States.\n  So, Mr. President, there is a lot of action out in the States. \nProponents of paycheck protection are heartened by the reception they \nare getting out in the States. It will be on the ballot in California \nthis June. Californians will have an opportunity to strike a blow for \nfreedom for union workers. Freedom's prospects are quite bright there.\n  But the union bosses will resist this freedom for the rank and file. \nThe union bosses will fight it with everything at their disposal, \nincluding the hundreds of millions of dollars they have amassed for \npolitical use from the workers' dues. It is expected that union bosses \nwill spend $20 million or more in California in their quest to defeat \nthis freedom quest for the rank and file.\n  I am confident that Californians will not be duped by the union \nbosses and their millions. Paycheck protection rings true to regular \nfolks and not even the most sophisticated, well-funded smear campaign \nwill drown it out.\n  There is going to be paycheck protection referenda in other States as \nwell, Mr. President. I think there are four or five that are going to \nbe on the ballot this year. There are movements all across America in \nState legislatures to press forward with bills giving union members \nthese basic, fundamental rights. So to have this kind of measure \ndescribed as a ``poison pill'' is amusing indeed.\n  It is fundamental, Mr. President, that no one in this country ought \nto be forced to contribute to causes with which they might disagree. So \nwe will press forward with this issue and hope for the best. But it \nwill go forward on a State-by-State basis regardless of what happens \nhere in Washington.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me just make a few more observations. I see \nthat my friend from Tennessee is here, and I won't delay him too long. \nI do want to make some observations about the larger question of \nMcCain-Feingold. The whole motive behind this reform agenda for the \nlast 22 years has been a disappointment, Mr. President, in the Supreme \nCourt decision of Buckley v. Valeo, which was, of course, a great \nvictory for the American people. The Court said in the Buckley case \nthat spending is speech. When you first hear that, you sort of scratch \nyour head and say, ``Gee, could that be true?'' But when you think \nabout it and when you read the decision, it is obviously the case that \nin a country of 270 million people, unless you can amplify your voice, \nyou don't have much speech. Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw and Peter \nJennings have a lot of speech--way more than any of us--because their \nspeech is amplified every night to millions of Americans. But the Court \nsaid to put Americans in a straitjacket of spending limits is to say \nthat they are left only with inadequate speech--in other words, a kind \nof continuing effort to go door-to-door, I guess, to carry your message \nto more and more Americans.\n\n  In fact, the Court said a spending limit would be about like saying \nyou are free to travel, but you can only have $100. How free are you? \nYou are not very free if you can't amplify your voice. The Court said \nyou are going to have a constitutional first amendment right to amplify \nyour voice, either with your own resources or that of others gathered \ntogether in a common purpose to advance a particular cause. The cause \ncould be speaking for a candidate, or against a candidate, or \nadvocating an issue, or opposing an issue.\n  In fact, the whole Court case was crafted in the direction of a wide \namount of permissible political discourse in this country. Well, the \nreformers hated that decision, and they have been coming back and \ncoming back and coming back over the years, and it has had different \nnames in different Congresses. A few years ago it was Boren-Mitchell. \nNow it is McCain-Feingold. But, fundamentally, the philosophy is the \nsame: What is wrong with the system is that we just don't have enough \nregulation. We just don't have enough restraint on the voices of all of \nthese Americans who are running around expressing themselves, and we \ndon't like it.\n  So McCain-Feingold has been constantly changing, and the version we \ncurrently have before us is a little bit different from earlier \nversions. The original version sought to put the Government in charge \nof the political speech of individuals, groups, candidates, and \nparties. The current version, which is the same version that was \ndefeated in October, seeks to put the Government in charge of the \npolitical speech of parties and groups, leaving aside individuals and \nleaving aside candidates.\n  So let me focus just a minute, Mr. President, on the kind of speech \nthat parties and groups engage in. It is said that, because of the \nscandals of 1996, we should take away from the political\n\n[[Page S823]]\n\nparties their ability to function in State and local races. It's called \ngetting rid of soft money. What happened in 1996, Mr. President? As the \ndistinguished majority leader pointed out, and as Senator Thompson's \nhearings have confirmed, we had arguable violations of existing laws; \nthat is, contributions from foreigners, money laundering, and raising \nmoney on Federal property. All of that is against the law now. What \nthat cries out for is enforcement of the law.\n  This bill--McCain-Feingold--doesn't have anything to do with the \nscandals of 1996. It is a totally different subject. This bill is \nseeking to restrain, to inhibit, to diminish the voices of American \ncitizens in their effort to participate in the political process \nthrough their political parties, or through groups they may belong to.\n  Now, the courts have had a good deal to say about that, Mr. \nPresident. Let me start with the groups. The courts have said that a \ngroup or, for that matter, an individual can go out and engage in \nwhat's called issue advocacy, without having to ask permission from the \nFederal Government, without having to register with the Federal \nElection Commission, or subject itself to the rules that apply to \ncandidates and to parties in Federal elections. The Court has said that \nas long as you don't say ``vote for'' or ``vote against,'' you are \npermitted wide latitude to applaud, condemn, say whatever you want to \nin the American political process.\n  There has been a whole line of cases on the question of issue \nadvocacy. The Federal Election Commission doesn't like the law on issue \nadvocacy. It has been pursuing groups over the years and it has lost \nevery single case. In fact, the last case the FEC lost was in the \nFourth Circuit, and they not only lost the case, but were required to \npay the lawyer's fees of the other side because the FEC just didn't get \nit. They couldn't read the law.\n  It is very clear. We don't have the authority here in the Congress to \nkeep people from criticizing us. We don't like it. We love to be able \nto control the entire election. But we don't own the election. The \nelection is not the property of the candidates, and if people want to \ncriticize us early or late, the courts are not going to allow us to \ninterfere with that.\n  One of the mutations of this that is developing that we have heard \nabout and read about may be offered by the senior Senator from Maine, \nSenator Snowe.\n  I gather, in addition to trying to change the rules on issue \nadvocacy, that it would also, in proximity to the election, require the \ngroup to disclose.\n  Mr. President, the courts have already spoken on that issue. They \nspoke on it as early as 1958 on the question of whether you could \nrequire a group to disclose their sources of funds or their membership \nlists as a condition for criticism. In the case of the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP v. Alabama in \n1958, the court made it very, very clear that it is a real threat to \ncitizens' groups and to their right to band together and express \nthemselves to require them as a condition for expressing themselves \nthat they disclose their membership.\n  The court said in that case, ``Compelled disclosure of membership in \nan organization engaged in advocacy of particular beliefs'' . . . is \ninappropriate. ``Inviolability of privacy in group association may in \nmany circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of \nassociation, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.''\n  The court went on to say:\n\n       We think it apparent that compelled disclosure of \n     petitioner's Alabama membership is likely to affect adversely \n     the ability of petitioner and [*463] its members to pursue \n     their collective effort to foster beliefs which they \n     admittedly have the right to advocate, in that it may induce \n     members to withdraw from the Association and dissuade others \n     from joining it because of fear of exposure of their beliefs \n     shown through their associations and of the consequences of \n     this exposure.\n\n  In other words, Mr. President, there will probably be another effort \nhere to shut down issue advocacy. Members may argue that we are not \nreally telling them they can't speak; we are just saying they have to \ndisclose if they speak. The courts have already said you can't do that; \nyou can't require people to disclose their membership as a precondition \nfor expressing their beliefs.\n  So it gets back to the fundamental point: We don't own these \nelections. Most of us do not like it when some group comes in. Even if \nthey are trying to help us, we usually think they are botching it. We \nhate all of these voices that are outside of our campaigns and outside \nof our control. But that is the price you pay for free speech in a \ndemocracy--that is the price you pay for free speech in a democracy.\n  So all of these efforts to try to shut these groups up by forcing \nthem to come under the Federal Election Commission, by forcing them \ninto the hard money camp, by trying to make it difficult for them to \nexpress themselves in proximity to an election, there is no court in \nAmerica that would uphold that. It is so clearly and blatantly \nunconstitutional that we ought not to do it.\n  The other entity that the most recent version of McCain-Feingold \nseeks to shut up are our great political parties. Soft money has become \na pejorative term. Let me define it: Soft money is everything that \nisn't hard money. Hard money, by definition, is money raised and spent \nin support of Federal candidates. But, as we know, Mr. President, this \nis a Federal system. The two great national parties--the Democratic \nNational Committee and the Republican National Committee--care who gets \nelected Governor of Tennessee and who controls the legislature in \nTennessee. They may even care who gets to be mayor of Knoxville. They \nhave at times even cared who the county commissioner was going to be in \nwhatever county Knoxville is in. These are national parties. The only \nway you could eliminate non-Federal money by definition is to \nfederalize everything. So that the Federal Election Commission would \nthen be in charge of the city council races in Nashville.\n  That is a great step in the right direction--just what we need. The \nFEC would be the size of the Pentagon with reams of files in every race \nin America.\n  The second problem with eliminating non-Federal money is a practical \nproblem. As I have already indicated, you will not be able to \nconstitutionally eliminate issue advocacy from the American political \nscene. It cannot be done. If we tried to do that, it would be struck \ndown. Maybe. We don't know. Some court could uphold an effort to \neliminate so-called soft money for the national parties. I don't know. \nI doubt it.\n  But let's assume they would uphold it. Then, Mr. President, the \nsituation would be this: The two great political parties, which exist \nonly for the purpose of electing candidates, would be the only entities \nin America that could not engage in issue advocacy. Everybody else \ncan--from the AFL-CIO to the Sierra Club to the Chamber of Commerce. \nOnly political parties wouldn't be able to engage in issue advocacy.\n  So the candidates of those parties would be defenseless when groups \nhostile or individuals hostile to candidates of their parties came in \nand engaged in issue advocacy, particularly in proximity to an \nelection. So the parties which exist for no other purpose other than to \nelect candidates would be restricted in engaging in issue advocacy \npresumably in defense of the candidates who wore their party label--a \nperfectly absurd result, Mr. President; a perfectly absurd and \nundesirable result of a quest to end non-Federal money.\n  Mr. President, fortunately, the Senate is not going to take that \nstep. There is not a consensus for any of these so-called reforms. \nFortunately, there is strong support for the first amendment.\n  I am glad that our friends in the press believe in the first \namendment. They are the practitioners of the first amendment. They have \nfrom time to time believed that it only applied to them, which I have \nalways found somewhat amusing.\n  I started last year asking reporters with whom I discuss this issue \nwhether they have read Buckley. At the beginning of 1997 almost no one \nhad. I am pleased to report that it got better. More and more reporters \nsat down and struggled their way through the Buckley case, and, all of \na sudden, eyes popped open and they began to realize that the first \namendment was not the sole prerogative--or property, shall I\n\n[[Page S824]]\n\nsay--of the fourth estate. It exists for all of us.\n  I have been perplexed, frankly, at the editorial support around the \ncountry for McCain-Feingold. The ACLU has been perplexed, too. I will \njust read a few observations from a letter of December 29 that they \nsent out to editorial boards around the country.\n  The ACLU said:\n\n       We're perplexed. As Washington prepares for another round \n     of campaign finance debate, we are deeply puzzled about why \n     so many--particularly in the media--continue to support \n     campaign finance legislation like the McCain-Feingold bill \n     that is patently unconstitutional, unlikely to pass and \n     doomed to failure in the courts.\n       Frankly, we're also worried. Polls are beginning to suggest \n     that the media's cavalier disregard for the free speech \n     implications of current campaign finance proposals is \n     encouraging an attitude among the public that could lead to \n     serious damage to freedom of the press. A recent Rasmussen \n     Research survey, for example, found that Americans believe \n     that one of the best ways to clean up campaigns is to \n     restrict newspaper coverage of elections.\n\n  Mr. President, I am not advocating that. But imagine the Washington \nPost calling for spending limits. It makes about as much sense as the \nCongress saying to the media, ``You are free to say whatever you want \nto but, by the way, your circulation is limited.'' And I wonder how the \nWashington Post would feel if the Congress decided it could only have a \n5,000 circulation--not saying that Congress can have any impact on what \nthe Washington Post can say--but that we just think the Post is \nspeaking to too broad an audience, and it is spending too much. \nObviously, I am being facetious. But it is the same principle. It is \nthe very same principle.\n  Advocates of spending limits say we are not telling you what to do; \nwe just think you are saying it too much or too many, but your audience \nis too widespread. We may all snicker about this issue. But, frankly, \nthe public has a lot of skepticism about the press.\n  I am looking at an article by Richard Harwood in the Washington Post \nfrom last October referring to a study of public opinion commissioned \nin 1990 by the American Society of Newspaper Editors. It is part of the \nobservance of the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights. Dick Harwood \npoints out that a Lou Harris survey for that group more recently had \nsome, as he put it, ``depressing findings.'' This is Harwood's \nobservation about the Lou Harris poll of the American people. He said:\n\n       If they had their way, ``the people''--meaning a majority \n     of adults--would not allow journalists to practice their \n     trade without first obtaining, as lawyers and doctors must \n     license. Whether the preferred licensing authority would be \n     the government or some other credentialing agency is not \n     clear.\n  That was the majority view of the American public with regard to the \nlicensing of the media.\n  Number two, referring to the survey:\n       They would confer on judges the power to impose fines on \n     publishers and broadcasters for ``inaccurate and biased \n     reporting'' and would liberalize libel laws to make it easier \n     for plaintiffs to win judgments against the press.\n\n  This is the majority view of the American people now. Third:\n\n       They would empower government entities to monitor the work \n     of journalists for fairness and compel us to ``give equal \n     coverage to all sides of a controversial issue.'' They also \n     favor the creation of local and national news councils to \n     investigate complaints against the press and issue \n     corrections'' of erroneous news reports.\n\n  That is the view of the American public, Mr. President.\n  Also, from this Rasmussen Research study, that I referred to earlier, \nthere is a release from this institute of October 2, 1997, which has an \ninteresting finding. It says:\n\n       Most Americans think that friendly reporters are more \n     important to a successful political campaign than money, \n     according to a Rasmussen Research survey of 1,000 adults. By \n     a 3-to-1 margin (61% to 19%) Americans believe that if \n     reporters like one candidate more than another, that \n     candidate is likely to win--even if the other candidate \n     raised more money in the campaign.\n\n  Further:\n\n       Americans are also generally suspicious of reporters. More \n     than seven-out-of-ten registered voters believe that the \n     personal biases of reporters affect their coverage of \n     stories, issues, and campaigns.\n\n  I cite this somewhat tongue and cheek to make the point that the \nfirst amendment applies to all of us. Just because the American public \nis skeptical of the press and its motivations doesn't mean that we want \nto restrict the press. By the same token, Mr. President, it is \nastonishing to find so many editorial boards around the country that do \nnot understand that the first amendment doesn't just apply to the \npress. It applies to all of us.\n  So, Mr. President, when all is said and done and this debate is \nended, the Constitution will still be intact and the ability of \nindividuals, groups, candidates, and parties who participate in the \nAmerican political process without regulation or interference by the \nGovernment will be preserved.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to allow a member of my staff, \nMelissa Figge, to have privileges of the floor during the duration of \nthis debate on campaign finance reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, during a 3-month period, the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee saw examples of clear violations of the law--money \nlaundering, foreign campaign contributions, violations of the Hatch \nAct, possible sale of influence. These are simple, flat-out legal \nviolations which require little debate or delay in terms of prosecuting \nthe appropriate individuals. There has been considerable delay, \nhowever, but at least we now see three indictments and the request for \none special council coming totally or in part from our committee \nactivities. One would assume that several more are imminent, judging \nfrom the record laid out before our committee.\n  There is another category of matters which up until 1996 were also \nconsidered to be violations of the law by most people--using the White \nHouse for fundraising purposes, a Presidential candidate actually \ncontrolling the expenditure of millions of dollars of soft money for TV \nads containing electioneering messages placed specifically to advance \nhis reelection prospects.\n  I say ``considered to be violations until recently'' because the \nAttorney General and Justice Department apparently now take the \nposition that these activities are legal for the final time. Although I \nbelieve that these are erroneous interpretations of the law, supported \nby neither the law or logic, the result is to give new arguments to \nthose who would seek to circumvent the clear intent of the law. This \nalong with court decisions, Federal Election Commission interpretations \nof the law, and piecemeal Congressional amendments has resulted in a \ncampaign finance system that is in shambles. The loopholes are now \nbigger than the law and there are now effectively no limits on big \ncorporate, big labor, big individual monies flowing into our political \ncampaigns--a situation that Congress has said we do not want for almost \na hundred years.\n  And if people think the 1996 campaign set new records for the big \nmoney scramble, they only have to wait until the next election cycle, \nand especially the next Presidential race. At least the last time there \nwas some concern among the candidates, and even the Clinton-Gore \ncampaign, as to how far they could go in pushing the limits. Now that \neveryone has seen that the Justice Department is apparently willing to \nbless the most egregious of this activity and refuse to request the \nappointment of an independent counsel for what the Courts and FEC \nconsider to be illegal activity, there will be no such hesitancy next \ntime.\n  And the Clinton-Gore example will be picked up and followed in the \nSenate and House races, one can only assume. Under the Attorney \nGeneral's interpretation, I can see nothing wrong with a Congressional \ncandidate raising unlimited amounts of soft money for use in TV ads \npraising the candidate or denigrating his opponent, so long as the ads \ndo not contain the magic words of ``vote for'' or ``vote against'' a \nparticular candidate.\n  Congress must decide whether or not we are going to pass on this \npatchwork, swiss cheese system, which goes against the clear intent of \nCongress the last time they addressed these issues. If so then the \nimplicit message will be\n\n[[Page S825]]\n\nthat we are no longer concerned about the appearance of corruption; \nthat we think that millions of dollars from companies, unions and \nindividuals who are trying to get us to pass legislation is okay with \nthe American people. I don't think it is and I don't think that is what \nwe want to say.\n\n  The McCain-Feingold bill addresses the worst of these problems. Also, \nmany of my colleagues have amendments which would greatly improve our \ncurrent situation, although they may never see the light of day.\n  However, I would urge that we don't get so caught up in the details \nof a particular piece of legislation that we are oblivious to the fact \nthat we are going to have to comprehensively address money in our \npolitical system eventually. We haven't really done it in 20 years and \nit shows. In many other areas we see that after a period of time laws \nthat have been passed have resulted in unintended consequences, and \nthere are court decisions and there are administrative rulings to point \nout weaknesses in the legislation and sometimes they go contrary to \ncongressional intent and we conclude that we need to address the law \nagain. That is clearly what we are going to have to do with regard to \ncampaign finance legislation.\n  It's important for us to understand how we got to where we are today. \nIn 1907, Congress banned corporate contributions. In 1943, Congress \nbanned labor union contributions. Congress comprehensively addressed \nhow we finance our federal political campaigns in 1972 and 1974. Again, \nCongress was specifically concerned with the extent to which \ncorporations, union, and individuals should be allowed to contribute to \npolitical candidates. Individuals were limited to $1,000 per election \nand limited to $25,000 in total annual contributions--$20,000 of this \ncould go to party committees. Corporations and labor unions were \nstrictly forbidden involvement in the federal campaign process, outside \nof $20,000 per election per candidate political action committee \ncontributions. The underlying justification for allowing political \naction committees was to provide a mechanism to facilitate voluntary \ncontributions from individual union members, corporate stockholders, \nand their administrative personnel.\n  In 1972 and 1974 limitations were placed on expenditures but all of \nthem were either repealed or deemed unconstitutional with the Buckley \nversus Valeo decision in 1976, except for the restrictions on party \ncommittees and publicly funded Presidential candidates. And the \ncontribution limits were upheld. So we have been talking about Buckley \nv. Valeo. The Senator from Kentucky rightly pointed out that in Buckley \nthe Court struck down most of the limits on expenditures. The Court did \nnot strike down the limits on contributions because the Court \nrecognized that, historically, governments of all kinds have been \nconcerned with the amounts of big money that could be given to \npoliticians who were in charge of public policy. And, as I said, \nCongress has been concerned about that since 1907. This is not a new \nconcern or a new issue.\n\n  Also, Congress eliminated private contributions to Presidential \ngeneral election campaigns altogether for those who opted into the \nPresidential public financing program that was established. So for the \nlast 25 years or so, Presidential nominees, who were willing to certify \nthat they would not raise and spend additional funds, were given \nmillions of dollars of tax payers money to fund their campaigns. That \nhas been our system. Again, as with the idea of limiting corporate, \nunion, and large individual contributions, the idea was to cut down on \nthe corrupting influence or appearance of corruption of large sums of \nprivate money being given to Presidential candidates, or maybe \nPresidents who were already in office. Congress also believed this \nlegislation would have the added benefit of pulling presidential \ncandidates out of the fundraising chase, and instead allow them time to \nfocus on issues and not so much on the money behind factions supporting \nthose issues. So, for a long time, Mr. President--we talk about the \nGovernment being in charge and we don't want to put the Government in \ncharge--for a long time in this country, many Members of this same body \nand many Members from both sides of the political spectrum, enough to \nget these laws passed for almost a century, the Government has been \ninvolved. I am not a big one for having the Government involved in a \nlot of things, but many of us have come to the conclusion that how we \nelect our Federal officers, how we elect our Federal officials, is one \nof those things that is legitimately the business of the Federal \nGovernment. And the Federal Government, and this Congress, has passed \non specific contribution limitations in times past because of this \nnotion that we need to kind of watch that carefully, because if you go \nout here in the private world and you see people in positions of \ndecisionmaking receiving money from the people whom they are making the \ndecision with regard to, that could be a problem. It is just kind of \nbasic common sense. And the idea that the Government has kind of been \noblivious to this and not involved in this for some time is really an \ninvalid concept.\n\n  For 25 years, the system that I have just described has worked pretty \nwell. There hasn't been a major Presidential scandal. People talk about \npublic financing. We are clearly not talking about public financing \nhere. But on the Presidential level, many people may not realize it but \nwe have had public financing for a long time, and it has been scandal \nfree. It has operated about as well for incumbents as it has \nchallengers. It has been more of a level playing field, people have \nopted into it, and it has worked pretty well. All the TV advertisements \nwere paid for within this system. With all of this money that was \nraised within this system, with these limitations placed on them, \npeople managed to buy television ads and have pretty decent television \ncampaigns--with this money, we call it hard money now, but the money \nwithin the system that was carefully thought out and allowed to be \ngiven to those of us in political office--because they were reasonable \namounts and it didn't feel like they were large enough to have any \ninfluence on us, is what it boils down to.\n  However, things began to happen in the 1970s, with later more \nsignificant developments in the 1990s, that have totally transformed \nthat system that Congress set up.\n  There was concern in Congress, for example, that there be adequate \nfunding for grassroots political activities. We are all concerned about \nthat. So, in the late 1970's, Congress amended the campaign laws and \nthe FEC interpreted those amendments to allow national parties to send \nunlimited amounts, but for voter registration, voter turnout, and so \nforth, without these moneys counting against the limitations placed on \nparty expenditures. Buckley, by the way, said that you could place \nlimitations on party expenditures. That was one of the expenditure \nareas that Buckley said it was right and proper for Congress to place \nlimitations on. We have limitations on party expenditures today.\n  Congress and the FEC also allowed part of these expenditures to be \nfunded with money that might be referred to as ``outside the system''--\noutside the system that we have just been discussing, the $1,000/$5,000 \nlimitation system that we have just been discussing. We now call this \nother money outside the system soft money--unlimited moneys; no \nlimitation on these moneys from corporations, labor unions, \nindividuals.\n  In 1991, now, moving along, the FEC--this is the Federal Election \nCommission, as we all know--decided that national parties could fund 35 \npercent of their generic voter-drive cost from soft money and 40 \npercent in an election year. So, now the soft money race was on. So \nnow, we see, we were concerned about local grassroots participation. We \nlet the parties send in more unlimited money for that purpose. Then we \nsaid OK, we can send some soft money in that you don't have to worry \nabout limitations on, for that particular purpose. So the soft money \ndrive was on and the public learned, in 1992, that the major party \ncommittees raised more than $83 million in soft money, which was 4 \ntimes the amount of soft money estimated to have been spent by the \nparties in 1984.\n  In 1996 the explosion in soft money continued. Soft money receipts by \nthe Republican National Party committees increased 178 percent over \n1992, to $138 million; while Democratic Party committee receipts of \nsoft money increased 242 percent over 1992 levels to $123 million. It \nis almost enough to make you\n\n[[Page S826]]\n\nlong for the good old days back when many people were concerned about \n$5,000 PAC contributions. PACs were considered to be our greatest \npotential problem, not too long ago by many people.\n  So, naturally with all this new money on hand there was a tremendous \ndesire by people in the political system to marry up that money with \nthe largest expenditure that we were all beginning to incur at that \ntime, and of course that's television advertising. So, in the summer of \n1995, Dick Morris fervently believed television advertisements \ncomparing the President with the Republican Congress were keys to the \nPresident's reelection. He encouraged the President to opt out of the \npublic financing program in order to run expensive TV ads that he felt \nwere absolutely necessary. Because he understood at the time, under the \npublic system, if you took the public money but you couldn't go out \nhere and raise all this money on the side, all this soft money to run \nthese additional programs--he said, ``Mr. President, I wish you just \nwouldn't take the public money so we can have unlimited expenditures.'' \nThe President decided to take the money and figure out a way to get the \nunlimited expenditures anyway. He told Mr. Morris to come back with \nplan B.\n  So, luckily for Mr. Morris, plan B was outlined for him in an \nadvisory opinion, once again issued by the FEC. We talk about not \nputting the Government in this. The Government has been in this up to \nits eyebrows almost from the very beginning. Congress has been involved \nin it. Congress set up the Federal Election Commission. The Federal \nElection Commission comes with all these advisory opinions. They said \nyou can use so much soft money for this, so much hard money for that, \nso many percentages for this purpose, so many percentages for the other \npurpose--that is the system we have now. The campaign finance reform \nbill would almost be a deregulation bill. This is not adding additional \nregulations on top of anything. This is doing away with some of this \nRube Goldberg system that we have now.\n  So, continuing on with this pattern, the FEC comes in again and, in \nAugust of 1995, they issued an opinion and, despite an attempt to use \ncareful language, the clear result of this advisory opinion was to \nplace the FEC stamp of approval for the first time on the use of soft \nmoney by national party committees to pay for broadcast media \nadvertisements that directly reference Federal candidates. So, by \nlumping this candidate-specific but issue-based TV advertising with \ngrassroots activity which, as we discussed a moment ago, was encouraged \nby the 1979 amendment, the FEC handed Mr. Morris his plan B on a \nsilver, soft-money platter.\n  The DNC and the Clinton-Gore campaign seized on the opportunity to \nuse the FEC's hard/soft allocation regulations to run TV ads, using the \n40 percent soft money. The first ones began running in October of 1995, \nshortly after this opinion was rendered. And so there we go.\n  However, it is very important to note that the rules still prohibited \nsoft money electioneering messages and coordination between the \ncandidate and the committee.\n  So, in summary, the national party could now spend soft money for a \nportion of its State-based party building, and it could directly spend \nsoft money for a portion of its issue advocacy, or it could transfer \nsoft money to the State parties.\n  Again, this is the system we have today. Does this sound like a \nsimple free-enterprise system that we are trying to somehow improperly \nmess with? This is the hopelessly complex, as we will see in a minute, \nridiculous system that we have allowed to be created under our very \nnoses.\n  However, again, under the FEC rulings and court decisions, it should \nbe noted that none of this soft money was supposed to go for activities \nthat were to be coordinated with individual candidates. Nevertheless, \nby now the system had been haphazardly and without premeditation \ntransformed from one which limited big money for Federal candidates \ninto an attractive opportunity for anyone willing to push the soft \nmoney game to its next level and past what the law allowed.\n  The Clinton-Gore campaign was willing. Briefly stated, their campaign \ncircumvented the DNC's coordinated limit and used approximately $44 \nmillion in national committee soft money to their candidates' advantage \nthrough electioneering messages that they claimed to be ``issue \nadvertisements,'' all the while certifying under our Presidential \nsystem, that they would not spend more than the public funding system \nwas giving them. They were receiving the taxpayer funding all at the \nsame time they were raising the $44 million outside the system.\n  The President and the Vice President personally raised a lot of this \nmoney, putting them right back into the campaign fundraising chase that \nCongress specifically intended the campaign laws to put them above. The \nPresident personally reviewed and edited TV commercial scripts that the \nsoft money went for and helped make the decision as to where the ads \nwould be run. Again, soft money is not permitted to go to support \nindividual candidates, and it is not supposed to be coordinated or \ndirected by those candidates. Nevertheless, the Attorney General, \nthrough her opinion on this matter, permits this abuse, and we can \nfasten our seatbelts for the next elections unless we make some \nchanges.\n  The second large area that was exploited in the 1996 election cycle \nhad to do with the transfer of large amounts of soft money from the \nnational party to the State parties, which in turn would be directed by \nthe national parties as to how to use the funds for national party \npurposes. In other words, the national party is just using the State \nparties as a passthrough.\n  Under FEC rules, the amount of permissible soft money expenditures by \nState parties depends on the ratio of Federal to non-Federal candidates \nthat is on the State's November ballot. For example, if there are two \nFederal races, say a Presidential and a congressional race, and eight \nnon-Federal local races, the State party can pay for 80 percent of \ntheir generic activities with soft dollars.\n  Again, this is the simple, deregulated system that we have today.\n  Given that hard dollars raised in $1,000 increments are more \ndifficult to raise, this gives an incentive to have the State party pay \nfor as many activities as possible using soft money. In other words, \nnow they have a system all contorted so that States can use more soft \nmoney than the Federal can, so you game the Federal system as much as \nyou can through the party committee. The President raises the soft \nmoney, runs it through the DNC and spends the soft money additionally \nto what he is allowed to spend through the public financing. Then you \ngo to the States, and because the States can use more soft money than \nyou can, you run the rest of it through the States and have the States \nrun the same ads that you are running at the Federal level for the same \npurpose, of reelecting the President. Now, that is the system that we \nhave today.\n  So to take advantage of the system, the national party committees \nbegan transferring soft money to State party committees to utilize \ntheir higher soft-money allowance.\n  In the crucial 1995 pre-election year, according to the FEC reports, \nthe DNC transferred almost $11.4 million of soft money to State \nparties, followed by another $6.4 million in the first quarter of 1996. \nThe RNC shifted a little over $2.4 million to the States in about that \nsame period of time. Ultimately, the DNC quietly transferred at least \n$32 million, and perhaps as much as $64 million by some estimates, to \nState Democratic Party committees in the 1996 election cycle. Of \ncourse, much of this money was used for television commercials.\n  This transfer allowed, of course, the State party committees to use \nnational party soft money in areas to help their Federal election goals \nmore than if the national committee had made the expenditures directly. \nThe DNC, on its own, would have had to purchase the same air time under \nthe guidelines requiring a high percentage of hard dollars.\n\n  Our hearings demonstrated that on some occasions, the very same ad \nwould be run by both the national party and the State party, all \ncreated by the DNC Clinton-Gore consultants, Squier, Knapp & Ochs. \nReports of the receipts and expenditures of a dozen State Democratic \nparties from July 1, 1995, to March 31, 1996, indicate the\n\n[[Page S827]]\n\nState entities operated as a little more than passthroughs for the DNC \nto pay for the production and broadcasting of ads by the Squier firm. \nThe Squier firm, of course, was in the White House consulting with the \nPresident, was the paid media consultant for the DNC, for the Clinton-\nGore campaign and, at the same time, was running these ads and creating \nthese ads for these State parties, and, in many cases, they were the \nsame ads. As we see, the DNC and Clinton-Gore campaign found a way to \nuse the big corporate, union and individual soft money they could raise \nfor the direct benefit of their own campaign. They could actually raise \nthe soft money from the DNC, which would, in turn, spend it as they \nwere directed by the Clinton-Gore campaign in order to benefit the \nnational campaign.\n  So it was all an obvious ruse to anybody who took a look at it, but \nit could work in a world where the FEC might take 4 or 5 years to \nimpose a modest fine and where the Attorney General was willing to \nadopt a tortured Clinton-Gore legal defense theory in order to justify \nsuch actions.\n  Of course, labor unions and 501(c)(4) tax-exempt independent groups \nsupporting both parties have kept apace of these new developments. \nThey, too, now systematically run ads supporting or targeting specific \ncandidates while often coordinating their activities with the candidate \nthey support as well as with each other.\n  As with the national parties, they claim the ads they run are ``issue \nads'' and, therefore, can't be regulated. Sometimes they are and \nsometimes maybe they are not. We have to decide that on an individual \nfact-by-fact basis. However, they take the position that, in most \ncases, they are not coordinating factual issues. But if they are \ncoordinated with the candidate, it is considered to be a contribution \nto the candidate, according to Buckley.\n  Buckley has been quoted, of course, as limiting the regulation that \nCongress can place on expenditures, but in the Buckley decision, it \nsays, if you set up a kind of a sham deal where you are supposed to be \nmaking these independent expenditures but you are really doing it at \nthe direction of the candidate, that is not independent and that is \nconsidered a contribution to the candidate. The FEC has, in many cases, \nsupported that proposition.\n  There is nothing in the court cases that would indicate that that is \nproper. In fact, quite the contrary. In fact, the FEC takes the \nposition that even issue ads which are coordinated are illegal. \nNational parties and independent groups seem to be taking the position \nthat, ``We didn't coordinate, but if we did, it may be legal anyway.'' \nBut the DNC and the Clinton-Gore campaign kind of stand alone on that \nissue because their soft-money expenditures were coordinated and \ndirected by the President so openly and clearly and blatantly that they \nhad no choice but to just adopt the idea, in the face of court \ndecisions and in the face of FEC rulings, that it was still legal and \nproper, and the Attorney General has gone along with them on it.\n  As I said, Buckley addressed the problems of would-be contributors \navoiding the contribution limits by the simple expedient of paying \ndirectly for media advertisements for a candidate when the expenditures \nwere controlled by or coordinated with the candidate. Buckley stated--\nand this is a quotation from the much-quoted Buckley--``. . . such \ncontrolled and coordinated expenditures are treated as contributions \nrather than expenditures under the Act's contributions ceilings [And \nthis]. . . prevents attempts to circumvent the Act through prearranged \nor coordinated expenditures amounting to disguised contributions. . . \n.''\n  That is the Buckley decision. But, of course, in the present \nenvironment, it prevents no such thing. Buckley says legally it \nprevents it. Practically we see that it does not.\n  It certainly makes no difference that the person who wants to \npurchase the TV ads runs his contributions through the political \nparties instead of directly. The potential corrupting influence that \npeople have been concerned with for many, many years in this country \nand others is there anyway. Nevertheless, the Attorney General seems to \nhave adopted the Clinton-Gore campaign argument.\n  The Attorney General's position will have many ramifications, Mr. \nPresident. Her position is based on the idea that soft money \ncontributions are not ``contributions'' within the definition of the \nact, and she thinks since soft-money contributions really don't fall \nwithin that definition of contributions, then they are not regulated, \nso that you can have unlimited soft money over here, but we won't call \nthem contributions, so they are not regulated.\n  Well, if that blanket position is true, then foreign soft-money \ncontributions are not illegal either, because they came under the same \ndefinition. If soft-money contributions of any kind are not really \ncontributions as defined by the act, then that is going to apply to \ndomestic or foreign. Under her interpretation, you could have unlimited \namounts of foreign money brought in and put by a political campaign \ninto a soft-money account and used for so-called issue ads, and it \nwould be perfectly legal.\n  These are the things we are going to see in the next election cycle.\n  If Congress does not want to be bound by this absurd interpretation, \nthen we are going to have to act. So, in summary, we see that the 1996 \nelections produced some clear violations of the criminal law, and \nCongress' job in this area is to exercise oversight over the Justice \nDepartment to make sure the laws are enforced. We need no changes in \nthe law with regard to these matters.\n  However, we also see that because of the way in which soft money, \nissue advocacy and coordination are being used and allowed to be used, \nas a practical matter, we are left with no campaign finance system at \nall, and we must decide if that is really what we want.\n  Because all these loopholes have been opened up now, contrary to our \noriginal intent, we find ourselves with a situation where we weren't \nthe ones who opened up the barn door, but all the horses are rapidly \nleaving. Do we want to fix it or do we want to take advantage of it, \nbecause it essentially helps all incumbents, and we go through this \nexercise every so often and get a pretty good vote, but not quite \nenough, and now we can have our cake and eat it, too.\n  If we had come to this floor and passed a piece of legislation that \nallowed the current system, they would have laughed us out of town, and \nnobody here would have had the courage to do it.\n  So the question is whether or not, if we find ourselves with it, we \nare going to take advantage of it because it benefits an incumbent. \nSome would welcome this turn of events. Some honestly believe there is \nnot enough money in our political system and that large corporations, \nunions and others should be allowed to make unlimited contributions to \ncandidates.\n  I believe that those who hold this opinion have won the day so far, \nbecause I think that is exactly where we are now. And I think it is \ntragic, and I believe that those of us in both parties who support such \na system because we think it might be beneficial to us as incumbents in \nsome way are being very shortsighted, because I believe that no system \nthat requires us or allows us as elected officials, including the \nPresident of the United States, to spend so much time raising so much \nmoney from so many people who have interests before us that we are \npassing legislation on, no such system will be allowed to survive \nindefinitely.\n  Where does such a system leave the average citizen with his or her \n$100 contribution? Is there any doubt as to why the more money we raise \nthe fewer people vote?\n  Throughout history, people have recognized the inherent problems \nassociated with large amounts of money going to those who make public \npolicy. It does not require a very smart person to see the inherent \nproblem with that. Nineteen centuries ago, the historian Plutarch \nthought that that was, more than anything else, what brought down the \nRoman Republic. Seven centuries ago, the Venetians imposed strict \nlimitations on what could be given public officials. If the donors had \nfavors to ask, they were not allowed to give anything.\n  Political influence money brought down the entire political systems \nin Japan and Italy. We have had our own money scandals--the corporate \ninfluence-buying scandals at the end of the last century as well as the \nWatergate campaign finance scandal that in large\n\n[[Page S828]]\n\npart caused the legislation of 1974. So we do not have to look very far \nto see the relevant historical precedence of what we are dealing with.\n  It is unlikely that we have recently abridged the laws of human \nnature or the corrupting influence of power or what people are willing \nto do to get it. In fact, that is what the 1996 scandals are all about.\n  When you add all of this history, the fact that we now have spent--\nlast time--$2.7 billion on our national elections, with all this amount \nof money involved, it is a virtual certainty we will have another major \nscandal in the not too distant future if we do nothing.\n  There are some who would try to convince those of us who are somewhat \nnew to these hallowed halls that campaign finance reform is somehow not \nconservative or it is anti-Republican.\n  Well, I believe that the best witness on that is Mr. Republican \nhimself, Barry Goldwater. In testifying before Congress in 1983, he \nsaid that big money ``eats at the heart of the democratic process. It \nfeeds the growth of special interest groups created solely to channel \nmoney into political campaigns. It creates the impression that every \ncandidate is bought and owned by the biggest givers. And it causes \nelected officials to devote more time to raising money than to their \npublic duties. If present trends continue, voter participation will \ndrop significantly''--sound familiar?--``public respect will fall into \nan all-time low''--sound familiar?--``political campaigns will be \ncontrolled by slick packaging artists''--sound familiar?--``and neglect \nof public duties by absentee officials will undermine government \noperations.''\n  Now, that is the man that we call ``Mr. Republican.'' Reading his \n``Conscience of a Conservative'' as a college student had a lot to do \nwith my becoming a Republican. And I do not think anybody ever accused \nBarry Goldwater of being an enemy of the first amendment.\n  I would ask those who are rightfully concerned about maintaining the \nauthority of Congress in our system of checks and balances, those of us \nwho criticize the courts--and I am one of them--and who criticize our \nFederal agencies--and I am one of them--if we really want the way we \nelect the highest officials in our Federal system to be determined not \nby Congress but by the courts, and by the Federal Election Commission, \nand by the Attorney General, and by those running for office who have \nthe most audacity.\n  So while McCain-Feingold may achieve its predicted fate again this \nyear--and maybe not--we need to realize that this overall issue is \ngoing to continue to stare Congress in the face. And as the next \ncampaign makes the last one look like child's play, we are going to \nhave to ultimately decide in this body, is this what we really want? \nAnd since it involves the very fundamentals of our democracy, don't we \nhave an obligation to deal with it?\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Tennessee leaves \nthe floor, I would like to ask him a question and make a comment about \nhis remarks.\n  I believe I heard the Senator from Tennessee predict that there would \nbe more scandals associated with the present system. Did I hear him \nright? And what form will they be in? And how serious?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Absolutely, I would say to my friend from Arizona. \nNobody ever knows for sure what is going to happen, but if the past is \nprologue, we have seen throughout history and in our own recent \nhistory, and certainly in the history of Europe, that when the money \ngets out of hand, the scandals come.\n\n  And we have gone from a system now where we were arguing whether it \nshould be a $1,000 limitation per individual or a little more or little \nless or whether it should be a $5,000 PAC limitation or not, and a big \ncontroversy whether that had a corrupting influence, to where now, \ninstead of soliciting those amounts, we are soliciting $250,000 from \nthese large entities.\n  So if the past has brought those kinds of political problems and \nlegal problems to us, I think we can almost rest assured that in the \nfuture, with those amounts involved, that we will have the same thing.\n  As I said, I do not think that we have abridged the laws of human \nnature over the last few years. And I suppose that Lord Acton's \nadmonition about the corrupting influence of power is still very much \nalive and well and with us.\n  So I say to my friend, I regret to say it, but I know that you \npredicted it would take another one to get anybody's attention on this \nissue. Now we have had one. Your prediction has come true. I am afraid \nthat I am just following up with the next prediction.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask the Senator also, in light of the literally \nthousands of hours that he has spent on this issue in the last year, is \nthere any remaining restraint on campaign contributions? Is there any \nremaining law, rule, or regulation that, if someone is serious enough, \nthat they can inject not as much money as they wish into any political \ncampaign?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. As a practical matter, I think there are no restraints. \nI think under the present situation, with the FEC interpretations that \nhave come down, with the Attorney General decisions and opinions that \nshe has made, I literally think that you could call up someone, if you \nknew someone in Russia or China or Brazil, or wherever you wanted to--\nor California for that matter--get them to send a suitcase full of a \nmillion dollars cash, launder it, if you needed to, put it into a soft \nmoney account, and as long as you used issue ads and did not say ``vote \nfor'' or ``vote against'' under this current ridiculous setup of \ninterpretations we have now, that is permissible. That is the system we \nhave currently.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask my colleague from Tennessee then, if that is \nthe situation, why does he detect a reluctance for our colleagues to \nsupport even, say, full disclosure or the banning of soft money or an \nabolition of the most obvious abuses that you so well described in your \nremarks?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Well, I do not want to delve too deeply into the \nmotivations of anyone. People can have different reasons for their \nthoughts. But it does puzzle me because, you know, in looking back at \nthe history of this thing, some of the leading Republicans, some of the \nleading conservatives, as well as some of the leading liberals and \nDemocrats in this body, have all joined together on some of these basic \nthings.\n  What I think the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin \nand I are trying to do here is kind of get back to where we were 20, 25 \nyears ago. We do not have that situation now. I hope the answer to your \nquestion is not that we see this current situation as an opportunity \nfor incumbents. And we know that most of the money goes to incumbents. \nI have been a challenger; I have been an incumbent, like we all have. \nAnd we know how the system works and operates. And that is fine. That \nwill always be the case.\n  We have some certain advantages, inherent advantages, in terms of \nnews coverage and things of that nature that I have no intention of \nwillingly giving up. And I think it is fine that I have those \nadvantages. But the money situation has gotten out of hand, and \nincumbents have such an advantage there that about 90 percent of all \nthe kind of money that we are talking about--well, that is not the \ncorrect figure either--but the great majority of the money we are \ntalking about now goes into incumbents.\n  In times past, in this body those considerations have not ruled, and \nI do not think ultimately they will here now. And I am not saying that \nthat is the motivation. All I am saying is that I hope that is not the \nmotivation. I am afraid that if we do not do some things--the Senator \nfrom Kentucky pointed out problems with Buckley that we have on the \nfree speech side of things. He makes some valid points there. It is a \nproblematic situation. It has to be either not dealt with at all, \nbecause of the Court interpretations, or it has to be dealt with very, \nvery carefully. I do not know how far we can go constitutionally.\n  But that has nothing to do with the contribution side. We decided \nback in 1907 that we did not want corporate contributions, large or \nsmall, and yet now we have effectively repealed that law, in my \nestimation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me finally ask the Senator from Tennessee, he also \nbrings\n\n[[Page S829]]\n\na unique perspective to this issue in that he, I am sure, is the only \nMember of this body who was an active participant in the Watergate \nscandal. Part of the scandal was the washing around of large amounts of \nmoney. I have heard the stories--people walking around with a valise \nwith a million and a half dollars of cash, et cetera. If we do not do \nsomething about this situation, in the view of the Senator from \nTennessee, are we likely to see a repeat of those kinds of revelations?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Well, I think if we do not do something about it, the \nbig difference will be that people will not have to hide that activity \nanymore because it would be considered permissible. You might have some \nlimitations on cash and things of that nature, but in terms of the \namounts, you know, one of the Cabinet members of the President at that \ntime allegedly was going around and, you know, hitting up these \ncorporations for pretty good sums of money--at that point, $50,000, \nincrements like that, some of it cash.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That was scandalous.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That was scandalous in those days.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Now they are hit up for $50,000, and it is the order of \nthe day, it is a lunch with the President.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. So we decided that--I think the country decided, after \nthat, that we needed to decide what we wanted to have corporations and \nlarge labor unions do. Clearly, they needed to participate. We set up \npolitical action committees and decided how much we wanted them to \nparticipate. And we said to corporations, labor unions, ``You can't do \nany more than that in terms of direct political contribution.'' We said \nto individuals, ``You can't spend more than $1,000 per election per \nindividual.'' That was not indexed. I think that was a mistake.\n  I think that $1,000, frankly, is ridiculously low nowadays, and if we \nhad a higher hard money limitation that maybe so much money would not \ngo into these independent ads and more money would go into hard money. \nBut we sat down and consciously decided, I think, as a Congress and as \na country, how much was appropriate for candidates to get their message \nout and to communicate with people and in what line did you get to a \npoint where the influence might appear to be too great. These were all \nconscious decisions.\n  All I am saying to this body now is that we at least need to \nrecognize that we are now addressing whether or not we still adhere to \nthat or not or are we going to a system where there are no limitations.\n  Some people make an eloquent argument there should be no limitations \nat all. But it ought to be debated. We ought to hash that out here on \nthe floor and not fool the American people into thinking that \neverything is basically just the way it was, and we do not want to \nencumber the system with additional regulations, and everything is \nfairly simple, and everything is fairly clean.\n  The Government, as I said, has been up to its eyeballs in this from \nday one, sometimes beneficially and sometimes ridiculously. And this \nlaw, to me, is just like most other major pieces of legislation. After \n20 years, you learn some things about it. You have unintended \nconsequences. You have court interpretations that go against what you \nthought you were doing.\n\n  So you have to sit down and revisit it and bring it up to date. I \nhope we don't avoid the responsibility of sitting down and revisiting \nthis. If the majority sentiment is that we don't want any rules \nanymore, that we want to allow candidates to pick up the phone and \nraise $5 million, maybe run it through a committee but coordinate all \nof it and direct it so that you can slam somebody maybe 2 years in \nadvance who might be a potential rival--if we really want to do that, \nsay that is what we are doing and lay it out in a piece of legislation.\n  It is a hodgepodge now. We argue about what is legal and illegal. We \nhave had some people say it is just violations of the law, what we need \nto do is enforce the law. That is true. Other people say, ``I don't see \nany violations of the law.'' See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. \nAll we need is reform. They are in part true. The biggest problem is \nthe gray area that everybody has assumed up until this last election \nwas against the law.\n  The Clinton-Gore campaign primarily went way beyond that and the \nAttorney General is trying to back them up. We can stamp our feet about \nit--I think she is dead wrong-- or we can sit down and say no, this is \nnot the way it is, Attorney General, this is not the way it is, FEC, or \ncourts, within the Constitution. We can make our own determinations as \nto what the Federal Government should be doing with regard to the \nelection of Federal candidates.\n  You and I do not want the Federal Government involved in many aspects \nof people's lives. I decided a long time ago, the motivation has to do \nwith lots of other things, like term limits and how long people stay \nwhen they are here, what their motivations are when they come here, \nwhat is primarily on their mind. All those kinds of things are the \nbusiness of this body. That is Federal Government business. I make no \napology for that.\n  So whether it is by inaction or by action, we are going to be \ndetermining how we elect people for Federal offices in this country.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me ask the Senator from Tennessee to sum up. Right \nnow there is no restriction on any campaign contribution, in his view; \nthere is no enforcement of existing law; there is no outrage because \n``everybody does it.''\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I have heard that often. That was part of what we heard \nover the last several months.\n  Everybody doesn't do it. Everybody doesn't do the things that we saw \nthe Clinton-Gore campaign do last time. I think everybody doesn't do \nwhat their campaign did in terms of laundering foreign money into this \ncampaign or using the White House and denigrating the White House. \nEverybody doesn't do that.\n  Where there are clear law violations the laws ought to be enforced. \nThat is another speech. If you get me started, it will be longer than \nthe last speech.\n  Mr. McCAIN. But existing law is not being prosecuted.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Is not being pushed hard enough, I don't think. We \nfinally got a couple of indictments on matters that have been on the \npublic record for a long, long time now. I am willing to reserve a \ncertain amount of judgment to see what comes up. Based on the public \nrecord we have there could be a dozen indictments, based on things that \nhave been on public record for a long, long time now. I expect there \nwill be more indictments coming down the pike, but up until now it has \nnot been aggressive. I'm afraid the trail has gotten cold on many. If \nyou don't act promptly on some of these things, it is a lost cause. I'm \nafraid that has happened.\n  Having said all of that, they can't blind us to the fact that \nseparate and apart from the clear violations of the law which do not \nneed amendment--they are clear laws, they are clear violations--we have \nnow created another area that does not require our attention, except \nour oversight, to see the law is enforced. What doesn't require our \nattention because of what the courts have done, because of what the FEC \nhas done, because of what we have done and because of what the Attorney \nGeneral has done, we have a hodgepodge that results in the allowance of \nunlimited amounts of money coming into any campaign almost under any \ncircumstances. You have to run it through a committee, perhaps. You \nhave to be careful how you word the TV ads, but as a practical matter \nwe have no limitations. That is what deserves our attention.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Tennessee. I hope that it is \nunderstood the Senator from Tennessee, chairman of the committee, just \nfinished a year-long oversight of the campaign finance abuses of this \ncountry. I think it is an important way to frame the debate which we \nare again embarking on, and that is that there are no limitations on \nany campaign contributions in American politics today. That is wrong. \nIt is wrong. It is wrong. We need to do something to fix it, or I \nsuggest that the people of this country will send some people who will \nfix it.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his incredible work and for \nhis perseverance and for his courage under sometimes very difficult \ncircumstances as he conducted his investigations throughout the last \nyear. I'm grateful for him, as well, obviously for his friendship.\n\n[[Page S830]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 1646\n\n (Purpose: To provide a complete substitute to reform the financing of \n                           Federal elections)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in accordance with the unanimous consent \nagreement regarding this issue, I send an amendment in the form of a \nsubstitute to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Thompson, Ms. Collins, Mr. Levin, and Mr. \n     Cleland, proposes an amendment numbered 1646.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment will be printed in a future edition of the \nRecord.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud that today we begin what \npromises to be a thorough and responsible debate on the issue of \ncampaign finance reform. I say responsible because I anticipate that in \nthe course of this debate Senators will make unmistakenly clear whether \nthey support or oppose meaningful reform. Senators will cast votes on \nat least one reform proposal, the revised McCain-Feingold legislation, \nand probably other proposals such as the one to be offered by Senator \nSnowe before we vote on whether or not to invoke cloture.\n  Previous debates have ended, unsatisfactorily, in a series of cloture \nvotes which, as we all know, tended to discourage good faith \ncompromises among Senators who are genuinely committed to finding a \nfair and effective solution to the disreputable state of modern \ncampaign financing. Moreover, cloture votes sometimes obscure from the \npublic a Senator's true position on the issue in question. By the end \nof this debate, whichever argument prevails, Senators will be on the \nrecord in support or opposition to reform, and, thus, accountable to \ntheir constituents who may then register their approval or disapproval \nat the polls.\n  Mr. President, I believe an open debate, which considers amendments \nrepresenting various views on the subject of reform, will encourage \nSenators on both sides of the issue to pursue a majority consensus on \nwhat can be done to improve our obviously and appallingly dysfunctional \ncampaign finance system. Should our debate result in honest progress \ntoward an acceptable compromise we may not even need to hold cloture \nvotes. Of course, this is an ideal result of the debate we commence \ntoday, and I recognize that we are a long way from achieving it. But I \nbelieve, with just a minimum of good faith on all sides, we can get \nthere.\n  But even if we fall short again, Mr. President, Senators will have \nshown ourselves willing to stand up for our beliefs and risk the \npeople's judgment when next we stand for election. I am proud of my \ncolleagues for having the courage of their convictions.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank the Majority Leader, Senator Lott, for \nagreeing to return to this subject, and allow Senators to express their \nviews by means usually employed in Senate debates--by means of \namendment. I wish also to thank my friend, the Senator from Kentucky, \nwho has long shown he has the courage of his convictions, for agreeing \nto resume debate in this manner.\n  I want also to thank the Minority Leader for his essential assistance \nin helping use to arrive at this important moment. I want to thank \nSenators Snowe, Jeffords and Chafee along with Senator Levin for their \nefforts to help the Senate achieve a meaningful consensus on a \ncontentious issue involved in this debate, and all Senators, on both \nsides of the aisle and the issue, who have worked hard to ensure that \nthis issue is fairly addressed by this Senate.\n  I wish to thank all the co-sponsors of McCain-Feingold, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, with a special thanks to a hardy band of \ndetermined Republicans, Senators Thompson, Collins and Specter who have \nlabored long and hard to change what we believe to be a mistaken \nmajority view among our fellow Republicans.\n  Lastly, I want to especially thank my tireless, resourceful and \npassionately committed friend, Senator Feingold. I have been in \nCongress for many years now, and I have never worked with a more \ndedicated or able member of this institution to pass legislation of \nsuch importance to our political system. He has inspired my own \ndetermination, and I am grateful to him.\n  Mr. President, we will hear from many Senators, representing several \npoints of view, during the course of this debate. I look forward to \ndebating various provisions of our legislation, as well as amendments \noffered by my colleagues on a range of issues related to campaign \nfinance reform. As I have said, many times in the past, this is a \nnecessary and important debate. The issue of campaign finance reform \nmerits our most serious attention. Indeed, I believe it deserves to be \na central focus of this Congress' work. I believe this so strongly \nbecause I think it is beyond doubt that the way we finance our \nelections in this country has caused the people we represent to doubt \nour personal integrity and the integrity of the institution we are \nprivileged to serve. And that, my friends, is a concern that should \ncall us all to action.\n  The substitute that Senator Feingold and I offer today represents a \nsubstantial change from S. 25, the original McCain-Feingold Campaign \nFinance Reform Bill, but at the same time, maintains the core of the \noriginal bill.\n  I strongly support all the provisions of the original bill. And as I \nhave stated in the past, as the debate proceeds, Senator Feingold and I \nintend to offer amendments that would restore the component parts of \nour original bill. We intend to proceed to those amendments in good \ntime.\n  Pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement that the Senate entered \ninto last year, the Senate will now turn to the bill S. 25 as modified, \nas an amendment to an original underlying bill. Later I will discuss my \nthoughts on the underlying bill, but now I would like to outline for my \ncolleagues the contents of our proposal.\n  Before I elaborate on the provisions of the bill, I want to remind my \ncolleagues of three points:\n  One--For reform to become law, it must be bi-partisan. This is a bi-\npartisan bill. It is a bill that effects both parties in a fair and \nequal manner.\n  Two--Reform must seek to lessen the role of money in politics. \nSpending on campaigns in current, inflation adjusted dollars continues \nto rise. In constant dollars, the amount spent on House and Senate \nraces in 1976 was $318 million. By 1986, the total had risen to $645 \nmillion. And in 1996 to $765 million. Including the Presidential races, \nover a billion dollars was spent in the last race. And as the need for \nmoney escalates, the influence of those who have it rises \nexponentially.\n  Three--Reform must seek to level the playing field between \nchallengers and incumbents. Our bill achieves this goal by recognizing \nthe fact that incumbents almost always raise more money than \nchallengers and as a general rule, the candidate with the most money \nwins the race. If money is forced to play a lesser role, then \nchallengers will have a better chance.\n\n\n                                title i\n\n  Title One of the modified bill seeks to reduce the influence of \nspecial interest money in campaigns by banning the use of soft money in \nfederal races. Soft money would be allowed to be contributed to state \nparties in accordance with state law.\n  In the first half of 1997, a record $34 million dollars of soft money \nflowed into political coffers. That staggering amount represents a 250% \nincrease in soft money contributions since 1993. And Mr. President, \nunless reform is passed, we are witnessing only the beginning of this \nproblem.\n  We do, however, seek to differentiate between state and federal \nactivities. Soft money contributed to state parties could be used for \nany and all state candidate activities. Let me repeat that statement. \nSoft money given to the state parties could be used for any state \nelectioneering activities.\n  If a state allows soft money to be used in a gubernatorial race, a \nstate senate race, or the local Sheriff's race, it would still be \nallowed under this bill. However, if a state party seeks to use soft \nmoney to indirectly influence a federal race, such activity would be \nbanned 120 days prior to the general\n\n[[Page S831]]\n\nelection. Voter registration and general campaign advertising would be \nallowed except during the 120 days prior to the election.\n  Voter registration efforts are very important. I know my colleagues \nrecognize that fact. We want individuals to register and then to go \nvote. This bill allows parties to engage in voter registration \nactivities. Additionally, state parties would be allowed within limits \nto engage in generic party advertising. These activities help build the \nparty and encourage people to vote.\n  To make up for the loss of soft money, the modified bill doubles the \nlimit that individuals can give to state parties in hard money. \nConsequently, the aggregate contribution limit for hard money that \nindividuals could donate to political races would rise to $30,000.\n  This ban of soft money is important for two fundamental reasons: \nfirst, it would reduce the amount of money in the election process; and \nsecond, it would result in candidates being forced to campaign for \nsmaller dollar amounts from individuals back home.\n\n\n                                title ii\n\n  Title II of the modified bill seeks to limit the role of independent \nexpenditures in political campaigns.\n  The bill in no way bans, curbs, or seeks to control real, \nindependent, non-coordinated expenditures in any manner. Any \nindependent expenditure made to advocate any cause, with the exception \nof the express advocacy of a candidate's victory or defeat, is fully \nallowed. To do anything else would violate the first amendment.\n  However, the bill does expand the definition of express advocacy. The \ncourts have routinely ruled that the Congress may define express \nadvocacy. In fact, current standards of express advocacy have been \nderived from the Buckley case itself.\n  As we all know, the Supreme Court case of Buckley v. Valeo stated \nthat campaign spending cannot be mandatorily capped. This bill is fully \nconsistent with the Buckley decision.\n  What the modified bill seeks to do is establish a so-called ``bright \nline'' test 60 days out from an election. Any independent expenditures \nthat fall within that 60 day window could not use a candidate's name or \nhis or her likeness. During this 60 day period, ads could run that \nadvocate any number of issues. Pro-life ads, pro-choice ads, anti-labor \nads, pro-wilderness ads, pro-Republican party or Democratic party ads--\nall could be aired with impunity. However, ads mentioning candidates \nthemselves could not be aired.\n  This accomplishes much. First, if soft money is banned to the \npolitical parties, such money will inevitably flow to independent \ncampaign organizations. These groups often run ads that the candidates \nthemselves disapprove of. Further, these ads are almost always negative \nattack ads and do little to further beneficial debate and a healthy \npolitical dialogue. To be honest, they simply drive up an individual \ncandidate's negative polling numbers and increase public cynicism for \npublic service in general.\n\n  The modified bill explicitly protects voter guides. I believe this is \na very important point. Some have unfairly criticized the original bill \nbecause they thought it banned or prohibited the publication and \ndistribution of voter guides and voting records. While I disagree with \nthose individual's conclusions, the sponsors of the modified bill \nsought to clarify this matter.\n  Let me state that voter guides are completely protected in the \nmodified bill. Any statements to the contrary are simply not true.\n  Not only are statements criticizing the bill on this point \ninaccurate, but the bill--as I have stated--in fact protects voter \nguides. I want to read the provision in its entirety so that there will \nbe no questions regarding this matter:\n\n       (C) Voting record and voter guide exception.--The term \n     express advocacy shall not include a printed communication \n     which is limited solely to presenting information in an \n     educational manner about the voting record or positions on \n     campaign issues of 2 or more candidates and which:\n       (i) is not made in coordination with a candidate, or \n     political party or agency thereof;\n       (ii) in the case of a voter guides based on a \n     questionnaire, all candidates for a particular seat or office \n     have been provided with an equal opportunity to respond;\n       (iii) gives no candidate any greater prominence than any \n     other candidate; and\n       (iv) does not contain a phrase such as ``vote for'', \n     ``reelect'', ``support'', ``Cast your ballot for'', ``(name \n     of candidate) for Congress'', ``(name of candidate) in \n     1997'', ``vote against'', ``defeat'', or ``reject'', or a \n     campaign slogan or words which in context can have no \n     reasonable meaning other than to urge the election or defeat \n     of 1 or more candidates.\n\n  I hope that this clear and concise language dispels any rumors that \nthis modified bill will adversely, in any way, affect voter guides.\n\n\n                               title iii\n\n  Title III of the modified bill mandates greater disclosure. Our bill \nmandates that all FEC filings documenting campaign receipts and \nexpenditures be made electronically and that they then be made \naccessible to the public on the Internet not later than 24 hours after \nthe information is received by the Federal Election Commission.\n  Additionally, current law allows for campaigns to make a ``best \neffort'' to obtain the name, address, and occupation information of the \ndonors of contributions above $200. Our bill would eliminate that \nwaiver. If a campaign can not obtain the address and occupation of a \ndonor, then the donation can not and should not be accepted.\n  The bill also mandates random audits of campaigns. Such audits would \nonly occur after an affirmative vote of at least four of the six \nmembers of the FEC. This will prevent the use of audits as a purely \npartisan attack.\n  The bill also mandates that campaigns seek to receive name, address \nand employer information for contributions over $50. Such information \nwill enable the public to have a better knowledge of all who give to \npolitical campaigns.\n\n\n                                title iv\n\n  Title IV of the modified bill seeks to encourage individuals to limit \nthe amount of personal money they spend on their own campaigns. If an \nindividual voluntarily elects to limit the amount of money he or she \nspends in his or her own race to $50,000, then the national parties are \nable to use funds known as ``coordinated expenditures'' to aid such \ncandidates. If candidates refuse to limit their own personal spending, \nthen the parties are prohibited from contributing coordinated funds to \nthe candidate.\n  This provision serves to limit the advantages that wealthy candidates \nenjoy and strengthen the party system by encouraging candidates to work \nmore closely with the parties.\n\n\n                                title v\n\n  Lastly, the bill codifies the Beck decision. The Beck decision states \nthat a non-union employee working in a closed shop union workplace and \nwho is required to contribute funds to the union, can request and be \nassured that his or her money not be used for political purposes.\n  I personally support much stronger language. I believe that no \nindividual--a union member or not--should be forced to contribute to \npolitical activities. However, I recognize that stronger language would \ninvite a filibuster of this bill and would doom its final passage. As a \nresult, I will fight to preserve the delicately balanced language of \nthe bill and will oppose amendments offered by both sides of the aisle \nthat would result in killing this important measure.\n  Mr. President, what I have outlined is a basic summary of our \nmodifications to the original bill. I have heard many of my colleagues \nsay that they could not support S. 25, the original McCain-Feingold \nbill for a wide variety of reasons. Some opposed spending limits. \nOthers opposed free or reduced rate broadcast time. Yet others could \nnot live with postal subsidies to candidates. And others complained \nthat nothing was being done about labor.\n  I hope that all my colleagues who made such statements will take a \nnew and open minded look at this bill. Gone are spending limits. Gone \nis free broadcast time. Gone are reduced rate TV time and postal \nsubsidies. And we have sought to address the problem of undue influence \nbeing exercised by labor unions. All the excuses of the past are gone.\n  Mr. President, I know our legislation is not perfect. I know that if \ngiven the opportunity to offer amendments, many Members will do exactly \nthat, and the legislation may well be improved as a result. I welcome \nthose amendments. But first we are required to vote for or against \ntabling our amendment. And I appeal to my colleagues to vote against \ntabling.\n\n[[Page S832]]\n\n  I know that many on this side of the aisle do not agree with all the \nprovisions I have outlined. But I know that many recognize that there \nis a problem with the way we finance our elections, and are distressed \nover the public's disdain for the system. It is a problem we must \naddress. So let us do so. Let any senator offer an amendment to our \nlegislation. I may agree with some. I may disagree with others. But by \nmeans of the amendment process we may begin building a consensus. Then \nwe can all sit down, in good faith, and do what the people want us to \ndo: come together on a consensus proposal to repair this terribly \ninequitable, unnecessarily expensive and, at times, corrupt campaign \nfinance system.\n  This is our opportunity. If we opt for gridlock over results, we will \nonly fuel the cynicism of the American electorate. I hope we will do \nwhat is right and take such steps as necessary to pass meaningful \ncampaign finance reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S817-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

A bill to reform Federal election campaigns; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n       THE FEDERAL ELECTION ENFORCEMENT AND DISCLOSURE REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, the year 1996 witnessed both a record \nhigh in the amount of money spent in pursuit of federal office--a \nstaggering $1 billion, an increase of 73 percent just since 1992--and \nthe second worst turnout in American history. In 1996, some $220 \nmillion was spent on Senate races alone--an average of $4.5 million per \ncampaign. Members of Congress combined currently raise an average of \nabout $1 million a day. It has been estimated that if these trends \ncontinue, by the year 2025 it will take $145 million to finance an \naverage Senate campaign. This is truly a ridiculous situation.\n  When I came to the Senate last year, I volunteered to serve on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. Sitting in the Committee's hearings on \ncampaign finance abuses and listening to the sordid tale of the 1996 \nmoney chase was a most unsettling experience. What I witnessed, heard \nand read made me even more convinced that we must strengthen our \ncampaign financing laws, now, and provide strong enforcement through \nthe Federal Election Commission of these laws, now, or risk seeing our \nelection process be swept away in a tidal wave of money.\n  At the conclusion of the Governmental Affairs hearings, I wrote to \nthe Committee Chairman to make four basic recommendations as \nappropriate follow-ons to the investigation:\n  (1) That we refer all evidence in the Committee's possession of \nalleged illegal acts to the Justice Department;\n  (2) That we hold additional hearings on both FEC enforcement and \n``gray areas'' in current law, such as the Pendleton Act and the \ndefinition of campaign coordination;\n  (3) That we mutually work for passage of McCain-Feingold as the best \nfirst step in curing our system-wide campaign finance problem; and\n  (4) That, to the maximum extent feasible, the Majority and Minority \nwork to produce a joint final report, with bipartisan conclusions and \nrecommendations.\n  While the jury is still out on my first three suggestions, clearly \nthe final one--concerning a bipartisan committee report--will, \nunfortunately, not be adopted. The separate, partisan reports which are \napparently to be released this week represent a lost opportunity to \npresent a strong, united case for reform.\n  Regardless of what action the Senate takes, or fails to take, on \nMcCain-Feingold, we need to turn to additional reforms in order to \nfurther improve our electoral process. I am pleased today to introduce \nthe Federal Election Enforcement and Disclosure Reform Act which is \naimed at dealing with two of the biggest problems confronting our \ncurrent federal campaign system: the inability of the Federal Election \nCommission (FEC), as currently constituted and funded, to adequately \nenforce election laws; and the significant gaps in existing campaign \nfinance disclosure requirements.\n  Let me be very clear that I continue to believe that enactment of \nMcCain-Feingold, even in its reduced form, is an essential step for the \nSenate to take this year in beginning the process of repairing a \ncampaign finance system which is totally out of control. Banning soft \nmoney and imposing disclosure and contribution requirements on sham \nissue ads aired close to an election, as provided for under McCain-\nFeingold, are absolutely vital reforms, without which the campaign \nfinance system will only grow less accountable, and more vulnerable to \nthe appearance, if not the fact, of undue influence by big money.\n  Nonetheless, I recognize that the issues raised by McCain-Feingold, \nin all of its forms, have become highly politicized and polarized, and \ncontinue to face a filibuster which threatens the Senate's ability to \nact on this legislation. Consequently, in addition to continuing to \nurge Senate adoption of McCain-Feingold, I want to broaden the scope of \ndebate, and to begin the process of seeking common ground on important \nreforms which are, by and large, outside of the purview of McCain-\nFeingold.\n  As previously discussed, one of the most glaring deficiencies in our \ncurrent federal campaign system is the ineffectiveness of its supposed \nreferee, the Federal Election Commission. The FEC, whether by design or \nthrough circumstance, has been beset by partisan gridlock, uncertain \nand insufficient resources, and lengthy proceedings which offer no hope \nof timely resolution of charges of campaign violations.\n  Thus, the first major element of my bill is to strengthen the ability \nof the Federal Election Commission to be an effective and impartial \nenforcer of federal campaign laws. Among the most significant FEC-\nrelated changes I am proposing are the following:\n  Alter the Commission structure to remove the possibility of partisan \ngridlock by establishing a 7-member Commission, appointed by the \nPresident based on qualifications, for single 7-year terms. The \nCommission would be composed of two Republicans, two Democrats, one \nthird party member, and two members nominated by the Supreme Court.\n  Give the FEC independent litigating authority, including before the \nSupreme Court, and establish a right of private civil action to seek \ncourt enforcement in cases where the FEC fails to act, both of which \nshould dramatically improve the prospects for timely enforcement of the \nlaw.\n  Provide sufficient funding of the FEC from a source independent of \nCongressional intervention by the imposition of filing fees on federal \ncandidates, with such fees being adequate to meet\n\n[[Page S838]]\n\nthe needs of the Commission--estimated to be $50 million a year.\n  A second major component of the Federal Election Enforcement and \nDisclosure Reform Act is to create a new Advisory Committee on Federal \nCampaign Reform to provide for a body outside of Congress to \ncontinually review and recommend changes in our federal campaign \nsystem. The Committee would be charged, ``to study the laws (including \nregulations) that affect how election campaigns for Federal office are \nconducted and the implementation of such laws and may make \nrecommendations for change,'' which are to be submitted to Congress by \nApril 15 of every odd-numbered year. As with the FEC, the Advisory \nCommittee would receive independent and sufficient funding via the new \nfederal candidate filing fees.\n  The impetus for the Advisory Committee is two-fold: (1) To build a \n``continuous improvement'' mechanism into the Federal campaign system, \nand (2) to address the demonstrable fact that Congress responds slowly, \nif a all, to the need for changes and updates in our campaign laws. In \nboth instances, the conclusion is the same: we cannot afford to wait \ntwenty-five years or until a major scandal develops to adapt our \ncampaign finance system to changing circumstances.\n  The final section of my bill seeks to enhance the effectiveness of \ncampaign contribution disclosure requirements. As Justice Brandeis \nobserved, ``Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and \nindustrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; \nelectric light the most effective policeman.'' This is certainly true \nin the realm of campaign finance, and perhaps the most enduring legacy \nof the Watergate Reforms of a quarter-century ago is the expanded \ncampaign and financial disclosure requirements which emerged. By and \nlarge, they have served us well, but as with everything else, they need \nto be periodically reviewed and updated in light of experience. \nTherefore, based in part on testimony I heard during last year's \nGovernmental Affairs Committee investigation and in part on the FEC's \nown recommendations for improved disclosure, my bill will make several \nchanges in current disclosure requirements.\n  Specifically, I am recommending two reforms which will make it more \ndifficult for contributors and campaigns alike to turn a blind eye to \ncurrent disclosure requirements by, first, preventing a campaign from \ndepositing a contribution until all of the requisite disclosure \ninformation is provided; and second, requiring those who contribute \n$200 or more to provide a signed certification that their contribution \nis not from a foreign national, and is not the result of a contribution \nin the name of another person.\n  In addition, my legislation adopts a number of disclosure \nrecommendations made by the FEC in its 1997 report to Congress, \nincluding provisions: requiring all reports to be filed by the due date \nof the report; requiring all authorized candidate committee reports to \nbe filed on a campaign-to-date basis, rather than on a calendar year \ncycle; and mandating monthly reporting for multi candidate committees \nwhich have raised or spent, or anticipate raising or spending, in \nexcess of $100,000 in the current election cycle.\n  In developing this legislation, I have been pleased to have the input \nand advice from a variety of individuals and organizations interested \nin the subject of campaign finance reform. In particular, while none of \nthem bear any responsibility for the finished product, I would like to \nacknowledge and thank the Reform Party and its founder Ross Perot, and \nchairman Russ Verney, Common Cause, and its president Ann McBride and \nvice president Meredith McGehee, and the Federal Election Commission \nand its assistant general counsel Susan Propper for their insights.\n  It is easy to be pessimistic when considering campaign finance reform \nefforts. The public and the media are certainly expecting this Congress \nto fail to take significant action to clean up the scandalous campaign \nsystem under which we now run. But ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, \nI suggest that we cannot afford the luxury of complacency. We may think \nwe will be able to win the next re-election because the level of \noutrage and the awareness of the extent of the vulnerability of our \npolitical system have perhaps not yet reached critical mass. But I am \nconfident that it is only a matter of time, and perhaps the next \nelection cycle--which will undoubtedly feature more unaccountable soft \nmoney, more sham issue ads of unknown parentage, more circumvention of \nthe spirit and in some cases the letter of current campaign finance \nlaw--before the scales are decisively tilted in favor of reform.\n  We will have campaign finance reform. The only question is whether \nthis Congress will step up to the plate, and fulfill its \nresponsibilities, to give the American public a campaign system they \ncan have faith in and which can preserve and protect our noble \ndemocracy as we enter a new century.\n  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that a summary of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Summary of the Federal Election Enforcement and Disclosure Reform Act\n\n\n                             I. FEC Reform\n\n       A. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) would be \n     restructured as follows:\n       The Commission will be composed of 7 members appointed by \n     the President who are specially qualified to serve on the \n     Commission by reason of relevant--\n       --two Republican members appointed by the President;\n       --two Democratic members appointed by the President;\n       --one member appointed by the President from among all \n     other political parties whose candidates received at least 3% \n     of the national popular vote in the most recent Presidential \n     or U.S. House or U.S. Senate elections; in the event no third \n     party reaches this threshold, the President may consider all \n     third parties in making this appointment; and\n       --two members appointed by the President from among 10 \n     nominees submitted by the U.S. Supreme Court. One of these \n     two members would be chosen by the Commission to serve as \n     Chairman, and the other would serve as Vice Chairman.\n       Relevant knowledge (for purposes of qualification for \n     appointment to the FEC) is defined to include:\n       --A higher education degree in government, politics, or \n     public or business administration, or 4 years of relevant \n     work experience in the fields of government or politics, and\n       --A minimum of two years experience in working on or in \n     relation to Federal election law or other Federal electoral \n     issues, or four years of such experience at the state level.\n       Commissioners will be limited to one 7 year term.\n       B. The FEC would be given the following additional powers:\n       Electronic filing of all reports required to be filed with \n     the FEC would be mandatory, with a waiver permitted for \n     candidates or other entities whose total expenditures or \n     receipts fall below a threshold amount set by the Commission \n     (similar to Section 301(a) of modified McCain-Feingold bill). \n     The requirement for the submission of hard (paper) copies of \n     such reports would be continued.\n       The Commission would be authorized to conduct random audits \n     and investigations in order to increase voluntary compliance \n     with campaign finance laws (same as Section 303 of modified \n     McCain-Feingold bill).\n       The FEC would be authorized to seek court enforcement when \n     the Commission believes a substantial violation is occurring, \n     failure to act will result in ``irreparable harm'' to an \n     affected party, expeditious action will not cause ``undue \n     harm'' to the interests of other parties, and the public \n     interest would best be served by the issuance of an \n     injunction (same as Section 303 of S. 25).\n       The Commission would be authorized to implement expedited \n     procedures for complaints filed within 60 days of a general \n     election (same as Section 309 of S. 25).\n       Penalties for knowing and willful violations of the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act would be increased (same as Section 305 \n     of S. 25).\n       The Commission would be expressly granted independent \n     litigating authority, including before the Supreme Court \n     (same as Section 304 of HR 493).\n       Private individuals or groups would be authorized to \n     independently seek court enforcement when the FEC fails to \n     act within 120 days of when a complaint is filed. A ``loser \n     pays\" standard would apply in such proceedings.\n       The Commission would be authorized to levy fines, not to \n     exceed $5,000, for minor reporting violations, and to publish \n     a schedule of fines for such violations.\n       Candidates for the Senate would be required to file with \n     the FEC rather than the Secretary of the Senate (same as \n     Section 301(b) of modified McCain-Feingold bill).\n       C. The FEC would be provided with resources in the \n     following manner:\n       Consistent with its expanded duties, the FEC would be \n     authorized to receive $50 million in FY1999 and FY2000, with \n     this amount indexed for inflation thereafter.\n       The funding would be derived from a ``user fee'' imposed on \n     federal candidate and party committees. The FEC would \n     establish a fee schedule and determine the requisite fee\n\n[[Page S839]]\n\n     level to fund the operations of the FEC and the new Advisory \n     Committee on Federal Campaign Reform. This determination will \n     include a waiver for the first $50,000 raised by campaigns.\n\n\n           ii. advisory committee on federal campaign reform\n\n       A. A new Advisory Committee on Federal Campaign Reform \n     would be created.\n       B. The Committee would be composed of 9 members, who are \n     specially qualified to serve on the Committee by reason of \n     relevant knowledge, to be appointed as follows: 1 appointed \n     by the President of the United States, 1 appointed by the \n     Speaker of the House, 1 each appointed by the Majority and \n     Minority Leaders of the U.S. House and Senate, 1 appointed by \n     the Supreme Court, 1 appointed by the Reform Party (or \n     whatever third party's candidate for President received the \n     largest number of popular votes in the most recent \n     Presidential election), and 1 appointed by the American \n     Political Science Association. Committee members would elect \n     the Chairman.\n       C. Committee members would each serve four-year terms, and \n     would be limited to two consecutive terms.\n       D. The appointees by the Supreme Court, the Reform Party \n     (or other third party), and the American Political Science \n     Association must be individuals who, during the five years \n     before their appointment, have not held elective office as a \n     member of the Democratic or Republican Parties, have not \n     received any wages or salaries from the Democratic or \n     Republican Parties, or have not provided substantial \n     volunteer services or made any substantial contribution to \n     the Democratic or Republican Parties, or to a Democratic or \n     Republican Party public office-holder or candidate for \n     office.\n       E. Relevant knowledge (for purposes of qualification for \n     appointment to the Committee) is defined to include:\n       A higher education degree in government, politics, or \n     public or business administration, or 4 years of relevant \n     work experience in the fields of government or politics, and\n       A minimum of two years experience in working on or in \n     relation to national campaign finance or other electoral \n     issues, or four years of such experience at the state level.\n       F. The Committee would be authorized to spend $1 million a \n     year in its first year, indexed for inflation thereafter. \n     Funding would be provided by the new campaign user fee \n     discussed above.\n       G. The Committee would be required to monitor the operation \n     of federal election laws and to submit a report, including \n     recommended changes in law, to Congress by April 15 of every \n     odd numbered year.\n       H. Congress would be required to consider the Committee's \n     recommendations under ``fast track'' procedures to guarantee \n     expeditious consideration in both houses of Congress.\n\n\n               iii. enhanced campaign finance disclosure\n\n       A. Campaigns would be prohibited from putting contributions \n     which lack all requisite contributor information into any \n     account other than an escrow account from which money cannot \n     be spent. Contributions placed in such an account would not \n     be subject to the current ten-day maximum holding period on \n     checks.\n       B. A new requirement would be placed on contributions in \n     excess of $200 (aggregate): a written certification by the \n     contributor that the contribution is not derived from any \n     foreign income source, and is not the result of a \n     reimbursement by another party.\n       C. The current option to file reports submitted by \n     registered or certified mail based on postmark date would be \n     deleted, thus requiring all reports to be filed by the due \n     date of the report.\n       D. Authorized candidate committee reports would be required \n     to be filed on a campaign-to-date basis, rather than on a \n     calendar year cycle.\n       E. Monthly reporting would be mandated for multi candidate \n     committees which have raised or spent, or anticipate raising \n     or spending, in excess of $100,000 in the current election \n     cycle.\n       F. The requirement for filing of last-minute independent \n     expenditures would be clarified to make clear that such \n     report must be received within 24 hours after the independent \n     expenditure is made.\n       G. Campaign disbursements to secondary payees who are \n     independent subcontractors would have to be reported.\n       H. Political committees, other than authorized candidate \n     committees, which have received or spent, or anticipate \n     receiving or spending, $100,000 or more in the current \n     election cycle would be subjected to the same ``last minute'' \n     contribution reporting requirements as candidate committees. \n     (Under current law, all contributions of $1,000 or more \n     received after the 20th day, but before 48 hours, before an \n     election must be reported to the FEC within 48 hours.)\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 1665. A bill to reauthorize the Delaware and Lehigh Navigation \nCanal National Heritage Corridor Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n THE DELAWARE AND LEHIGH NATIONAL HERITAGE CORRIDOR ACT AMENDMENTS OF \n                                  1998\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nreintroduce legislation I originally introduced on November 8, 1997, to \nreauthorize the work of the Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage \nCorridor Commission in Pennsylvania. The new bill makes some technical \nchanges which deal with method of appointing Commission members, \nensuring that the Commission will continue to be composed of \nrepresentatives from local and state agencies who have worked on this \nsuccessful public/private partnership with the federal government over \nthe past 10 years. I am hopeful that the Subcommittee on National \nParks, Historic Preservation, and Recreation of the Senate Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources will hold hearings on this bill as soon as \npossible. Since authorization for the Commission is set to expire in \nNovember, 1998, it is vital that the Senate pass this legislation this \nyear to enable the Commission to continue its unfinished work in \neastern Pennsylvania.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN:\n  S . 1666. A bill to amend Federal election laws to better define the \nrequirements for Presidential candidates and political parties that \naccept public funding, to better define the limits on the election-\nrelated activities of tax exempt organizations, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to prevent future occurrences of some of the more egregious \ncampaign finance abuses that we learned of during the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee investigation into the 1996 federal \nelection campaigns.\n  What I have particularly in mind is the misuse of taxpayer money by \nour presidential candidates and by various tax-exempt organizations \nthat intervened in both congressional and presidential elections in \n1996.\n  Over the course of its inquiry, the Governmental Affairs Committee \ncompiled a compelling record that leaves little question our political \nsystem was subverted in 1996 by overzealous presidential campaigns \nworking with their parties to circumvent spending limits and by \nindependent organizations abusing the special tax status conferred upon \nthem. At times, the campaigns and outside groups conducted their \nbusiness as if the election laws were written in invisible ink. Our \ndemocratic process suffered as a result.\n  My proposal focuses on two specific areas of the law whose spirit and \nintent were violated in 1996. They are the campaign finance statutes \nregarding the public financing of presidential campaigns and the tax \ncode, as it applies to the political activity of tax-exempt \norganizations.\n  Let me first make clear that I am a steadfast supporter of the \nMcCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. I hope the ideas that I \npresent today might be considered as supplemental to it, since they \ncomplement McCain-Feingold and fill in some of the gaps that only \nbecame apparent after our year-long Governmental Affairs Committee \ninvestigation.\n\n\n        The Abuse of Public Financing for Presidential Campaigns\n\n  Under the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act and the \nPresidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act, the taxpayers spent \napproximately $236 million on the 1996 presidential campaigns. The \npurpose of this support was to limit spending in order to protect \npresidential candidates from the potentially corrupting influence of \nfull-time fund-raising and to reduce the flow of private money into \ncampaign coffers.\n  The two laws give public subsidies to presidential candidates and \ntheir parties at three stages. First, the Treasury matches \ncontributions raised by certain primary candidates who agree to limit \ntheir primary spending to an amount specified in the statute. Second, \npolitical parties may receive a specified amount to fund their \npresidential nominating conventions if they agree to spend no more than \nthat. Third, major party nominees who agree to limit their spending to \nthe amount they receive in public funds are eligible for full public \nfinancing during the general election.\n  Both of 1996's major party candidates accepted public financing and \npledged in return to limit their spending to $37 million during the \nprimary season and $62 million during the general election.\n\n[[Page S840]]\n\n  But, as the Governmental Affairs Committee's hearings demonstrated, \nthe candidates effectively ignored their pledges. Instead of curtailing \ntheir fund-raising and limiting themselves to spending the amount they \nagreed to, the two major party candidates continued raising massive \namounts of money which their parties then spent on TV ads that advanced \nthe nominees' candidacies. In other words, the public did not get the \nbehavior they were supposed to get in return for their $236 million.\n  The McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform legislation, S. 25, would \ngo a long way toward preventing these abuses by banning soft money and \nlimiting the sources of funding available for running advertisements \nusing a candidate's likeness or name within 60 days of an election.\n  But because the Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo explicitly \nsanctioned Congress's ability to impose even greater restrictions on \nthose candidates who accept public financing, we should go beyond S. \n25's proposals in regard to publicly-funded presidential candidates.\n  Therefore, I am introducing legislation that would underscore the \noriginal goal of the presidential public financing laws by banning \ncandidates from raising soft money throughout their campaigns, \nrequiring them to limit fundraising to hard money during the primary \nseason, and prohibiting them from raising any money at all after they \nare nominated. My bill would further prevent presidential candidates \nfrom using the parties to circumvent spending limits by making illegal \ntheir involvement in any party spending on advertising that exceeds the \namount federal law in 2 U.S.C. Sec.  441a(d) explicitly authorizes for \ncandidate/party coordination.\n  I am also proposing to limit what parties seeking public financing of \ntheir conventions can do. To get convention financing, parties would \nhave to agree to use only hard money to pay for advertising using the \nname or likeness of the presidential candidates and would be limited in \ntheir coordinated or independent expenditures on behalf of presidential \ncandidates to the amount set forth in Section 441a(d). Parties seeking \nconvention financing also would have to agree to a ban on soft money \nand would be prohibited from soliciting or directing contributions for \ntax-exempt organizations.\n\n\n                 The Abuse of Tax-Exempt Organizations\n\n  And that leads me to an equally troubling phenomenon in the 1996 \nelections, which was the improper use of tax-exempts to circumvent the \ntax-code and campaign finance laws so that they could conduct partisan \ncampaign-related activity.\n  The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) mandates strict limits on \nwho may contribute to campaigns, and it imposes reporting and \ndisclosure requirements on organizations involved in federal elections. \nThe purpose is to ensure honest elections by limiting the sources of \ncampaign funds and publicly identifying those trying to influence \nvotes.\n\n  Groups with Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) status --which \nconfers not only tax-exempt status but also the ability to receive tax-\ndeductible contributions--may not intervene in any political campaign \non behalf of or in opposition to any candidate. The tax code permits \norganizations with Section 501(c)(4) status--which qualify for tax-\nexempt status, but whose contributors cannot deduct their \ncontributions--to engage in non-partisan election advocacy as long as \nthat is not the group's primary activity.\n  Unfortunately, the scope of the activities some of these groups \nengaged in during the 1996 elections went far beyond what Congress \nintended.\n  The Republican National Committee, (RNC), for example, infused the \n501(c)(4) organization Americans for Tax Reform, (ATR), with over $4.5 \nmillion in the weeks leading up to the 1996 election. The RNC sent that \nmoney to ATR just in time for ATR to pay its bills for a direct mail \nand phone bank campaign involving four million calls and 19 million \npieces of mail explicitly disputing the Democrats' position on Medicare \nas it related to the November 5th election.\n  By funneling money through an outside group like ATR, the RNC was \neffectively able to hide the fact that it was behind the mail and phone \ncalls. Recipients of the material funded by the RNC were left with the \nimpression that it came from a disinterested organization, not the \nparty itself.\n  The RNC also steered large amounts of money to the American Defense \nInstitute (ADI), a 501(c)(3) organization that runs a voter turnout \nprogram for military personnel, who tend to vote Republican. The \nWashington Post reported on October 23, 1997 that in September 1996, \nADI returned $600,000 donated to it by the RNC because, according to \nthe group's president, ``we didn't want to be controversial and we had \nfunding from other sources.'' However, as the Post reported, that money \nwas not returned until several days after the RNC itself sent checks \ntotaling $530,000 from six donors to ADI. Around that time, RNC \nChairman Haley Barbour also apparently solicited $500,000 from the \nPhilip Morris Companies Inc. for ADI.\n  The timing of these transactions raises the question of whether the \nRNC and ADI substituted the donor's money for the RNC's money to avoid \npublicizing the fact that the RNC was the source of ADI's funding--in \nother words, to avoid disclosure requirements. Furthermore, all the \ndonors could take a tax deduction for their RNC-solicited ADI \ncontributions, forcing taxpayers to subsidize donations to a political \ncampaign.\n  On the Democratic side, the Committee heard testimony that Vote Now \n96, the fund-raising arm of the 501(c)(3) get-out-the-vote organization \nCitizens Vote, Inc., sought and received help from the DNC in raising \nmoney for its work, presumably because these organizations were working \nto raise the turnout among groups who tend to vote Democratic. For \nexample, the DNC apparently directed a $100,000 contribution to Vote \nNow 96 from Duvaz Pacific Corporation after it learned the head of the \nPhilippine company, who had attended a DNC fund-raiser, could not \nlegally contribute to the party because of her foreign citizenship.\n  There is also significant evidence that a number of tax-exempt \ngroups, none of which disclosed their activities to the FEC, intervened \nin elections by producing TV ads the groups claimed were issue \noriented, but which, in fact, were designed to influence specific \nelections. According to a study by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, \nthe 501(c)(4) Citizens for Reform ran $2 million worth of ads during \nOctober and November of 1996 on behalf of several Republican \ncongressional candidates around the country.\n  All of these activities by tax-exempt, presumably non-partisan \ncorporations cry out for remedial action by Congress. The McCain-\nFeingold proposal, S. 25, partially addresses these problems by \nprohibiting party organizations from soliciting contributions for, or \ndirecting them to, tax-exempt entities. This is a very important \nrestriction.\n  In addition, I am proposing to prohibit such organizations from \ncoordinating any expenditure with parties and candidates and to forbid \nthem to run advertisements or send direct mail identifying a candidate \nwithin 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary election.\n  I am confident this proposal will pass constitutional muster because \nthe Supreme Court upheld similar restrictions on tax-exempt \norganizations in Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Washington. \nIn finding against a First Amendment challenge to a prohibition against \nsubstantial lobbying by a 501(c)(3), the court said that ``tax \nexemptions and tax deductibility are a form of subsidy that is \nadministered through the tax system'' and that by restricting a tax-\nexempt's lobbying activities ``Congress has merely refused to pay for \nthe lobbying out of public monies.''\n  My bill also would also make clear that Section 527 organizations \nmust comply with federal campaign laws. Internal Revenue Code Section \n527 offers tax benefits to ``political organizations,'' a term it \ndefines to include organizations seeking to influence Federal, State or \nlocal elections. A number of 501(c)(4) groups active in federal \nelection campaigns apparently have switched their tax status to Section \n527, which offers tax benefits with fewer restrictions on political \nactivity. At the same time, these groups claim they are not subject to \nFECA because they don't engage in express advocacy\n\n[[Page S841]]\n\nof particular candidates, even though FECA defines the groups it covers \nin essentially the same terms as Section 527. My bill would make it \nclear that the taxpayers should not be subsidizing undisclosed and \nunregulated political activities by groups who claim they are trying to \ninfluence Federal elections for the purpose of the tax code--and thus \nare entitled to tax-exemption--but not for the purpose of FECA--and \nthus are immune from regulation. My bill makes clear that they cannot \nhave it both ways and that Section 527's tax benefits are available \nonly to groups regulated under FECA, unless a group seeking Section 527 \nstatus is engaged exclusively in State or local political activity.\n  It is important to emphasize that this bill would not prevent any one \nor anything from engaging in any type of activity. Instead, it would \njust say that if a candidate or an organization puts a hand out and \nasks for a public subsidy--whether it be public financing for a \npresidential candidate or tax-exemption for an organization--they have \nto be willing to comply with the rules for taking that public subsidy. \nAfter all, no person or entity has a right to public money or to be \nfree of taxes; it is entirely up to Congress to determine what type of \nactivities are so important to society that we should use public money \nor tax-exemption as ways of encouraging them. In offering tax-exemption \nto the 501(c)(3) and (c)(4) organizations covered by this bill, \nCongress already plainly chose to limit their involvement in partisan \ncampaign activity. This bill would merely build on the experience of \nthe 1996 elections to clarify the scope of those limitations.\n  There are always some who find new and clever ways to manipulate the \nlegal system. Their efforts peaked in our politics in the 1996 cycle \nwith an unparalleled flouting of the laws' requirements and \nprohibitions. Based on the excuses the Committee heard last year to \njustify this behavior, I have no doubt the trend will continue--unless \nwe find the will to radically restructure our campaign finance laws.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, and \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-\nsection of it appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1666\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

First, it would amend the presidential public \n     financing laws to ensure that taxpayers--who spent $236 \n     million on the 1996 elections in an effort to limit spending \n     on the presidential campaign and keep candidates for the \n     presidency above the fundraising fray--get what they pay for. \n     Second, it offers amendments to the tax code, with the goal \n     of limiting the ability of tax-exempt organizations to \n     circumvent existing restrictions on their involvement in \n     partisan politics. The following provides a section-by-\n     section explanation of the bill's provisions.\n\n\n Section 1: Requirements for Presidential Candidates Accepting Public \n                               Financing\n\n       Section 1 imposes two new requirements on candidates \n     seeking public financing for their presidential primary or \n     general election campaigns: (a) they must limit their \n     fundraising; and (b) they must agree not to try to evade \n     spending limits on their own campaigns by using the parties \n     or outside groups to make expenditures for them.\n       (a) Fundraising Restrictions: Subsection 1(a) imposes \n     fundraising restrictions on candidates accepting public \n     financing:\n       (1) Definition of ``Fundraising Activity'': Subsection \n     1(a)(1) defines the term ``fundraising activity'' to include \n     efforts to raise money for: (a) candidates, (b) political \n     committees (like the DNC or RNC), (c) tax-exempt \n     organizations that engage in any election-related activity, \n     which is defined to include voter registration, get-out-the-\n     vote activities, the publication or distribution of voter \n     guides, or the making of widely disseminated communications \n     that mention candidates or political parties, (d) political \n     organizations as defined by Section 527 of the tax code, or \n     (e) any organization that engages in ``electioneering \n     advertising,'' a term the bill defines in Section 2 below. \n     ``Fundraising activity'' in this section also includes the \n     candidate's authorization to use his name in connection with \n     any of the activities just described. Because the election \n     laws explicitly allow presidential candidates to seek private \n     contributions to defray their legal and accounting costs or \n     if the public financing fund does not have enough money in it \n     to give candidates their full allotment of public funds, the \n     subsection excludes raising contributions for those purposes \n     from its definition of ``fundraising activity.''\n       (2) Restrictions on Fundraising During the General \n     Election: Subsection 1(a)(2) provides that a publicly-funded \n     general election candidate for the presidency, members of his \n     immediate family, the candidate's authorized committee, and \n     agents and officials of that committee may not engage in any \n     fundraising activity from the date of the candidate's \n     nomination until the general election.\n       (3) Restrictions on Fundraising During the Primary \n     Campaign: Subsection 1(a)(3) provides that from January 1 of \n     an election year until the date of the convention of the \n     party whose nomination the candidate seeks, a primary \n     election candidate receiving federal matching funds must \n     limit his fundraising activities to the solicitation or \n     acceptance of hard money (money regulated and limited by the \n     Federal Election Campaign Act). This restriction also applies \n     to members of the candidate's immediate family, the \n     candidate's authorized committee, and agents and officials of \n     that committee.\n       (b) Restrictions on Spending Through the Parties and \n     Outside Groups: Subsection 1(b) seeks to prevent candidates \n     for the presidency from circumventing limits on their own \n     campaigns by working with parties or outside groups to spend \n     party money to advance their candidacies.\n\n[[Page S844]]\n\n       (1) Definition of Coordinated Disbursement: Subsection \n     1(b)(1) defines the term ``coordinated disbursement'' as \n     spending by a person or entity other than a candidate or his \n     authorized committee for broadcast, print, direct mail or \n     other similar type of public communication if the spending \n     person or entity consults or coordinates with a candidate or \n     party about the disbursement. ``Coordinated disbursements'' \n     encompass any type of communication or advertising, and are \n     not limited to those including words of express advocacy. The \n     term does not encompass, however, any spending a political \n     party makes under Section 441a(d), which explicitly allows \n     parties to coordinate a set amount of spending with their \n     candidates, or disbursements for bona fide newscasts, \n     editorials, and the like. In addition, in the case of a \n     presidential candidate who designates a political party as \n     his authorized campaign committee, the term encompasses only \n     coordinated spending by the political party that exceeds the \n     combined limit allowed under the public financing laws and \n     Section 441a(d).\n       (2) Prohibition on Participating in Coordinated \n     Disbursements During General Election: Subsection 1(b)(2) \n     prohibits publicly-funded general election candidates from \n     participating in any coordinated disbursements.\n       (3) Prohibition on Participating in Coordinated \n     Disbursements During Primary Election: Subsection 1(b)(3) \n     prohibits primary candidates receiving federal matching funds \n     from participating in coordinated disbursements unless the \n     coordinated disbursement is a contribution subject to the \n     election law's contribution limits.\n\n\n    Section 2: Requirements for Political Parties Accepting Public \n           Financing for Presidential Nominating Conventions\n\n       Section 2 imposes five new requirements on political \n     parties accepting public financing for their presidential \n     nominating conventions: (a) they must agree to use only hard \n     money to fund advertisements using a presidential candidate's \n     name or likeness in a presidential election year; (b) they \n     must agree to limit their express advocacy expenditures--\n     whether they are made in coordination with their \n     presidential candidate or independently of them--to the \n     amount set in Section 441a(d); (c) they must agree not to \n     participate in coordinated disbursements with respect to \n     their presidential candidates; (d) they must agree not to \n     solicit any funds for or make any donations to tax-exempt \n     groups; and (e) they must agree to a ban on soft money:\n       (a) Definition of Electioneering Advertising: Section 2 \n     defines ``electioneering advertising'' to include a \n     communication that either uses words like ``vote for'' or \n     ``vote against'' the candidate, or that refers to one or more \n     clearly identified candidates in a communication that is \n     widely disseminated through a broadcast station, newspaper, \n     magazine, direct mail or any other type of general public \n     communication. The provision explicitly excludes printed \n     voter guides from the term ``electioneering advertising,'' as \n     long as the voter guide presents information in an \n     educational manner about two or more candidates' positions on \n     issues, is not coordinated with candidates or political \n     parties, provides equal prominence to all candidates covered \n     by the guide, and does not contain phrases like ``vote for'' \n     or ``vote against'' any candidate.\n       (b) Restrictions on Electioneering Advertising by Parties: \n     Section 2 provides that throughout the presidential election \n     year, parties accepting public convention financing must use \n     only hard money to pay for electioneering advertising \n     featuring presidential candidates. In addition, it prohibits \n     them from avoiding this restriction by transferring funds to \n     State parties for the purpose of running such ads.\n       (c) Limits on Coordinated and Independent Expenditures: \n     Section 441a(d) provides that political parties can spend a \n     set amount of money in coordination with their presidential \n     candidates to further those candidates' chances for election. \n     Under Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. \n     Federal Election Commission, parties also have the right to \n     make unlimited ``independent expenditures''--that is, \n     expenditures that expressly advocate a candidate but are not \n     made in consultation with the candidate. Section 2 of the \n     Lieberman bill would require parties accepting convention \n     financing to agree to limit all categories of their \n     expenditures for their presidential candidates--whether they \n     be coordinated expenditures, independent expenditures or \n     expenditures for electioneering advertising--to the amount \n     set in Section 441a(d).\n       (d) Prohibition on Coordinated Disbursements: Section 2 \n     provides that parties accepting public convention financing \n     may not participate in coordinated disbursements involving \n     presidential candidates during a presidential election year. \n     Note that because the definition of ``coordinated \n     disbursement'' excludes Section 441a(d) expenditures, parties \n     still may spend a specified amount in coordination with their \n     presidential candidates.\n       (e) Prohibition on Donations to Tax-Exempt Organizations: \n     Section 2 provides that parties accepting convention \n     financing may not solicit any funds for, or direct any \n     donations to, IRS Code Section 501(c) organizations that \n     engage in any election-related activity, which is defined to \n     include voter registration, get-out-the-vote activities, the \n     publication or distribution of voter guides, or the making of \n     widely disseminated communications that mention candidates or \n     political parties.\n       (f) Prohibition on Soft Money: Section 2 requires parties \n     accepting convention financing to agree to a ban on soft \n     money. The language for the ban is taken from S. 25, the \n     McCain-Feingold bill.\n\n\n       Section 3: Required Disclaimer for Presidential Candidates\n\n       Section 3 requires candidates for the presidency to add the \n     following statement to any broadcast or direct mail \n     advertisement: ``Federal law establishes voluntary spending \n     limits for candidates for President. This candidate ____ \n     agreed to abide by the limits.'' The blank line is to be \n     filled in with either ``has'' or ``has not,'' as appropriate.\n\n\n      Section 4: Limitations on Political Activity by Tax-Exempt \n                             Organizations\n\n       Section 4 makes more explicit the precise limits on the \n     political activities of organizations with tax-exempt status \n     under Section 501(c)(3) or (c)(4) of the tax code. It \n     provides that such organizations shall lose their exemption \n     if they:\n       (a) solicit or accept a contribution from a political party \n     or a candidate;\n       (b) make or direct a contribution to a political party or a \n     candidate;\n       (c) make a disbursement for electioneering advertising \n     (defined in Section 2, above) if the advertising is made 60 \n     days or less before a general election or 30 days or less \n     before a primary election, unless the disbursement \n     constitutes an independent expenditure that is otherwise \n     permitted by law; or\n       (d) participate in a coordinated disbursement (defined in \n     Section 1(b)(1), above).\n\n\n  Section 5: Ensuring that Section 527 Organizations Comply with the \n                         Federal Election Laws\n\n       A number of 501(c)(4) organizations active in federal \n     election-related activity apparently have started switching \n     their status to Section 527, a different provision of the tax \n     code that offers tax benefits with fewer restrictions on \n     political activity. At the same time, these organizations \n     claim that they are not subject to FECA because they are not \n     engaging in express advocacy. Section 5 amends the \n     definitions of the term ``political organization'' in Section \n     527 and ``political committee'' in FECA to make clear that \n     the tax benefits of Section 527 are available only to \n     organizations whose activities are regulated under FECA, \n     unless the organization focuses exclusively on State or local \n     political activity.\n\n\n                        Section 6: Severability\n\n       Section 6 provides that a declaration that any provision of \n     the legislation is unconstitutional shall not affect the rest \n     of the legislation.\n\n\n                       Section 7: Effective Date\n\n       Section 7 provides that the legislation takes effect 30 \n     days after enactment.\n\n\n             Section 8: Authority to Promulgate Regulations\n\n       Section 8 provides the FEC and the IRS with authority to \n     (a) promulgate regulations as necessary to enforce the \n     legislation and (b) provide exceptions to any of the \n     legislation's provisions if necessary to serve the public \n     interest.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 1667. A bill to amend section 2164 of title 10, United States \nCode, to clarify the eligibility of dependents of United States Service \nemployees to enroll in Department of Defense dependents schools in \nPuerto Rico; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n               department of defense schools legislation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President. I would like to draw attention to a \nproblem in our drug control program. It concerns something that the \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) is not doing. And frankly it's embrassing. \nToday, the men and women of federal law enforcement constantly put \ntheir lives at risk in an effort to fight the increasing flow of \nillicit drugs into our country. Not only do we face the threat of an \nincrease of drugs in our children's schools and on our streets, but our \nlaw enforcement officers continue to face a rising tide of violence at \nour borders and in our cities as a result of the drug trade. We \ncontinue to see the flow of narcotics across the Southern tier of the \nU.S. to include Puerto Rico. Law enforcement personnel, with their \ncommitment to the mission to fight the war on drugs, work many long \nhours, sometimes late into the evening and are subject to changes in \ntheir schedules at a moment's notice. The families of these officers \nalso feel the pressures of the job they perform. This brings me to the \npoint I would like to make.\n  The front lines of the U.S. Customs Service do not involve just a \nproblem of gun-toting drug thugs. Agents face more than long hours and \nrisky situations. While they deal with all these things, they must \nshoulder the additional burden of coping with bureautic bumbledom. This \nadded load is a result of DoD officiousness and unwillingness to \ncooperate. The language of instruction in Puerto Rico public schools is\n\n[[Page S845]]\n\nSpanish and not English. Therefore, the only affordable English-\nlanguage school option for U.S. Customs personnel is the DoD school. \nHowever, current legislation and DoD policy is creating a hardship for \nCustoms employees and their families. This unnecessarily affects our \ncounter-drug efforts by undermining morale.\n  It is understanding that the children of these law enforcement \npersonnel have been attending DoD schools in Puerto Rico for more than \n20 years. Throughout the years, changes in legislation and DoD policy \nhave placed numerous restrictions on Customs and other Federal civilian \nagencies. Customs has recently augmented its workforce in Puerto Rico \nunder its Operation Gateway initiative in light of the continuing and \nheightened threat of narcotics smuggling and money laundering in the \nCaribbean Basin. I supported this initiative.\n  This session I will also stress the need for better coordination of \nour interdiction strategy, particularly the need to develop a \n``Southern Tier'' concept. This initiative will strive to focus \nresources in a more comprehensive way to protect our southern frontier. \nPuerto Rico is crucial to this strategy. Current legislation and DoD's \npolicy requirements are, however, obstacles to the effective \nimplementation of this aggressive enforcement initiative in terms of \nrecruitment and retention of Customs employees because, as I stated \nearlier, there are no English speaking public schools in Puerto Rico.\n  In my view, it is unfair that Customs agents and Inspectors in Puerto \nRico--the men and women who deal daily with difficult and dangerous \nsituations--should find their attention distracted by something like \nthis.\n  The U.S. Customs Service interdicts more drugs than any other \nGovernment Agency. Based on the size of the workforce of Customs in \nPuerto Rico, their critical law enforcement mission, the difficulty in \nrecruiting, and the negative effect this policy is having on their \nemployees and families (over 150 children of Customs employees are \ncurrently enrolled in the program), I would like to see a swift \nsolution to these problems.\n  Recently, a Customs' Special Agent was killed in an accident while \nassisting the U.S. Secret Service on a Presidential detail. This \nhighlights another problem. My legislation would also address a concern \nraised by this case. It happens that the children of this agent \ncurrently attend classes in the DoD school in Puerto Rico. It is my \nunderstanding that a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury was sent \nto the Secretary of Defense requesting that these children be able to \ncontinue to attend classes in the DoD school program for the remainder \nof their education. So far, DoD has dragged its feet and has not \nresolved the matter. What is unfortunate is that at the end of the \nyear, these children will no longer be eligible to attend the DoD \nschool.\n  My staff has communicated with DoD to resolve these problems. But DoD \nhas not been very responsive. I personally wrote the Secretary of \nDefense to work out a solution. I got a response from a low-level \nbureaucrat who responded just like, well, a bureaucrat. The answer was, \n``nothing can be done'', that the solution is to ``change the \nlegislation''.\n  Mr. President, I plan to do just that. Today, I am introducing \nlegislation that would clarify the eligibility of Customs Service \nemployee dependents to enroll in the Department of Defense Schools in \nPuerto Rico. This bill is essential in order to address the current \nproblems that I have described for these employees and their families. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that our efforts \nto protect our country from illicit drugs is effective and adequately \nsupported. I hope that my colleagues will look at this legislation and \njoin me in sponsoring this bill. It is enough of a burden on the \nfamilies of the dedicated men and women who labor to protect our \nborders without further weighing them down with senseless red tape.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1667\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the 104th Congress passed legislation, \nintroduced by myself and my distinguished colleague Senator Warner, to \nauthorize the establishment of a monument to Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr. on federal land in the District of Columbia.\n  Today I rise, once again for myself and Senator Warner, to introduce \nlegislation that would give effect to the recommendation of the \nDepartment of Interior that this Memorial be situated in Area I of the \nCapital. Area I comprises, in the words of the Interior Department, \n``the central Monumental Core of the District of Columbia and its \nenvirons,'' that is, the Mall and its surrounding areas. The Department \nhas determined that a commemorative work belongs in Area I only if it \nis determined to be of preeminent historical and lasting significance \nto the Nation. It comes as no surprise that the King memorial has been \nfound to meet these criteria, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \napproving the Department's recommendation. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of a January 29, 1998 letter from Don Barry, Acting Assistant \nInterior Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, to Vice President \nGore transmitting this recommendation be included in the Record.\n  Mr. President, it is particularly apt that Senator Warner and I \nintroduce this legislation in February, which has been designated Black \nHistory Month. To place the King Memorial alongside monuments to \nAmerica's greatest leaders would acknowledge the nation's historic debt \nto Dr. King, to his philosophy of nonviolence, and to his dream of \nAmericans living together in racial harmony. The National Capital \nMemorial Commission agrees. After holding a hearing on July 29, 1997, \non the question of the location of the King Memorial, the Commission \ninformed Assistant Secretary Barry that, in his words:\n\n       Dr. King, the central figure of the Civil Rights movement, \n     a man who strove to advance the cause of equality for all \n     Americans, and a man who dedicated himself through nonviolent \n     means to promote the principles of justice and equality, who \n     paid the ultimate price for his beliefs, has had a profound \n     effect on all Americans which will continue through history.\n\nSituation of the King Memorial in Area I would also place Dr. King's \nlegacy in historical context. Americans are already aware of the \nachievements of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, the veterans of our foreign wars, and other \nArea I honorees in preserving the liberties, freedoms, and rights that \nAmericans hold dear. Dr. King and his legacy hold a vital place along \nthis continuum, and fully deserve the honor that the Secretary of the \nInterior seeks to accord them.\n  Mr. President, while we have come a long way since Dr. King's death \ntoward\n\n[[Page S846]]\n\nthe goals of equality and racial harmony for which he lived, and gave, \nhis life, we still have a long way to go. A King Memorial in Area I \nwould serve as a signpost along the road toward these goals for those \nwho were not alive when Dr. King lived, and as a reminder that the \ngoals toward which he strove must be attained in order for America to \nremain strong and true to its governing principles.\n  In closing, let me pay tribute to Alpha Phi Alpha, the oldest \nAfrican-American fraternity in the United States, to which Dr. King and \nmany other prominent African-Americans, such as former Supreme Court \nJustice Thurgood Marshall, belonged. Under the King Memorial plan \nenacted into law last Congress, Alpha Phi Alpha will coordinate the \nfunding and design of the King Memorial, which will be funded entirely \nthrough private donations, at no cost to the public. Alpha Phi Alpha's \nefforts in this area--and its support of this legislation--reflect its \ndesire that Dr. King's legacy remain alive. I urge the Senate to carry \nits burden in this effort, and to pass the Interior Department's \nrecommendations into law as soon as possible.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 29, 1993.\n     Hon. Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Public Law 104-333, Section 508, 110 \n     STAT. 4157, (1996), authorized the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity \n     to establish a memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr., in the \n     District of Columbia pursuant to the Commemorative Works Act, \n     40 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1001-1010 (1994 & Supp. I 1995).\n       The Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity has requested that the \n     memorial be located in Area I, the area comprising the \n     central Monumental Core of the District of Columbia and its \n     environs, which is defined in section 1002(e) of the \n     Commemorative Works Act by a referenced map. Section 1006(a) \n     of that Act provides that the Secretary of the Interior, \n     after consultation with the National Capital Memorial \n     Commission, may recommend locating a commemorative work in \n     Area I only if the Secretary determines that the subject of \n     the memorial is of preeminent historical and lasting \n     significance to the Nation. If a determination of preeminence \n     and lasting significance is made, this section further \n     provides that the Secretary shall notify the Congress and \n     recommend that the memorial be located in Area I.\n       Following its public meeting on July 29, 1997, the National \n     Capital Memorial Commission advised me that Dr. King, the \n     central figure of the Civil Rights movement, a man who strove \n     to advance the cause of equality for all Americans, and a man \n     who dedicated himself through nonviolent means to promote the \n     principles of justice and equality, who paid the ultimate \n     price for his beliefs, has had a profound effect on all \n     Americans which will continue through history.\n       I have considered the advice and find the subject to be of \n     preeminent historical and lasting significance to the Nation. \n     The Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity should be granted the \n     authority to consider locations within Area I as potential \n     sites for the memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr.\n       In accordance with section 1006(a) of the Act, notice is \n     hereby given that I have, through my designee, consulted with \n     the National Capital Memorial Commission, and recommend that \n     the memorial be authorized a location within Area I. Under \n     section 1006(a) of that Act, my recommendation to locate the \n     memorial in Area I shall be deemed disapproved unless, not \n     later than 150 days after this notification, the \n     recommendation is approved by law.\n       No sites have been considered in advance of this \n     recommendation. Enclosed is a draft of a joint resolution to \n     authorize location of this memorial in Area I. We recommend \n     that it be referred to the appropriate Committee for \n     consideration.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the enactment of the enclosed draft joint \n     resolution from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                    Don Barry,\n\n                                    Acting Assistant Secretary for\n     Fish and Wildlife and Parks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Res. 179\n\n       Whereas, the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg \n     was convened to try individuals for crimes against \n     international law during World War II;\n       Whereas, the Nuremberg tribunal provision which held that \n     ``crimes against international law are committed by men, not \n     by abstract entities, and only by punishing individuals who \n     commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be \n     enforced'' is as valid today as it was in 1946;\n       Whereas, on August 2, 1990 and without provocation, Iraq \n     initiated a war of aggression against the sovereign state of \n     Kuwait;\n\n[[Page S848]]\n\n       Whereas, the Charter of the United Nations imposes on its \n     members the obligations to ``refrain in their international \n     relations from the threat or use of force against the \n     territorial integrity or political independence of any \n     state'';\n       Whereas, the leaders of the Government of Iraq, a country \n     which is a member of the United Nations, did violate this \n     provision of the United Nations Charter;\n       Whereas the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of \n     Civilian Persons in Times of War (the Fourth Geneva \n     Convention) imposes certain obligations upon a belligerent \n     State, occupying another country by force of arms, in order \n     to protect the civilian population of the occupied territory \n     from some of the ravages of the conflict;\n       Whereas, both Iraq and Kuwait are parties to the Fourth \n     Geneva Convention;\n       Whereas, the public testimony of witnesses and victims has \n     indicated that Iraqi officials violated Article 27 of the \n     Fourth Geneva Convention by their inhumane treatment and acts \n     of violence against the Kuwaiti civilian population;\n       Whereas, the public testimony of witnesses and victims has \n     indicated that Iraqi officials violated

Whereas, in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, from \n     January 18, 1991 to February 25, 1991, Iraq did fire 39 \n     missiles on Israel in 18 separate attacks with the intent of \n     making it a party to war and with the intent of killing or \n     injuring innocent civilians, killing two persons directly, \n     killing 12 people indirectly (through heart attacks, improper \n     use of gas masks, choking), and injuring more than 200 \n     persons;\n       Whereas, Article 146 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states \n     that persons committing ``grave breaches'' are to be

of international law;\n       Whereas, in Resolution 665, adopted on August 25, 1990, the \n     United Nations Security Council deplored ``the loss of \n     innocent life stemming from the Iraq invasion of Kuwait'';\n       Whereas, in Resolution 670, adopted by the United Nations \n     Security Council on September 25, 1990, it condemned further \n     ``the treatment by Iraqi forces on Kuwait nationals and \n     reaffirmed that the Fourth Geneva Convention applied to \n     Kuwait'';\n       Whereas, in Resolution 674, the United Nations Security \n     Council demanded that Iraq cease mistreating and oppressing \n     Kuwaiti nationals in violation of the Convention and reminded \n     Iraq that it would be liable for any damage or injury \n     suffered by Kuwaiti nationals due to Iraq's invasion and \n     illegal occupation;\n       Whereas, Iraq is a party to the Prisoners of War Convention \n     and there is evidence and testimony that during the Persian \n     Gulf War, Iraq violated articles of the Convention by its \n     physical and psychological abuse of military and civilian \n     POW's including members of the international press;\n       Whereas, Iraq has committed deliberate and calculated \n     crimes of environmental terrorism, inflicting grave risk to \n     the health and well-being of innocent civilians in the region \n     by its willful ignition of 732 Kuwaiti oil wells in January \n     and February, 1991;\n       Whereas, President Clinton found ``compelling evidence'' \n     that the Iraqi Intelligence Service directed and pursued an \n     operation to assassinate former President George Bush in \n     April 1993 when he visited Kuwait;\n       Whereas, Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials have \n     systematically attempted to destroy the Kurdish population in \n     Iraq through the use of chemical weapons against civilian \n     Kurds, campaigns in 1987-88 which resulted in the \n     disappearance of more than 182,000 persons and the \n     destruction of more than 4,000 villages, the placement of \n     more than 10 million landmines in Iraqi Kurdistan, and ethnic \n     cleansing in the city of Kirkuk;\n       Whereas, the Republic of Iraq is a signatory to \n     international agreements including the Universal Declaration \n     on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights, the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and the POW Convention, \n     and is obligated to comply with these international \n     agreements;\n       Whereas, Section 8 of Resolution 687 of the United Nations \n     Security Council, adopted on April 3, 1991, requires Iraq to \n     ``unconditionally accept the destruction, removal, or \n     rendering harmless, under international supervision of all \n     chemical and biological weapons and all stocks of agents and \n     all related subsystems and components and all research, \n     development, support, and manufacturing facilities'';\n       Whereas, Saddam Hussein and the Republic of Iraq have \n     persistently and flagrantly violated the terms of Resolution \n     687 with respect to elimination of weapons of mass \n     destruction and inspections by international supervisors;\n       Whereas, there is good reason to believe that Iraq \n     continues to have stockpiles of chemical and biological \n     munitions, missiles capable of transporting such agents, and \n     the capacity to produce such weapons of mass destruction, \n     putting the international community at risk;\n       Whereas, on February 22, 1993, the United Nations Security \n     Council adopted Resolution 808 establishing an international \n     tribunal to try individuals accused of violations of \n     international law in the former Yugoslavia;\n       Whereas, on November 8, 1994, the United Nations Security \n     Council adopted Resolution 955 establishing an international \n     tribunal to try individuals accused of the commission of \n     violations of international law in Rwanda;\n       Whereas, more than 70 individuals have faced indictments \n     handed down by the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia in the Hague for war crimes and crimes \n     against humanity in the former Yugoslavia, leading in the \n     first trial to the sentencing of a Serb jailer to 20 years \n     in prison;\n       Whereas, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has \n     indicted 31 individuals, with three trials occurring at \n     present and 27 individuals in custody;\n       Whereas, a failure to try and punish leaders and other \n     persons for crimes against international law establishes a \n     dangerous precedent and negatively impacts the value of \n     deterrence to future illegal acts;\n       Whereas, on February 17, 1998, the President of the United \n     States outlined his policy on engaging in a military action \n     against Iraq and stated that his purpose is ``to seriously \n     diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass \n     destruction program'' and further stated that if a United \n     States military operation does not prevent Saddam Hussein \n     from rebuilding his weapons of mass destruction, future \n     military strikes will be necessary;\n       Whereas, current plans are grossly inadequate because it is \n     insufficient to ``seriously diminish'' the threat posed by \n     Saddam Hussein to the international community through the use \n     of weapons of mass destruction;\n       Whereas, there is a need for a long-term approach to \n     removing Saddam Hussein from his position as President of \n     Iraq; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the President should--\n       (1) call for the creation of a commission under the \n     auspices of the United Nations to establish an international \n     record of the criminal culpability of Saddam Hussein and \n     other Iraqi officials; and\n       (2) call for the United Nations to form an international \n     criminal tribunal for the purpose of indicting, prosecuting, \n     and imprisoning Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials who \n     are responsible for crimes against humanity, genocide, and \n     other violations of international law; and\n       (3) devise a long-term plan, in consultation with allies of \n     the United States, for the removal of Saddam Hussein from his \n     position as President of Iraq, so that he can be prosecuted \n     fully for war crimes and other violations of international \n     law.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I now offer a resolution that seeks to \ndeal with the international crisis caused by Saddam Hussein's amassing \nof weapons of mass destruction. There are reports as of this morning \nthat Secretary General Kofi Annan has solved the problem after \ndiscussions with Saddam Hussein. A diplomatic solution is always \npreferable to a military solution, even though Saddam Hussein has \ncarried the world to the brink of war. Before we will know whether or \nnot Secretary General Kofi Annan has succeeded, we will have to read \nthe fine print.\n  In the event that the Secretary General's efforts to end the crisis \nare unsuccessful, I submit that it is a constitutional imperative that \nCongress consider, debate, deliberate, and vote on a resolution on how \nto deal with this threat before the President takes unilateral action \nwith air and missile strikes.\n  Air and missile strikes constitute acts of war. Under the U.S. \nConstitution, only the Congress has the authority to involve our Nation \nin war. In his constitutional capacity as Commander in Chief, the \nPresident may act in emergencies, but there is now time for \ndeliberative action by the Congress.\n  During the week of February 9, when this issue was the talk of the \ncaucuses and the cloakrooms, Congress spoke loudly by not speaking at \nall because there was no agreement on what should be done. On February \n16, I wrote the President urging that no military action be taken until \nCongress returned from the recess today, February 23. With the prospect \nof unilateral Presidential action, if Secretary General Annan is \nunsuccessful, I believe it is our duty in both the Senate and the House \nto take a position on this obviously critical issue of war or peace \nbefore the President takes unilateral action with a military strike.\n  My resolution is an alternative to the approach outlined by the \nPresident on February 17. Without deciding whether I would vote to \nsupport the President's plan, I am submitting this alternative because \nI think it is a preferable course of action and, perhaps even more \nimportantly, to stimulate debate in the Congress which could produce an \neven better course of U.S. action. The issues that now confront our \nNation are complex, controversial, and could produce unintended \nconsequences. I do not contend that my\n\n[[Page S849]]\n\nresolution provides all the answers, or even necessarily the best \nanswer, but it could lead to the least of the available undesirable \nalternatives, and that is what I think we face, Mr. President--a \nquestion of which is the least of the undesirable alternatives.\n  At the outset, let there be no doubt that it is my view that Saddam \nHussein's amassing weapons of mass destruction is intolerable and must \nbe stopped. If the United States takes action, there must be national \nunity behind our fighting forces, but that doesn't mean giving the \nPresident a blank check in advance by delegating to the executive the \nCongress' constitutional duties.\n  Again, without committing myself on how I will vote if the \nPresident's plan is submitted to Congress in a resolution, I do wish to \nexpress my deep reservations and concerns for the following reasons:\n  First, the President's plan does not reach the core issue of removing \nSaddam Hussein as Iraq's leader or in eliminating his weapons of mass \ndestruction. The maximum result, as articulated by the President in his \nown words, is ``to seriously diminish the threat posed by weapons of \nmass destruction.'' But there is the understanding or concession in \nthat statement that there would only be a serious diminution, not an \nelimination, of weapons of mass destruction. The President then noted \nthat if such weapons are rebuilt, there would be another strike. Such a \nseries of strikes, which could be indefinite for all we know, are \nhardly the answer.\n  Saddam Hussein's continuous flouting of his specific agreements and \nU.S. mandates since 1991 requires removing him from office as the only \nadequate answer.\n  My second concern is that U.S. air and missile strikes, aided only by \nGreat Britain, could materially hurt our position as the world leader, \nor at least as the leader of the free world. We are, after all, seeking \nto enforce the U.N. position on Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass \ndestruction and that Iraq must comply with those U.N. resolutions and \nyield to U.N. inspections.\n  When we arrogate unto ourselves, with only Great Britain's \nconcurrence, the decision to undertake air and missile strikes, on this \nstate of the record, we are likely to be viewed by the world as \narrogant, which is the root meaning of arrogating unto ourselves that \nultimate decision.\n  In my foreign travels, I have found enormous respect and admiration \nfor the United States around the world. People everywhere admire and \nreally envy our freedom, our democratic values, our standard of living, \nand our power. But, in a January trip to Europe, the Mideast and North \nAfrica, I heard virtually unanimous objections to the proposed U.S. air \nand missile strikes on Iraq as an abuse of power and U.S. arrogance. \nThe key part of that arrogance involves projected Iraqi civilian \ncasualties and our insistence on acting as we see fit, contrasted with \nthe views of the other nations, almost uniformly with the exception of \nGreat Britain.\n  Third, air and missile strikes may cause devastating unintended \nconsequences. Our experience has demonstrated that we may expect \nretaliation from terrorists. The bombing of Libya in 1986 produced the \nbombing of Pan Am 103. Our so-called covert proposals against Iran most \nprobably produced the terrorist attack on Khobar Towers in June of \n1996.\n  On the issue of unintended consequences, who can be sure what will \nhappen if we detonate Iraq's biological and chemical weapons of mass \ndestruction and those substances enter the atmosphere? In March 1991, \nallied forces detonated Iraq's chemical weapons at Kamasia. Those \nsubstances became airborne and may have been a significant contributing \ncause to Gulf War syndrome, an issue now under intensive investigation \nby the Veterans Affairs Committee, which I chair.\n  The resolution, which I am submitting today, strikes at the core of \nthe problem: removing Saddam Hussein as Iraq's leader by prosecuting \nhim as an international war criminal; and, if he is not taken into \ncustody as a war criminal, by then implementing a long-term plan for \nhis removal as Iraq's President.\n  My basic proposal to try Saddam Hussein as an international war \ncriminal was advanced on March 5, 1991, at the conclusion of the Gulf \nWar. On that day I introduced a Senate resolution which articulated the \napplicable principles of international law, and then concluded with \nthis clause.\n\n       Resolve . . . , that it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should confer with Kuwait and other member nations \n     of the coalition of the United Nations to establish an \n     international criminal court or an international military \n     tribunal to try and punish all individuals involved in the \n     planning or execution of the above-referenced crimes \n     including Saddam Hussein.\n\n  Had we pursued that course of action at that time we would very \nlikely--almost certainly, in fact--be in a different position today.\n  Since my resolution was offered, and this is an ongoing effort which \nI have made, along with Congressman Jim Leach in the House, and Senator \nChristopher Dodd here in the Senate, a War Crimes Tribunal has been \nestablished by U.N. Security Council Resolution 808 on February 22, \n1993, establishing an international tribunal to try individuals accused \nof international war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, and Resolution \n955 adopted on November 8, 1994, to establish a similar war crimes \ntribunal for Rwanda. By extending the jurisdiction to Iraq, the War \nCrimes Tribunal could prosecute Saddam Hussein.\n\n  There is an abundance of evidence which would warrant the conviction \nof Saddam Hussein and the imposition of the death penalty. While the \nU.N. resolutions on the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda do not provide for \nthe death penalty, the United Nations may well be persuaded that Saddam \nHussein's conduct warrants the death penalty. I believe the evidence \nspeaks loudly to that effect. Beyond his war of aggression against \nKuwait and his missile attacks killing U.S. personnel in Saudi Arabia \nand Israelis in Tel Aviv, there is powerful evidence of Saddam \nHussein's systematic action to destroy the population of civilian Kurds \nin Iraq through the use of chemical weapons in 1997-1998, with more \nthan 182,000 missing persons and the destruction of more than 4,000 \nvillages, including the placement of more than 10 million land mines in \nIraq's Kurdistan and ethnic cleansing in the city of Kurkuk.\n  Those international crimes certainly warrant the death penalty by all \nexisting standards. With an international judicial determination that \nthe death penalty should be imposed on Saddam Hussein, we would then \nhave the high moral ground to carry out that verdict.\n  The removal of Saddam Hussein as Iraq's President does pose questions \nas to who would take over and what would happen to Iraq's ability to \ncounterbalance Iran in that region. It is hard to imagine an \ninternational situation worse than the one currently posed by Saddam \nHussein, and it is hard to imagine a new Iraqi leader worse than Saddam \nHussein. It may well be that a covert action or covert actions might \nsucceed in deposing Saddam Hussein. That was the subject of an op-ed \npiece in the New York Times yesterday by former CIA Director John \nDeutch. The Voice of America could be intensified giving encouragement \nto his many enemies in Iraq. An alternative government could be \nestablished with those dissident forces. And, a no-fly zone could be \nestablished over all of Iraq. A naval blockade could further tighten \nthe noose and perhaps bring Saddam Hussein to his knees. These and \nother proposals could lead to his removal without targeting him.\n  As a generalization, our national policy is sound, not to kill a \nforeign leader for political purposes. But it is important to note that \nthat prohibition is mandated only by a Presidential Executive order. It \ndoes not have the force of law of congressional enactment.\n  Let me now pursue a series of questions relating to that policy.\n  First, should that policy be applied to Saddam Hussein after he \nattempted to assassinate former President George Bush?\n  Second, should that policy be applied to Saddam Hussein, considering \nhis atrocious record of war crimes, or at least after he is convicted \nand sentenced to death?\n  Three, would targeting Saddam Hussein constitute a lesser use of \nforce and a more justifiable use of force than the President's \ncontemplated air and missile strikes?\n  Fourth, is it time to reexamine that policy as it applies to the \nlikes of Saddam Hussein?\n\n[[Page S850]]\n\n  Fifth, is it sensible to tie our own hands for self-defense by such a \nPresidential Executive order when Saddam Hussein amasses weapons of \nmass destruction which threaten the United States and the whole world \nwith horrible consequences?\n  Sixth, if we are justified in preemptive air and missile strikes, \nwhich will inevitably kill Iraqi civilians, why are we not justified in \npreemptive actions against Saddam Hussein who is a mass murderer and a \ncertified international war criminal?\n  Mr. President, it is a rapidly changing world scene. It is time to \nconsider those questions.\n  I have no doubt about two propositions. First, a trial of Saddam \nHussein as an international war criminal would be preeminently just. \nSecond, solving the international threat posed by Iraq's weapons of \nmass destruction mandates removing Saddam Hussein as Iraq's leader. \nPerhaps Saddam Hussein could be replaced by the people of Iraq with \nadditional U.N. sanctions, a stronger Voice of America, and nonlethal \ncovert action. If not, then we may have to change our answers to those \nsix questions, just as Saddam Hussein has changed the world with his \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to the \nPresident, dated February 16, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                Committee on Veterans' Affairs\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 16, 1998.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I strongly urge you not to take \n     military action against Iraq until Congress has an \n     opportunity to consider a resolution to authorize the use of \n     force.\n       Bomber and missile strikes constitute acts of war. Only \n     Congress has the Constitutional prerogative to authorize war. \n     The Congress spoke loudly last week by not speaking at all. \n     It is not too long to wait until next week for Congress to \n     consider and vote on this issue.\n       Our national experience in Vietnam is a relatively recent \n     reminder that public and Congressional support are \n     indispensable to successful military involvement. I am glad \n     to note you plan to address the nation tomorrow night. I held \n     five town meetings last Monday and Friday, and can tell you \n     that my constituents are very uneasy about air and missile \n     strikes. There are concerns about inflicting casualties on \n     innocent Iraqis, about potential terrorist reprisals, and the \n     possibilities of expanding the conflict.\n       There is general agreement that Saddam Hussein is an \n     intolerable menace and cannot be alloweded to threaten the \n     world with weapons of mass destruction. But are there near-\n     term alternatives such as a blockade to tighten the noose on \n     his oil exports? Or can our allies be persuaded to tighten \n     economic sanctions if they will not join us on the use of \n     force?\n       I compliment Secretary Cohen and Secretary Albright, but \n     their visits have not produced the coalition which was formed \n     for the successful prosecution of the 1991 Gulf War. Have you \n     considered personal meetings with the leaders of France, \n     Russia, China, Germany, Egypt, etc?\n       There has been unanimity in our Congressional discussions \n     to support the men and women of our military forces. But that \n     unanimity does not extend to giving the President a blank \n     check when the Constitution calls for independent \n     Congressional action to decide whether to involve the United \n     States in war.\n       There is yet time to pursue alternatives. Diplomacy and \n     other sanctions short of war should be given every chance to \n     work.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues \nto leave the door to NATO open. Others, whose wisdom I respect, have \ncome before the Senate to urge that we legislatively adopt a policy \nthat would close the door to NATO membership to candidate countries, \nregardless of their qualifications. While the reasons advanced in \nsupport of that view carry weight, I do not believe that they outweigh \nthe reasons for leaving the door open.\n  Last year, as Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation \nin Europe, I chaired a series of hearings at which ambassadors of \ncandidate countries appeared and testified concerning their respective \ncountries' reasons and qualifications for joining NATO. At the end of \nthat series of hearings, we issued a report urging that Poland, the \nCzech Republic, Hungary, Romania, and Slovenia be included in the first \nround of NATO expansion. Since that time, ten months ago, I believe \nthat subsequent developments have supported strongly the conclusion \nthat we drew in favor of NATO expansion.\n  Now, the Senate is close to voting on the admission of Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic. I intend to vote for expansion. These \ncountries have each proven that they share our democratic and free \nenterprise values, that they want to be members of NATO, and that they \nare willing to join us in bearing the burdens that Alliance membership \nimposes.\n  Mr. President, I want to take particular note that each of these \ncountries, contrary to the positions taken by some of our allies of \nlonger standing, have not hesitated to publicly state their support for \nour effort to persuade, and if necessary, compel Saddam Hussein to \ncomply with the United Nations Security Council resolutions adopted \nafter Iraq's unprovoked military aggression against Kuwait. One of the \ntests of alliance is the political will to take risks for the common\n\n[[Page S851]]\n\ngood of the group. Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary have met \nthis test.\n  As I stated earlier, our recommendation ten months ago was that \nSlovenia and Romania be included in the first group of countries \nconsidered for NATO membership. That did not happen. But neither \nSlovenia nor Romania recoiled from their rejection by NATO. In fact, \nboth have persisted in policies readying their countries and their \nmilitaries for NATO membership, and have been vocally enthusiastic \nabout the prospect.\n  On July 8th, 1997, the ``Madrid Declaration on Euro-Atlantic Security \nand Cooperation'' was issued by the Heads of State and Government of \nNATO. Paragraph 8 of the Madrid Declaration stated that, and I quote:\n\n       We reaffirm that NATO remains open to new members under \n     Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty. The Alliance will \n     continue to welcome new members in a position to further \n     principles of the Treaty and contribute to security in the \n     Euro-Atlantic area. The Alliance expects to extend further \n     invitations in coming years to nations willing and able to \n     assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership, \n     and as NATO determines that the inclusion of these nations \n     would serve the overall political and strategic interests of \n     the Alliance and that the inclusion would enhance overall \n     European security and stability. To give substance to this \n     commitment, NATO will maintain an active relationship with \n     those nations that have expressed an interest in NATO \n     membership as well as those who may wish to seek membership \n     in the future. Those nations that have previously expressed \n     an interest in becoming NATO members but that were not \n     invited to begin accession talks today will remain under \n     consideration for future membership. The considerations set \n     forth in our 1995 Study on NATO Enlargement will continue to \n     apply with regard to future aspirants, regardless of their \n     geographic location. No European democratic country whose \n     admission would fulfill the objectives of the Treaty will be \n     excluded from consideration. Furthermore, in order to enhance \n     overall security and stability in Europe, further steps in \n     the ongoing enlargement process of the Alliance should \n     balance the security concerns of all Allies.\n\n  Mr. President, those words sound like a promise to me. Perhaps more \nimportantly, they recognized a central fact. That fact is that by \nsetting an artificial limit to NATO enlargement, we are drawing a new \ndividing line across Europe. Whether that line is geographic or \ntemporal does not matter. When such a line is drawn, in the present \nenvironment it creates a gray area. History teaches us that gray areas \nare not solutions, they are problems waiting to happen.\n  Other candidate NATO members do not want to be consigned to gray \nareas. They know that bad things happen to small countries left alone \nin gray areas. We know that we do not want to create situations that \ninvite anti-democratic forces to grow and plan and act.\n  At the Commission, we pay very close attention to human rights \nconcerns in Europe. Our experience with NATO enlargement has been that \nthe requirements countries must meet for consideration for NATO \nmembership have very strongly influenced their domestic politics. While \nall human rights problems are not resolved, most of them are. Also, \ndisputes between ethnic majority and minority groups are given \nprominence and progress is made toward solutions. Some of these \nproblems have existed for centuries and, in my view, would have \ncontinued unaddressed but for the necessity each country has seen to \n``put its house in order'' before applying for NATO membership.\n\n  Moreover, international cross-border disputes that in the past have \ntriggered at least hostility if not military conflict have been \nformally resolved, with the support of democratic majorities in the \ncountries involved. This is not a trivial development in a part of the \nworld where such disputes have given repeated rise to brutal conflicts \nthat are incomprehensible to most Americans.\n  For these reasons, it is vitally important that the door to NATO \nmembership not be closed, especially not by the United States. \nProponents argue that a ``delay'' is necessary as a period of \nconsolidation of the Alliance, and for the Russians to accommodate \nthemselves to the changed European landscape.\n  I believe that ``delay'' in this case could become denial, with very \ngrave consequences to those nations shut out by such a decision. \nMoreover, Russia is one of the nations I have in mind when I make this \nstatement. Regardless of rhetoric by Russian Communists like \nZhirinovsky, and others of the so-called ``red-brown'' extreme \nnationalist fringe, Russia itself has a very real interest in NATO \nexpansion. And that interest is not in blocking, delaying, or limiting \nit.\n  In fact, to the extent that NATO expansion is delayed or limited, the \nradical forces in Russia's political equation will be strengthened. For \nthe United States to provide them with a victory they could not have \nsecured by any other means would be a terrible mistake. Radical forces \nin Russia cannot be appeased by throwing them a bone. All it does is \nembolden them and add to their power, allowing them to say to Russian \nvoters, ``See what we can do, and we are not yet in charge of the \ngovernment.'' Our policy should be to do what is best for us, and that \nmeans to give hope, support and security to small states trying to \nbecome democratic capitalist members of the Western community, and \ntreat anti-democratic forces with implacable opposition.\n  Mr. President, the citizens of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia were \ngiven hope when we refused for the duration of the Cold War to \nrecognize their forcible and illegal incorporation into the Soviet \nUnion. Ukraine is now a NATO ``Partner for Peace.'' The President of \nBulgaria, Petar Stoyanov, was here recently, seeing President Clinton \nto make the case that Bulgaria is a credible candidate for NATO \nmembership. The people of these countries do not deserve to have the \ndoor to NATO slammed shut on their fingers.\n  While some states with serious human rights and democratization \nproblems do not look like possible NATO members at any time in the near \nfuture, as states around them make major efforts to put their domestic \nand international affairs in order to quality for membership, this has \nan influence and an impact. If we do as we have pledged, and allow \ncandidate countries to join when they demonstrate that they meet \nthe qualifications, those who choose not to make the effort will be \nmore and more isolated. This process will undermine and weaken anti-\ndemocratic forces that have stirred back to life in some former Warsaw \nPact states after the fall of Communism.\n\n  I want to make one other point. When the Commission issued its \nreport, I reminded the Senate that NATO is a military alliance. A look \nat the map will refresh my colleagues' understanding of the need to \ninclude Romania and Slovenia in the next round of expansion. After \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are admitted, we will have an \nAlliance with a member, Hungary, which lacks a land corridor connecting \nit with other Alliance members. This is a weakness of major importance, \none whose significance can only be magnified if we artificially \n``delay'' accession of other qualified candidates. This point also \nfocuses attention on Bulgaria's desire to become, when it is qualified, \nan Alliance member.\n  The Washington Post's Wednesday, February 11, 1998 edition contains \nan editorial and a separate article that support my perspective on this \nissue. The editorial entitled ``Opening NATO's Door,'' states that, and \nI quote:\n\n       There is a moral heart to the case for enlargement, and it \n     is to bind the democracies, refreshing the old, strengthening \n     the new. The first three candidates have demonstrated they \n     are committed to assuming alliance responsibilities. Their \n     accession would, as Secretary of State Albright put it \n     Monday, `make us all safer by expanding the area of Europe \n     where wars do not happen.' The resulting increments of \n     stability would benefit not only NATO members but the \n     Russians, who remain opposed to the development but are \n     unable to stop it.\n       The serious American objection to enlargement comes from \n     strategists who fear the political and military dilution of \n     an alliance once focused laser-like on territorial defense \n     against a single dangerous foe. These strategists would have \n     the European Union do the main work of easing the path of the \n     new democracies, leaving NATO to deal with a still-\n     problematic Russia and its huge residual nuclear resource. \n     But the would leave the now-free pieces of the old Soviet \n     empire marooned in strategic ambiguity. The new democracies \n     need better and deserve it.\n\n  The article, entitled ``NATO Candidates Urge Senators to Back \nExpansion,'' by Edward Walsh, is also important. It quotes the foreign \nministers of\n\n[[Page S852]]\n\nPoland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary as supporting the continued \nexpansion of NATO when other candidate states are ready to join. Here \nis the description of what they said, and I quote:\n\n       Geremek said other Central and Eastern European countries \n     that hope to join NATO were disappointed to be left out of \n     the first proposed expansion round but ``they are happy that \n     the expansion will take place and feel it will increase their \n     security.''\n       Enacting legislation requiring a three- to five-year wait \n     before others could join NATO, as some have suggested, would \n     send a discouraging message to these countries, the officials \n     argued. ``The purpose of the enlargement is to diminish the \n     dividing lines [in Europe], not to create new lines of \n     division between the new members of NATO and those who stay \n     outside,'' Kovacs said.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of both the editorial and the \narticle from which I have just quoted be included in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  I urge my colleagues to support NATO expansion. It is the right thing \nto do for America, the right thing to do for the Alliance, and the \nright thing to do for the people of Central and Eastern Europe who \nstruggled so long in a seemingly hopeless quest for freedom and \nindependence. We supported them then, and we must continue to support \nthem now.\n  The material follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 11, 1998]\n\n                          Opening NATO's Door\n\n       As the Senate moves to the question of ratifying NATO \n     enlargement, the debate is in a curious place. It is \n     generally accepted that adding Poland, Hungary and the Czech \n     Republic to the 16-nation Atlantic Alliance will be approved \n     by well over the necessary two-thirds when the vote comes \n     probably next spring. Yet several years of intense discussion \n     have not removed all serious doubts about the step. Even \n     among supporters, misgivings about adding further members \n     later are evident.\n       There is a moral heart to the case for enlargement, and it \n     is to bind the democracies, refreshing the old, strengthening \n     the new. The first three candidates have demonstrated they \n     are committed to assuming alliance responsibilities. Their \n     accession would, as Secretary of State Albright put it \n     Monday, ``make us all safer by expanding the area of Europe \n     where wars do not happen.'' The resulting increments of \n     stability would benefit not only NATO members but the \n     Russians, who remain opposed to the development but are \n     unable to stop it.\n       The serious American objection to enlargement comes from \n     strategists who fear the political and military dilution of \n     an alliance once focused laser-like on territorial defense \n     against a single dangerous foe. These strategists would have \n     the European Union do the main work of easing the path of the \n     new democracies, leaving NATO to deal with a still-\n     problematic Russia and its huge residual nuclear resource. \n     But that would leave the now-free pieces of the old Soviet \n     empire marooned in strategic ambiguity. The new democracies \n     need better and deserve it. The EU should move more quickly \n     but cannot fairly be asked to satisfy the full range of their \n     wish to be of the West. Their insecurity could rub events raw \n     and unsettle the region.\n       The different currents of resistance to enlargement meet in \n     common opposition to taking in any more than Central Europe's \n     favored three. This is the impulse behind suggestions of a \n     legislated ``pause.'' Such a maneuver, tying the hands of \n     executive-branch foreign policymakers, is a truly bad idea. \n     It could generate nervousness verging on desperation among \n     the unfavored of Central Europe, and tempt others to throw \n     their weight around.\n       The better way surely is, with Secretary Albright, to leave \n     the NATO door open. Other democracies, as they meet the \n     rigorous political as well as military standards for alliance \n     membership, will then be able to assert their claim to be \n     brought into the charmed circle. Time will let the allies \n     show that enlargement, far from simply moving a military bloc \n     menacingly closer to Russia's borders, calms the region as a \n     whole.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 11, 1998]\n\n            NATO Candidates Urge Senators to Back Expansion\n\n                           (By Edward Walsh)\n\n       Pressing for Senate ratification of an agreement to admit \n     their countries to NATO, senior officials from three Central \n     European countries said yesterday that enlarging the military \n     alliance would enhance stability in that region.\n       Foreign Ministers Laszlo Kovacs of Hungary and Bronislaw \n     Geremek of Poland and Deputy Foreign Minister Karel Kovanda \n     of the Czech Republic visited key senators yesterday and \n     Monday as part of the campaign to win the two-thirds Senate \n     vote necessary for ratification. President Clinton is \n     scheduled to send the expansion agreement, formally known as \n     Protocols of Accession, to the Senate today. The Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee has scheduled at least one more \n     hearing on the agreement for Feb. 24 before a full Senate \n     vote, probably this spring.\n       At a breakfast meeting with Washington Post reporters and \n     editors, the officials said Senate concerns about the \n     agreement center on the cost of the expansion and its impact \n     on U.S.-Russian relations. Russia last year agreed to the \n     expansion, which NATO officials have estimated will cost $1.5 \n     billion over 10 years, with the United States paying about 25 \n     percent of that amount. Other estimates have set the figure \n     significantly higher.\n       Pointing to numerous potential ``trouble spots'' in the \n     region, Kovacs said NATO and the United States ``have two \n     options--to stay idle and wait for the next crisis, then to \n     intervene and try to enforce peace, which is more expensive \n     and certainly more risky, or to enlarge NATO, projecting \n     stability. The new members will further project stability.''\n       Kovacs and Geremek said public opinion in their countries \n     supported joining NATO. Polls in the Czech Republic, Kovanda \n     said, show 55 percent to 60 percent support, but also 15 \n     percent to 20 percent who are ``diehard opponents.''\n       Geremek said other Central and Eastern European countries \n     that hope to join NATO were disappointed to be left out of \n     the first proposed expansion round but ``they are happy that \n     the expansion will take place and feel it will increase their \n     security.''\n       Enacting legislation requiring a three- to five-year wait \n     before others could join NATO, as some have suggested, would \n     send a discouraging message to these countries, the officials \n     argued. ``The purpose of the enlargement is to diminish the \n     dividing lines [in Europe], not to create new lines of \n     division between the new members of NATO and those who stay \n     outside,'' Kovacs said.\n       Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), a senior member of the Armed \n     Services Committee, said in a statement to the Senate \n     yesterday he intends to propose a three-year moratorium on \n     further NATO expansion as a condition to the resolution of \n     ratification for the admission of Poland, Hungary and the \n     Czech Republic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S850-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO STEVE DAHL\n\n Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, in his State of the Union Address last \nmonth, President Clinton urged Congress to approve his request to pump \nbillions of dollars into the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help \nstabilize Asian economies. He justified his request by saying that \n``preparing for a far off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser \nthan ignoring the thunder 'til the clouds are just overhead.''\n  There is something to be said for trying to deal with problems before \nthey grow too large--before they engulf us. We will have a debate about \nthe propriety of the IMF request in the weeks ahead. But I would \nsuggest that it is not just the IMF that is attempting to deal with an \napproaching storm.\n  Mr. President, millions of Americans are also looking ahead to be \nsure they can cope with unforeseen threats to their own family's future \nfinancial security. Some people are trying to create a nest egg for \ntheir retirement years. Some take out a life-insurance policy or buy an \nannuity to ensure that a spouse or child is taken care of when they are \ngone. Others are looking for a way to pay death taxes without creating \ntoo much hardship for their families. Whatever the coming storm might \nbe, they are trying to find a way to prepare. And most of us would \nconsider that to be good planning--something the federal government \nwould want to encourage.\n  Unfortunately, while the Clinton administration eagerly argues the \nbenefits of pouring billions of dollars into the IMF to help other \ncountries, it cannot seem to see a benefit in helping our\n\n[[Page S853]]\n\nown citizens to ward off their own personal storm clouds. I am \nreferring to the provisions in the President's proposed budget that \nwould impose significant tax increases on people who try to save and \ninvest for the future, including people who take out life insurance or \nbuy annuities to protect themselves and their families.\n  President Clinton's budget calls the existing tax treatment of life \ninsurance and annuities ``unwarranted.'' But the Washington Post has \nidentified the President's proposed changes as an effort to ``slam \n[the] middle class.''\n  Let us put this issue in context. Personal savings rates in our \ncountry have been on the decline since 1981, when they stood at 9.4 \npercent. Some say that was respectable by international standards. By \n1992, the savings rate had declined to 6.2 percent, and it has plunged \nduring the Clinton years. As of last November, the personal savings \nrate stood at 3.8 percent--the lowest since the Great Depression. In \nother words, people are not setting much aside for their future needs, \nincluding retirement.\n  Add to that the problems we all know are coming in the Social \nSecurity system. The experts are telling us that Social Security \nrecipients currently receive, on average, benefits equal to 43 percent \nof their pre-retirement earnings. But then they point out that only 70 \npercent of that amount is fully funded for future retirees, which means \nthat unless taxes are raised substantially or additional funding is \nfound, retirees in the future will only get a benefit that amounts to \nless than 30 percent of their pre-retirement income.\n  In other words, retirees in the future are likely to experience a \nsignificant decline in their standard of living unless they find some \nway to supplement their Social Security benefits. That means saving and \ninvesting more, contributing to an IRA, buying an annuity, or taking \nout a good life insurance policy. We ought to make it as easy as \npossible for people to do that.\n  However, the Clinton budget means to take us in the opposite \ndirection. For example, it would impose new taxes on individuals who \nsubstitute one insurance policy for another policy that better meets \ntheir needs. We are talking here about new taxes, primarily on \nhouseholds with incomes under $75,000. Many people in this group work \nfor employers who do not offer, or who have terminated, a retirement \nplan. So unless they find some other way to protect themselves, they \ncould be out in the cold when they retire.\n  The proposed budget would make it harder for businesses to protect \nthemselves with business life insurance. It seems to me entirely \nreasonable that a business would want--and need--insurance to minimize \nthe costs that would result from the death of a key employee. That is \nparticularly true of small businesses, whose size means that so much of \nits success depends upon a few individuals.\n  The Clinton budget would overturn so-called Crummey powers, making it \nharder for moderate income families to even pay death taxes. That alone \nsets up a major confrontation with many of us in Congress who believe \nthat death taxes ought to be eliminated altogether.\n  These substantive problems with the Clinton plan come on top of what \nmany of us consider a reneging by the President on last year's budget \nagreement. Only seven months after entering into that agreement, which \nprovided for very modest tax relief--relief amounting to $95.3 billion \nover five years--the President is proposing a net tax increase of $98.1 \nbillion. In other words, the entire amount of tax relief approved just \nseven months ago would be reclaimed in one fell swoop.\n  Not only does that back track on the promise to provide tax relief, \nbut it comes at the same time that the President is proposing to bust \nthe spending limits that were established in last year's agreement. \nSpending levels would exceed the agreed-upon limits by more than $37 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, the federal government is collecting record amounts of \ntax revenue, primarily as a result of robust economic growth. We do not \nneed another tax increase, let alone a tax increase that singles out \nthe very tools people need to protect themselves against threats to \ntheir personal security. We must reject the unwarranted tax increases \nproposed in this budget, and instead consider tax policies that will \nmake it easier for people to save and invest. Families need tax relief, \nnot new burdens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S852-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S853-S854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NATIONAL CHARACTER COUNTS WEEK RESOLUTION\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to again join Senator \nDomenici as an original cosponsor of S. Res. 186, a resolution \ndesignating the week of October 18-24, 1998, as ``National Character \nCounts Week.'' As he does every year, Senator Domenici again introduced \nthis resolution on behalf of the bipartisan membership of the Senate \nCharacter Counts Group, and I want to thank him for his continuing \nleadership on this important effort.\n  For those of you who are not familiar with Character Counts, the \nnational Character Counts Coalition is an alliance of hundreds of \ngroups, communities, and individuals who share a concern about the \nmoral compass of our country. I know a lot of us here in the Senate \nshare this concern about the wrong direction that many of our young \npeople seem to be headed.\n  Character Counts was born out of a meeting of some of our country's \nbest thinkers and doers about five years ago. Character Counts is an \neffort that says to all of us, parents, educators, church and youth \nleaders, community and business leaders, let us constantly by action \nand example reinforce six basic values, or pillars of character. These \npillars of character are so important and so basic that I do not think \nanyone could question them. They are: trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship.\n  I have two young children, so I know firsthand how difficult it is \nfor kids to make the right choices when they are constantly being \nbombarded by messages from our popular culture about how cool it is to \ndrink alcohol, or smoke, or use vulgar language. By the time they \nfinish elementary school, most kids have seen 8,000 murders on \ntelevision.\n  To counteract these messages, it is more important than ever that we \ninstill in our young people the integrity and good character to stand \nup for what is right. Children are not born with good character. They \nlearn by example, and if they have good role models all around them, I \nam confident they will make the correct choices for themselves. Perhaps \nTeddy Roosevelt said it best: ``To educate a person in mind and not \nmorals is to educate a menace to society.''\n  We often tell our kids to do what is right, but unfortunately, kids \nwitness adult actions that do not reinforce that message. For example, \nI have spoken on this floor several times about the case of Juan C., a \n15-year-old New York high school student who brought a gun to school in \n1992.\n  The facts of this case stand common sense on its head and send a \nterrible message to students. In 1992, Juan C. was stopped by a school \nsecurity guard who saw a bulge resembling the handle of a gun inside \nJuan's leather jacket. The guard grabbed for the bulge, which was \nindeed a loaded .45 semiautomatic handgun.\n  Juan was charged with criminal weapon possession violations. He was \nalso expelled from school for one year, as is consistent with the \n``zero tolerance'' law written by Senator Feinstein and me to prevent \nguns in our schools.\n  The family court that heard Juan's criminal case ruled that the \nsecurity guard did not have reasonable suspicion to search this \nstudent. As a result, the court refused to admit the gun as evidence of \nJuan's court. The New York appellate court then took this decision to \nridiculous lengths by applying the same reasoning to the internal \nschool disciplinary action against the student to expel him for a year.\n  This was a ludicrous decision from a court. It sent a message to \nstudents that there will be no consequences for bringing a loaded gun \nto school, even though that is clearly against school rules and the \nlaw. In some cases, like this one, it tells school officials that they \nought to look the other way when they know a student is carrying a \nloaded weapon.\n  With these kinds of messages, it is no wonder that our children are \nconfused about what is right and wrong. Fortunately, this case was \nultimately overturned, and I have also taken the step\n\n[[Page S854]]\n\nof introducing the Safer Schools Act, along with Senators Feinstein, \nCleland, Coverdell, Johnson, and Landrieu, to send a clear message to \nschool officials, parents, and students that guns seized from students \non school premises can and will be used as evidence in a school \ndisciplinary hearing. I hope the Congress will act on my bill soon so \nthat the confusing messages the courts have been sending on this issue \nare cleared up.\n  We all have a role in ensuring that our children are given the \nethical tools they need to make difficult choices in today's world. \nQuite simply, that is what the Character Counts effort is all about.\n  Before closing, I want to take a few minutes to highlight the \nCharacter Counts efforts that have been occurring in North Dakota. Less \nthan two years ago, Character Counts in North Dakota was borne out of a \nmeeting I hosted to bring together parents, educators, young people, \nand other concerned citizens to introduce them to what the Character \nCounts program is all about. In the last year, under the vigorous and \ncapable leadership of 4-H youth leader Geri Bosch, Character Counts has \nblossomed. More than 800 people in North Dakota have participated in \nCharacter Counts training so that they could take this program, or a \nvariation of it, back to their communities. Several communities in \nNorth Dakota are considering adopting a comprehensive Character Counts \nprogram. Service clubs are adopting Character Counts among their \nprojects, and Character Counts was even used as the platform for one of \nour state's Miss North Dakota candidates last year. Most importantly, \nthe lives of thousands of young people in North Dakota have been \ninfluenced for the better directly and indirectly.\n  I have been proud to play some small role in supporting Character \nCounts in North Dakota and our nation. It is through these kinds of \nefforts that we can build a better future for our kids, and I pledge my \ncontinued help and support for teaching the pillars of good \ncharacter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S853-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE LIFE OF STANLEY O.

Then, goals become the navigational \nstars to guide you in the vision.''--Stanley O. McNaughton.\n  These are the words Stanley O. McNaughton lived by until his sudden \ndeath on January 19th.\n  Stan McNaughton was a man who rose from modest beginnings in a small \nBritish Columbia town, who would later become the CEO of PEMCO \nFinancial Services and who would leave behind one of the greatest \nlegacies of goodwill Washington state will ever see.\n  I could spend an evening recounting Stan's business successes. I \ncould spend even greater time speaking of Stan's dedication to \ncommunity service, his exceptional character, integrity and the \ncountless personal accolades. Yet the two worlds are intertwined. The \nman who was once named Seattle-King County First Citizen and Seattle \nUniversity alumnus of the year relied on the same values to achieve \npersonal and professional success and improve the lives of others.\n  As Stan used to say, ``Our security lies in our values. And from \nvalues flow principles.''\n  Stan placed profound importance on family, philanthropy, and \nleadership.\n  Stan donated money to causes involving children and education, and \noften said: ``A corporation is the greatest vehicle ever created to do \ngood. Corporations have a responsibility to raise the quality of life \nin the communities where they do business.''\n  I know I can speak for all of us by saying: Stan McNaughton succeeded \nin leaving his community a better place.\n  Tomorrow in Olympia, the extraordinary life of Stan McNaughton will \nbe honored with a Medal of Merit, one of the highest awards that the \nState of Washington can bestow upon a citizen. to quote from the \nresolution: ``Stanley O. McNaughton exemplified the best \ncharacteristics of an employer and community leader by his constant \nconcern and activities for those employed by him and others in the \ncommunity.''\n  Stan had the amazing ability to see the potential in everyone, \ninspiring his employees, friends and family to be the best they could \npossibly be. There are countless ``Stan stories'': the woman who \nremembered the time Stan sent her child a birthday card; the man who \nlost his wallet and Stan offered to reimburse the money; the donations \nto charities, particularly those that benefitted people disadvantaged \nthrough no fault of their own; and his special efforts to know every \nname of the more than 1,000 PEMCO employees.\n  Of course, there is the definitive ``Stan story'' of the great \nlengths he went to for one of his employees, Mark Roberts who had \nbroken his neck and become paralyzed from the neck down. Stan could \nhave sent a card or even a bouquet of flowers, but in true Stan \nMcNaughton fashion, Stan went the extra mile. He assured Mark he would \nstill have a career at PEMCO and went about changing the dynamics of \nMark's job. By computerizing much of the workload, Stan made it \npossible for Mark to succeed and recover from what would have \nordinarily been a career ending accident. Stan even went so far as to \nbuy Mark a specialized van, for his professional and personal use.\n  Stan McNaughton touched the lives of so many different people. His \npersonal philosophy of seeing life as a batting average: ``You must \ngive people enough chances at bat'' represents the spirit of this great \nleader and sets an example for all of us to follow.\n  My heart goes out to his wife Clare of 55 years, his six children, \nand 10 grandchildren.\n  Stnaley O. McNaughton will be very much missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S854-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S854-S855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DAN & WHIT'S\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if there is one thing that anyone \nwho visits Norwich, Vermont does not forget, it is Dan & Whit's General \nStore. Dan & Whit's is a Vermont legend, as are its namesakes, Dan \nFraser and Whit Hicks, who bought the store back in 1955. Since then it \nhas become the unrivaled nerve center of business, socializing, and \npolitical debate for Norwich and the surrounding area. Whit died a \nwhile back, Dan has since retired and his wife Eliza, known to all as \nBunny, who did the bookkeeping, died not long ago. But the store has \nnot lost any of the Vermont character they gave to it. Fortunately it \nhas stayed in the family. Today it is managed by Dan's sons George and \nJack Fraser, with the help of George's wife Susan, Jack's daughter \nCheri, George's sons Dan and Matt, and a throng of loyal employees, \nyoung and old.\n  When you first enter Dan & Whit's you think it is just another \ngrocery store. Of course there is a lot more Vermont maple syrup and \ncheddar cheese. But then you notice winter boots and snowshoes hanging \nfrom the ceiling, and boxes of nuts and bolts and nails and screws and \nevery type of hardware. There are pots and pans, outdoor clothing, pens \nand stationery, guns and ``No Hunting'' signs. Keep walking and you \npass piles of the ``New York Times'' and the paint mixing machine, and \nthen you realize you have barely scratched the surface. Through a door \nand around a corner there are aisles that stretch almost as far as you \ncan see, stacked high with snow shovels, horse feed, half a dozen sizes \nof stove pipe, sheep fence, sewing pipe, sleds, saws and axes, rakes \nand wheelbarrows, mail boxes, window glass, there's no end to it. You \ncan even bring in your fire extinguishers for recharging, Jack being \nthe Captain of the Norwich Fire Department. Thus the Dan & Whit's \nmotto, ``if we don't have it, you don't need it.'' Vermont author Noel \nPerrin once wrote, ``There may be a better general store in the United \nStates. But I haven't heard of it.''\n  Mr. President, Dan & Whit's General Store is the unbelievable number \nand variety of things you can buy there, but it is also the \nextraordinary people who work there. In addition to the Fraser family \nmembers, it is people like Larry Smith, Linda Conrad, Al Langlois, Ron \nSwift, and Perry Wagner, who have been there for years and help make \nthe store the one-of-a-kind place that it is. Dan & Whit's is people \nlike Bill Fitzgerald, who finally retired after more than 30 years. \nAlways in good spirits, always helpful, always finding what you need. \nAnd the one time in a million that they don't find\n\n[[Page S855]]\n\nit, they will convince you that you did not need it in the first place.\n  Recently, ``The Norwich Times'' printed an article about Dan & Whit's \nthat says it better than I can. I ask that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                 If We Don't Have It, You Don't Need It\n\n       What has 22,600 square feet of space (but you'd never know \n     it), and is filled with great stuff like aerators, Sorels, \n     and the Sunday Times?\n       The legendary Dan & Whit's has stretched out along Main \n     Street ever since the Merrill family opened their grain store \n     in this location in 1891. At that time, the wandering \n     building with the now-creaky wooden floors also housed \n     Norwich's post office, town hall, and several small shops. \n     Today, under the diligent management of owners George and \n     Jack Fraser, this nerve center of Norwich is open seven days \n     a week from seven o'clock in the morning until nine o'clock \n     at night, three hundred and sixty four days a year.\n\n\n                           all in the family\n\n       In 1955, Dan Fraser and his partner Whit Hicks bought it \n     from Leon Merrill for whom they had worked since 1933. Dan \n     and Whit plunged right in, expanding their merchandise to \n     include newspapers, guns, beer, and wine. As the line of \n     merchandise and inventory continually expanded, family \n     members helped out. First it was Dan Fraser and his wife \n     Bunny running it with Whit and Grace Hicks. Also at that \n     time, grandfather John pitched in and cemented the basement \n     of the store and stocked shelves, while the younger \n     generation filled in after school. In 1973 when Dan bought \n     out Whit and became sole proprietor, he was joined by his \n     sons, George and Jack. Today, there are eight Frasers working \n     at the store in various capacities.\n\n\n                              good people\n\n       ``What has kept me in the business is that I like the \n     people. I would have retired before, but I know it's hard to \n     find good people.''--Bill Fitzgerald, Dan & Whit's employee \n     off and on since 1934.\n       When two brothers work 60 and 70 hours each per week, one \n     wonders how they can keep the peace. Jack and George say \n     their partnership works very well. ``We seldom fight,'' says \n     Jack despite their grueling work schedules and the constant \n     decisions that have to be made.\n       If you're looking for the people person, you'll find George \n     up front managing staff, scheduling, hiring and training \n     people and overseeing the Produce Department. Jack, on the \n     other hand, is a product man. From his bench desk in the back \n     of the store, he manages the Hardware and Housewares \n     Departments.\n       No doubt the brothers are handy and resourceful people. \n     However, working as many hours as they do, they gladly \n     entrust some of the major responsibilities to guys like Larry \n     Smith, one of their longest term employees, who runs the \n     grocery department, and Al Langlois and Ron Swift who have \n     the resourcefulness of a handy-man. Supervisor Linda Conrad \n     oversees the check-out counters and trains many of the new \n     hires. Then there's 82-year-old Bill Fitzgerald, with a white \n     apron over his work attire, who cruises the aisles helping \n     customers. Bill says that he first worked at the store in \n     1934, then after a number of years in the old drug stores in \n     Hanover, came back in 1964. He's been at Dan & Whit's ever \n     since.\n\n\n                               the store\n\n       ``I use Dan & Whit's as part of my tour when showing \n     property in Norwich. I always tell my customers to look \n     around Dan & Whit's and be sure to go to the back. It's \n     awesome.''--Brian Gardner, Realtor at The Gardner Agency, \n     Main Street, Norwich\n       In the 22,600 square feet of space, 13,000 of that is \n     devoted to selling. The basement is as large as the main \n     store where vast amounts of goods are stored as is the huge \n     supply of wood for the store's main source of heat--a large \n     wood furnace. In former times, the store was heated by coal \n     and then by oil. Now the Frasers use 16 to 20 cords of wood a \n     year, most of it obtained by various arrangements Matt Fraser \n     makes with loggers and wood lot owners. A back-up supply of \n     split firewood is kept in the yard of Dan Fraser off Turnpike \n     Road. In times of extreme cold, an old railroad stove in the \n     basement is fired up.\n\n\n                       the customer is everything\n\n       ``We have a very serious responsibility to our customers, \n     and if we can't serve them and the community, we are in \n     trouble.''--George Fraser\n       The very lifeblood of Dan & Whit's is the customer. \n     ``Helping our customers is most important for our business--\n     more than any kind of media advertising,'' said George. ``We \n     train and orient our employees to be nice to them,'' adds \n     Jack.\n       With so many products, helping the customer adjust to new \n     products and changing technology is a good example of the Dan \n     & Whit's customer-friendly philosophy. Jack tells about the \n     lady who came in to complain that the batteries she bought \n     from Dan & Whit's weren't working. She overlooked the fact \n     that she had to buy a charger for the batteries. ``Customers \n     do get confused,'' he said.\n\n\n                            no cash required\n\n       ``You know you have gone through an important rite of \n     passage when you get to sign your name at Dan & Whit's--which \n     seems to happen in the 3rd or 4th grade.''--Norwich attorney, \n     Garfield Miller\n       Local, down-home trust has been a hallmark of Dan & Whit's \n     for years. How many places do you know (and it's practically \n     the year 2000) that still offer customer charge accounts. \n     About 30% of Dan & Whit's customers have charge privileges \n     which used to involve prepayments or deposits of up to $300, \n     but that minor inconvenience has since been dropped.\n       ``Personal trust helped the store develop customer \n     loyalty,'' said George. ``. . . and it was also very \n     convenient. If a customer forgot their checkbook or wallet, \n     the store would carry them until the next time they came \n     in.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S854-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WOMEN'S SPORTS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe students, journalist, coach and business that have been recently \nrecognized for their achievements in women's sports by the University \nof Vermont Women's Center in collaboration with the YWCA of Vermont as \nwell as the Women's Sports Foundation. The recipients were selected \nfrom a long list of nominations based upon their contributions and \nsupport for women's athletics.\n  Sports play an integral role in the development of our children and \nhelp to bring communities together. By participating in sports, student \nathletes are exposed to a variety of situations that help to develop \nthe skills they will need to succeed. As such, community support for \nthese programs is of the utmost importance.\n  I am particularly pleased to see that the criteria for these awards \nincluded consideration of the students' academic performance, community \ninvolvement and leadership qualities.\n  I am thrilled that these awards acknowledge the contributions made by \ncoaches, journalists and local businesses as well. Each plays a \ncritical role in promoting school athletics. Coaches provide students \nwith mentorship while journalists supply the public recognition and \nbusinesses contribute financially. Without the assistance of each, \nVermont's student athletes would not have the opportunity to excel that \nthey enjoy today.\n  In addition to the awards ceremony, the Professional Programs \nDivision of Continuing Education hosted a teleconference for a number \nof recognized experts to discuss Title IX funding. Through our efforts \nin this field, significant progress has been achieved in providing \nwomen athletes with improved opportunities and better recognition, as \nis evident in this year's Olympic games.\n  Once again, I would like to congratulate this year's recipients and \nwish them luck in their future endeavors.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Future \nBusiness Leaders of America--Phi Beta Lambda (FBLA-PBL) for fifty-six \nyears of service to America's students, teachers, businesses, and \ncommunities. During the week of February 8-14, educators, students, and \nbusiness professionals across the country recognized National FBLA-PBL \nWeek. I think this is a wonderful time for us to look back on the \naccomplishments of this organization, whose legacy leaves a strong \nfoundation for education and the future of American enterprise.\n\n[[Page S856]]\n\n  On February 3, 1942, Dr. Hamden L. Forkner spearheaded the effort to \ncreate the first FBLA chapter in Johnson City, Tennessee. Dr. Forkner \nenvisioned a national organization that would train high school \nstudents in the real-life aspects of the professional business world, \nand also develop their leadership, self-confidence, and patriotism. The \nFBLA concept quickly expanded, and membership grew many times over.\n  In 1958, the benefits of FBLA were extended to postsecondary students \nwith the creation of Phi Beta Lambda. This professional business \norganization seeks to ease the transition from school to work for \nthousands of students by providing training in business leadership \nskills and connecting students with current industry leaders.\n  Over the years, FBLA-PBL has grown to encompass two additional \ndivisions: a Professional Division, founded in 1989, for their \npartners, supporters and alumni; and the Middle Level, founded just a \nfew years ago, which connects middle school and junior high students \nwith basic leadership and business principles.\n  The mission of the FBLA-PBL is to bring business and education \ntogether in a positive working relationship through innovative \nleadership and career development programs. They accomplish this \nthrough a variety of national programs, including seven national \nleadership conferences, over seventy competitive events, strategic \nbusiness partnerships, career expos, and community service.\n  Mr. President, in the past fifty-six years, FBLA-PBL has trained \nliterally millions of today's leaders in American business. For fifty \nyears now, Louisiana has benefited from the FBLA-PBL and today, there \nare approximately 7,000 members in my home state. I am proud to say \nthat the National Phi Beta Lambda President is from Louisiana. This is \ntruly an organization that has made a positive impact on my home state \nas well as on our country, proving that our youth are ready, willing, \nand able to take the reins of leadership and help guide us toward a \nbrighter tomorrow. With over 240,000 members annually, FBLA-PBL is a \nshining example of what makes America great, and I am pleased to have \nthis opportunity to recognize them for their efforts. I would like to \ntake this opportunity for all of us to recognize and remember that \nFBLA-PBL has done a tremendous service for this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S855-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING THE HEROIC EFFORTS OF JOHN BENSCHEIDT\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, all too often, we hear frightening \nstories about today's young people. I think it's important to remember \nthat not all of them deserve that bad reputation. In fact, many--if not \nmost--of our young people step up to the responsibility of caring for \ntheir communities and fellow citizens. I would like to take this \nopportunity to tell you about a heroic young Idahoan, John Benscheidt, \nwho courageously saved the life of eight year-old Douglas Schedler. \nThis remarkable youth responded to an emergency situation with the \nspeed of a trained professional.\n  John Benscheidt was the only person to witness the heavy snow pile \ncascade off a condominium roof at Schweitzer Mountain and quickly bury \na small child standing nearby. Without hesitating, John began digging \nwith his snow board, trying to reach little Douglas trapped under five \nfeet of snow. John's calls for help caught the attention of others in \nthe area, who assisted in John's efforts to save the boy. After frantic \nminutes of searching, the child was retrieved and taken to Bonner \nGeneral Hospital, where he was treated and released without serious \ninjuries.\n  We are all grateful that John had the presence of mind to act quickly \nin a life-threatening situation. The inherent characteristics John \ndemonstrated during this incident reflect a strong upbringing and \nprofound awareness of human value. Let him serve as a reminder to all \nof us that we have exceptional youth in this country who contribute \ngreatly to our communities and to our lives. It gives me great pleasure \nto honor such a fine young man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S856-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S856-S857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RADIATION EXPOSURE\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I want to recognize those \nAmericans who were exposed to radiation fallout from government testing \nof nuclear weapons in the 1950's, the effects of which are still being \nstudied.\n  I was recently contacted by Karen Anderson and her two children, Leah \nand Seth, who are constituents of mine from Urbandale, Iowa. Included \nin their correspondence was a moving and touching tribute to Bob \nAnderson, their husband and father, who, after a lengthy and courageous \nbattle, succumbed to cancer on September 7, 1996. As someone who grew \nup in Iowa and lost two sisters and a brother to cancer, I understand \nand empathize with their situation.\n  The letters, photos and other personal materials that made up a bound \nvolume memorializing the life and struggle of Mr Anderson displayed the \nobvious affection and love he felt for everyone and that he received in \nreturn. In fact, dozens of friends and relatives signed the notebook in \ntribute to Bob Anderson. It is always a tragedy when someone is taken \nfrom us when they have so much left to offer. There is no doubt he will \nbe greatly missed by all.\n  The anguish of the Anderson family was compounded by the \ncircumstances surrounding the cause of Mr Anderson's cancer. Atomic \nbomb tests in Nevada during the 1950's exposed millions of Americans--\nparticulary children--to large amounts of radioactive Iodine-131, which \naccumulates in the thyroid gland and has been linked to thyroid cancer. \n``Hot Spots''--where the Iodine-131 fallout was the greatest--were \nidentified as receiving 5-16 rads of Iodine-131\n  To put that in perspective, Federal standards for nuclear power \nplants require that protective action be taken for 15 rads. To further \nunderstand the enormity of the potential exposure, consider this--116 \nmillion curies of Iodine-131 were released by the above ground nuclear \nweapons testing in the United States compared with 7.3 million from the \nChernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in the former Soviet Union. \nExposing our citizens to these risks is unacceptable.\n  The ``Hot Spots'' included many areas far away from Nevada, including \nNew York, Massachusetts and Iowa. Due to the character of Iodine-131, \nthose exposed to the highest concentrations were those who drank large \namounts of milk from cows that grazed in fields with radiation fallout. \nBecause their thyroids are smaller and still growing, children were \nmost vulnerable.\n  Mr. Anderson grew up in Iowa in Woodbury County , an area noted as a \nhot spot by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). He also suffered from \nThyroid cancer. It is understandable that his family now wonders \nwhether his cancer could have been detected and treated more \neffectively if the NCI information was known earlier.\n  This hits very close to home for me. During the 1950's, like Bob \nAnderson, I was living in a rural Iowa county which has now been \nidentified as a ``Hot Spot'' by the long delayed National Cancer \nInstitute study. Along with many Iowans, I drank milk from cows kept on \nthe farm. This increased the risk faced by myself and my family because \nof the accumulation of radioactive iodine in milk.\n  When it comes to the government and nuclear testing, history shows \nthe problem hasn't just been a fallout of radiation, but withholding of \nfacts which may be detrimental to the public health. Information has \ncome to light that government officials were aware that fallout from \nnuclear testing would contaminate areas that were hundreds, even \nthousands, of miles away. Additionally, it is outrageous that the \ngovernment provided maps and forecasts of potential radioactive \ncontamination to the Kodak film corporation during the 1950's and not \nto the American public. As I've said before, if we could protect a roll \nof film, we should have protected the parents and children.\n  On October 1, 1997, the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services \nAppropriations Subcommittee held hearings where I raised questions \nabout Iodine-131 fallout and its impact on our nation's citizens. I am \nworking with NCI and other federal health agencies to ensure that \nuseful and timely guidelines on the health impacts of radioactive \nfallout from nuclear weapons testing gets to physicians and concerned \nscientists. Although NCI has started this process, a lot more needs to \nbe done.\n\n[[Page S857]]\n\n  There is strong evidence that exposure to other radioactive isotopes, \nsuch as strontium 90, cesium 137, and barium 140, which were also \nspread by nuclear testing, could lead to bone cancer, leukemia, higher \ninfant mortality, and a host of other illnesses. This needs to be \nexamined. So do the nuclear weapons tests that took place in other \nparts of the United States and around the world. I am hopeful that my \ncolleagues will support legislation I have introduced, S.1524, which \ncontinues the study of the health impacts of nuclear fallout. I feel \nthis is important legislation that needs to become law this year.\n  I am grateful to the Anderson family for sharing their highly \npersonal and powerful story of the struggle with Bob's illness and the \nlack of forthcoming information on the potential exposure to radiation \nfallout in the 1950's. A story like the Anderson's underscores the need \nfor accurate and timely dissemination of information to protect the \npublic health.\n  Mr. President, I ask to include a letter from the Anderson family in \nthe Record.\n  The letter follows:\n                                  Urbandale, IA, January 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senator, Federal Building, Des Moines, IA.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: My name is Bob Anderson. My family has \n     been reading with great interest the newspaper articles that \n     have appeared in the Des Moines Register regarding the \n     radioactive fallout that resulted from the more than 90 \n     atomic bombs detonated above and below ground between 1951 \n     and 1970. I was born in Woodbury County on October 3, 1952 \n     and lived there until I left to attend college in 1970. As \n     you are aware, Woodbury County received moderate levels of \n     radioactive fallout (6.1 rads) from the above-ground atomic \n     bomb tests between 1951 and 1962, and was one of four \n     counties to be repeated in the list of Iowa counties \n     receiving radiation from underground nuclear tests (1960-\n     1970).\n       In October 1992, at the age of 40, I noticed a large lump \n     in my neck and showed the lump to my family physician during \n     my annual physical exam. He told me that the lump was just a \n     fat deposit and to go home and not worry about it. About six \n     months later, I mentioned the lump to my wife and she advised \n     me to see a specialist as soon as possible. In March of 1993, \n     I went to an ear, nose and throat specialist who spent \n     several weeks performing a needle biopsy with no results. In \n     April of 1993, I underwent a thyroidectomy. The surgeon \n     removed only the side of my thyroid which contained the \n     tumor. Two weeks later the final biopsy confirmed the 2\\1/4\\ \n     centimeter tumor was malignant. I then saw an oncologist who \n     advised me the other side of my thyroid should be removed \n     immediately so I could start my radioactive iodine treatments \n     to rid my body of any remaining cancerous thyroid tissue. I \n     visited another surgeon the remove the remaining thyroid. He \n     was very apologetic but said that he could not remove the \n     rest of my thyroid until my incision was completely healed \n     which would take six more months. From the time I first \n     showed the lump to a physician until the time that I received \n     my radioactive thyroid treatments for cancer, over one year \n     had elapsed.\n       My family wonders if the information from the National \n     Cancer Institute had only been released earlier, if my \n     physicians would have taken a more serious approach to the \n     ``fat deposit'' in my neck. The also wonder if this \n     information had been made available to the public earlier, if \n     I would have been so trusting of my doctors' opinions. Many \n     wrong choices and assumptions were made in regard to my \n     thyroid cancer. Knowledge is power and without the knowledge \n     of the exposure I had as a youth to the radioactive fallout, \n     I was rendered powerless.\n       In 1996 I was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a very \n     deadly cancer. I went to the University of Iowa Hospital and \n     found out that I had had the multiple myeloma at the same \n     time that I had the thyroid cancer. In order to survive, I \n     would have to undergo a bone marrow transplant. Because I was \n     adopted, I could not find a related bone marrow donor. An \n     unrelated donor was located, and in July of 1996 I received \n     my bone marrow transplant. On September 7, 1996, in spite of \n     the love and prayers of family and friends, I died from \n     rejection of the transplant.\n       After my death, my wife, Karen, saw Dr. Andrea McGuire \n     (nuclear medicine physician) interviewed on TV13. When Dr. \n     McGuire told about her three in-laws from Woodbury County who \n     had all developed thyroid cancer, my wife decided to call her \n     to share my story. One of Dr. McGuire's relatives was born \n     the same year that I had been born (1952) and also developed \n     cancer at age 40 like me. My wife read to Dr. McGuire a \n     portion from a National Cancer Institute publication \n     entitled, ``What You Need to Know About Multiple Myeloma.'' \n     In that publication, under the subheading, ``Possible \n     Causes,'' it states, Some research suggests that certain risk \n     factors increase a person's chance of getting multiple \n     myeloma. * * * In addition, people exposed to large amounts \n     of radiation (such as survivors of the atomic bomb explosions \n     in Japan) have an increased risk for this disease. Scientists \n     have some concern that small amounts of radiation (such as \n     those radiologists and workers in nuclear plants are exposed \n     to) also may increase the risk.'' Dr. McGuire not only agreed \n     my multiple myeloma was caused by the radioactive fallout but \n     even told my wife that the radionuclide strontium 89 would \n     have been directly responsible since it collects in the bone \n     marrow after it is ingested by the body.\n       The main purpose of my letter is to let you know my family \n     believes that I was a victim of radioactive fallout. I, like \n     millions of others, was an innocent infant when the atomic \n     bomb tests were being conducted. I can't think of anything \n     more evil than a government that would intentionally \n     contaminate their own population, especially babies and small \n     children.\n       I have enclosed some photos of myself and my family. I want \n     you to see what I looked like as a small child when the \n     atomic bombs were being detonated. I want you to see that I \n     was a caring son, wonderful brother, loving husband, adored \n     father and I treasured friend.\n       Since I could not write this letter for myself, my family \n     and friends decided to write it for me. I hope you don't mind \n     that they have signed it for me also.\n       Senator Harkin, please keep fighting for the truth. Only \n     when the American people have the whole truth, will they have \n     the power and control over their own lives. It is my hope \n     that this letter will encourage the release of all \n     information that the government has regarding radioactivity \n     and it's connection with all forms of cancers. It is also my \n     prayer that this information may help others.\n       Senator Harkin, please don't forget me. Please don't let my \n     death be in vain.\n       In Loving Memory of Bob Anderson,\n                                            Karen Anderson, Widow.\n                                           Leah Anderson, Daugher.\n     Seth Anderson, Sen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S856-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S857-S858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, Sunday, February 8 marked the \nsecond anniversary of the signing of the landmark Telecommunications \nAct of 1996. As we take this opportunity to reflect on the state of \ntelecommunications reform, I rise to share my concerns with the \nimplementation of a critical provision of the historical law--the \nprovision dealing with universal telephone service.\n  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 ordered the overhaul of the \nestimated $23 billion in subsidies currently used to fund universal \ntelephone service. Congress intended all implicit subsidies to \nuniversal service to be removed from rates and transferred to a new \nexplicit Universal Service Fund to be supported equally by all \ncarriers.\n  In the face of declining telephone rate support, through federally \nmandated access charge reduction and new competitors targeting the most \nprofitable markets and services, a sustainable universal service \nsupport mechanism is ever more important. I view with great concern the \nFederal Communication Commission's (FCC) current formula for universal \nservice support: twenty-five percent of funding from federal sources \nand seventy-five percent from each state.\n  Many states, like Wyoming, clearly are not in a position to bear \nseventy-five percent of the universal service burden alone. Universal \nservice is a shared state-federal responsibility. The best approach to \nfulfill Congress' intent and ensure affordable phone service in all \ncorners of the country is to create a national universal service fund \nthat ensures support reaches where it is needed most.\n  The fund should be based on interstate and intrastate \ntelecommunications revenues and cover one-hundred percent of the \nsubsidy needed to keep phone rates affordable for customers in rural \nand high-cost areas. With a national fund, all telecommunications \nservice providers would contribute a portion of their revenues to \nsupport reasonable rates across the country. In other words, service \nproviders in more urban, low-cost areas would help support affordable \nphone service in rural, high-cost areas.\n  Leaving seventy-five percent of the funding responsibility to the \nstates would place a disproportionate burden on consumers, service \nproviders and utilities commissions in rural states like Wyoming. Such \na burden could result in higher phone rates and reduce network \ninvestment--both of which would have a chilling effect on economic \ndevelopment opportunities. Since telecommunications is a vital element \nof commerce, disparate universal service surcharges on communications \nservices between states\n\n[[Page S858]]\n\nwould divert industries and job growth away from the rural areas that \nneed it the most.\n  Mr. President, I submit for the Record a letter I wrote with the \nother members of the Wyoming delegation to the FCC on this issue. There \nis still time for the Commission to get this funding problem right. We \nmust ensure that all customers across the country continue to have \naccess to quality local phone service at affordable rates.\n  The letter follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Reed E. Hundt,\n     Chairman,\n     Federal Communications Commission,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hundt: Reforming our nation's universal \n     service system is a tremendous challenge, and one that will \n     have lasting implications for telephone customers in Wyoming \n     and other rural states. In your work on the Joint Board, we \n     encourage you to protect the interests of rural consumers and \n     create a national high-cost fund that sends support dollars \n     where they are needed most. By doing this, you will fulfill \n     the clear mandate of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and \n     help sustain a truly national communications system available \n     to all citizens.\n       In the face of declining telephone rate support, through \n     federally mandated access charge reductions and new \n     competitors targeting the most profitable markets and \n     services, a sustainable universal service support mechanism \n     is ever more important. We therefore view with great concern \n     the current formula for universal service support: 25 percent \n     of the funding comes from federal sources and 75 percent from \n     the states.\n       In Wyoming, with its vast terrain and dispersed and \n     relatively small population, a 75 percent state funding \n     responsibility will have a clear, immediate and detrimental \n     effect on phone rates. Although Wyoming has a universal \n     service funding mechanism, it is beyond the capacity of \n     Wyoming to absorb the huge increases in costs that a 25/75 \n     split would create for it. It is clear to us that a federal \n     universal service fund that pays only 25 cents on every \n     dollar of high-cost telephone service will shortchange \n     thousands of Wyoming telephone customers, and millions of \n     others across the country.\n       Universal telephone service is a national commitment \n     requiring strong federal support. In that regard, the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996 envisioned a partnership \n     between the states and the federal government to work \n     together on the nation's telecommunications challenges. We \n     urge you to adopt a national high-cost fund that provides all \n     of the rate support needed to keep Wyoming customers \n     connected to the public telephone network. Only with a \n     national fund available to all high-cost service providers \n     can customers in our state be assured of affordable access to \n     this vital communications link.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this matter. We hope \n     you will join us in supporting a cooperative national \n     solution for universal service.\n           Sincerely,\n     Craig Thomas,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Michael Enzi,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Barbara Cubin,\n       Member of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S857-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S858-S859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FEBRUARY IS AMERICAN HEART MONTH\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I stand in observance of American \nHeart Month. This is an annual event since 1964 resulting from passage \nof a joint Congressional resolution asking the President to proclaim \neach February as American Heart Month. In declaring February as \nAmerican Heart Month for the last 34 years, both the Congress and the \nPresident recognize the seriousness of heart disease and the need to \ncontinue the battle against this our country's number 1 killer and a \nleading cause of disability.\n  American Heart Month takes on an added significance in 1998 because \nboth the National Institutes of Health's National Heart, Lung, and \nBlood Institute and the American Heart Association are celebrating \ntheir 50th anniversaries--50 proud years for both national \norganizations.\n  The NHLBI is the federal government's leading supporter of heart \nresearch and educational programs. The American Heart Association is \nthe nation's largest voluntary health organization dedicated to the \nreduction of death and disability from heart attack, stroke and other \ncardiovascular diseases--the leading cause of death in the United \nStates.\n  There have been wonderful discoveries made through research and \nwonderful treatments that are provided in our hospitals in the area of \ncardiology. Yet there is so much we still do not know. It seems to me \nmore and more research can unlock these mysteries and give us the \nopportunity to save more and more lives in this country.\n  Virtually all of us have a friend or a loved one who has been \naffected by heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular diseases. As \nmany of my colleagues know, I have a very personal interest in trying \nto provide additional resources for NHLBI to be used to provide funding \nvitally needed for heart and stroke-related research.\n  I have become increasingly concerned, however, with what has been \nhappening to the amount of money spent on heart research by the federal \ngovernment. Even with the significant increases that Congress has been \ngiving to the NIH over the past decade, funding for heart research has \nsimply not kept pace. In fact, funding for heart research at the NHLBI \nappears to be losing more and more ground.\n  In constant dollars from FY 1985 to FY 1995, funding for the NHLBI \nheart program decreased 4.8 percent.\n  In constant dollars from FY 1986 to FY 1996 funding for the NHLBI \nheart program declined 5.5 percent.\n  And, in figures just released by the NHLBI, funding for the heart \nprogram decreased by 7.6 percent in constant dollars from FY 1987 to FY \n1997.\n  We can do better, and we must do better. Our nation must do a better \njob than this in the battle against America's No. 1 killer.\n  During the commemoration of this 50th anniversary of the 1948 Heart \nAct, which created the National Heart Institute, I call on the on the \nPresident and every one of my colleagues to take three pivotal steps to \nmake more progress against this insidious disease:\n  Commit to providing a significant increase in funding for research \nagainst heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases;\n  Establish a Presidential Commission on Heart Disease and Stroke, \nsimilar to the one convened by President Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Today, \n34 years after the first Presidential Commission, these diseases remain \nthe first and third largest killers in America; and\n  Convene a National Conference on Cardiovascular Diseases sponsored by \nthe NHLBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The first \none was sponsored by the National Heart Institute and the American \nHeart Association in 1950 to ``summarize current knowledge and to make \nrecommendations concerning further progress against heart and blood \nvessel diseases.'' I think it is time we take another systematic look \nat the status of our heart disease research efforts to date and the \nareas that need further research.\n  These steps are vital to the health and well being of the more than \n57 million Americans with one or more types of cardiovascular disease.\n  I ask that this year's Presidential proclamation on American Heart \nMonth be printed in the Record.\n\n                       American Heart Month, 1998\n\n\n    a proclamation by the president of the united states of america\n\n       Fifty years ago, a heart attack meant an end to an active \n     lifestyle, and, for a third of those stricken, it meant \n     death. Thankfully, the past half-century has brought us an \n     array of advances in the prevention and treatment of heart \n     disease. Procedures such as balloon angioplasty and coronary \n     artery bypass grafts, noninvasive diagnostic tests, and drugs \n     that treat high blood pressure and clots and reduce high \n     blood cholesterol have enabled Americans to live longer and \n     healthier lives. Equally important, we have become better \n     educated during the past five decades about heart disease \n     risk factors and how to control them.\n       This year, two of the groups most responsible for this \n     remarkable progress--the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \n     Institute and the American Heart Association--are celebrating \n     their golden anniversaries. The National Heart, Lung, and \n     Blood Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, \n     leads the Federal Government's efforts against heart disease \n     by supporting research and education for the public, heart \n     patients, and health care professionals. The American Heart \n     Association plays a crucial role in the fight against heart \n     disease through its research and education programs and its \n     vital network of dedicated volunteers.\n       Despite the encouraging developments in that fight, we \n     still face many challenges. Heart disease continues to be the \n     leading cause of death in this country, killing more than \n     700,000 Americans each year. The number of Americans with \n     heart disease or a risk factor for it is staggering. \n     Approximately 58 million have some form of cardiovascular \n     disease, about 50 million have high blood pressure, and about \n     52 million have high\n\n[[Page S859]]\n\n     blood cholesterol. Americans are also becoming more \n     overweight and less active--two key factors that increase the \n     risk of heart disease. Most disturbing, for the first time in \n     decades, Americans are losing ground against some \n     cardiovascular diseases. The rate of stroke has risen \n     slightly, the prevalence of heart failure has increased, and \n     the decline in the death rate for those with coronary heart \n     disease has slowed.\n       Women are particularly hard hit by this disease, in part \n     because public health messages too often have not focused on \n     how this segment of our population can best protect their \n     hearts. The American Heart Association recently discovered \n     that only 8 percent of American women know that heart disease \n     and stroke are the greatest health threats for women, and 90 \n     percent of women polled did not know the most common heart \n     attack signals for women.\n       For a variety of reasons, including poorer access to \n     preventive health care services, minorities in America have \n     high mortality rates due to heart disease. The American Heart \n     Association reported that, in 1995, cardiovascular disease \n     death rates were about 49 percent greater for African \n     American men than for white men, and about 67 percent higher \n     for African American women than white women. In addition, the \n     prevalence of diabetes--a major risk factor for heart \n     disease--is very high in some of our Native American \n     populations, and Asian Americans have a high mortality rate \n     for stroke.\n       However, both the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute \n     and the American Heart Association have undertaken activities \n     to counter these trends. Both groups have initiated major \n     efforts to better inform women and minorities about the \n     threat of heart disease and the steps that can be taken both \n     to prevent and treat it. These fine organizations also \n     continue their efforts to educate health professionals on \n     improving medical practice in heart health and to inform \n     patients and the public about how to reduce their risk of \n     heart disease. As we celebrate their 50th anniversaries, let \n     us resolve to build on their record of accomplishment. By \n     continuing our investment in research, raising public \n     awareness of the symptoms of heart disease, and educating \n     Americans about the importance of a heart-healthy diet and \n     exercise, we can continue our extraordinary progress in \n     saving lives and improving health.\n       In recognition of these important efforts in the ongoing \n     fight against cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint \n     Resolution approved December 30, 1963 (77 Stat. 843; 36 \n     U.S.C. 169b), has requested that the President issue an \n     annual proclamation designating February as ``American Heart \n     Month.''\n       NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the \n     United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 1998 as \n     American Heart Month. I invite the Governors of the States, \n     the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of other areas \n     subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the \n     American people to join me in reaffirming our commitment to \n     combating cardiovascular disease and stroke.\n       IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this \n     thirtieth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen \n     hundred and ninety-eight, and of the Independence of the \n     United States of America the two hundred and twenty-second.\n     William J.

Mr. President, the proposal in Congress to rename \nthe Washington National Airport for former President Ronald Reagan has \ncaused some to claim that anyone who opposes the change is expressing a \npartisan view.\n  I greatly respect and admire former President Reagan. I have \nsupported naming Washington, D.C.'s largest federal office structure \nthe Ronald Reagan Building. The ceremony to do that will be held in the \nnext few months. I also have supported naming the aircraft carrier that \nis currently under construction the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan.\n  But I did not think it was appropriate for Congress to dictate a name \nchange to the local airport authority. The bill turning over the \nauthority for the airport to a metropolitan airport authority was \nsigned by President Reagan nine years ago. I don't think the spirit of \nthat transfer of control is served by a proposal directing the airport \nauthority to rename the airport.\n  That airport is now named after America's first President. In fact, \nthe porticos in the architecture of the Washington National Airport \nwere designed to resemble Mount Vernon.\n  Again, while I admire and respect President Reagan, I believe that \nit's most appropriate that the principal airport serving our nation's \ncapital retains the name of our first President. However, I did vote \nfor an amendment that would permit renaming it, provided the local \nairport authority chose to do so.

This law punishes hospitals that make \nuse of the full continuum of care and discourages them from moving \npatients to the most appropriate levels of post-acute care.\n  The current hospital prospective payment system is based on an \naverage length of stay for a given condition. In some cases, patients \nstay in the hospital longer than the average and in other cases their \nstay is shorter. Historically, a hospital has been reimbursed based \nupon an average length of stay regardless of whether the patient \nremained in the hospital a day less than the average or a day more than \nthe average. When the Balanced Budget Act transfer provision takes \neffect, however, this will no longer be the case.\n  This new policy penalizes facilities that transfer patients from the \nhospital to a more appropriate level of care earlier than the average \nlength of stay. It encourages hospitals to ignore the clinical needs of \npatients and keep them in the most expensive care setting for a longer \nperiod of time. In short, it offers an incentive for hospitals to \nprovide an unnecessary level of care, for an unnecessary length of \ntime.\n  The transfer policy is particularly hard on hospitals in low-cost \nstates like Iowa, where the cost of implementation has been estimated \nat $25 million a year. Because Iowa's hospitals\n\n[[Page S860]]\n\npractice efficient medicine, they have average lengths of stay well \nbelow the national average. These hospitals will be hit especially \nhard. This kind of perverse incentive is part of the problem with \nMedicare, not part of the solution.\n  I understand that there may be concerns about abuses by some \nhospitals moving patients to lower levels of care sooner than is \nclinically appropriate. If that is a problem, let's attack it. But \nlet's not punish all hospitals--especially the most efficient for the \nsins of a few others.\n  In addition to the irrational incentives this policy creates, there \nis the very real problem of administering it. This law holds hospitals \naccountable for the actions of patients that are no longer under their \ncare. If a Medicare beneficiary were discharged from the hospital \nwithout the expectation of a need for further care and circumstances \nchanged, the hospital would not be entitled to the full Medicare \npayment. But the reality is that, the hospital may or may not know of \nthis change. The law sets hospitals up for accusations of fraud due to \nevents that are completely beyond their control.\n  This law is a serious roadblock to the provision of appropriate and \nefficient care. The repeal of this legislation will help ensure that \nlogical coordinated care remains a primary goal of the Medicare \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S859-4", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF DONALD RUSSELL\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, South Carolina lost one of its \ngreatest citizens when former Governor, former U.S. Senator, and \nFederal Judge Donald Russell passed away Sunday night. I am both \ngreatly saddened and honored to pay tribute today to the exemplary life \nof this extraordinary man.\n  In addition to his many years of public service as Governor, U.S. \nSenator, and Federal Judge, Donald Russell also served as president of \nthe University of South Carolina from 1952 to 1957. During the Second \nWorld War, he served in the War Department and as a special assistant \nto James F. Byrnes until 1943. In 1943, he entered upon active duty in \nthe U.S. Army; he was decommissioned as a major in 1944 after serving \nwith Supreme Allied Headquarters. He was present at Yalta with James \nByrnes and President Roosevelt. Following the War, he served for two \nyears as Assistant Secretary of State for Administration.\n  Some in this Chamber remember Donald Russell as an esteemed colleague \nwho served with great distinction in the United States Senate in 1965 \nand 1966. During his time in the Senate, Senator Russell was known as a \nserious, conscientious, and particularly intelligent lawmaker, \ndedicated to his country and to his state. Both South Carolina and the \nUnited States benefitted from Senator Russell's wise and vigorous \nleadership.\n  Before entering the Senate, Donald Russell served as Governor of \nSouth Carolina. His governorship was one of the most progressive, most \nactive, and most important in my state's history. For example, he \nstrongly supported and helped fund the statewide system of technical \ncolleges that has been essential to South Carolina's dramatic economic \ngrowth for the past two decades. But the hallmark of Donald Russell's \ngovernorship was his commitment to racial reconciliation and fair \ntreatment for all in South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, the best way to illustrate Donald Russell's caring, \ngenerous, and just nature and his commitment to equitable and \nprogressive policies is to relate a vignette. On his inauguration as \nGovernor, Donald threw a barbecue for the people of South Carolina--all \nthe people. This was unprecedented: never before in South Carolina had \na governor thrown a party and invited all the state's people--white and \nblack--to attend. For the first time, the Governor shook many black as \nwell as white hands in his receiving line. Donald's act was as bold as \nit was wonderful, and it set the tone for his governorship, during \nwhich he worked to encourage the citizens of South Carolina to accept \nthe end of the pernicious system of segregation.\n  After leaving the Senate, Donald was appointed by President Lyndon \nJohnson to the United States District Court for the District of South \nCarolina. In 1971, Judge Russell was appointed by President Richard \nNixon to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. For \nover thirty years, Judge Russell served with great distinction and \nearned a reputation as one of America's most respected jurists. His \nintellect remained keen to the end and he never accepted senior status. \nHis years on the bench set a standard for judicial integrity, wisdom, \nand fairmindedness that will endure for many years. In fact, it was as \na jurist that Donald Russell found his true calling. I doubt that I \never have seen or will see another jurist to surpass him.\n  For more than fifty years, Mr. President, I have known Donald Russell \nto be one of the most dedicated public servants in South Carolina's \nrich history. His dedication to improving the lives of everyday \ncitizens has inspired me throughout my own career in public service. I \nam proud to have been his friend and colleague, and I send his family \nmy sincere condolences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S860-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE STAN CAVE: REPUBLICAN LEGISLATOR OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nStan Cave, who represents the 45th district (Lexington) in the Kentucky \nHouse of Representatives. Representative Cave has been recognized by \nthe National Republican Legislators Association as one of their ten \nLegislators of the Year.\n  I am proud to have joined several of his General Assembly colleagues \nin nominating Stan for this award. I have worked closely with Stan \nsince his election to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1993, on \na variety of issues of importance to our constituents.\n  Since his election, Stan has risen quickly in the Republican \nleadership in the Kentucky House. He currently serves as Chairman of \nthe House Republican Caucus. For the past two years, Stan has played a \nmajor role in overhauling Kentucky's Workers' Compensation laws, as \nwell as other important issues ranging from Higher Education Reform to \nthe state budget.\n  Outside of the General Assembly, Stan has been very generous with his \ntime to both Republican causes and candidates for office. As \nRecruitment Chairman for the Fayette County Republican Party, Stan has \nworked tirelessly to find quality candidates for Congress, the state \nlegislature, Mayor and Council in his home community of Lexington, \nKentucky.\n  Mr. President, in just a few short years, Stan Cave has become a \nrespected contributor to Kentucky government and politics. His meteoric \nrise has now been recognized and rewarded by the National Republican \nLegislators Association as a 1997 Legislator of the Year, a great and \nwell deserved honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S860-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S860-S861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO THE CORVETTE: MOTOR TREND'S 1998 CAR OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \nrecent recognition of the redesigned Chevrolet Corvette as Motor Trend \nmagazine's 1998 Car of the Year. By recognizing the 1998 Corvette with \none of the automobile industry's most prestigious awards, the editors \nof Motor Trend bestow a great honor, not only on the car, but more \nimportantly on those men and women who design and build the Corvette in \nBowling Green, Kentucky.\n  Motor Trend--in celebrating the radically-redesigned 1998 Corvette--\npoints to the new, cleaner 5.7 liter/345 horsepower V-8 engine, a \nlighter, more refined chassis, and an impressive 24.9 cubic feet of \ncargo space, noting that ``the new Corvette will be remembered as one \nof the greatest cars in American automotive history.''\n  The selection of the Corvette further signals the resurgence of great \nAmerican cars. I am proud that the Corvette has been at the forefront \nof this revival.\n  This award is a testament to the tireless efforts of those in Bowling \nGreen who have designed and assembled the Corvette since 1981, when the \nshiny new plant was born from an old Chrysler Air Temps facility. Since \nCorvette production moved from St. Louis 18 years ago, the people of \nBowling Green have been proud to carry on the tradition of America's \noriginal roadster.\n  Mr. President, by honoring the Corvette, the editors of Motor Trend \nhonor all the hard-working men and women\n\n[[Page S861]]\n\nin my home state of Kentucky who have played a role in all stages of \nthe production of the new, 5th generation Corvette. I offer my \ncongratulations to all those who work for Chevrolet in Bowling Green, \nwhose innovative thinking and diligence has resulted in the Corvette \nwinning this prestigious award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S860-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO THE TOYOTA CAMRY: AMERICA'S No. 1 SELLING CAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the employees \nat the Erlanger, Kentucky, headquarters of Toyota's North American \nmanufacturing operations as well as those at the Georgetown Toyota \nassembly plant whose dedication and hard work have resulted in the \nToyota Camry becoming the number one selling car in the United States \nfor 1997.\n  By recording its best-ever sales month in December, the Camry edged \npast traditional favorites--the Honda Accord and the Ford Taurus--to \nbecome the best selling car in the United States--the first time a \nToyota automobile has been so recognized.\n  Because dealers had a hard time keeping both the Accord and the Camry \nin stock this year, the primary factor in determining which model sold \nbest was which company could get the most out of its assembly line. I \nam proud to report that, because of the industriousness of those men \nand women who work in the Georgetown plant, there were enough Camrys on \ndealer's lots to outsell both the Accord and the Taurus. And by the \nway, 80% of all Camrys sold in the U.S. have been assembled in \nGeorgetown.\n  This past year, the Camry plant in Georgetown increased production by \n12% over the previous year, mostly by improving efficiency on the \nassembly line and pressing suppliers to keep up with their demand for \nraw materials.\n  Despite the tremendous growth this year, officials at the Georgetown \nplant say that they intend to build even more Camrys next year, as they \nimprove the speed of the assembly line and further improve the plant's \nefficiency.\n  Mr. President, again, I would like to congratulate all those men and \nwomen associated with Toyota Motor Sales, USA, particularly those in \nErlanger and Georgetown, whose dedication and hard work made the Camry \n1997's top selling car.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S861-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SUBMISSION OF SENATE RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the debate that we begin today on \ncampaign finance reform must be prefaced with one question: To what \nextent, if any, should the Federal Government regulate political speech \nin our country?\n  The President has endorsed Senator McCain and Senator Feingold's \ncampaign finance reform legislation. However, I cannot.\n  Campaign finance reform debate is not just about politicians and \ntheir campaigns. At the core of this issue is the First Amendment. The \ngovernment must tread lightly in attempts to place limitations on \nspeech. The government can no more dictate how many words a newspaper \ncan print than it can limit a political candidate's ability to \ncommunicate with his or her constituents\n  The McCain-Feingold legislation bristles with over a dozen different \nrestrictions on speech--provisions that, I believe, flagrantly violate \nthe First Amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court.\n  I cannot overemphasize this point. George F. Will, in a Washington \nPost editorial stated of the McCain Feingold bill:\n\n       Nothing in American history--not the left's recent campus \n     speech codes,' not the right's depredations during the 1950s \n     McCarthysim or the 1920s `red scare,' not the Alien and \n     Sedition Acts of the 1790s--matches the menace to the First \n     Amendment posed by campaign `reforms' advancing under the \n     protective coloration of political hygiene.'\n\n  Mr. President, I would point out that the 1996 presidential system of \ncampaign finance clearly reveals that two significant problems exists \nwith our current election process:\n  1. Too much money is spent on campaigns; and 2. Current laws are not \nenforced.\n  Unfortunately, McCain-Feingold would do little to end the vicious \ncycle of fundraising. In fact, if anything, it would only prolong the \ncampaign calendar. Since McCain-Feingold contains restrictions on \nexpress advocacy'' financed by soft money only 60 days before an \nelection--that will mean that money will simply be raised earlier in \nthe calendar year, and the election season will seem virtually \nunending.\n  And what is ``express advocacy?'' If this proposal ever becomes law, \nwe can change the name of the Federal Election Commission to the \nFederal Campaign Speech Police. Every single issue advertisement will \nbe taped, reviewed, analyzed and litigated over. The Speech police will \nset up their offices in all 50 states to ensure the integrity of \npolitical advertising. Is that what we in this chamber really want? I \ndon't think so. But that is what will inevitably happen if we adopt \nMcCain-Feingold.\n  Mr. President, the political tactics and schemes of the 1996 \nPresidential election campaign reveal the abuses involved in our \ncurrent system. Bottom-line, our current election laws are not being \nenforced.\n  It's interesting to note that where the lack of law enforcement has \nbecome the most apparent is in the one area that receives guaranteed \nfederal funding via a tax subsidy--federal presidential elections.\n  As grand jury indictments amass with regard to Democratic fundraising \nviolations in the 1996 Presidential election, we learn more and more \nabout President Clinton's use of the perquisites of the Presidency as a \nfund-raising tool. It's important to recall some of those abuses as we \nbegin our debate on campaign reform. And please keep in mind my point \nhere is existing campaign laws are not being enforced.\n  First, the Lincoln bedroom. During the five years that President \nClinton has resided in the White House, an astonishing 938 guests have \nspent the night in the Lincoln bedroom, and generated at least $6 \nmillion to the Democrat National Committee.\n\n  Presidential historian, Richard Norton Smith, stated that there has \n``never been anything of the magnitude of President Clinton's use of \nthe White House for fundraising purposes. . .it's the selling of the \nWhite House.''\n  Presidential Coffees. President Clinton hosted 103 ``presidential \ncoffees.'' Guests at these coffees, which included a convicted felon \nand a Chinese businessman who heads an arms-trading company, donated \n$27 million to the Democrat National Committee.\n  President Clinton's Chief of Staff, Harold Ickes, recently turned \nover a large number of documents that show figures for both expected \nand actual donations from nearly every White House coffee. Mr. Ickes \ngave the President weekly memorandums which included projected monies \nhe expected each ``Clinton coffee'' would raise. He projected each \nwould raise no less than $400,000.\n  Here's a comparison: President Bush hosted one ``presidential \ncoffee.'' No money was raised. The cost was $6.24.\n  Foreign Contributions. Investigations by both the Senate Government \nAffairs Committee and the Department of Justice into campaign abuses in \nthe 1996 presidential campaign have revealed that the Democrats \nrecklessly accepted illegal foreign donations in exchange for \npresidential access and other favors. A few examples:\n  First John Huang. John Huang, raised millions of dollars in illegal \nforeign contributions for the Democratic National Committee (DNC), \nwhich the DNC has already returned.\n  Huang, despite being wholly unqualified according to his immediate \nboss, received an appointment to the Department of Commerce, where he \nimproperly accessed numerous classified documents on China.\n  Huang made at least 67 visits to the White House, often meeting with \nsenior officials on US trade policy.\n\n[[Page S862]]\n\n  Senator Specter stated that the activities of Mr. Huang at the \nCommerce Department had ``all the earmarks of. . .espionage.''\n  Second Charlie Trie.\n  Longtime friend of Bill Clinton, raised and contributed at least \n$640,000 contributions to Clinton, Gore and the DNC.\n  Shortly thereafter, Clinton signed an executive order to increase the \nsize of the US Commission on Pacific Trade and appointed Trie to the \nCommission.\n  On January 29th of this year, the Department of Justice indicted Trie \non charges that he funneled illegal foreign contributions to the 1996 \nClinton-Gore reelection campaign in order to buy access to top \nDemocratic Party and Clinton Administration officials.\n\n\n                            money laundering\n\n  Vice President Gore was present at an event at a Buddhist Temple \nwhere $80,000 in contributions to the DNC were laundered through \npenniless nuns and monks.\n  Vice President Gore offered differing characterizations of the \nBuddhist Temple event. First, the vice-president described the event as \na ``community outreach.'' He later characterized it as a ``donor-\nmaintenance'' event where ``no money was offered or collected or raised \nat the event.''\n  However, last week, the Department of Justice determined otherwise. \nOn February 18, veteran Democratic fundraiser Maria Hsia was charged in \na six-count indictment by the Justice Department for her part in \nraising the illegal contributions for the Democrat National Committee \nat the Buddhist Temple event.\n  These abhorrent abuses in our current campaign laws must end. Healthy \nreform can begin with this debate. So my point is that current laws are \nnot being enforced.\n  Mr. President, there is clearly one area where reform is certainly \nneeded. During the 1996 election, the AFL-CIO spent $35 million to \ndefeat Republican candidates. Where did the AFL-CIO get the resources \nto fund this campaign? From the dues of both union and nonunion \nmembers.\n  Were these hard-working Americans asked by their unions how those \ndues should be spent? We all know the answer--No. The leaders of the \nAFL-CIO, headquartered here in Washington, just sat down and decided \nthey would use their members' dues to target Republicans, whether those \ndue-paying workers liked it or not.\n  I believe this practice should end. I applaud Senator Lott for \noffering a sensible alternative. The Lott Substitute requires full \npublic disclosure. Just as someone cannot donate money to a campaign in \nsomeone else's name under existing law, the Lott Amendment would close \nthe loophole for labor unions by requiring that members approve of ads \nthat their dues are spent on.\n  Mr. President, it is my intention to offer amendments to this bill \nthat will address several issues related to campaign finance reform. \nOne of those amendments will address what I believe is a fundamental \ninequity in the rules governing Senatorial activities.\n  The amendment I will offer will conform the rules that we have for \ntransportation and lodging in connection with a charitable event with \nthe rules that exist for transportation and lodging in connection with \na political event, such as a political fundraiser something we all \nknow.\n  Under rules we adopted in 1995, private entities cannot reimburse \nMembers for the cost of transportation and lodging to a charitable \nevent. But, members are still permitted to be privately reimbursed if \nthey travel to a fundraising event for another member. In other words, \nlobbyists and PAC Committee contributions can be used to reimburse \nmembers for taking a night off and flying to Hollywood for political \nfundraisers.\n  Under the Senate Ethics Committee's Interpretative Ruling No. 193, a \nSenator may accept travel expenses from an official of a district's \npolitical party organization in return for his appearance at a rally \nsponsored by the organization.\n  Now, Mr. President, every Member of this body has at one time or \nanother made a campaign appearance for his or her party or for a \ncandidate of his party. Often, that means flying to another Member's \nhome state, attending a party function; maybe making a speech and \nsharing a meal; maybe attending an entertainment or sports function. \nAnd the entire cost is almost always covered by lobbyists and other \npolitical contributors.\n  So we have a situation where a Senator can travel all over the \ncountry attending political fundraisers and have lodging and \ntransportation reimbursed, but a Senator can't attend charity events--\nevents that raise money for very worthwhile causes such as breast \ncancer detection--and have those costs reimbursed. Does that make \nsense?\n  Why is it all right for a political action committee to host a $500 a \nplate political fundraiser, or give a campaign check for $5,000 to an \nelected official, but there can be no solicitation of corporations and \nother individuals to participate in a charitable event that only \nbenefits a small community or state? I believe this whole notion of \npreventing Senators and corporations from sharing in raising money for \na worthy cause outside the Beltway, but allowing $5,000 and $10,000 \npolitical gifts smacks of sheer hypocrisy.\n  Since we adopted this change in our rules, it has become far more \ndifficult for Senators to participate in charitable events. A recent \narticle in Roll Call pointed out that charitable golf and ski events \nhave dried up as a result of our rule change. But as Roll Call notes: \n``But Members and their staff can still flock to sports tournaments or \nwine and dine with lobbyists--as long as it's part of a fundraiser.''\n  Mr. President, the amendment I intend to offer will end this \nhypocrisy.\n  My amendment simply provides that Senators would be permitted to be \nprivately reimbursed for the costs of lodging and transportation in \nconnection with charitable fund-raising events in the same manner they \ncan be reimbursed for political travel.\n  This is a very simple amendment. It merely conforms the charitable \ntravel rules with the political travel rules.\n  Mr. President, I believe one of the most important responsibilities \nof a public official is to promote worthwhile charitable causes. Not \neverything that can be done for the public good derives from \ngovernment. Private charities play a vital role in servicing many of \nthe needs of our citizens.\n  In my own case, for the past 4 years, my wife Nancy and I have been \nthe honorary chairs of a fishing tournament in Alaska which has raised \n$830,000 for a mammogram machine for the Fairbanks Breast Cancer \nDetection Center and a mobile detection van.\n  And as a result, the center has been was able to provide free breast \ncancer examinations and mammograms for 25,000 women who from 81 \nvillages in Alaska.\n  The units we've been able to finance have been vital in helping \npreserve the health of Alaska's women, especially the women in the \nsmall villages.\n  The State's cancer mortality is the third highest in the nation--one \nin eight Alaska women will develop breast cancer. Breast cancer \nscreening can reduce these amounts by 30 percent.\n  I believe that without the money raised from these two fundraisers, \nthe health of Alaska's women would be severely marginalized. I am proud \nof the work that my wife Nancy has done to get these units operating. \nIf we change the rules on charitable events, I am convinced that \nneither of these units would have become a reality.\n  What we have here is a situation that discriminates against distant \nStates.\n  Mr. President, even though Senators are permitted to attend \ncharitable events, the rules relating to transportation and lodging \nclearly discriminate against charitable events in distant States.\n  Large national charitable organizations have the clout and resources \nto hold events in Washington, D.C. where Members can easily attend.\n  But if you are a small organization, like the Fairbanks Breast Cancer \nDetection Center or you are not going to have the resources or the \ncapability to have your event held in the Nation's Capital. And if \nSenators cannot receive transportation and lodging reimbursement, \nevents like mine and events sponsored by other Senators in their home \nstates are just going to disappear because it costs too much to get to \nAlaska and other small States.\n  Mr. President, I think we have a very clear choice here. Do we want \nto establish the same lodging and transportation rules for charitable \nfund raisers\n\n[[Page S863]]\n\nas we have for political fundraising? Or do we want to make it harder \nto raise money for worthy charities, while at the same time continuing \nthe unlimited reimbursement for political fundraising.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support my amendment when it \nis offered. And I want to assure my colleagues that should my amendment \nfail, I will offer an amendment to conform the transportation and \nlodging rules with the charitable rules so that Members will have to \npay out of their own pockets to participate in fund raisers for other \npolitical candidates.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that sensible campaign reform will come \nforth during this debate--reform that:\n  does not violate free speech rights; provides greater enforcement for \ncurrent laws; and ends loopholes that circumvent the intent of campaign \nlaws.\n  Any reform taken by this Body must not infringe upon individual \nliberties. Reform should limit the elected official --not the \nelectorate. The American public deserves no less.\n  I defer to my good friend from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1667 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, the last 48 hours have been a very \nimportant moment in our diplomatic efforts to achieve Iraqi compliance \nwith U.N. Security Council resolutions. I want to congratulate \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan of the United Nations for his remarkable \nmission to Iraq. Obviously, many of us still look forward to being \nbriefed on all of the details of the agreement between U.N. and Iraqi \nofficials. But I think it is fair to say we have made great progress \nover the course of the last several days in large measure because of \nhis effort.\n  Just before the February congressional recess, Senator Lott and I \ncame to the floor to impress upon the world community and our country \nthe Senate's unity with regard to dealing with Saddam Hussein's lack of \ncooperation.\n  I believe that unity exists today as well. With this unity we express \nto Saddam Hussein that his pattern of intransigence is unacceptable; \nthat his willingness now to agree once more to open up his facilities \nfor complete inspection is commendable.\n  The question we now face is, when and under what circumstances will \nUNSCOM now be allowed to reenter the country to carry on its mission. \nBut I believe that the willingness on the part of Saddam Hussein to \nnegotiate with the U.N. leadership and to reach this agreement is a \ndirect result of this administration's willingness to demonstrate to \nhim that we will use force if necessary to accomplish our goals.\n  I commend President Clinton and his administration for their efforts, \nwhile facing criticism in some circles, to make it abundantly clear to \nSaddam Hussein, that with or without successful negotiations, we will \nopen up those facilities, we will inspect every questionable location \nto our satisfaction.\n  This message of our determination to see Iraqi compliance and the \nunity we demonstrated in showing our determination to use force, along \nwith the successful diplomatic efforts of Kofi Annan, have brought us \nthe results today.\n  We are not there yet. U.N. weapons inspectors still have to reenter \nthe country and be permitted to go to each location. We still have to \nbe confident that whatever questions we have regarding Iraq's \nintentions on the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction will be \ncompletely answered.\n  I hope that until and unless we have all of those questions answered, \nour forces will be kept in the Persian Gulf to demonstrate our \nwillingness to use force, if necessary, to accomplish our mission.\n  So, again, Mr. President, I commend the administration, I commend Mr. \nAnnan, I commend all of those who have had so much to do with our \nsuccess today. We will watch with interest, we will watch with the \nexpectation of complete success, but we will also watch with the \nknowledge that if we need to use force, that force will be every bit as \navailable in the future as it has been for the last 2 weeks. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/23/senate-section/article/S863-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1998\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.
