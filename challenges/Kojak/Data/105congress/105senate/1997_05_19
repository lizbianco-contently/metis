Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business to accommodate a number of Senators who have asked for \ntime to speak.\n  The Budget Committee is scheduled to mark up the budget resolution \nbeginning this afternoon at 4 p.m., and it is my hope that we may count \nany debate time today that we will use relating to the budget toward \nthe statutory time limitation.\n  Tomorrow, the Senate will begin consideration of the concurrent \nbudget resolution, and Members can anticipate rollcall votes throughout \nthe day.\n  It is also possible that the Senate may resume consideration of H.R. \n1122, the partial-birth abortion ban bill, with the intention of a vote \non final passage occurring early this week. We had actually hoped that \nwe could get a vote on that perhaps right after the luncheon on \nTuesday. But there are some discussions underway, and we may not be \nable to get to that that soon.\n  As always, all Members will be notified as soon as any votes are \nscheduled on these or other matters.\n  Also, as a reminder to Members, this is the last week prior to the \nMemorial Day recess and, therefore, Senators can expect a very busy \nweek with us more than likely having to go into the evening on Tuesday, \nWednesday, and Thursday. And we should expect votes on Friday. At least \non Tuesday, I don't know that there will be recorded votes, but \ncertainly on Wednesday and Thursday in order to finish the budget \nresolution, complete action on the partial-birth abortion ban, and also \nget to another vote on the comptime-flextime Family Friendly Workplace \nAct. We will have to have some votes on that probably on Thursday. Then \nwe would probably need to do the budget resolution by Friday, or \nprobably on Friday, as well as the supplemental appropriations on \nFriday, if we haven't been able to get an agreement to do it before \nthen.\n  Also this week we will have to pass the Chemical Weapons Convention \nimplementation bill. I think the problems are being worked out there. \nIt shouldn't take too much time, although a block of time will be \nnecessary to explain what is included in that implementation bill.\n  So, Mr. President, I just want to reconfirm that we do still this \nweek intend to do the budget resolution, finish the debate and final \nvote on the partial-birth abortion ban, have votes on the comptime-\nflextime bill with the hope that we could reach some agreement to \nactually get the legislation completed, and then vote on the budget \nresolution conference and the supplemental conference.\n  We will keep the Members advised of any changes in the schedule.\n  By the way, we do expect this week to take up perhaps some action on \nthe Executive Calendar, at least the judicial nominations, probably \nWednesday or Thursday. And we will have to have recorded votes on those \nthree nominations, if we actually do take them up.\n  So we would try to schedule that either Wednesday or Thursday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/19/senate-section/article/S4663-4", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel).

Mr. President, I rise to speak about a topic which is \ngoing to be voted on here in the U.S. Senate tomorrow, the topic of \npartial-birth abortion. This is an issue which I think is \nunderstandable by virtually every American who has given it any \nconsideration. They understand this is a brutal technique which \ninflicts pain and is the kind of thing which would shock the conscience \nof most Americans not only as it relates to unborn children, but if it \nwere, as a matter of fact, a procedure used even on animals.\n  Mr. President, about 2 weeks ago, a Rhode Island jury found a mother \nguilty of second-degree murder in the death of her newborn daughter. \nThe State medical examiner, according to a May 9 article in the \nProvidence Journal-Bulletin, testified that the little girl died from a \nsingle blow to the back of the head that left a laceration on her scalp \nand an inch-long skull fracture. The umbilical cord and the placenta \nwere still attached to the child.\n  Now, ironically, this Rhode Island woman who had been found guilty of \nsecond-degree murder, if she had, prior to giving birth, allowed a \nphysician to perform a procedure very similar to what she did, a \nprocedure called partial-birth abortion, there would have been no \ncriminal action involved. The baby would have been there, the blow to \nthe head would have been similar, the umbilical cord would still have \nbeen attached, the placenta would still have been there, but because \nthe baby would have been only partially born, it would have been \nentirely legal.\n  This kind of tension that exists in the law between charging and \nconvicting a mother of second-degree murder and authorizing a physician \nto conduct what is called a partial-birth abortion makes no sense to \nthe American people.\n  Let me take a few moments today to talk about the lessons we teach \nwhen we as a culture allow such tensions to persist. When we come down \nhere to the floor and we argue before the cameras, the Nation is \naffected on a level of which we too often take little notice. People \nlook, people listen, people understand.\n  Right now we are debating a violent medical procedure that, in my \njudgment, should be a clear-cut wrong. People understand that. However, \nthe high emotion of the abortion debate seems to blur the vision of \nmany of us who are in the U.S. Congress. We are so caught up in arguing \nabout the definition of technicalities that we are in danger of \nslipping into absurdities ourselves, absurdities that are exemplified \nby the charge and conviction of the woman in Rhode Island.\n  The stakes are high here, as we are talking, in no uncertain terms, \nabout the value of human life. It seems so clear that all of us should \nvote to ban the direct killing of a fully formed, often viable, human \nbeing. Yet because the child is 80 percent born, somehow we have \nallowed the killing of that child to be legal.\n  Now the partisan political rhetoric we expend here and the attempts \nto turn this vote into abstract public policy are setting an example in \nour society and in the world that bring into question our Nation's \nstatus as a moral leader. How can we lecture or threaten China on its \nhuman rights abuses when we stand up and argue that human beings should \nbe brutally butchered in a procedure that is rarely, if ever, medically \nnecessary?\n  How can we question the practice of child slavery in foreign nations \nwhen our own Nation's lawmakers cast cavalier votes to torture our own \ninfants?\n  Let me be clear, though. Our position as a world leader does not \ntrouble me as much as the positions we put our youth in when we refuse \nto provide moral guidance.\n  What are we teaching our own children? What are we saying to them \nabout the value of life? What are we saying to them when we suggest \nthat a technicality provides the difference between destroying a life, \ncommitting murder, and merely having an abortion?\n  What values are we teaching when we vote that the difference between \na partial-birth abortion and a homicide is a mere 3 inches?\n  If the physician took forceps or scissors to collapse the baby's \nskull outside the mother's body, he or she would be charged with \nmurder.\n  Yet, if the skull is collapsed when the baby's head is still \npartially in the birth canal, the homicide becomes a legal procedure.\n  What values are we teaching when lawmakers show more concern for \nanimals or the environment than for human life? Let's look at two \npieces of legislation that demonstrate the absurdity of our present \nvalue system.\n  H.R. 3918 was introduced by then Representative Barbara Boxer on \nNovember 25, 1991. The Congressional Research Service summarizes the \nbill as follows:\n\n       Requires each Federal department or agency head to review \n     and evaluate nonanimal alternatives with the potential for \n     partial or full replacement of the Draize or other animal \n     acute toxicity tests for some or all of the products \n     regulated by such department or agency.\n\n  I might not have all the facts, but it seems to me that Senator \nBoxer--one of the strongest opponents of this legislation--seems to put \nthe pain and suffering of laboratory animals above the pain and \nsuffering of human beings.\n  When you say that you want to replace the Draize, or other animal \nacute toxicity tests, and you are willing to say it is necessary to \nspare animals this kind of pain but it is not necessary to spare these \nmostly born children of the pain inflicted on them by partial-birth \nabortion, I think you can again raise the level of tension between what \nthe public knows is right and the technicality of the law which would \nallow something which the public knows to be very wrong.\n  Former Senator Pell introduced S. 1701 during the 104th Congress. The \nbill prescribes criminal penalties for use of steel jaw leghold traps \non animals; directs the Secretary of the Interior to reward \nnongovernment informers for information leading to a conviction under \nthis act; and empowers enforcement officials to detain, search, and \nseize suspected merchandise or documents and to make arrests with and \nwithout warrants.\n  Senator Pell stated on the floor, ``While this bill does not prohibit \ntrapping, it does outlaw a particularly savage method of trapping.'' \nWell, the bill we are debating today does not outlaw abortion--it \noutlaws ``a particularly savage method of abortion.''\n  I am surprised and even a bit dismayed that the Members supporting \nand proactively fighting for measures that would reduce the suffering \nof animals have not been willing to afford at least the same \nprotections to human beings.\n  What values are we teaching when we appear to value to limbs of \nanimals over the lives of children?\n  And this takes me back to my opening--the emotion and strife of the \nabortion debate is blinding and confusing some Members. However, the \nlegislation before us today is not about an uncertainty, it is about \ncombating acts of barbarism against human beings.\n  Of course, part of the confusion on this issue is due to misleading \nreports on the necessity and practice of partial-birth abortions. As \nreported in Newsweek last October:\n\n       When the partial-birth-abortion debate took shape last \n     year, pro-choice groups insisted the procedure was extremely \n     rare. The number 500 to 600 was tossed around, with the \n     President and others explaining that it was reserved for \n     heart-wrenching cases involving women whose tests show \n     severely deformed fetuses or whose health was at risk.\n\n  That comes from Jonathan Alter, ``When the Facts Get Aborted,'' \nNewsweek, October 7, 1996.\n  But we now have a fairly clear and broad concurrence on the truth \nabout the rarity and utility of this procedure. Let's look at the \nfacts.\n  The fact is that partial-birth abortions are not rare or unusual.\n  The fact is not that it is 500 or 600 cases a year in the entire \ncountry.\n  The Sunday Record of Bergen County, NJ stated: ``But interviews with \nphysicians who use the method reveal in New Jersey alone, at least \n1,500 partial-birth abortions are performed each year''--triple the \n450-500 number which the National Abortion Federation [NAF], a lobby \nfor abortion clinics, has claimed occur in the entire country.\n  The same article in the Bergen County Sunday Record reported:\n\n       Another [New York] metropolitan doctor who works outside \n     New Jersey said he does about 260 post-20-week abortions a \n     year, of which half are by intact D The doctor, who is \n     also a professor at two prestigious\n\n[[Page S4665]]\n\n     teaching hospitals, said he had been teaching intact D \n     since 1981, and he said he knows of two former students on \n     Long Island and two in New York City who use the procedure.\n\n  The truth contravenes the myths of last year's debate--the \nsuggestions by proponents of this procedure that it is only used in \nsituations of dire medical emergency, and that it is limited in its use \nto about 500 or 600 a year nationwide. The truth of the matter is that \nin New Jersey alone it is three times that number.\n  Is partial-birth abortion needed to protect the health of the mother?\n  Frankly, I think we have to always be very concerned about the health \nof women in this debate. We should not do those things that would \nunduly or unnecessarily impair the health of women in this country.\n  President Clinton has justified his veto of the partial-birth \nabortion ban last year by pointing to the legislation's absence of a \nhealth exception. Some Members of this body also argue for a health \nexception. However, the facts indicate that such an exception is \nunnecessary.\n  Four specialists in ob/gyn and fetal medicine representing PHACT--\nPhysicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth--a group of over 500 doctors, \nmostly specialists in ob/gyn, maternal and fetal medicine, and \npediatrics, stated in a September 19, 1996, Wall Street Journal \narticle:\n\n       Contrary to what abortion activists would have us believe, \n     partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to \n     protect a woman's health or her fertility. In fact, the \n     opposite is true: The procedure can pose a significant and \n     immediate threat to both the pregnant woman's health and her \n     fertility.\n\n  In response to the President's statements that partial-birth \nabortions were necessary to preserve the woman's health and their \nability to have future pregnancies, former Surgeon General C. Everett \nKoop stated:\n\n       I believe that Mr. Clinton was misled by his medical \n     advisors on what is fact and what is fiction in reference to \n     late-term abortions. Because in no way can I twist my mind to \n     see that the late-term abortion as described--you know, \n     partial birth, and then destruction of the unborn child \n     before the head is born--is a medical necessity for the \n     mother.\n\n  ``Because in no way can I twist my mind in a way * * *.''\n  C. Everett Koop, former Surgeon General of the United States, \nindicates that it takes a twisting of the mind to get to the point of \nsaying that the baby must be destroyed in that setting.\n  Even Dr. Martin Haskell, who has performed over 1,000 partial-birth \nabortions, said that he performs them routinely for nonmedical reasons, \nand that 80 percent are purely elective--not required to protect the \nhealth of the mother.\n\n  Dr. David Brown, a physician investigating this procedure for the \nWashington Post wrote:\n\n       [I]in most cases where the procedure is used, the physical \n     health of the woman whose pregnancy is being terminated is \n     not in jeopardy * * *. Instead, the ``typical'' patients tend \n     to be young, low-income women, often poorly educated or \n     naive, whose reasons for waiting so long to end their \n     pregnancies are rarely medical.\n\n  The PHACT doctors have even said that at 21 weeks or later, abortion \nis riskier to a woman's health than childbirth. They state in a recent \nletter to the editor of the Washington Post:\n\n       It should be noted that at 21 weeks and after, abortion is \n     twice as risky for women as childbirth: the risk of maternal \n     death is 1 in 6,000 for abortion and 1 in 13,000 for \n     childbirth.\n\n  I hope we will be successful in our endeavor to obtain enough votes \nto override an expected Presidential veto in this matter. Clearly the \nPresident won't be able to rely on the myths and misrepresentations \nthis year that he relied on last year if he is to veto it.\n  We are not only teaching poor values. We are not only setting a bad \nexample. We are risking lives and losing lives as a result of this \nprocedure.\n  George Will tells an interesting story in an April 24 Washington Post \nop-ed which demonstrates the irony of what we are debating here. The \nstory is about Stephanie and Sandra Bartels of Hull, IA. Sandra and \nStephanie were twins born in a South Dakota hospital. They were born 88 \ndays apart by what is called ``delayed-interval delivery.'' Will \nstates:\n\n       Stephanie, born January 5 when her mother went into \n     premature labor in the 23rd week of her pregnancy, weighed 1 \n     pound, 2 ounces. Sandra, weighing 7 pounds, 10 ounces, was \n     born April 2, by which time Stephanie weighed 4 pounds 10 \n     ounces.\n  For 88 days, while her twin sister's life was protected by the law, \nSandra, who was still unborn, under the current law could have been the \nsubject of a partial-birth abortion.\n  As Will states,\n\n       Location is the key factor. Unless she is completely \n     outside the mother she is fair game for the abortionist.\n  The tension between the fact that one twin already born is protected \nby our law, while the other twin yet unborn is fair game for \ndestruction through a brutal procedure called a partial-birth abortion, \nis obvious.\n  Such an absurdity in the law is not consistent with American values. \nIt is not consistent with the expectation of the American people that \nwe govern rationally. Physical location should not be the key factor. \nHowever, George Will is right. Location was and is the key factor, and \nthat locational factor should be abandoned.\n  We should ask ourselves about location. We should ask ourselves: To \nwhat location will our moral compass direct us when we vote on the \nPartial-Birth Abortion Ban Act? I believe it should direct us to the \nlocation where we abandon and outlaw this painful and brutal procedure.\n  We should ask ourselves: Where will we end up on the scale of decency \nand humanity?\n  Will we continue to be guilty of basing our reasoning on a thin, \nirrational thread of support for an inexcusable practice which we would \nnot tolerate in terms of animal experiments?\n  Should we keep drawing these illogical distinctions to sustain the \nbrutal inhumane treatment of our citizens?\n  I hope when this vote comes before the Senate that we will all end up \non the high ground. I hope that our vote to ban this procedure will be \nso resounding that the President will look at our action and think, \nThis legislation is not only based upon rationality and consistency, \nbut it was also endorsed so thoroughly by the U.S. Senate that I ought \nto sign it rather than veto it. We as a nation must refuse to allow the \ngrotesque brutality of partial-birth abortion to continue.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/19/senate-section/article/S4664-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4665-S4668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FAMILY FRIENDLY WORKPLACE ACT\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families in America are facing a \nchallenge raising children--especially since in most cases --if there \nare two parents, they both are in the workplace. Certainly for single \nparents being in the workplace makes raising children even more \ndifficult. For these single parents, if their children have to go to \nthe doctor--they take them. If their children are having trouble at \nschool or get sick during the day, the single parent does not have \nanyone else to rely on.\n  The single parent must take care of the problem themselves. As \ndifficult as that may be, if that single parent is a salaried worker, \nshe can work with her employer to arrange her work schedule to \naccommodate these needs. However, if that single parent is an hourly \nworker, she must find a way to meet her child's needs and work all of \nthe required hours during a 7-day period or lose part of her pay.\n  Demographics have changed significantly since the passage of our \nmajor employment laws. In 1938, when the Fair Labor Standards Act was \nenacted, only 2 out of 12 mothers with school-age children were in the \nworkplace. Today only 3 out of 12 mothers of school-age children are \nnot in the workplace--obviously, the statistics have taken a real flip. \nPeople have gone into the workplace in order to tackle the incredible \ntax burden and the cost of living. It has been said that in some \nfamilies, in most families, one parent works to pay the Government and \nthe other parent works to provide for the family.\n  It is very difficult for families to make ends meet unless you have \nboth\n\n[[Page S4666]]\n\nparents working to provide financial resources for the family. \nTherefore, we have a high level of involvement of the parents of \nAmerica in the workplace--this stresses our families. Regardless of why \nwe have this kind of stress in our lives, it exists. It is real as any \nother societal problem that we are dealing with today. We need a \nsolution.\n  Parents need to be available to their children to go to award \nceremonies, to see them play soccer or football, and to confer with the \nteacher. Parents need to be able to care for a sick child or a child \nthat becomes sick or ill at school without worrying that they will have \nto miss time away from work--and the income that goes with it.\n  We have proposed and will continue to debate--and I think we will \nenact--what is called the Family Friendly Workplace Act. It is a way of \nsaying to parents you should be able to make agreements with your \nemployer about flexible working arrangements, that you should be able \nto save up some time off that comes when you work overtime. Instead of \nbeing paid time-and-one-half, if you want to--at your option and at \nyour request--you should be able to take time-and-one-half in time off \nwith pay. You can use that time later so that when the need arises you \nwill be able to meet the needs of your family.\n  Those who have been opposed to providing this option for America's \nworkers have their own solution to the problem--they think that \nproviding the American worker with more unpaid leave will somehow help \nalready financially strapped workers. They want to expand Family and \nMedical Leave to allow for 24 hours of unpaid leave to attend a child's \nevent.\n  I think the Family Friendly Workplace Act is a superior option. This \nwould allow you--at your option--instead of being paid time-and-one-\nhalf for overtime to take time-and-one-half with pay some other time to \nmeet the needs of your family. The Family Friendly Workplace Act does \nnot say to the moms and dads of America, in order to be a good mom and \ndad, you have to take a pay cut. It says if you can work something out \nwith your employer to put some time-and-one-half hours in the bank and \ntake time off later, you still will be paid for them because you have \nhours in the bank.\n\n  There is more social tension, there is more financial tension, and we \nneed to have the flexibility for families to spend more time with each \nother to resolve those tensions. It is simply true that moms and dads \nin America should not have to take a pay cut in order to be good \nparents.\n  Experience has shown us that pilot programs--or experiments--help us \nunderstand whether a program should be permanently authorized or more \nbroadly adopted. It will tell us whether there are bugs in it that need \nto be worked out or whether it is a program that will work well and can \nsucceed.\n  The Family Friendly Workplace Act is modeled off of one such pilot \nprogram. Since 1978, Federal Government workers have been able to work \nflexible work schedules as provided for in the Federal Employees \nFlexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act. That is, we have had \nflexible working arrangements. We have had compensatory time off for \novertime that has been used at the option of the worker. I believe it \nhas been a model that we can follow to provide for American laborers \nwho work by the hour.\n  As a matter of fact, in 1994 in an Executive order, President Clinton \ndirected more broad use of these flexible scheduling programs \nthroughout the Federal Government. So what we have here is a system \nwhich is working for Federal employees that should be allowed for the \nmen and women of America who work by the hour.\n  I should just take a moment to indicate that all the people who are \nsalaried workers have flextime potentials--the people in the board \nrooms, the presidents and the owners of the companies, the supervisors \nand managers generally. As a matter of fact, the great majority of \nworkers in the country, especially when you put in governmental \nworkers, have comptime and flextime options, but the average hourly \nworker in America does not. It is time to give the hourly workers, the \nlaboring people what the great majority of workers have and that is \nflexible working arrangements.\n  Now, one of the things that opponents of this bill constantly say is \nthat this proposal destroys the 40-hour week, that it somehow would \nforce people to work overtime without pay. Nothing is further from the \ntruth. Taking compensatory time off in the bill is totally--\ncompletely--voluntary. The Family Friendly Workplace Act provides for \nnew, voluntary choices for workers. Section 3 provides, under \ncompensatory time off, that it is voluntary participation. It says, No \nemployee may be required to receive compensatory time in lieu of \nmonetary compensation.\n  That basically says no one can be required, instead of taking time-\nand-one-half pay, to take time-and-one-half off later with pay. It is a \nsystem that says we want to give workers the choice. As a matter of \nfact, so committed are we to choice, even if you decided you wanted to \ntake compensatory time off when you work the overtime hours but later \nchange your mind, the bill says you have an absolute right to get paid \nthe cash.\n  Comptime provides some flexibility for those workers who get paid \novertime. However, many workers never earn overtime compensation. The \nbiweekly work programs and flexible credit hour programs provide \nflexibility for those workers. Participation in these programs also are \ncompletely voluntary. ``No employee may be required to participate in a \nprogram described in this section.'' This is all voluntary. Those who \nsay there are not employee choices in this matter simply have not read \nthis legislation.\n  There are protections for workers to make sure that voluntary means \nvoluntary. The protections that are involved in this bill for workers \nexceed those protections that are involved in the Federal law for State \nand local government workers. ``Section (d). Prohibition of Coercion. \nAn employer shall not directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten or \ncoerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten or coerce any employee.'' \nAnd ``the penalties for abuse are doubled in the current law.'' We have \ntaken great steps here to make sure that this is totally voluntary and \nthat any coercion, direct or indirect, is impermissible and would be \npunished substantially with higher penalties than we have under current \nlaw.\n\n  As a matter of fact, the situation we are recommending in the Family \nFriendly Workplace Act has far more guarantees and protections for \nworkers than are currently involved in the law for State and local \ngovernment workers. The Federal law allowing State and local government \nworkers to have comptime says that workers can be required to be \ninvolved in comptime as a condition of employment. That is not so under \nthe law we are proposing for private workers. It is strictly voluntary. \nIt cannot be required. It is up to the worker. No worker can be \nrequired to participate.\n  Under the law which now applies to State and local government \nworkers, management can decide when a worker must use comptime. Under \nthe Family Friendly Workplace Act, workers cannot be coerced into using \ntheir comptime. Penalties would be doubled for any direct or indirect \ncoercion. There is another significant difference. There is no cash-out \nprovision under the system for State and local government workers, \ncomptime only is paid in cash when the employee is either terminated or \nquits. In other words, if a State or local government worker wants to \nget his overtime in cash, you can only get the cash out of the system \nwhen you leave your job. You have to quit your job to get your money.\n  Under the Family Friendly Workplace Act, you do not have to quit to \nget your money. Any time you change your mind, comptime must be cashed \nout on request. It must be cashed out at the end of each year. So that \nthe Family Friendly Workplace Act is totally voluntary--and there are \nthese structural guarantees--with doubled penalties. These arrangements \nare strictly voluntary. They cannot be required, they cannot be \ncoerced, penalties are doubled, and comptime must be cashed out on \nrequest. This is a system which basically allows workers to make \nchoices. It allows them to make meaningful choices. These are choices \nabout spending time with their families.\n  We have talked about just one of these choices--the choice that \nrelates to comptime which you get when you work overtime. But the truth \nof the matter is, many American workers seldom if ever get overtime. As \na matter\n\n[[Page S4667]]\n\nof fact, in 1996, our census data indicates that only 4.5 percent of \nworking women in the private sector get regular overtime.\n  If we were just to leave this bill at the comptime level and not do \nanything about flexible working arrangements, we would not be providing \nmuch relief to women who work by the hour and never get overtime so \nthey could take comptime instead of time-and-one-half in pay. In order \nto meet the real needs of American workers--the broad workforce--we \nneed to have the kind of breadth of options in the program that is in \nthe program for Federal workers. Federal workers have more than just \ncomptime as an option for flexibility. They have the potential for \nflexible working arrangements so individuals who never get overtime \nstill have the ability to have flexible working arrangements and spend \ntime with their families.\n  If only 4.5 percent of the 28.9 million women who work by the hour in \nthis country--if only 4.5 of percent of them get overtime--really, if \nwe only do comptime, we are not going to help the vast majority of the \nwomen. We have to give the private sector workers the same range of \noptions that exist for the Federal employees. And that includes \nflextime arrangements; the ability to schedule work flexibly and the \nability 1 week to work an hour extra so the next week you can take an \nhour off.\n  Right now, it is shocking, but our legal framework makes it illegal \nfor an employer to say to you, I'll let you work an extra hour on \nFriday so you can take an hour off on Monday. Most Americans are \nshocked by that. They also are shocked by the fact that it is not \nillegal for a Government employee to do it, but it is illegal for an \naverage citizen to do it. They know it is not illegal for the boss to \ndo it or for the boardroom guys to do it or the managers or the \nsupervisors to do it. They know it is not illegal for the salaried \npeople to do it. They ought to have some reservations about a system \nthat has sort of second-class citizenship for hourly paid persons and \nit is illegal for them to work an extra hour on Friday and take an hour \noff on Monday, even when their employer agrees with it. We need to stop \nthat illegality.\n\n  The point is simply this. Since very few working women who work by \nthe hour get overtime, very few will benefit from a comptime only \noption. We need to provide a framework for these women to have the \nability to be with their families, and we have to have flextime in \norder to get that done.\n  Mr. President, this is a great opportunity for us to say to American \nfamilies, We are with you. We are not against you. This is a great \nopportunity for us to say to the working people of the country, You \ndeserve the same chance for flexibility that the Federal Government \nemployees have. You deserve the same chance to be with your children \nthat the salaried workers have--the managers, the supervisors, and \nCEO's or the company Presidents. As a matter of fact, they are a \nminority of workers who do not have these options. We understand that. \nHourly workers are a minority of workers in this country when compared \nto the Government and the salaried and other workers. But they should \nnot be treated as second-class citizens.\n  The soccer game is just as important to the hourly worker's child as \nit is to the boss' child. It is just as important to go to the school \ndoctor to confer about your child's health if you are an hourly worker \nas it is if you are a Federal Government employee. It is just as \nimportant for your family to operate as a family, to be able to shape \nthe values and to provide the framing, the development of the next \ngeneration if you are an hourly worker as if you are paid in some other \nway. The Family Friendly Workplace Act is simply a means of getting \nthat done.\n  It is a means we have designed with protections that are strong. The \nprotections are superior to the protections that are there for State/\nlocal government workers. I am a little bit befuddled because the \nindividuals who argue most aggressively against providing this for \nhourly private sector workers across this country sponsored the \nlegislation for State and local government workers. Not only did they \nsponsor the legislation for the State and local government workers, but \nthat legislation --that they cosponsored--has fewer protections than \ndoes the legislation we are proposing for private workers. Yet those \nwho sponsored the fewer protections for State and local government \nworkers are criticizing the proposal in the private sector because they \nsay enough protections do not exist in the measure. That is difficult \nto understand. Those individuals, I think, should reevaluate their \nposition.\n  When organized labor leaders of this country oppose laboring people \ngetting the opportunity to spend time with their families and flexible \nworking arrangements, we ought to ask them to come to the table to help \nus, to help us assure an opportunity for America's working people, not \nstand aside and hurt us and criticize a system which is far superior to \nthe one that has been endorsed and for which they negotiate when they \nare representing State and local government workers.\n  Mr. President, the opportunity to pass flexible working arrangements \nto help parents be better parents, to have more time to spend with \ntheir families, to be able to take the time off with pay by using \ncompensatory time and flexible working arrangements is what the future \nof America will be all about. Those who suggest we have to have more \nunpaid leave so parents will have to choose between taking a pay cut \nand helping their child are on the wrong track. People are not working \nbecause they can afford to take a pay cut. They are working because \nthey need the money, and we should never ask them to sacrifice their \nchild in order to make more money or to sacrifice the money they need \nto help their child in order to spend time with their child.\n  The last time I checked, when my children had to go to the dentist \nand I needed to take them there, that is not the time I could do with \nless money. That's the time I needed more money, when there was a \ncrisis, when I needed to go to school to see what was happening with my \nchild, take the child to the doctor or to the dentist. I didn't want to \ntake a pay cut. I didn't want to have my salary reduced. Of course I \nwouldn't. I am a Member of the Senate, I am a Government employee. I \nhave flexible working arrangements. But I do know this, for us to say \nto the working people of America: When you have a special need in your \nfamily, you should take a pay cut and you should take leave without \npay, we are asking them to jump out of the frying pan into the fire.\n  As a matter of fact, family and medical leave has been the occasion \nfor a lot of people to find themselves in real financial distress. When \nthe Commission on Family and Medical Leave met, it found that over 10 \npercent of all people who took that unpaid leave to meet the needs of \ntheir family had to go on welfare because of the loss of salary. \nWouldn't it have been better to have flexible working arrangements and \nsome comptime in the bank so you could do that? Ten percent went on \nwelfare, over 40 percent said they had to defer the payment of bills. \nThey just had to stop paying their bills. About 20 percent said they \nhad to borrow money. We have a great opportunity to say to families, \n``If you work together, cooperate with your employer in a framework of \nsolid protections in a voluntary system, you will be able to be better \nparents and you will not have to take a pay cut to do it.''\n  I call upon my colleagues to enact this legislation as a matter of \ngreat service to the people of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

Mr. President, there are many times when I am so inclined \nto pay my respects to Senators who have gone out of their way to take a \nsomewhat different stand. And I imagine that during the past week--and \nthroughout the days of debate on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in \nthe 104th Congress, as a matter of fact--that if unborn children had a \nvote or a message of communication and a way to deliver it, they would \nbe sending their love to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, \nMr. Santorum; and to the distinguished occupant of the chair, Mr. \nDeWine of Ohio; and to the able Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith \nas well as to the able Senators from Texas and Tennessee, Mr. Gramm and \nMr. Frist; and on and on.\n  It has not always been easy to take the pro-life position on this \nfloor, but it is a lot easier and a lot more comfortable now, thanks to \nthese great Senators and others. I personally pay my respects to all \nwho have participated in the debate on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban \nAct up to this point.\n  By the way, as one who has participated in the abortion debates since \nthe Supreme Court's Roe versus Wade decision in 1973, and as one who \nhas been condemned by many in certain quarters, I am so thankful that \nthe cavalry has arrived in the Senate and now other Senators are \nstanding up to be counted on an issue that involves the survival of \nthis country. I have long felt if our country cannot reconcile with \nmorality and decency and honesty, the position on the deliberate \ndestruction of the most innocent, the most helpless of human life, that \nmay be at peril--lying just down the road--is the survival of this \ncountry.\n  In any case, the abortion debate shifted dramatically when \nlegislation was introduced in the 104th Congress to spare unborn babies \nfrom a merciless procedure known as a partial-birth abortion. Because \nof the debate in Congress and the heightened concern of the American \npeople, the spotlight no longer is focused on the sanctimonious, so-\ncalled right to choose; instead, the debate now centers around the \nultimate question: Does an innocent, defenseless, unborn child have a \nright to live? Senators have cast their votes for and against \nlegislation outlawing partial-birth abortions on two previous \noccasions--first on December 6, 1995, when 54 Senators voted to ban \npartial-birth abortions. But the President of the United States, Mr. \nClinton, saw fit to veto that bill. The Senate, on September 26 of last \nyear, failed to override that Presidential veto. Fifty-seven Senators \nvoted to override, but the 57 were 10 votes fewer than the two-thirds \nnecessary and required to override.\n  Which brings me to where we are now and the reason I stand here to \npay my respects to Senators like the distinguished occupant of the \nchair, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Smith, and others. The Senate has \nbeen considering whether an innocent baby--partially born, just 3 \ninches from the protection of the law--deserves the right to live, to \nlove, and to be loved. Interestingly enough, the House of \nRepresentatives has already passed H.R. 1122, which is the bill now \nbefore the Senate. In my judgment, the Senate must not squander this \nopportunity to outlaw partial-birth abortions, and I cannot believe it \nwill.\n  Those who oppose the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, as it is named, \nhave again asserted the necessity of the procedure that enables doctors \nto deliver babies partially, feet first from the womb, only to have \ntheir brains brutally removed by the doctor's instruments. This \nprocedure has prompted revulsion across this land, even among many who \npreviously have been vocal advocates of the right to choose.\n  Well-known medical doctors, obstetricians and gynecologists have \nrepeatedly rejected the assertions that a partial-birth abortion is \nneeded to protect the health of a woman in a late-term complicated \npregnancy. Dr. Pamela E. Smith, who is director of medical education in \nthe department of obstetrics and gynecology at Chicago's Mount Sinai \nHospital, in a letter to Senators described these assertions as--in her \nwords, not mine--``deceptive and patently untrue.''\n\n  Also, Mr. President, there is much to be said about the facts \nsurrounding the number of partial-birth abortions performed annually \nand the reason they are performed--or at least the given, stated \nreason. It is hard to overlook the recent confession of Ron \nFitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion \nProviders, who admitted that he, himself, had deceived the American \npeople on national television about the number and the nature of \npartial-birth abortions.\n  Mr. Fitzsimmons now estimates that up to 5,000 partial-birth \nabortions are conducted annually on healthy women carrying healthy \nbabies. This is a far cry from the rhetoric espoused by Washington's \npro-abortion groups who maintain that only 500 partial-birth abortions \nare performed every year, and only in extreme medical circumstances.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on, but Senators throughout this \ndebate have provided ample evidence affirming the need to rid America \nof this senseless, brutal form of killing. And it is also important to \nnote that the American people recognize the moral significance of this \nlegislation. The continued outpouring of letters and phone calls from \nacross the country in support of a ban on partial-birth abortions has \nbeen nothing short of remarkable.\n  I remember so vividly the day in January 1973, when the Supreme Court \nhanded down the decision to legalize abortion. It was hard to find many \npeople to speak up, certainly on the floor of the Senate, on behalf of \nunborn babies.\n  But it is time, once again, for Members of the Senate to stand up and \nbe counted for or against the most helpless human beings imaginable, \nfor or against the destruction of innocent human life in such a \nrepugnant way. The Senate simply must pass the Partial-Birth Abortion \nBan Act, and I pray that it will do it by a margin of at least 67 votes \nin favor of the ban.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/19/senate-section/article/S4668-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, last week a fire devastated downtown \nRapid City, consuming the historic Sweeney Building in a furious blaze \nthat threatened to destroy the entire block. Only the heroic efforts of \nthe Rapid City Fire Department and emergency workers from all over the \ncounty ensured that the damage, as severe as it was, was contained.\n  This terrible blaze took a much-loved part of our heritage from us. \nThe Sweeney Building had towered over Rapid City for 111 years, and was \none of the oldest buildings in the Black Hills. Its builder, Tom \nSweeney, was legendary. His name and slogan ``Tom Sweeney Wants to See \nYou'' were famous throughout the hills, and his showmanship put Buffalo \nBill to shame. His store was full of everything from gold pans to \nwagons for the early pioneers, and it was said that he could--and did--\nsell anything. Tom's store is gone now, and it will be missed.\n  Although part of our past, the Sweeney Building also was a vibrant \npart of our present. Seven businesses located in the building were lost \nin the Rapid City fire. They ranged from the State Barbershop, where \nVern Johnson cut hair for 37 years, to the 1-week-old Blue Moon \nnightclub. No one is yet\n\n[[Page S4669]]\n\nsure how the fire started, but shortly after firefighters arrived to \ninvestigate reports of smoke, a broken window fed the fire with a \nsudden rush of oxygen. The result was a fiery explosion that shattered \nstorefront windows and blew out the rear wall of the building, causing \na rain of bricks to fall on Larry and Mike Blote, two owners of the \nbuilding, and Pat Dobbs, a reporter for the Rapid City Journal. \nThankfully, they had just minor injuries.\n  Soon after the explosion, Fire Chief Owen Hibbard made the difficult \ndecision to retreat from the building. Few choices are more painful for \nfirefighters. They are by nature people whose instincts urge them to \nsave and preserve, and to fight a fire until the end. Yet as the flames \nof the Sweeney Building climbed higher and 40 mph winds blew cinders \nand sparks onto the roofs of neighboring buildings, Chief Hibbard \nrecognized that the out-of-control blaze could destroy the entire \nblock. Ordering his people back, he formed a defensive line around the \nfire and began the difficult work of containing it. Over the next 2 \nhours, with the sounds of exploding gunpowder and ammunition thundering \nfrom the burning First Stop Gun and Coin shop, the firefighters labored \nto cool nearby buildings and reduce the intensity of the blaze. By 4 \np.m., the fire had been successfully contained, and dozens of homes and \nbusinesses that could have been destroyed were saved.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Rapid City Fire Department for their \noutstanding job containing this fire. It is due to their preplanning, \ntraining, and strong leadership that no one sustained serious injuries, \ndespite dangerous circumstances ranging from backdraft explosions to \nricocheting bullets. I also want to thank Mayor Jim Shaw for his calm \nand solid leadership throughout this crisis. The loss of the Sweeney \nBuilding has been difficult, especially for those men and women who \nlost their livelihood, but I am confident that, together, we will \nrecover.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

Mr. President, we are going to, this week, enter into one \nof the most serious debates that we will have all year, one of the \nmatters that I think is the most serious that we will address all year, \nand that is the question of the budget. As a matter of fact, it is my \nunderstanding we will talk about two budgets. One will be the \nappropriations for the supplemental budget, designed to deal with \ndisaster and other matters, but then the real budget for the year which \nwill outline the spending for this country.\n  I think this is important, particularly important, because there is \nmuch more to it than arithmetic. It is not simply numbers. It is not \nsimply what we will spend. I think it has to do with a number of things \nthat are of particular significance. I hope that we give some \nconsideration to these broader things as we talk about numbers, which \nwe inevitably will do. One has to do with the size of the Government. \nIt has to do with the potential and the opportunity to reduce the size \nof Government. I happen to believe that Government has become too large \nand that it could be smaller. It could be much more efficient. I \nsuspect it would be more efficient if it were smaller. The budget is \none of the ways that you do that.\n  Government by its nature does not get smaller unless somehow there is \na restriction on the amount of money available. I think it also gets \nmore efficient when there is less money to do the job, and it is \nsimilar to what has to be done in the private sector.\n  Second, it has, of course, to do with priorities. Each of us, as we \nspend our money, whether in business or personal and private family \nlives, have to set priorities. There is never enough money for \neverything. Certainly that is increasingly true with Government. So it \nis necessary to set priorities, to decide which of the many functions \nof Government are most important, which ones need to be financed, which \nones need to be funded, which ones, indeed, could be reduced or \neliminated.\n  Third, it has to do with taxing. It has to do with how much money we \nare going to allow families to keep, to spend for themselves. Average \nfamily spending for taxes now is nearly 40 percent, 40 percent of \nrevenue from the family. It was just recently that we had tax day, so \nthat everything we earned up until just a week or so ago all went for \ntaxes.\n  The budget has to do with the potential, the possibility of reducing \nthe burden on the families in this country. It has to do with the \nincentive for investment. Tax reduction is also an opportunity to have \ninvestments for people to put into their businesses, to create jobs, to \nstrengthen the economy. There is a direct relationship, particularly in \ntax reductions such as capital gains which encourages people to invest.\n  The budget gives us an opportunity to keep Medicare and entitlements \navailable.\n  I just met this morning with a great group of young people, high \nschool people. We talked a little bit about entitlements. We talked \nspecifically about Medicare. Frankly, all of them, 18 years old, said, \n``We really do not think there will be any Medicare for us.'' Indeed, \nthere will not be unless we make some changes. Budgets, of course, are \nwhere it is possible to do that.\n\n  Budgets also test our willingness to be financially responsible, to \nbalance the budget and not spend more than we take in, which we have \ndone for more than 30 years here in this Congress. I have to say I have \nnot done it for 30 years because I have not been here for 30 years.\n  Finally, and related to that, of course, budgets determine what will \nwe leave to our kids to pay in terms of budgets, in terms of debts. \nWhat we have done, of course, over the last few years, is we have spent \nmore than we took in and put it on the old credit card, and it is maxed \nout. So we will determine how much of a debt we leave to our kids.\n  That is what we are talking about in terms of budgets. It will be \ndifficult. It will be difficult. American voters, as someone said, and \nI think it is true, sent two teams to do the same thing, two teams with \nquite different philosophies. If everyone here had the same philosophy \nthen we would have a certain kind of a budget. If everybody believed we \nought to have smaller Government, we would have smaller Government. If \neverybody thought we ought to have more tax relief, we would have that, \nbut everybody does not. There are two different points of view that \nwill have to be reconciled before anything can be done.\n  So we approach a budget with, I think, a certain amount of reserve. \nCertainly this is not a breakthrough budget. This is not a turnaround. \nThis is not a change, a sea change, I do not believe. I do not think it \nis designed for meaningful reduction in the size of Government or \nspending reductions. It is not dedicated to real honest-to-goodness tax \nrelief.\n  Now, on the other hand, I think in fairness, and we will have to talk \nabout it, it does provide some of the principles that most of us have \ntalked about for some time. It probably comes closer, and I hope it \ndoes, to a real balance than any budget in recent history over a period \nof 5 years, a real balanced budget.\n  Now you have to keep in mind you can balance the budget in many ways. \nYou can continue to increase taxes and increase revenue and balance the \nbudget up here, when the real idea that most people want to balance the \nbudget is down here, and reduce some of the spending.\n  Second, it provides some tax relief. We are told that there will be \nan opportunity on the floor for debate of tax relief. One will be $500 \nper child for family relief. That is good. Another would be some relief \nof capital gains taxes. That is good. It will help the economy. And in \nthe short term, at least, it will increase revenues. Some reduction in \nestate taxes, I think, is good.\n  In my State of Wyoming, there are lots of family farmers, ranches, \nand\n\n[[Page S4670]]\n\nsmall businesses. People have worked all of their lives--and many times \nthe lives of their forebears--to put together a business or a ranch or \na farm, often with relatively little flow of cash but lots of assets. \nUnder the present circumstances, that is taxed at nearly 50 percent. \nMany have to sell those assets in order to pay the taxes. That ought to \nbe changed.\n  There will be some effort made at entitlement reform. That is good. \nIt helps preserve Medicare for people who will be on it in the future. \nThere has to be some changes made to do that. So it is a kind of a \nmixed bag, it seems to me.\n  There are some other items I would like to see changed. I would like \nto see some incentives to increase the capital gains so that there is \nincentive to invest in the economy.\n  I would like to see some real long-term meaningful changes in \nMedicare so that our kids will have a chance.\n  The President has sort of tinkered around the edges, and takes down \nthe providers' cost a little here and there to avoid any real tough \ndecision, but he is doing a little something. We have to make them. The \nsooner we make them, the less costly they will have to be. We need to \nallow families to keep more of their dough.\n  We need to be careful about balancing the budget and about making \nvery optimistic projections in the future. Suddenly, there was $200 \nbillion-plus because of the projections for the future.\n  We ought to make kind of a level projection, it seems to me. And \nthen, if we are fortunate enough to have revenue growth, why not apply \nthat to the debt? Wouldn't that be a nice idea? But no, we put that on \nso that we continue to spend and see the Government grow larger.\n  These are some of the things we will be grappling with this week. I \nthink they are very difficult ones, and some things I hope we do \nregardless of what we do with the tax bill, regardless of what we do \nwith the budget. I hope we move on past that to reform the tax system. \nThe tax system needs to be changed.\n  People are increasingly complaining about the IRS. And I understand \nthat. The tax issue is not going to change the IRS a great deal until \nyou change the system that they have to enforce. We ought to do that.\n  This budget should not mean we are going to leave it as it is for 5 \nyears. We need meaningful reductions in taxes.\n  We need a smaller Government. We need to change the situation so that \nthe Government doesn't compete with the private sector in those things \nthat the Government does that are commercial in nature. We ought to \nallow for contracting, and let private small businesses be able to \ncompete to do things that the Government does that are basically \ncommercial.\n  Mr. President, there is something else that I think we ought to do \nthat would help us. We ought to have a biennial budget.\n  We spend almost all of our time with this budget. We started this \nthing just about this time in January when the Congress came in. We \nwill be very fortunate if we are through by the middle of September or \nthe 1st of October. And, as you know, Mr. President, it has been longer \nthan that in the past.\n  It wouldn't take any longer to do it on a biennial basis. We could \nknow those figures just as well. The agencies would have 2 years of \nknowing where their money is going to be. But, most important of all, \nwe could have the budget one year and the next year do oversight. That \nis part of Congress' responsibility, to oversee the things that the \nGovernment is doing. We can accomplish a great deal, if we can do that.\n  So, Mr. President, I look forward to this week's debate and \ndiscussions. I am confident we will come out of it with something \nbetter than we have had.\n  Thank you for the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/19/senate-section/article/S4669-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4670-S4672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BAN ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to announce that \nin the last few days I have been working with Representative Canady in \nthe House, with Senator Frist here in the Senate, and with the American \nMedical Association in trying to work out some changes to H.R. 1122, \nthe Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which would satisfy some of the \nconcerns that the board at the American Medical Association had with \nthe legislation.\n  I am very pleased to report that we have been able to reach some \ntechnical changes with the legislation that has gained the support of \nthe American Medical Association. I will read for the Record and insert \ninto the Record a copy of a letter that was sent to me just a very \nshort time ago from P. John Seward, M.D., executive vice president of \nthe American Medical Association.\n\n       Dear Senator Santorum: The American Medical Association \n     (AMA) is writing to support HR 1122, ``The Partial Birth \n     Abortion Ban Act of 1997,'' as amended. Although our general \n     policy is to oppose legislation criminalizing medical \n     practice or procedure, the AMA has supported such legislation \n     where the procedure was narrowly defined and not medically \n     indicated. HR 1122 now meets both those tests.\n       Our support of this legislation is based on three specific \n     principles. First, the bill would allow a legitimiate \n     exception where the life of the mother was endangered, \n     thereby preserving the physician's judgment to take any \n     medically necessary steps to save the life of the mother. \n     Second, the bill would clearly define the prohibited \n     procedure so that it is clear on the face of the legislation \n     what act is to be banned. Finally, the bill would give any \n     accused physician the right to have his or her conduct \n     reviewed by the State Medical Board before a criminal trial \n     commenced. In this manner, the bill would provide a formal \n     role for valuable medical peer determination in any \n     enforcement proceeding.\n       The AMA believes that with these changes, physicians will \n     be on notice as to the exact nature of the prohibited \n     conduct.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to work with you towards \n     restricting a procedure we all agree is not good medicine.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              P.

Rick Santorum,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: The American Medical Association \n     (AMA) is writing to support HR 1122, ``The Partial Birth \n     Abortion Ban Act of 1997,'' as amended.

John Seward, M.D.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, before I go into the details of the \namendment, let me also enter into the Record a statement by Senator \nBill Frist.\n  I cannot emphasize enough how important he has been as the only \nphysician here in the U.S. Senate in helping us in the debate here on \nthe Senate floor and providing that expertise that is so necessary in \nthese kinds of medical issues, and also in helping us work with the AMA \nto come up with some language that could garner their support.\n  I quote Senator Frist's statement. He would have been here to \nannounce this. But I understand we are going to be closing up shortly, \nand he is still on an airplane.\n\n       As the only physician in the Senate, I am proud of the \n     American Medical Association's decision to support the ban on \n     partial birth abortions. This is the strongest medical \n     confirmation yet that this so-called medical\n\n[[Page S4671]]\n\n     procedure, is brutal, inhumane, and medically unnecessary. As \n     I said on the floor of the United States Senate, any provider \n     who performs a partial birth abortion has violated the \n     Hippocratic principle, ``First do no harm.''\n       The President has already been standing on shaky ground in \n     his efforts to explain his intent to veto once again a ban of \n     this grisly and unnecessary procedure. With these technical \n     changes and the endorsement of the AMA, it's time for the \n     President to do the right thing--it's time for him to sign \n     this bill.\n\n  Mr. President, let me go through the changes that are in the bill \nthat we are going to amend tomorrow morning. We hope to get unanimous \nconsent to amend it. These are technical changes, and we believe that, \nirrespective of your position on the bill, these are changes that can \nbe supported.\n  The first thing this bill does, as has been referred to, is to \ntighten up the language on what we mean by partial-birth abortion. \nThere was some concern principally about a situation where the doctor \nwould be delivering a baby with a normal delivery, but the baby would \nbe delivered breech. And that happens on occasion. The baby is \ndelivered in a breech position. The concern is that some complication \nmay occur in the course of this breech delivery, and the doctor would \nbe required, in order to save the mother's life, to perform some sort \nof procedure that would result in the killing of the baby.\n  Those are always very terrible situations. But the AMA was concerned \nthat, because the definition was not specific enough from their \nreading, some zealous prosecutor could come out and accuse the doctor, \nwho has not performed an abortion--does not intend to perform an \nabortion--but performed a normal delivery and, because of a \ncomplication, that somehow he or she could be covered under this act.\n  We have tightened up the language with mens rea, to use the legal \nterm. That directs the mental state--as to what the doctor was doing \nwhen he was delivering the baby for the purpose of a live birth and is \nnot doing an abortion.\n  So we tightened that language up substantially to satisfy that. That \nkind of situation would no longer be covered under the act. Frankly, I \ndon't believe it is covered under the original act. But this makes it \ncrystal clear that it is not covered under the act.\n  I think to the extent that we have made that clear and that it is \npositive to the extent that we have put in the requisite mens rea for a \ncriminal statute, which arguably was somewhat vague in the original \nbill, we have now done that. We have tightened it up. This is a good, \nsolid criminal statute as a result of that.\n  Second, as was discussed in the AMA letter, the State medical boards, \nwe understand that if the doctor is going to be charged in doing one of \nthose procedures, there is going to be medical evidence presented. The \ndoctor and his team are going to present their medical experts, and the \nprosecutor will present their medical experts.\n  This gives us some medical expertise, if you will, that is not in \neither camp but gives us a peer review determination as to what they \nsaw happen and what they believe happened. It will most likely result \nin as many people who agree with the physician as not. It is not \nsomething that we believe is a stacked deck one way or the other. We \nbelieve it is a legitimate peer review mechanism.\n  It is admissible in court but not determinative. It is simply medical \nevidence to be used should the prosecution continue with the case. We \nthink that is important. It certainly is important for the professional \nstandards that the AMA and other State medical associations would like \nto see in their profession.\n  So we have no problem with that. We believe it is legitimate medical \nevidence that would be otherwise included. So that is, again, a \npositive contribution to the legislation.\n  The other change is really the ultimate of technical changes that was \nsurplus language in the life-of-the-mother exception where we said \nbasically twice that it was the only procedure necessary. We said it \ntwice. You don't need to say it twice. You just say necessary. It was \nthe only procedure available that is necessary to save the life of \nmother. We don't say ``necessary'' twice. So we eliminated the surplus \nlanguage.\n  Those are the three changes. They certainly do not go to the \nsubstance of the legislation. They are technical in nature. They are \ndefined and solidifying in nature as a criminal statute and, I believe, \na positive contribution.\n  I believe eventually, whether it is in the next few months as a \nresult of this bill being passed and either signed by the President or \nhaving the President's veto overridden, that this bill will end up in \ncourt. Someone will challenge the constitutionality after this \nlegislation.\n  My feeling is that this legislation not only has to be solid on the \nbasis of abortion law, but also it has to be solid based on criminal \nlaw and how a criminal statute is drafted.\n  I think what we have done with these changes is improve the language \nas a criminal statute. I think that is very important, and I would hate \nto go through the entire legislative process and have the courts say, \n``Well, on abortion law you are fine, but on criminal law you are too \nvague, and we are throwing it out for that.''\n  That would be a disconcerting result, one that I do not want to see \nand one that I believe is greatly reduced as a result of the changes \nthat we hope to make tomorrow in this legislation, and which we will \nmake tomorrow.\n  I have to say, finally, how excited I am that the AMA has stepped \nforward and supported this legislation.\n  This is the association that is the most preeminent association that \noversees medicine in this country. As Dr. Seward said, partial-birth \nabortion is not good medicine. As Dr. C. Everett Koop said, it is not \nmedically necessary for the life and health of the mother to do this \nprocedure. This is a procedure that is a rogue procedure. It should be \nan outlawed procedure. We are attempting to outlaw this procedure \nbecause it just simply goes too far.\n  I am hopeful, with the support of the preeminent medical authority in \nthis country, the American Medical Association, Members of this Senate \nwill look long and hard now in these last few hours before the vote, \nwhich we are hoping to have scheduled tomorrow afternoon, they will \nlook long and hard at the changes, at the evidence that now has been \npresented, the facts that have now been presented as a result of some \nof the admissions by the abortion industry as to what a partial-birth \nabortion is, when it is used, who it is used on, all of this new \ninformation that we have been presented in the Senate since the last \nvote a year ago, almost a year ago, and hopefully it is enough evidence \nand enough change in the statute that is being proposed, the bill that \nis being proposed, that we will get the requisite 67 votes.\n  I know there are a half a dozen or more Members who have still not \npublicly announced what their position is on this bill. That is more \nthan enough votes for us to get it to the 67 we need to override the \nPresident's veto. I ask each and every Member who is not committed, \nand, frankly, I would ask those Members who are committed in light of \nthe evidence that has been presented, in light of the changes that we \nhave made in this legislation, in light of the AMA's strong endorsement \nand support for this legislation, to take another look. I know it is \nvery difficult for Members on this issue to walk outside of their camp \nof support. If you are a pro-choice Member, it is very difficult to \nwalk outside of that camp and venture away from those groups of \nabortion-rights supporters who have supported you in your election and \nwho by and large agree. But it takes a lot of courage to look at your \nfriends and tell them when they are wrong. The AMA supports legalized \nabortion, and they have been able to look at their friends and say in \nthis case you are wrong; this is not an approved medical procedure and \nwe should not have it legal in this country.\n  That took a lot of courage. I commend them for their courage. I just \nsuggest that if the AMA can stand up to others in the medical community \nwho believe abortion anytime, anywhere, under any procedure should be \nlegal, they are willing to stand up to those within their ranks who \nhold that very extreme position, then I hope Members of this body who \nare not supposed to come here to argue extremist, irrational positions \nbut here to represent what is in the best interests of this country \nwill be able to look into the faces of the organizations that I know \nthey seek support from on election day and with whom I know they\n\n[[Page S4672]]\n\nfind themselves in agreement on most occasions, look at them and say, \nyou have gone too far this time; we have to draw a line somewhere on \nthis issue; it is not an absolute right for anyone at any point in time \nunder any method to kill their children, that we have to have limits. \nEven Senator Daschle and, to some degree, although minor, Senators \nFeinstein and Boxer have admitted there is some limit here as to what \nwe can do, on what we should allow in the area of abortion.\n  The AMA and other professionals in the field have stood up and said \nthis is the line to draw. I hope Members have the courage to stand up \nand say this is where we draw the line. I commend Members who have done \nthat already. I commend them for their understanding that, frankly, \nthis is less about abortion and more about infanticide; this is more \nabout when we take a baby that is out of the womb, being born, outside \nof the mother and, frankly, gratuitously kill that baby. We have gone \ntoo far. There is no medical reason that a baby four-fifths delivered, \neverything outside of the mother with the exception of the head, there \nis no reason to perform a procedure on that baby that kills it at that \npoint. There is no medical reason to protect the life or health of the \nmother ever to kill the baby at that point. In fact, it is more \ndangerous for the mother to insert instruments, to puncture bone by \nstabbing the baby at the base of the skull. That is dangerous to the \nhealth and life of the mother. It is obviously very dangerous to the \nbaby.\n  That is not a safe procedure. You cannot argue that the baby sitting \nthere in that position, that it is for the health of the mother to \ninsert an instrument into the baby's skull. It is not. It can never be. \nSo what we are saying is, whether it is partial-birth abortion or all \nlength, give the baby a chance. Give the baby a chance.\n  There may be cases, and we understand that--folks who have gotten up \nand argued to ban this procedure have always recognized that there are \nsituations in which the health and life of the mother are in danger and \nthat separation of the child from the mother is necessary to protect \nthe mother's health and life. But it is never necessary, certainly not \nby doing this barbaric procedure, to kill the baby in the process. You \nhave a baby four-fifths born with a tiny head that is inches away from \nthat first breath. Let the baby be born. Give it at least a chance to \nsee if that baby can survive. Why do violence to that little baby? \nThere is no medical reason. Why protect a procedure that does violence \nunnecessarily to little babies who otherwise would be born alive? They \nmay not survive long. They may only survive minutes or hours. But give \nthem the dignity of being born and brought into our human community. \nGive them the dignity of not having violence be the only thing they \nknow of this Earth. Give them the dignity of life and memory as a part \nof our human family.\n\n  I am very hopeful that as a result of the endorsement of the AMA and \nother evidence that has come out, we can muster up the moral courage to \nsay no to this procedure. I hope you can.\n  I hope that anyone who is in the sound of my voice will call, write, \nfax, E-mail, pray, send any kind of communication they possibly can to \nMembers of the Senate who are going to be voting here tomorrow on this \nlegislation asking that they now look at the evidence presented, look \nat the changes in the legislation, look at the evidence that has been \npresented and make the right decision for these children, make the \nright decision for our culture.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I appreciate so much the remarks of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania. I associate myself with everything he said, \nand I intend to speak on this subject tomorrow before we have the final \nvote. I trust that Members will give it great thought before they make \ntheir final decision because we are on the verge of making a \ndetermination that I think is very important to the future of this \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/19/senate-section/article/S4670-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4672-S4676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this evening I should like to take just a \nvery few moments to report, along with my colleague from Connecticut, \nSenator Lieberman, on the recently released Quadrennial Defense Review. \nIt was released today by the Secretary of Defense. It is the \nculmination of a very extensive process at the Department of Defense \nover the shape and makeup, the characterization and the implementation \nof our Armed Forces for the next several years.\n  We are at a unique point in our history, particularly as it relates \nto defense issues. We have come through a period of time when our \nstrategy was primarily based on the threat from another superpower--the \nSoviet Union--a nuclear threat that required an extraordinary \ncommitment of resources, of manpower, of effort to try to contain and \nto try to nullify that threat. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, with \nthe fall of the Soviet Union, with the realignment that has taken place \nwith the United States emerging as the one superpower in the world, we \nmay have the luxury of looking at our defense structure, of making \ndecisions and beginning a process of fashioning our defense forces for \nthe threats of the future and not the threats of the past.\n  It is important to recognize, as Secretary Cohen has and as \nacknowledged in this Quadrennial Defense Review which was just released \ntoday, this is not a status quo situation. We have made extraordinary \nstrides in terms of reshaping our forces from perhaps what was the peak \nof our defense effort in 1985, a very, very substantial decline in the \nnumber of active duty forces and the percentage of our budget and \npercentage of our gross national product that is devoted to defense. In \nthe process, much of the framework that puts us in a position to make \ndecisions in the future has at least been initiated, and the QDR, \nQuadrennial Defense Review, encompasses a lot of that thinking.\n  Because so often in the Congress we receive the conclusion of the \nanalysis of the Department of Defense after all the decisionmaking \nprocess has been conducted and after the options have been evaluated, \nwe do not have those same resources here in the Congress to ask the \nappropriate questions and get the full view of where we think we ought \nto go with our national defense policy. So Senator Lieberman and I, \nalong with others, in last year's authorization bill created a National \nDefense Panel consisting of outside experts in military affairs, who \nhad a lifetime of experience, who could give us through this process a \nsecond look, a second opinion. I am pleased that they were able to have \naccess to the process, the thinking process and the decisionmaking \nprocess that was undertaken in the Department of Defense on the QDR. \nThey will now undertake a very thorough and very complete analysis of \nthis QDR and report back to Congress. We have their preliminary report. \nThey will report back to Congress no later than December 15 of this \nyear giving us their view of current threats and future threats the \nUnited States might face, the strategy that we ought to employ to \naddress those threats, as well as how we ought to implement that \nparticular strategy and how we pay for it.\n  So we are looking forward at a process, and I have described this \nprocess in some detail because I do not want Members to think that this \nis the final chapter in the book. This really is the initial chapter in \nthe decisionmaking process that has to be undertaken by the Congress \nand the administration over the next several months, if not several \nyears, as we look into the next century and try to define the national \ndefense strategy and the force to implement that particular strategy.\n  I will say this: I think the Secretary of Defense and the people who \nhave undertaken this effort, the QDR, have done this in good faith. I \nthink they have asked the tough questions. They have evaluated the \nvarious options. They will admit that this is an initial stage of the \nprocess and not the final chapter. They will indicate that there is \nmore to come. There are more decisions to be made.\n  But I also say to my colleagues, a lot of the burden \nand responsibility also falls on us. The Department of Defense has \npresented its viewpoint of where we are going in the future, but we are \nthe ones who have to ultimately make the decision as to whether to \nratify what they have said, modify what they have\n\n[[Page S4673]]\n\nsaid, or reject what they have said and come up with our own \nalternatives. There are issues in the QDR Report to which a lot of \nMembers, various Members, are going to say: ``wait a minute, that gets \na little too close to home.'' We are talking about two more rounds of \nbase closings. We have reduced our force structure more than a third \nsince 1985, and yet we have reduced our infrastructure, our bases which \nsupport that force structure, by only approximately one-half of the \namount that we reduced manpower. There is infrastructure that is \nexcessive, and we are looking at a very difficult decision, in terms of \nhow to go ahead and continue to advance the process of closing bases, \nof scaling back infrastructure, because every dollar spent on a \nfacility or a support function that does not go to support our forces \ntakes resources away from more pressing needs. To simply preserve \nexcess infrastructure because it happens to be in a particular State or \nparticular Member's district, or to preserve it because we were not \nable to come to a conclusion about closing it results in dollars \nstaying in infrastructure that take away dollars from the very badly \nneeded modernization of our forces, from research and technology, and \nfrom support for our active duty forces in terms of their readiness and \ndeployment, et cetera.\n\n  So we have to recognize that the decisions that will be made here, \nwhether it is streamlining the Department of Defense, whether it is \nconsolidating or streamlining various defense and support agencies, \nwhich is recommended here--I wish the QDR provided recommendations in \nmore detail, but it is recommended here nonetheless--whether it is \nclosing bases, and even decisions on modernization will be made in this \nChamber, will be made by these Members, and they will not be easy \ndecisions.\n  We all recognize, I think, that one of the most important actions we \ncan take, as this report says, is make decisions about modernizing our \nforces and investing in research and development of new technology. \nWhether this relates to platforms like tactical air for the Air Force \nand the Navy, ships for the Navy, land forces for the Army and Marines, \nor new technology to advance the way they do their business, all of \nthat requires resources. And all of that will have to be done with \noffsets, because we pretty much have a static budget line. Without an \nexternal threat that we can foresee right now and without a major \nconflict, we are going to be at a pretty level funding appropriation \nfor the next several years. If that is the case, then, if we want to \nretain the forces readiness, if we want to retain our current forces \ncapability to deal with the threats as we see them, and if we want to \nrestructure and modernize the force, we are going to have to provide \nthem with the resources, and the only place we can get the resources is \nfrom existing expenditures.\n  This report takes us some of the way down that road. I am a little \ndisappointed in the QDR in that it did not more specifically outline \nhow we can go about particularly restructuring the base closing \nprocedure, how we can restructure some of the defense or support \nagencies, how we can restructure the Reserve and the National Guard to \nbetter complement our active duty; but also to define, in some sense, \ndifferent roles for them in that process, how we could go forward in \nmaking the decisions on modernization, what the different options are, \nand so forth.\n  I think there are several questions that Congress is going to have to \naddress. I just mentioned modernization. Commitment to modernization, \nyes, but where do we put that money? What research? What new \ntechnologies? What new military platforms--ships, planes, et cetera--\nshould we select? And how many of those should we buy?\n  These are critical decisions. It is not enough just to say we need to \nincrease our modernization budget. It is where we put those dollars \nthat will be critical to define the military of the future, and how we \naddress these questions about the role of the Guard and Reserve and the \nreductions in defense infrastructure, which I mentioned earlier. I am \ndisappointed we did not address the medical care issue in the QDR. \nClearly, how we provide medical care for our active duty servicemembers \nand their family members, Reserve forces and others such is a major \ncost item in the defense budget. That needs to be addressed in the \nfuture.\n  Missile defense, how we allocate funds to missile defense, the \nSecretary says we have a shortfall in research and development funds \nfor a National Missile Defense System and we need to shift a \nsubstantial amount of money, up to $2 billion, into that particular \naccount--where does that money come from? That is not identified.\n  These are all issues which the Congress is going to have to grapple \nwith in the next several months. Beyond that, we need to ensure that, \nin our thinking, we realize this is the beginning and not the end of \nthe process. We need to look to outside sources like the National \nDefense Panel to give us guidance in terms of what the proper questions \nare: How we look at the scenarios in the future that will require a \ndefense structure to address those challenges; how we devise the right \nkind of strategy to meet the threats; how we build in the flexibility--\nbecause we do not know what all those threats are going to be--how we \nbuild in the flexibility to have our forces able to adapt to those \nthreats of the future; how we avoid making critical mistakes in \nresource allocation that prohibit us from having that flexibility in \nthe future; how we go about implementing all of this and how we come up \nwith the resources to address it.\n  So there are many, many questions still outstanding. It is an ongoing \nprocess. I look forward to working with my colleague, Senator Lieberman \nof Connecticut, as we explore this, as well as my other colleagues, \nboth on the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House Armed \nServices Committee, as well as our colleagues here in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend and colleague and, on matters of \ndefense, my partner, Senator Coats from Indiana.\n  Mr. President, I want to add a few words to those spoken by my \ncolleague about the Quadrennial Defense Review, which was released by \nSecretary of Defense Cohen earlier today. It has been my pleasure to \nwork with the Senator from Indiana, as well as with our colleagues on \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator McCain, Senator Robb, \nSenator Kempthorne, Senator Levin, and many others in a bipartisan \neffort that led to legislation requiring the Quadrennial Defense Review \nand the National Defense Panel.\n  Our intent in sponsoring this legislation, was to drive the defense \ndebate to a strategy-based assessment of our future military \nrequirements and capabilities, not to do a budget-driven incremental \nmassage of the status quo.\n  We were motivated by two factors in calling for this over-the-horizon \nreview of our defense needs. First, we did not want this to be just \nanother annual report on what our defense needs are. Second, we wanted \nto force the Pentagon to look beyond the short range and to understand \nthat many of us inside and outside of Congress believe that the \ndecisions we are making today will affect our ability to protect our \nnational security 10 to 20 years out.\n  From my first review of the Quadrennial Defense Review I would say \nwhile the report issued today does not live up to the high expectations \nI had for it, it is a step forward in the process that Senator Coats \nhas just described. If we want to make defense decisions effectively, \nwe have to consider two dramatic changes that have occurred in our \nworld, which are influencing our defense needs. One is the dramatic and \nongoing change in the post-cold-war world; second is the extraordinary \nchange in technology, the transition we have made from an industrial \nage to an information age, which inevitably will affect the way wars \nare fought.\n  Even before it was released, the Quadrennial Defense Review achieved, \nI think, an important part of our goal by catalyzing a broad and \nvigorous debate within the Pentagon which engaged more people who \nconsidered more options than either of the previous two post-cold-war \nsecurity assessments done in the Bush administration and then in the \nfirst year of the Clinton administration. The reviewing process began, \nalso, to stimulate similar debate outside of the Pentagon and outside \nof Congress. I believe that all those involved in the Pentagon effort\n\n[[Page S4674]]\n\nhave done well by debating the controversial questions and in making \nrecommendations they believed were essential, even though some of those \ndid not, in my opinion, go far enough and were not bold enough, and \neven though some of them are recommendations that will be controversial \nhere in Congress.\n  I want to particularly draw attention to significant steps forward \nthat are made in the QDR in three critical areas.\n  First, I believe the QDR has developed a much more comprehensive view \nof our strategic future military environment than we had from the two \nprevious studies; that is, the way in which the national security \nenvironment, will be affected by unconventional threats to our \nsecurity, including, of course, terrorism and chemical and biological \nwarfare, but also including the capacity of an enemy to strike at us in \nwhat the military calls an asymmetrical way, that is, to find our \nvulnerability, invest much less than we spend on our military, and then \nto strike at that vulnerability.\n  Second, I think the QDR has taken some significant steps forward in \nbeginning to deal with management improvements within the Pentagon and \nin confronting the need for some reductions in manpower and some \nreductions in acquisition of high-visibility procurement programs and \nin recommending, as Senator Coats has indicated, two additional rounds \nof BRAC, of the base closure process. To put it mildly, that will not \nbe popular on Capitol Hill. And, yet, the more you look at the \nreductions that have already occurred in the size of our military \nforces and the extent to which we have reduced tooth but not reduced \ntail, it is hard to conclude that, in the interest of our national \nsecurity, we do not need to further reduce military infrastructure.\n\n  Third, although I would criticize the QDR for being more budget \ndriven than strategy driven, the Pentagon has presented some \nconclusions about reducing forces that they assume can help bring the \ndefense program more closely and realistically in line with the fiscal \nassumptions that they are operating under.\n  Nevertheless, why do I say the report, as I looked at it this \nafternoon, does not live up to my own hopes for it? I find it to be too \nmuch of a status-quo document. While it is true we have reduced \npersonnel and force structure significantly since the close of the cold \nwar, the shape and focus of our military remains substantially what it \nwas then. This report represents, as others have said, essentially a \n``salami-slicing'' approach. It is not a dramatic change, nor does it \nseem to point to future dramatic changes to deal with increased \nworkload for our military forces to respond to the much more \ncomplicated geopolitical situation nor to changes in technology, which \nhave created a revolution in military affairs.\n  Mr. President, as I said a moment ago, the report was more budget \ndriven than strategy driven. Perhaps that is understandable for the \nPentagon has to live within the constraints we impose, but I must say, \nSenator Coats and I and the others did not introduce legislation which \ncalled for this Quadrennial Defense Review as a way to cut the defense \nbudget. That might be a result, but a future-oriented review might just \nas logically lead to an increase in the defense budget, depending on \nwhat a strategic review of the world determines that our future defense \nneeds will be. In fact, as you look at the more comprehensive strategic \nreview of the future of the military environment that is in this QDR, \nit argues for additional capacity to that which the report continues to \nadvocate: Which is the capacity to meet two major regional threats, a \nseries of additional requirements, including terrorism, chemical and \nbiological warfare, missile defense, and peacekeeping. Yet, I don't see \nthe connection between what I think is the more accurately described \ncomplicated strategic future we have and the programs the report \nadvocates to meet that future.\n  The report is not strategy driven. It continues to require that the \nmilitary be structured to deal with two major regional conflicts but \nits assessment of the strategic environment raises questions about \nwhether that is an appropriate standard, particularly since one of \nthose conflicts presumably would be on the Korean Peninsula against \nNorth Korea, a state that many question will constitute a threat to \nsecurity very much longer. So, as we look 10 to 20 years out, will our \nmajor threat in Asia be on the Korean Peninsula, or will it come from \nanother great power or midsize power that has gained nuclear capability \nand can disrupt the entire region?\n  The report makes no recommendations for change to the organization of \nthe current force and only minor changes to the size of that force. As \nI have indicated, some weapons-purchasing programs were reduced, but no \nmajor programs have been canceled. Perhaps even more important, from my \nown point of view, as we look forward, no new programs were recommended \nto deal with the extraordinary range of threats and responsibilities \nthat are described in the strategic review part of the report. The \nexplosion in technology could literally and totally change the way \nenemies will fight us and what weapons they will employ, while at the \nsame time creating enormous opportunities for us, if we wisely and \nboldly use technology, to fundamentally improve our military capability \nto defend our interests perhaps in a much more cost-effective way.\n  I also was disappointed that the report did not deal with the further \nimplementation of the Goldwater-Nichols legislation, which I think most \nobservers would say has not fully achieved its goals for more \njointness. The fact is, too much of what happens in the Pentagon and \nour military still happens in the stovepipes of the four services. We \ndo not see enough cooperation across service lines--joint training, for \ninstance--to either achieve the dollar savings or the increases in \nfighting effectiveness that many observers think will come from \nincreased jointness.\n\n  Mr. President, a final word. There is a brief reference to space and \nthe role space may play in future warfare. Remember, we are talking \nabout 10 to 20 years from now. It is hard to imagine as we see the \nworld depend more and more on space-based satellites that our future \nenemies will not rely on a wide range of space-based capabilities to \nfight us. It seems to me this suggests a very, very urgent need for us \nto consider the implications of that for our future military \npreparedness, including very controversial questions, which I think we \nhave to consider in the responsible exercise of our duties, whether we \nshould proceed with what might be called the weaponization of space, \nand what we should do to develop capacity to defend against attacks on \nus from space.\n  In summary, I feel strongly that we need to act more boldly and \nbroadly now. We need to stop doing business as usual now so we can \nbetter respond to the challenges of the future, and that goes not just \nfor those in the Pentagon, but also for those of us in Congress, \nbecause the decisions that we are making today will commit enormous \nnational resources and determine the military forces we will have for \ndecades.\n  The fact is that the extraordinary victory we achieved in the gulf \nwar was the result not only of the extraordinary military leadership we \nhad and the extraordinary bravery and skill of our troops on the \nground, in the air, on the water, but it also was the result of \ndecisions and investments made in the seventies in military technology \nthat came online and were available to be used in the early 1990's in \nthe gulf war.\n  We have to think, as we make the decisions we do committing hundreds \nof billions of dollars to defense programs, whether these are the \nprograms we will need 10 and 20 years from now. The fact is, if we \nchoose unwisely and a future opponent chooses more wisely, we may well \nbe jeopardizing not only the lives of our soldiers, but also the lives \nof our children and our grandchildren. When we discover that, we will \nhave precious little time and perhaps not the resources to fix our \nmistakes.\n  So in those ways, I find the QDR to be lacking, but Senator Coats and \nour cosponsors anticipated this and believed it would be the first step \nin a dynamic process. I hope that is the way in which the QDR, will be \nseen--as a first step, an important one--in a series of steps to \ndetermine what our future military needs will be. It does, in fact, \nprovide a sound base from which this critical discussion can proceed.\n  I think Secretary Cohen himself has recognized this is only the \nbeginning--\n\n[[Page S4675]]\n\nit is the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end--not only \nin what he specifically said, but in the fact that last week he \nannounced the appointment of a task force which will now go the next \nstep, particularly in considering reform of the Office of the Secretary \nof Defense.\n  We all have high hopes for the independent National Defense Panel, \nthat was created as part of our legislation, to go further and create \nclear alternatives and to begin to identify the critical unanswered \nquestions that we are left with after reading the QDR. Then, as Senator \nCoats has said, it will be up to those of us in Congress and to those \nin the White House and the administration to absorb the recommendations \nof the QDR we received today; then of the National Defense Panel which \nwill be presented to us in December; and then to push boldly against \nthe status quo.\n  Our responsibility may require us to make difficult decisions about \nthe weapons we buy and where our forces will be based and how they will \nbe structured so that tomorrow's American military will be ready to \nmeet the security threats of the next century in the most cost-\neffective and technologically dominant way.\n  The point is this: Some people will say, ``QDR says it all, we're \ndoing well, our security is clear. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' \nOf course, we agree our security is strong today and it ain't broke \ntoday, but if we don't fix it, it will be broke 10 or 20 years from \nnow, and we will not have fulfilled the fullest measure of our \nresponsibility under the Constitution to provide for and protect the \ncommon defense.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. COATS. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I certainly agree with my colleague--we \nworked on this together--that this QDR report doesn't meet all of our \nexpectations. We wanted a more visionary document. We wanted some \nbolder challenges, at least a broader definition of what the future \nmight look like and what options we would have to address it, because \nthe point is that we are at such a critical decisionmaking point, in \nterms of allocation of resources, that we need that look into the \nfuture in order to try to make the decisions that will give us the \nflexibility and the resources to address those future threats.\n  The real concern here is that we stay locked into, not necessarily a \nstatus quo proposal, but one that closely resembles the current state \nof affairs within the military, and that we will, on that basis, make \ndecisions that will preclude us from having the resources to make \ndifferent decisions in the future or to address different threats in \nthe future. That, again, is the reason why we wanted a national defense \npanel, outside evaluators and experts, to give us some guidance on \nthat.\n  While that Panel's report will not be available to support us in this \nyear's decisionmaking process for the fiscal 1998 budget, it will be \navailable for us next year. So I hope we can keep that in mind when we \nare allocating these resources and making these decisions.\n  Second, I say to my friend from Connecticut that, while many of our \ncolleagues, and many individuals, will criticize this QDR as a status \nquo document, my guess is it will be extraordinarily difficult to \nconvince them that they ought to adopt even half of the proposals of \nthis status quo document because it will affect bases that are located \nin their State, it will affect defense contractors that manufacture \ndefense products in their State, and so on.\n  Each of us has our favorite service, I suppose, perhaps one we served \nin. We try to be objective in that, but, you know: ``I was a marine, \nand therefore, we're not taking one person away from the Marines,'' or, \n``I served in the Navy, and we can't take ships down.'' ``They build \nships in my district; therefore, I can't support any changes in \nshipbuilding.'' And on and on and on it goes. We have that fight every \nyear.\n  So my guess is that, if we can implement half of what is here, it \nwould be a pretty extraordinary step for Congress.\n  Now, what is the point? The point is that we cannot just always blame \nthe Department of Defense for not being bold enough, challenging \nenough, visionary enough when we ourselves are not willing to take some \nof those steps. So it is going to require several things: one, some \ngood outside evaluation and expert help for us to even ask the right \nquestions in order to arrive at the right decisions; and, second, some \nbold initiatives and some courage on our part in order to enact and \neffect some of these decisions.\n  The Senator from Connecticut talked about a different kind of threat, \ndriven by technology, that we are just now beginning to understand. We \nprobably are not looking at the massed formation type of standoff, a \nmass army versus mass army threat that we have looked at in the past. \nWe are looking at technology which can give our adversaries advantages \nthat perhaps we have not even thought of and capability we have not \neven thought of; but yet also offer us great promise in terms of \ndefense capabilities to counter those threats if we can anticipate them \ncoming our way in the future.\n  So there is a lot of work to do. I guess the caution here is that we \nallow ourselves to get outside the normal pattern of how we make \ndecisions and how we appropriate funds for defense, to think beyond the \nnext election cycle, to think into the next century, to be willing to \ntake bold steps in either saying no or in saying yes to decisions that \nwill have tremendous future implications for this Nation.\n  What does that mean? That means that we have to have an open mind, we \nhave to see this as a process and not as a fixed point for which \ndecisions made today will necessarily be those decisions which will be \nimplemented tomorrow. We have to retain that flexibility as we \nunderstand how to develop a national defense strategy for the future.\n  It has been said that no major changes in military affairs in history \nhave ever occurred except after a crushing defeat. We had a stunning \nvictory in Operation Desert Storm. I think a lot of that was \naccomplished because of the lessons we learned in Vietnam, the changes \nthat were consequently made. Yet, for us now to rest on that success \nand pretty much indicate that we are not willing to make major changes \nwould condemn us to the lessons of history; we cannot simply strengthen \nand retain the capabilities of our last success, but we must fully \nunderstand and prepare for the potential of our next war. We want to \navoid preparing for the past.\n  That is going to take some bold thinking. That is going to take some \nstepping outside the box to take some challenging questions about \ncurrent assumptions and the current status quo as we look out in the \nfuture. I think we have started that process.\n  I want to commend my friend from Connecticut for all the effort that \nhe has put into this and our other colleagues who have been involved in \nsetting up our National Defense Panel and working with the Department \nof Defense, working with the new Secretary, who I think is committed \nand pledged to do this very thing.\n\n  I thank the Senator for his time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Indiana for his comments, which \nI agree with totally.\n  Part of what we are saying--I echo him--is the world is changing so \ndramatically that we must make sure that our national security \nstructure changes as well. There is not a company doing business in \nAmerica today the way it did 5 or 10 years ago, let alone 30, 40, or 50 \nyears ago. What strikes me as so stunning is that the companies that \nare doing best today are looking ahead 3, 4, 5, 10 years forward to \nfigure out how they are going to need to change to make sure they are \nstill on top. There are limits to that comparison, but that is what we \nare trying to do with our national security structure.\n  We are, in a sense, being the burrs under the saddle here because we \nare riding tall in the saddle right now as a country. We are very \nstrong. But history tells us that unless you look forward and change \nwith the times, particularly to begin to absorb the full measure of \ntechnological change in your military plans, then you are not going to \nbe riding securely for very long.\n  Just to echo a final point, a very important one, when we drafted \nthis legislation, Senators Coats, McCain, Robb, Kempthorne, Levin, and \nothers,\n\n[[Page S4676]]\n\nand I had in mind that it was not just the Pentagon--as big and \nbureaucratic, although very effective, an institution as it is--that \nneeded an outside push; it was Congress, it was us because we are as \nprone to ride along with the successful status quo and not take the \npainful looks out over the horizon, particularly if they affect us, as \nsome of these changes may.\n  So this is the first step. It is an ongoing process. I feel even more \nstrongly that legislation was correct in calling for an independent \npanel, a national defense panel. And ultimately it will be up to the \nArmed Services Committees, the Appropriations Committees, and all the \nMembers of both Houses to have the guts to make the tough decisions \ntoday that will guarantee that America is strong and secure tomorrow \nand a lot of tomorrows forward into the 21st century.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/19/senate-section/article/S4672-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/19/senate-section/article/S4676-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/19/senate-section/article/S4676-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:01 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1385.

A bill to amend the Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 to require a \nlocal educational agency that receives funds under the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965 to expel a student determined to be in \npossession of an illegal drug, or illegal drug paraphernalia, on school \nproperty, in addition to expelling a student determined to be in \npossession of a gun; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                         EDUCATION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have just presented a bill to the clerk, \nS. 763, the goal of which is to strike a decisive blow in the war \nagainst drugs by protecting America's schoolchildren from the scourge \nof drugs in their classrooms.\n  Before anyone says, ``Here we go again,'' I counsel all to consider \nthe differences between this bill and anything which was enacted \nbefore.\n  Incidentally, I am honored to be joined in the sponsorship of this \nmeasure by several distinguished Senators--Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Ashcroft, \nMr. Grassley, and Mr. Sessions.\n  Specifically, this legislation will require each school accepting \nFederal education funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct of 1965 to adopt a zero tolerance policy regarding illegal drugs \nand illegal drug paraphernalia in schools. Zero tolerance means what it \nsounds like. It requires the expulsion, for not less than 1 year, of \nany student who possesses this contraband at school. This will send a \nclear message to students, parents, and teachers: Drugs and schools do \nnot mix.\n  Illegal drug use is, in my judgment, the most insidious and \ndestructive influence in our country today. Its cost to society, in \nterms of crime and wasted lives, is enormous. Just think of the \ninnocent babies born already addicted\n\n[[Page S4678]]\n\nto drugs; think of the families destroyed because fathers, mothers, or \nchildren care more about where they will get their next fix than they \ndo their loved ones; think of the neighborhoods that have been \ndevastated by swaggering drug dealers peddling poison. These terrible \nthings are going on right in the shadow of this Capitol in which the \nU.S. Senate operates.\n  Mr. President, Americans have heard these tragic stories so often \nthat some citizens have questioned the wisdom of waging war against \ndrugs. Last fall, California and Arizona voters took the unprecedented \nstep of legalizing the so-called medicinal use of drugs, such as \nmarijuana, heroin, and LSD, and in an outrageous decision reported \nrecently, a Federal judge in San Francisco, Judge Fern Smith, ruled \nthat the Federal Government cannot impose sanctions on doctors who \nrecommend marijuana to their patients, despite the fact that such use \nremains illegal under Federal law.\n  Is it not time to say enough is enough? Is it not time to go all out \nin the drug war? Mr. President, the answers to these questions are \nobvious: It is time and we must do it. It is time to take every \npossible step to reverse this retreat from responsibility, and \neliminating drugs from America's classrooms is the imperative, \ninescapable first step.\n  Anybody wondering if this bill is needed should take a look at the \nresults of the latest ``Monitoring the Future'' [MTF] study of drug use \namong America's 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-graders and ``The National \nHousehold Survey on Drug Abuse'' study which measures drug use among \nthe general population. Both studies dramatically confirm what many of \nus have known: We have lost ground in the war against drugs over the \npast 4 years. Most disturbing is the shocking increase in illicit drug \nuse by our school-age children.\n  The findings in the ``Monitoring the Future'' study are eye-opening: \n50 percent of 12th-graders have used illicit drugs during their \nlifetime; about 25 percent have used drugs during the past 30 days; \nalmost one-third of 8th-graders have used illegal drugs during their \nlifetime; with about 15 percent of 8th-graders using it in the last 30 \ndays. Marijuana use among 8th- and 10th-graders almost tripled from \n1992 to 1996, while 5 percent of 12th-grade marijuana users are daily \nusers.\n  But perhaps the most distressing finding is that the youngest \nstudents surveyed, our 8th-graders, report the highest rate of heroin \nuse. Moreover, the percentage of actual drug use may be even greater \nthan reported, because the MTF does not survey school dropouts. \nInstead, it relies solely on student self-reporting.\n  Similarly, ``The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse'' found \nstartling increases in drug use among teenagers over the last 4 years. \nFor example, the survey found that teen cocaine use increased 166 \npercent in 1 year, 1994-95; teen use of LSD and other hallucinogens \nskyrocketed 183 percent from 1992 to 1995; and the use of marijuana \namong teenagers soared 141 percent over the same period.\n  So, Mr. President, it is no coincidence that drug use among our \nchildren has skyrocketed. Drug dealers deliberately target our young \npeople to be both consumers and distributors of illicit drugs because \nour children are our most precious and vulnerable resource. As a \nresult, students report that drugs are now the No. 1 problem they face, \nfar outdistancing any other concern. That, by the way, was the finding \nof a recent survey conducted by the Center on Addiction and Substance \nAbuse at Columbia University. And what an alarming conclusion it was, \nthat it is our students who are on the front lines of the war against \ndrugs.\n  Today, students of all ages have immediate access to a wide variety \nof drugs that are cheaper and more powerful than those of the past. \nAccording to the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, 69 percent of \n17-year-olds report going to schools where students keep, use, and sell \ndrugs. Here in the Nation's Capital authorities have closed unsafe \nschools for fire code violations, yet thousands of children still \nattend drug-infested schools. Billions of dollars spent on schools will \naccomplish little, Mr. President, if we do not first ensure that our \nchildren are safe there.\n  The relationship between violence and drug use is clear. The most \nrecent national Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education [PRIDE] \nsurvey found that students who carried guns to school were 20 times \nmore likely to use cocaine than those who did not bring a gun to \nschool. Gang members were 12 times more likely to use cocaine, and \nstudents who threaten others were 6 times more likely to be coke users.\n  The findings of a recent Department of Education report prepared by \nthe Research Triangle Institute, in my home State of North Carolina, \nconfirmed the findings of the PRIDE study. The Research Triangle \nInstitute, found--and I quote--``[t]he use of drugs was related to \nviolent behavior in schools. A much larger percentage of current users \nof alcohol and/or other drugs (32 percent of them) reported being \ninvolved in school fights as the aggressors than did current nonusers \n(14 percent of those students) or students who had never tried drugs (6 \npercent).''\n  Mr. President, that report went on to say that 37 percent of the \nstudents reported that they are afraid of attacks at school while 29 \npercent said they feared attacks when traveling to and from school. \nAnd, sadly, we must acknowledge that those fears are too often \njustifiable.\n  According to the North Carolina Center for the Prevention of School \nViolence, over 8,100 incidents of school violence were reported in \nNorth Carolina during the last full school year. Possession of a \ncontrolled substance, possession of a weapon other than a firearm, and \nassault on a school employee together accounted for 85 percent of those \nincidents. That study concluded: ``[t]he high number of reported weapon \npossessions may be reflective of student concern for their own safety, \neven in schools, since the most often cited reason for carrying weapons \n* * * is `protection'.''\n  Parents and Government have a duty to do everything we can to protect \nchildren from the ravages of illegal drugs and the crimes spawned by \nthe drug trade. Up until now--I think we ought to be frank with each \nother and acknowledge that we have failed miserably. It is not enough \nto prohibit students from taking guns to school if we do not address \nthe reasons why they do so.\n  Mr. President, Congress addressed the issue of school violence in \n1994 with the passage of the Gun-Free Schools Act, which required \nStates to adopt a law mandating the expulsion of any student who brings \na gun to school.\n  During debate on that bill, it was argued that we should state, as a \nmatter of policy, that children should not bring guns to school. In my \nopinion, the Senate should also state, as a matter of policy, that \ndrugs have no place in school. That is why I am offering today S. 763, \na bill which I believe to be a logical and commonsense extension of the \n1994 law.\n\n  Like that act, the bill sponsored by myself and several other \nSenators conditions the receipt of Federal education dollars, that is \nto say, Federal funds, on a State's adoption of a policy requiring the \nexpulsion, for not less than one year, of any student who brings \nillegal drugs to school. Now, like the Gun-Free Schools Act, this bill \ndoes not create a new criminal offense, but it does require schools to \nrefer violators to proper law enforcement authorities.\n  Both the 1994 act and the bill I am introducing today are flexible. \nEach bill allows the chief administrative officer of a school district \nto grant an exemption on a case-by-case basis, and permits, but does \nnot require, school districts to establish alternative education \nfacilities for violators.\n  So I think the policy is firm, yet fair. The drug trade and the \nviolence associated with it have no place in America's classrooms. \nSchools should provide an environment that is conducive to learning and \nsupportive of the vast majority of students who are in school to learn. \nChildren and teachers alike deserve a school free of the fear and \nviolence caused by drugs.\n  Mr. President, on the issue of drugs, many speeches have been made \nciting respected authorities and a lot of impressive statistics as I \nhave done today. However, nothing any Senator has said on this floor \nspeaks quite as eloquently of our responsibilities as the statement of \none of the students\n\n[[Page S4679]]\n\ninvolved in the Research Triangle Institute study who said--and get \nthis, I say to the Chair and other Senators--this student said, ``I \ndon't like how dangerous it is at this school. I just wish the teachers \nand the rest of the school staff would have better control over their \nstudents and keep kids like me safe.''\n  Isn't it time for us to give the teachers and school administrators \nthe support they need to remove violence and drug offenders from our \nschools? I think the answer to that is obvious.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, the removal of drugs and violence from our \nschools surely are goals that everybody agrees with. The President, \nduring his State of the Union Address, said that ``we must continue to \npromote order and discipline'' in America's schools by, as he put it, \n``remov[ing] disruptive students from the classroom, and hav[ing] zero \ntolerance for guns and drugs in school.''\n  Obviously, I think the President was right on that one. I do not \nalways agree with him, but you can't get any clearer than that. I \ncommend him for that statement, and I hope he will support this effort \nby several of us who are concerned about the safety of our youngsters. \nI believe that working together, we can eliminate illegal drugs and \nillegal drug paraphernalia from America's classrooms.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the complete text of the \naforementioned bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 763\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I urge my fellow Members of the Senate \nto support the legislation being introduced today by my distinguished \ncolleague from North Carolina, Senator Helms--the Safe Schools Act of \n1997.\n  Urgent calls for more and more Federal money for schools to pay for \neverything from school construction to Internet access are misplaced. I \nwould argue they are misplaced in any case, because decisions about how \na school district should allocate its resources are better left at the \nlocal and State level. But they are certainly misplaced without a \nprimary commitment to reducing school violence.\n  Students cannot learn effectively unless they feel safe. It was hard \nenough to learn in the days when I was in school with the normal \ndistractions--the occasional spitball or gum-smacking student. Now some \nstudents worry about whether they will even survive to graduate from \nhigh school.\n  My colleagues have noted the results of several studies which confirm \nthe very strong correlation between school violence and illegal drug \nuse. And we already know the cost illegal drugs have exacted in terms \nof ruined lives and the breakdown of families. Yet in the past year we \nhave seen two States, California and Arizona, pass laws to legalize the \nso-called medicinal use of drugs like marijuana, heroin, and LSD. That \nis why I introduced the Drug Use Prevention Act to impose strict \npenalties on doctors who prescribe marijuana. As my colleague has \nnoted, a San Francisco Federal judge has recently overruled such \npenalties. But that particular debate is far from over yet.\n  Many Americans have concluded that the ground lost in recent years in \nthe war on drugs is not recoverable, that the war is lost. I disagree. \nToo much is at stake to simply surrender the fight, especially when it \ncomes to providing a safe environment for students in public schools. \nAt the very least, schools should not receive Federal funds unless they \nrefuse to tolerate the presence of drugs as well as firearms on school \nproperty.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Santorum and Mr. Lautenberg):\n\n\n[[Page S4680]]\n\n\n  S. 764. A bill to reauthorize the mass transit programs of the \nFederal Government; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                THE MASS TRANSIT AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation that would reauthorize and expand upon existing Federal \nmass transit programs. My legislation, the Mass Transit Amendments Act \nof 1997, is intended to lay the groundwork for the Senate's \nconsideration of mass transit legislation in the context of \nreauthorizing the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \n[ISTEA]. Substantial increases in Federal spending on mass transit are \nwarranted, notwithstanding current budget constraints, because a \ngreater commitment to public transportation is in the national \ninterest. I would note, however, that this legislation is an \nauthorization bill which does not increase the deficit; funds \nauthorized to be spent out of the mass transit account of the highway \ntrust fund would still be subject to the annual appropriations process, \nwhich is subject to the discretionary spending caps set in the budget \nresolution and the 602(b) allocation process.\n  Transit should not be viewed as a partisan issue or a regional issue. \nThis bill recognizes the valuable role transit plays in reducing our \nenergy dependence, protecting our environment, reducing gridlock, and \nproviding access to jobs, schools, and health care facilities for \nmillions of Americans in urban and rural areas throughout the Nation. \nIn particular, I urge my colleagues to review my proposed reverse \ncommute pilot program, which would authorize $250 million annually in \nnew grants targeted at improving access to employment for residents in \neconomically distressed urban areas and rural communities.\n  This bill is intended to encourage the Banking Committee, led by \nChairman Alfonse D'Amato and Senator Paul Sarbanes, to report to the \nSenate legislation which will preserve much of the ISTEA transit \nprogram but at increased funding levels which reflect the importance of \nmass transit to our economy, quality of life, and environment. I look \nforward to working with Senator D'Amato, Senator Sarbanes, and others \non the Banking Committee and Appropriations Committee who want to \nimprove the Nation's transit systems through the ISTEA reauthorization \nprocess.\n  This legislation takes into account the transit industry consensus \nproposal put forth by the American Public Transit Association (APTA), \nwhich represents transit systems, large and small, in all 50 States. I \nam pleased to note that APTA's new president is Bill Millar, whom I had \nthe pleasure of working with for a number of years when he was the \nexecutive director of the Port Authority of Allegheny County.\n\n  In preparation for the ISTEA reauthorization process and the annual \nappropriations process, I have met with many individuals in an effort \nto learn more about the needs of transit systems, the towns and cities \nin which they operate, and the riders they are trying to serve. In \nrecent months, I have discussed strategies to increase transit funding \nwith Gov. Tom Ridge, Senator Rick Santorum, and Chairman Bud Shuster. \nIn addition, I have visited with Jack Leary, the general manager of the \nSoutheastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), Mayor Tom \nMcGroarty of Wilkes-Barre, and representatives of the Pennsylvania \nPublic Transportation Association. I have also met with transit system \nofficials during my regular visits to Pennsylvania's 67 counties.\n  I am particularly pleased to be introducing this bill with my \ndistinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, Rick Santorum, who has \njoined with me regularly to increase support for public transportation, \nsuch as when we unsuccessfully offered an amendment to the fiscal year \n1996 Transportation appropriations bill to restore $40 million in \nFederal operating assistance. Both Senator Santorum and Gov. Tom Ridge \nrecognize the vital role mass transit plays in Pennsylvania and have \nworked with me to maximize the Federal resources available to urban and \nrural transit systems in our State.\n  I am also pleased that Senator Frank Lautenberg has joined in this \nbipartisan effort. For two years, Senator Lautenberg has joined me in \nco-chairing an informal Senate transit coalition, which has served as \nan information clearinghouse for Senate transit supporters and their \nstaffs and which will play an even greater role, I hope, during the \nreauthorization process.\n  For some time, I have addressed an ongoing threat to our Nation's \nsecurity and prosperity, a threat with dual roots--in the precarious \nMiddle East and right here at home. As I stated in a speech on the \nSenate floor on January 30, 1997, I am very concerned by our nation's \nincreased reliance on potentially unstable foreign sources of oil and \nbelieve it is critical that during the 105th Congress, we focus on \nincreasing energy conservation.\n\n  I have been troubled that United States imports of foreign oil \ncontinue to increase from the current 50-percent level, with 20 percent \nof our purchases coming from the Arab countries of the Organization of \nPetroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC]. According to the American \nPetroleum Institute, we import more than 9 million barrels per day, \nwith a 6-percent increase in 1996 alone. This is a huge jump from the 6 \nmillion barrels imported per day in 1973. Further, if these trends \ncontinue, analysts say in ten years we will look overseas for two-\nthirds of our energy needs.\n  In part because of the ready availability of less expensive sources \nof foreign oil, it has not been cost-effective for U.S. energy \ncompanies to increase domestic production. Further, the effectiveness \nof the strategic petroleum reserve has dwindled because it only holds \nan amount comparable to 75 days of foreign imports, a situation that \nwas not helped by the Clinton administration's decision last year to \nsell off approximately 25 million barrels of petroleum from the reserve \nto generate revenues.\n  The timing for selling our reserves was less than prudent, \nparticularly considering the state of affairs in the Middle East today. \nSaudi Arabia, in particular, poses unique cause for concern. If a \nhostile nation seized Saudi oil wells, the largest reserve in the \nworld, the American economy and world markets could tumble. The \ndeplorable June 25, 1996, terrorist attack at the Khobar Towers \nfacility in Dharhan, which resulted in the murders of 19 airmen and the \nwounding of more than 400 United States personnel, also gives cause for \nconcern because there is a strong possibility of links to internal \ndomestic struggles in Saudi Arabia. Pressure is mounting from \npolitically activist and conservative Islamic movements to undermine \nthe ruling monarchy, who are viewed by some to be too liberal and \nwestern. If American access to Persian Gulf oil cannot be guaranteed, \nthen the United States must reduce its dependence on foreign oil.\n\n  While reducing our dependence on foreign oil is a difficult task, we \ncan achieve meaningful reductions in energy consumption by promoting \nthe use of public transportation. On the significant link between \nenergy consumption and our transportation infrastructure, a Department \nof Transportation study of the 50 largest urban areas in the United \nStates suggests that nearly 4 billion gallons of gasoline a year are \nwasted due to traffic congestion--approximately 94 million barrels of \noil. There is much at stake, for the annual economic loss to businesses \nin the United States caused by traffic congestion is estimated at $40 \nbillion by the Federal Transit Administration.\n  Mass transit has developed to include traditional bus and subway \nlines, commuter rail, cable cars, monorails, water taxis, and several \nother modes of shared transportation. Public transportation is a \nlifeline for millions of Americans and deserves substantial funding for \nthat reason alone. However, it deserves even greater funding when one \nconsiders that public transportation saves 1.5 billion gallons of fuel \nconsumption annually in the United States and that each commuter who \nswitches from driving alone to using public transportation saves 200 \ngallons of gasoline per year, according to government and private \nstudies.\n  Transit also does much to protect our environment. For example, on \nMay 12, I visited the site of the proposed Frankford Intermodal Center \nin Philadelphia, which will be built on the site of the existing \nBridge-Pratt terminal. At present, the terminal serves 40,000 El \npassengers daily, translating into\n\n[[Page S4681]]\n\n17,600 fewer cars on the road each day and mitigating the release of \n16,500 pounds of pollutants into the city's air. The new facility is \nexpected to attract new ridership, taking more cars off the streets and \nreducing pollution even further. But, without increases in transit \ncapital assistance programs, projects such as the Frankford Center will \nbe difficult to get off the drawing boards.\n  There are ample other reasons to increase our commitment to transit \nfunding. In our States, citizens and communities depend on good public \ntransportation for mobility, access to jobs, environmental control, and \neconomic stability. Public transportation lets the elderly visit their \nhealth care providers, shops, or friends. In rural areas, buses are \nessential to reduce isolation and ensure economic development. Also, \nchildren use public transportation to go to school. Without affordable \nmass transit, people in America's inner cities can't get to work. Under \nthe welfare reform law enacted last year, there are expectations that \nmost individuals receiving welfare benefits will find gainful \nemployment. If they can't afford to get to work, or bus routes are cut, \nwe are just making it that much harder for them to get off welfare. It \nshould also be noted that millions of Americans have jobs in the \ntransit industry, operating and maintaining buses and subways, \nmanufacturing vehicles, and constructing new facilities.\n\n  I am troubled that some have proposed freezing Federal transit \nspending around $4.4 billion. Transit systems depend to a great degree \non Federal assistance in order to remain viable. A survey by my staff \nof 18 Pennsylvania transit operators shows that they receive an average \nof 26.7 percent of their total operating and capital funding from the \nFederal Transit Administration. In addition, SEPTA receives 15 percent \nof its overall funding from the Federal Government--55 percent of its \ncapital funds--and the Port Authority of Allegheny County receives 32.9 \npercent from FTA. Reductions in Federal operating and capital support \ncannot necessarily be made up by local sources. Further, if the systems \nmust cut routes, increase fares, and let their facilities fall into \ndisrepair, they will lose the critical mass of riders needed to sustain \noperation. The Department of Transportation has calculated that $13 \nbillion in annual transit capital spending is needed just to preserve \ncurrent conditions--$7 billion more than current capital expenditures--\ndemonstrating the great need to increase, rather than freeze, Federal \nsupport.\n  Responding to this need, my legislation includes several provisions \nto strengthen our transit systems and enable them to respond to our \nsociety's growing need for efficient and affordable public \ntransportation.\n  First, the bill reauthorizes transit programs for 5 years at a total \nof $34.4 billion through fiscal year 2002. For fiscal year 1997, total \ntransit appropriations are $4.3 billion. Under my bill, the fiscal year \n1998 authorization would be $6.5 billion and this figure would be \nadjusted up for inflation through fiscal year 2002. The authorization \nis based on calculations of available gasoline tax receipts in the mass \ntransit account of the highway trust fund, considering past surpluses \nand the additional revenue stream that would be created by diverting a \nportion of the 4.3 cent per gallon gas tax increase from 1993 into this \naccount. While the $6.5 billion figure may seem substantial to some, I \nwould note that Congress enacted in ISTEA in 1991 a $7.45 billion \nauthorization for fiscal year 1997 in recognition of the importance of \ninvesting in public transportation. We have been remiss in not meeting \nthe ISTEA authorization levels. We must do better under its successor \nlegislation.\n\n  Under my proposal, discretionary capital grants for new starts, rail \nmodernization, bus acquisitions, and bus facility construction would \nrise from the current $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion in fiscal year 1998. \nFormula capital grants would rise from current $2.2 billion to $3.5 \nbillion in fiscal year 1998, meaning more funds for urbanized areas, \nrural areas, and elderly and disabled program needs. My legislation \nalso preserves operating assistance within the formula program for all \nareas, unlike pending proposals to eliminate it in fiscal year 1998.\n  The bill's truth in taxation provision redistributes the 4.3 cent per \ngallon gasoline tax which is currently going to deficit reduction in \nthe following manner: 0.76 cents to the mass transit account of highway \ntrust fund, 0.5 cents to a new intercity passenger rail trust fund that \nwould serve as a dedicated source of revenue for Amtrak and is \nidentical to the legislation introduced by Senator Roth (S. 436), and \nthe remaining 3.04 cents to the highway trust fund. I have long argued \nthat gas tax receipts should be used for the transportation \ninfrastructure purposes for which the tax was enacted and that to do \notherwise is comparable to the crime of fraudulent conversion, which I \nused to prosecute as District Attorney in Philadelphia. When people pay \nFederal taxes at the gas station, they are under the impression that \ntheir funds will be used to improve highways and roads and other forms \nof transportation infrastructure. Accordingly, it is time to redirect \nthe 1993 gas tax increase to its traditional purposes.\n\n  As I noted earlier, a new proposal for a reverse commute pilot \nprogram is also included in my bill. In order to stimulate economic \ndevelopment and help individuals in both urban and rural areas obtain \nmeaningful employment and job training, the bill authorizes a new $250 \nmillion per year discretionary grant program for the Secretary of \nTransportation to provide funds to States, local governments, and \ntransit systems for pilot projects providing access to suburban jobs \nand job training to residents of distressed urban areas with a \npopulation of over 50,000 and for pilot projects involving access to \nemployment in rural areas as well. Funding uses could include, but are \nnot limited to, grants to employers to purchase/lease a van or bus \ndedicated to shuttling employees from inner cities to suburban \nworkplaces. Grants could also fund additional reverse commute bus \nroutes or commuter rail operations. Such grants are intended to serve \nas seed money that will generate self-sustaining commute options for \nyears to come. 954 distressed urban areas currently meet the definition \ncontained in the bill.\n  This program would not come at the expense of transit core formula \nand discretionary programs. The reverse commute pilot program would be \na separate program and as a member of the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee, given the importance of helping increase mobility for \nAmericans seeking good jobs, I would urge my colleagues to fund it \nabove and beyond the traditional formula and discretionary grant \nprograms, for which there is already a great need for funds.\n  My legislation also includes several technical program changes that \nwill benefit transit systems of all sizes. My bill would allow the use \nof capital grants for maintenance of capital assets, such as buses, \nsubways, which is currently not allowed. It would allow the smallest \nurban and rural transit systems complete flexibility between use of \ncapital and operating assistance for various needs. It would also allow \ntransit systems that sell capital assets--bought in part with Federal \nfunds--to keep the proceeds and reinvest in new capital assets, rather \nthan returning some small share of the proceeds to the Federal Transit \nAdministration. This is intended to stimulate acquisitions of new \nequipment and vehicles by such systems.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to consider supporting this \nauthorizing legislation, which would spend out funds accumlating in the \nmass transit account of the highway trust fund, subject to the \nappropriations process and not in a manner that increases the deficit. \nI hope that this bill will stimulate debate in the Senate on the need \nto increase our commitment to mass transit and I look forward to the \nopportunity to work with the Banking Committee and the Appropriations \nCommittee in the coming months.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a brief summary of \nthe bill and four letters in support of the Mass Transit Amendments Act \nof 1997 from Mr. William W. Millar, president of the American Public \nTransit Association, Mr. Armando V. Greco of the Lehigh and Northampton \nTransportation Authority, Mr. Paul Skoutelas, executive director of the \nPort Authority of Allegheny County, and Mr. Sonny Hall, international \npresident of the Transport Workers Union of America.\n\n[[Page S4682]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Summary of Mass Transit Amendments Act of 1997\n\n       1.

Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: On behalf of the American Public \n     Transit Association (APTA), I want to thank you for \n     introducing the Mass Transit Amendments Act of 1997, a bill \n     to reauthorize the federal transit program. APTA strongly \n     supports the Mass Transit Amendments Act of 1997. The bill \n     would build on the success of the Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) and increase investment \n     in the nation's transit infrastructure.\n       Adequate investment in the nation's transit infrastructure \n     is essential to a healthy economy; the movement of people, \n     services, and goods; access to health care, education, and \n     jobs. The Mass Transit Amendments Act would increase \n     investment in the federal transit program providing $34.4 \n     billion for transit program over five years.\n       Your proposal also recommends a number of substantial and \n     innovative changes to current law which we strongly support. \n     It permits a wide range of maintenance activities to be \n     funded with capital funds and grants small urbanized areas \n     the authority to use formula funding for capital or operating \n     expenses. The bill recommends the use of the 4.3 cents fuels \n     tax that now goes to deficit reduction for transportation \n     purposes, including intercity passenger rail and proposes a \n     number of changes aimed at making program delivery more \n     efficient. We are pleased to note that many of the provisions \n     of your bill are consistent with APTA's ISTEA reauthorization \n     proposal, which has been endorsed by our membership.\n       The Mass Transit Amendments Act will help us address the \n     nation's transit needs, and you can count on APTA's \n     membership to support this important legislation.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                William W. Millar,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Port Authority\n\n\n                                          of Allegheny County,\n\n                                     Pittsburgh, PA, May 19, 1997.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I am writing to express my strong \n     appreciation for your leadership in developing legislation to \n     reauthorize federal programs supporting public \n     transportation. The $6.5 billion annual funding level for \n     transit proposed in your legislation recognizes the need for \n     additional reinvestment and expansion in our public \n     transportation infrastructure. Your legislation also \n     recognizes the importance of continuing the strong federal-\n     state-local partnership that has been so successful in \n     funding public transportation.\n       Public transportation is a vital component of economic \n     development strategies in Allegheny County. The capital \n     investment programs outlined in your bill recognize this \n     important relationship. Providing access to jobs is another \n     area of fundamental importance to our economic systems. Your \n     legislation addresses this in your innovative welfare to work \n     program and in other policy initiatives. Still another \n     priority is the need for transit providers to have the \n     flexibility of using funds in accordance with the needs they \n     know best. Again, your legislation establishes this important \n     new direction in the federal program.\n       On a typical weekday over 250,000 riders use Port Authority \n     to travel to and from their jobs, to shop, to worship, to go \n     to school, or to pursue other social and professional needs. \n     Public transportation provides daily mobility to the millions \n     who use it for its convenience, cost savings, and to those \n     who have no alternative means of transportation.\n       We are grateful to you, your cosponsors Senator Santorum \n     and Senator Lautenberg, and your Senate colleagues who have \n     stepped forward as advocates for national transportation \n     policies fostering mobility and balanced transportation \n     alternatives. I look forward to working with you as this \n     legislation is considered in the coming months.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Paul P. Skoutelas,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Transport Workers Union of America,\n\n                                     New York, NY, April 21, 1997.\n     Hon Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I am writing to congratulate you on \n     the introduction of the Mass Transit Amendments Act of 1997. \n     The Transport Workers Union strongly supports this \n     legislation because it increases the money available for mass \n     transit and preserves crucial 13(c) protections for our \n     members. We also commend you for the provisions in the bill \n     which allow use of capital grants for maintenance of capital \n     assets--an idea the TWU has supported for many years.\n       The TWU is grateful that you have again stepped forward to \n     support mass transit and mass transit workers. We hope that \n     the progressive concepts in your legislation will be enacted \n     and we will do all we can to assist you in achieving that \n     result.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Sonny Hall,\n     International President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Lehigh and Northampton,\n\n\n                                     Transportation Authority,\n\n                                                    Allentown, PA.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: For the Lehigh and Northampton \n     Transportation Authority, I extend a thank you for the time \n     you afforded us during our recent visit to Washington. Your \n     continued support for Pennsylvania public transportation is \n     very much appreciated.\n       As part of the visit you shared with us the draft of the \n     Mass Transit Amendments Act of 1997 and requested comments. \n     Several items are listed below for your consideration, but I \n     must begin by noted our general concurrence and support for \n     the program changes and funding levels proposed. LANTA and \n     the PA transit industry is prepared to support your \n     legislative effort.\n       The items for change are as follows:\n       1. The reverse commute program should permit rural pilot \n     projects as well as urban.\n       2. The population threshold for distressed urban areas \n     should be set at 50,000.\n       Both of these changes are based on experiences LANTA has \n     encountered in the communities adjacent to the Lehigh Valley. \n     Access to employment is a problem found in all communities \n     without regard to size.\n       Again, thank you. We look forward to working with you as \n     ISTEA moves through the reauthorization process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Armando V.

Mr. President, today I rise to proudly acknowledge \nthe contribution that my home State of Minnesota made to the recently \ndedicated memorial to Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n  On May 2, 1997, over 6,000 people joined President Clinton beside the \ntidal basin midway between the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials to \ndedicate a memorial to our Nation's 32d President, Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt. As those present at the dedication walked among the granite \nwalls, waterfalls, and bronze sculptures, they were witnessing a piece \nof history which Minnesota's own Cold Spring Granite Co. helped make \npossible.\n  Minnesota's role in the Roosevelt Memorial began in 1975 when \ndesigner Lawrence Halprin chose Cold Spring Granite for the walls and \nfloor of the memorial. Located just south of the Granite City of St. \nCloud in central Minnesota, Cold Spring Granite Co. provided the more \nthan 6,000 tons of granite that adorns the memorial.\n  Started in 1898 by Henry N. Alexander, the Cold Spring Granite Co. \nhas grown into one of the world's largest granite quarrying and \nfabrication operations. Today the Cold Spring Granite Co. is headed by \nPatrick D. Alexander, the grandson of Henry Alexander, who oversees a \ncompany of over 1,400 employees with five fabrication facilities and 28 \nquarries located throughout North America.\n  Mr. President, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial is expected to \ndraw as many as 2 million visitors each year. I am pleased that those \nwho visit this site will see not only a memorial to one of our Nation's \nmost remembered Presidents, but also a testament to the hard work and \npatriotism of the men and women of Minnesota, particularly the \ndedicated employees of the Cold Spring Granite Co.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/19/senate-section/article/S4683-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4683-S4684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DEATH OF JEFFREY J. DYE\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise \nto observe the untimely death late last month of my former Senate staff \nmember, Jeffrey J. Dye, the young executive director of the Tennessee \nDemocratic Party, and the only son of Dennis and Janell Dye.\n  After serving less than 2 months in his new position, and reportedly \nmeeting every challenge that this difficult job had to offer, Jeff was \nstruck down in the very prime of life, at 27, by an epileptic seizure.\n  It was a tragedy to his family, his friends, and the party he served \nwith such fire and dedication.\n  Jeff's passing has a very personal impact, Mr. President, because he \nworked for me for 2\\1/2\\ years, first as a research assistant and later \nas a legislative correspondent, until he obtained a coveted\n\n[[Page S4684]]\n\nposition with the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee [DLCC] last \nJuly.\n  As a Senate staffer, Jeff displayed the thirst for knowledge and \neagerness to serve that characterizes many idealistic youth who come to \nWashington, He fulfilled his duties capably and supported me and my \nlegislative staff in my Senate responsibilities. He gave much, Mr. \nPresident, and he learned much about the duties and responsibilities of \npublic service.\n  But it was clear from the start that Jeff chafed to do more. His \nendless interest in the political drama of our times, coupled with his \nyouthful energy, finally turned him to the arena that he truly was born \nfor: electoral politics, the art and science of political campaigning.\n  Never was there an operative so constitutionally fitted for the rock \nand roll of modern, media-age politics as he. Jeff loved the ups and \ndowns of elections, the eat-or-be eaten nature of the democratic \nprocess, whether in the form of a Presidential campaign or a race for \nthe local school board. He had a Texas-size appetite where these things \napplied.\n  But Jeff was not merely interested in the process. He was driven by a \nreal concern for the people of our country. He had a passion to help \nordinary Americans, and an abiding confidence in the ability, and \nindeed the obligation, of government to help the less fortunate. That \nis why he worked long hours, well into the evenings, to learn more \nabout the political profession.\n  Indeed, Jeff had a personal vision, one that he shared with some of \nmy staff. He hoped to use the Internet as a communication tool for \ncampaigns. His idea was to establish a multicandidate, multiparty \nbulletin board on the Internet for campaign literature and party \nplatforms. Through this means, he hoped that everyone might have access \nto the information they needed to make better decisions about \ncandidates and campaigns. Campaigns would thus be fairer and more \ninformed.\n  So when Jeff left my office last July to take up a position with the \nDLCC, the organization within the national Democratic Party that \nfocuses on electing Democrats to State legislatures, I felt the loss of \nhis departure but understood that he was going forward in the right \ndirection. And when I heard that his success at the DLCC led to a \nposition with the Tennessee Democratic Party, I knew he had found his \ndream.\n  Jeff's unexpected death the third Monday in April was thus double \ntragic, for in addition to his youth, he seemingly had at last found a \nposition that exactly meshed with his temperament, interests, and \nabilities. His opportunities appeared boundless.\n  But if Jeff was taken from us just as he appeared to be fully engaged \nin life, we must remember that he died doing that which he truly loved. \nHow many of us can say the same?\n  Mr. President, Jeff's years among us were far too few, but let us \ntake comfort in the knowledge that he lived them fully. May his parents \nand loved ones take solace in his bright memory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/19/senate-section/article/S4683-4", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO DOROTHY CALLAGHAN, NEW HAMPSHIRE'S MOTHER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

There is an urgent need to enact legislation this year \nwhich can advance the creation of new networks and balance America's \ncompelling interests in commerce and security.\n  Secure networks are critical for the protection of personal privacy \nand the promotion of commerce on the Internet and other interactive \ncomputer systems.\n  The Congress has been gridlocked for more than a year in a debate \nabout the Nation's export policy for encryption software. I believe \nthat meaningful compromise can be found on this issue which can clear \nthe way for the consideration of broader legislation which fosters the \ncreation of secure networks.\n  If we are successful, a powerhouse of economic activity and \nopportunity can be unleashed.\n  Senators Burns and Leahy as well as Congressman Goodlatte have \nintroduced legislation which identifies a real problem with the current \nlaw on the export of encryption software. Thanks to their leadership, \nthere is a growing consensus that reform is needed. In many ways, the \nintroduction of their legislation has already motivated meaningful \nchanges in the administration's policy on software exports. Yet, even \nwith those changes, the underlying law needs to be changed and a \nbroader agenda for secure networks needs to be adopted.\n  What must happen in a relatively quick fashion is an agreement on a \nbipartisan, bicameral process to enact secure network legislation which \nincludes a solution to the encryption export riddle. Our goal should be \nto enact legislation which the President can sign by October 1, 1997.\n  The ability to use strong encryption is an important element in \ncreating secure networks. Through encryption, messages are encoded and \ndecoded. Encryption protects privacy and security. The American people \nneed to know that their communications are safe and that the most \nprivate, confidential personal information can be confidentially \ncommunicated on computer networks.\n  Encryption however, poses some very serious problems for law \nenforcement and national security which cannot be ignored. The \nchallenge is to promote the use of encryption in a manner that does not \nunduly compromise national security or public safety and does not \nunnecessarily burden industry.\n\n  What needs to be created is an electronic environment which gives \nusers total confidence in the security of commercial transactions and \npersonal communications. To do so, a largely private infrastructure \nmust be developed to provide for authentication of messages, keys, and \ndigital signatures and when necessary, the recovery of keys.\n  As the largest purchaser of computer software and hardware, the \nFederal Government can create important incentives to help the market \nswiftly respond to this need.\n  I see three big interests at stake--network commerce, network \ngovernment, and network security. First, the need to facilitate \ncommerce, both in advancing America's leading position as an exporter \nof software and in the\n\n[[Page S4685]]\n\npromotion of commerce on the Internet, grows in importance every day. \nSecond, there is the civic interest of Government. The American people \nshould be able to have secure access to their Government, for the \nresolution of problems, the communication of ideas and access to \nservices via electronic networks. Third, there is a security interest \nof law enforcement and national defense. Defensively, that interest is \nto protect citizens from foreign or criminal violations of privacy. \nOffensively, there needs to be a means fully consistent with our \nConstitution for discreet access to communications. That digital access \nshould be no more or less expansive than exists in the nondigital \nworld.\n  Mr. President, there needs to be a commitment to a process for \nresolving a host of issues. First and foremost what is needed is a \ncommitment by the leadership of this Congress to work together in good \nfaith to find a resolution that can be signed into law by the \nPresident.\n  I have proposed a discussion outline for compromise. If there can be \nagreement on principle and process, I am confident good faith \nnegotiations between all interested parties can meet the ambitious goal \nof new legislation before the end of this session of Congress. This \noutline is meant to spark discussion and facilitate compromise on some \nvery challenging issues. It is by no means etched in stone and I \nwelcome suggestions for improvement and additions.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the Secure Public Networks Act \ndiscussion outline be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n            The Secure Public Network Act Discussion Points\n\n\n                                Purpose\n\n       To encourage and facilitate the creation of secure public \n     networks for communication, commerce, education, research, \n     tele-medicine and government.\n\n\n                     A.

Mr. President, livestock producers across the \nDakotas have suffered immeasurable losses this winter. Baxter Black, \ncowboy poet and commentator on National Public Radio, wrote a touching \npiece describing the struggles of ranchers facing the realities of the \nseason's severe weather. National Public Radio aired the commentary on \nApril 23.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the following transcript of Mr. Black's \ncommentary be printed in the Record.\n  The transcript follows:\n\n                             We Understand\n\n       Repeat after me: I do solemnly swear as shepherd of the \n     flock to accept the responsibility for the animals put in my \n     care, to tend to their basic needs of food and shelter, to \n     minister to their ailments, to put their well being before my \n     own if need be, and to relieve their pain and suffering up \n     to, and including, the final bullet. I swear to treat them \n     with respect, to always remember that we have made them \n     dependent on us, and therefore have put their lives in our \n     hands, as God is my witness.\n       Helpless. The worst winter in Dakota's memory. Cattle \n     losses already predicted up to 50,000 head. And how did they \n     die? From exposure and lack of feed. Basic needs--food and \n     shelter. And now the flooding.\n       You think those Dakota ranchers said, ``Well, I'll just \n     close down the store and put on the answering machine, we'll \n     wait'll the storm blows over, no harm done''?\n       No, they couldn't. Wouldn't.\n       ``Charlie, you can't go out there. The cows are clear over \n     in the west pasture. You can't even see the barn from here.'' \n     But he tried anyway. Tried to get the machinery running, \n     tried to clear a path, tried to load the hay, tried to find \n     the road.\n       These are not people who live a pampered life. These are \n     not people who are easily defeated. These are not people who \n     quit trying. But days and weeks on end of blizzards, blowing \n     snow, and fatal wind chills took their toll.\n       Cattle stranded on the open plains with no cover, no \n     protection, no feed, no place to go, and no relief from the \n     Arctic fury died in singles and bunches and hundreds and \n     thousands, frozen as hard as iron.\n       And back in the house sat the rancher and his family, \n     stranded, unable to do what every fiber in their bodies \n     willed them to do, knowing that every hour he could not tend \n     his cows diminished him in some deep, permanent, undefinable \n     way, changing him forever.\n       The losses will eventually be tallied, the number of head, \n     and extrapolated to dollars. But dollars were not what kept \n     him pacing the floor at night, looking out the window every \n     two minutes, walking out in it 50 times a day, trying, \n     trying, trying, knowing if he could only get to them he could \n     save them. And then finally having to face the loss, his \n     failure as a shepherd. That's what kept him trying. \n     Exhausting, depression, and despair.\n       It's hard to comfort a person who has had his spirit \n     battered like that. ``It couldn't be helped, there's nothing \n     you could do,'' is small consolation.\n       So, all I can say to our fellow stockman in the Dakotas is, \n     in our own way, we understand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/19/senate-section/article/S4686-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO GARY HODSON ON BEING NAMED THE 1997 SOMERSWORTH CITIZEN OF \n                                THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, I would like to submit the \nfollowing testimony for the Record. Dr. Curtis Cook is a board-\ncertified obstetrician/gynecologist and a subspecialist in maternal-\nfetal medicine in Michigan. In March, Dr. Cook testified before the \nHouse-Senate joint hearing on ``Partial-Birth Abortion--The Truth.'' \nHis expert testimony speaks to both the medical necessity of the \npartial-birth procedure and the issue of fetal pain during the \nprocedure.\n  The testimony follows:\n\n Testimony by Curtis Cook, M.D., Maternal Fetal Medicine, Butterworth \n           Hospital, Michigan State College of Human Medicine\n\n       My name is Dr. Curtis Cook. I am a board-certified \n     Obstetrician/Gynecologist and a subspecialist in Maternal-\n     Fetal Medicine (also known as Perinatology or High Risk \n     Obstetrics). In my practice I take care of referred \n     complicated pregnancies because of preexisting chronic \n     medical conditions of the mother, or suspected abnormalities \n     in the baby. I am also the Associate Director of our region's \n     Maternal-Fetal Medicine division and also serve as Assistant \n     Residency Director for our Obstetrics and Gynecology training \n     program, I am an Assistant Clinical Professor at Michigan \n     State University of College of Human Medicine, and a member \n     of the American College of OB/GYN, The Society of Perinatal \n     Obstetricians, The American Medical Association, and the \n     Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics. I am \n     a founding member of PHACT (Physicians Ad Hoc Coalition for \n     Truth about Partial Birth Abortion), which I helped organize \n     after hearing the appalling medical misinformation circulated \n     in the media regarding this procedure. PHACT includes in its \n     membership over 400 physicians from Obstetrics, Maternal-\n     Fetal Medicine and Pediatrics. Many of these physicians are \n     educators or heads of departments, and also include the \n     former Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop. All that in required \n     of a physician for membership in an Interest in maternal and \n     child health, and a desire to educate the population on this \n     single issue.\n       I must begin my statement by defining partial birth \n     abortion as the feet first delivery of a living infant up to \n     the level of its after coming head, before puncturing the \n     base of its skull with a sharp instrument and sucking out the \n     brain contents, thereby killing it and allowing the collapse \n     of its skull and subsequent delivery. This description is \n     based upon the technique of Dr. Haskell of Ohio, who has \n     subsequently identified it as accurate. He has referred to \n     his technique as\n\n[[Page S4687]]\n\n     ``D & X'' (Dilatation and Extraction), while Dr. McMahon of \n     California refers to it as an ``intact D & E.'' An ACOG ad \n     hoc committee came up with the hybrid term ``intact D & X''. \n     As you can see, many terms are used and are not clear in \n     their description.\n       Partial birth abortion is mostly performed in the fifth and \n     six months of pregnancy. However, these procedures have been \n     performed up to the ninth month of pregnancy. The majority of \n     patients undergoing this procedure do not have significant \n     medical problems. In Dr. McMahon's series, less than ten \n     percent were performed for maternal indications, and these \n     included some ill-defined reasons such as depression, \n     hyperemesis, drug exposed spouse, and youth. Many of the \n     patients undergoing partial birth abortion are not even \n     carrying babies with abnormalities. In Dr. McMahon's series, \n     only about half of the babies were considered ``flawed'', and \n     these included some easily correctable conditions like cleft \n     lip and ventricular septal defect. Dr. Haskell claimed that \n     eighty percent of his procedures were purely elective, and a \n     group of New Jersey physicians claimed that only a minuscule \n     amount of their procedures were done for genetic \n     abnormalities or other defects. Most were performed on women \n     of lower age, education, or socioeconomic status who either \n     delayed or discovered late their unwanted pregnancies. It is \n     also clear that this procedure occurs thousands of times a \n     year, rather than a few hundred times a year, as claimed by \n     pro-abortion advocates. This has been independently confirmed \n     by the investigative work of The Washington Post, The New \n     Jersey Bergen Record and the American Medical Association \n     News.\n       One of the often ignored aspects of this procedure is that \n     it requires three days to accomplish. Before performing the \n     actual delivery, there is a two day period of cervical \n     dilation that involves forcing up to twenty five dilators \n     into the cervix at one time. This can cause great cramping \n     and nausea for the women, who are then sent to their home or \n     to a hotel room overnight while their cervix dilates. After \n     returning to the clinic, their bag of water is broken, the \n     baby is forced into a feet first position by grasping the \n     legs and pulling it down through the cervix and into the \n     vagina. This form of internal rotation, or version, is a \n     technique largely abandoned in modern obstetrics because of \n     the unacceptable risk associated with it. These techniques \n     place the women at greater risk for both immediate (bleeding) \n     and delayed (infection) complications. In fact, there may \n     also be longer repercussions of cervical manipulation leading \n     to an inherent weakness of the cervix and the inability to \n     carry pregnancies to term. We have already seen women who \n     have had trouble maintaining pregnancies after undergoing a \n     partial birth abortion.\n       There is no record of these procedures in any medical text, \n     journals, or on-line medical service. There is no known \n     quality assurance, credentialling, or other standard \n     assessment usually associated with newly-described surgical \n     techniques. Neither the CDC nor the Alan Gultmacher Institute \n     have any data on partial birth abortion, and certainly no \n     basis upon which to state the claim that it is a safer or \n     even a preferred procedure.\n       The bigger question then remains: Why ever do a partial \n     birth abortion? There are and always have been safer \n     techniques for partial birth abortion since it was first \n     described by Dr. McMahon in 1989 and Dr. Haskell in 1992. The \n     usual and customary (and previously studied) method of \n     delivery at this gestation is the medical induction of \n     labor using either intravaginal or intramuscular \n     medications to cause contractions and expulsion of the \n     baby. This takes about twelve hours on average, and may \n     also include possible cervical preparation with the use of \n     one to three cervical dilators (as opposed to the three-\n     day partial birth abortion procedure, with up to 25 \n     dilators in the cervix at one time). This also results in \n     an intact baby for pathologic evaluation, without \n     involving the other risk of internally turning the baby or \n     forcing a large number of dilators into the cervix. The \n     only possible ``advantage'' of partial birth abortion, if \n     you can call it that, is that it guarantees a dead baby at \n     time of delivery.\n       The less common situation of partial birth abortion \n     involves, an abnormal baby. These conditions do not threaten \n     a woman over and above a normal pregnancy, and do not require \n     the killing of the baby to preserve her health or future \n     fertility. I have taken care of many such women with the same \n     diagnoses as the women who provided testimony on this issue \n     in the past. Each of these women stated that they needed to \n     have a partial birth abortion performed in order to protect \n     their health or future fertility. In these cases of trisomy \n     (extra chromosomal material), hydrocephaly (water on the \n     brain), polyhydramnios (too much amniotic fluid) and \n     arthrogryposis (stiffened baby), there are alternatives to \n     partial birth abortion that do not threaten a woman's ability \n     to bear children in the future. I have personally cared for \n     many cases of all of these disorders, and have never required \n     any technique like partial birth abortion in order to \n     accomplish delivery. Additionally, I have never had a \n     colleague that I have known to have used the technique of \n     partial birth abortion in order to accomplish delivery in \n     this same group of patients. Moreover, there are high profile \n     providers of third trimester abortions who likewise do not \n     use the technique of partial birth abortion.\n       In the even rarer case of a severe maternal medical \n     condition requiring early delivery, partial birth abortion is \n     not preferred, and medical induction suffices without \n     threatening future fertility. Again, the killing of the fetus \n     is not required, only separation from the mother.\n       Finally, I wish to address the fetal pain issue, since it \n     has been claimed that a fetus feels no pain at these \n     gestational ages. This is about as ridiculous as the earlier \n     claim that the anesthesia of partial birth abortion put the \n     baby into a medical coma and killed it prior to the \n     performance of the auctioning technique. This was no small \n     claim to the many pregnant women undergoing non-obstetric \n     surgery every day in this country. Fortunately, this was \n     soundly denounced by both the American Society of \n     Anesthesiologists and the Society of Obstetrical Anesthesia \n     and Perinatology. In the course of my practice, we must \n     occasionally perform life-saving procedures on babies while \n     still in the uterus, I have often observed babies of five to \n     six months gestation withdraw from needles and instruments, \n     much like a pain response. Dr. Fisk in England has recently \n     reported an increase in fetal pain response hormones during \n     the course of these procedures at these same gestational \n     ages. In addition, we frequently observe the standard \n     grimaces and withdrawals of neonates born at six months \n     gestation like any other pain response in a more mature \n     infant.\n       While it is not my desire for legislators to enter into the \n     realm of medical policy making, there are times when the \n     public health risk needs to be addressed if the medical \n     community is either unwilling or unable to address it. We \n     have seen this precedent for female circumcision and forty-\n     eight hour postpartum stays. I believe the unnecessary, \n     unstudied, and potentially dangerous procedure of partial \n     birth abortion is unworthy of continuance in modern \n     obstetrics. It neither protects the life, the health or the \n     future fertility of women, and certainly does not benefit the \n     baby. For these reasons, I urge you to support the ban on \n     partial birth abortion.\n       I thank you for the opportunity to share my testimony and \n     my concern for the women and children of this \n     country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/19/senate-section/article/S4686-4", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4687-S4688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RAYMOND REID\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \na great patriot who has served over 54 years in the Federal Government. \nOn May 15, 1997, Raymond ``Ray'' T. Reid, retired from the U.S. House \nof Representatives, where he worked as a chief of staff for 23 years, \nlending his expertise and leadership to three different Congressmen \nrepresenting the Third District of Arkansas. I was one of those \nfortunate Members who had the privilege of working with Ray for the 4 \nyears that I served in the House. When I was first elected to Congress \nin 1992, I replaced John Paul Hammerschmidt, a retiring Member who had \nrepresented the Third District for 26 years, and had become a legend \nboth on Capitol Hill and in the State of Arkansas. However, it was no \nsecret that behind this great politician was Ray Reid, a man who over \nthe years had become an Arkansas legend himself. When John Paul \nretired, his work continued on through Ray's service and dedication. As \na newly elected freshman, Ray provided my office with continuity, \nefficiency, stability, and a wisdom that could only come from 19 years \nof being a chief of staff.\n  The successful career of Ray Reid began long before he worked on \nCapitol Hill. Ray began his career back in 1942 when he left Bowdoin \nCollege in Brunswick, ME, to join the U.S. Army to defend our Nation in \nWorld War II. Following the war, he rose quickly up the ranks, \nreceiving honors for his leadership ability and outstanding \nachievement. He made the Army his career for 31 years, where he served \non both foreign soil and here in the United States. Ray moved his \nfamily several times, living in countries around the globe. He fought \nfor freedom and justice in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam in addition \nto faithfully serving his country in peacetime.\n  He continued his service undiminished until December 31, 1973, when \nhe retired from the Army as a colonel. Having worked in the Office of \nthe Congressional Liaison at the Pentagon, Ray was able to make a \nsmooth, natural transition to working in a congressional office. He \nbrought to Congressman Hammerschmidt's office a vast degree of \nknowledge from several years of international exposure and a solid \nbackground in domestic policy. By the time Ray came to work for me, he \nwas an invaluable resource who possessed a wealth of information and \nexperience. Throughout his tenure as chief of staff in my office, he \nprovided guidance and an institutional knowl-\n\n[[Page S4688]]\n\nedge which would have been difficult to match. I can say without \nhesitance that Ray Reid conducted legislative business with the highest \nethical standards. The best interests of the residents of the Third \nDistrict were always placed above partisan politics and our office was \nmanaged in a way that was beyond reproach. When I moved over to the \nSenate, Ray demonstrated his commitment to the constituents of the \nThird District once again by agreeing to see another freshman, my \nbrother, Asa, through the transition process.\n  So, today, as Ray enjoys the first Monday that he doesn't need to go \nto work after over a half a century of public service, on behalf of the \nState of Arkansas and the people he touched here on Capitol Hill, I \nwant to offer my deepest thanks to a man whose loyalty and friendship \nwill not be forgotten. Truly a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/19/senate-section/article/S4687-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO HOLLIS/BROOKLINE COOPERATIVE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS MATH TEAM\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, I suggest that before we begin \nthinking about patting ourselves on the back for the budget agreement \nthat was finalized last week, we consider the hard work ahead. The \nagreement is merely a broad outline--a blueprint--for the spending and \ntax bills yet to come. We still need to consider how it is supposed to \nbe implemented before claiming any sort of victory.\n  We need to consider, for example, whether it will actually lead to a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002. Is it good for families? Will it \nensure that the Medicare Program is protected for today's generation of \nretirees and for our children and grandchildren? Will it help the \neconomy produce the jobs needed for those trying to get off welfare, or \nthose entering the work force for the first time? Will it help more \nyoung people get a college education? Will it provide the resources \nneeded to safeguard our country from immediate and future threats from \nabroad?\n  Mr. President, as the broad outline of the budget agreement with the \nWhite House has been filtering out over the last 2 weeks, I could not \nhelp but think of the budget deal that was brokered by President Bush \nand congressional Democrats 7 years ago.\n  Here is what President Bush said when he announced that agreement in \na broadcast on October 2, 1990:\n\n       It is the biggest deficit-reduction agreement ever; half a \n     trillion dollars. It's the toughest deficit-reduction package \n     ever, with new enforcement rules to make sure that what we \n     fix now stays fixed. And it has the largest spending \n     savings ever, more than $300 billion.\n\n  Of course, the agreement produced no such thing. Looking back, it \nproduced bigger deficits, not smaller deficits--221 billion dollars' \nworth of red ink in 1990, rising to $290 billion in 1993. Federal \nspending increased from $1.2 to $1.4 trillion--up nearly 17 percent in \njust 3 years. So the mere fact that there is an agreement with the \nPresident is not reason enough to believe that the problem has been \nsolved. As Gen. George S. Patton once said, ``if everybody is thinking \nalike, then somebody isn't thinking.'' We need to look objectively at \nthe details, and whether the plan is reflective of values that our \nconstituents sent us here to uphold.\n  Right now, people are not sure. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll released \non May 8 indicated that an overwhelming majority of Americans--roughly \n8 in 10--do not believe the deal will actually result in a balanced \nbudget by 2002. Obviously, we need to take a careful look at what is \nbeing proposed here before deciding whether or not to support it.\n  Mr. President, let me quote some of the words President Clinton used \non May 2 when he announced the latest budget agreement. I think they \nwill show why people have reason to be skeptical. While suggesting that \n``it will be the first balanced budget in three decades,'' the \nPresident went on to note that it would ``continue to increase our \ninvestments,'' ``expand coverage,'' ``restore cuts,'' ``extend new \nbenefits,'' and ``increase'' spending, while ``moderating excessive \ncuts.'' My friends, we cannot balance the budget by increasing spending \nand funding a whole host of new programs and benefits. Let us be honest \nabout that. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\n  As I recall, the goal in 1990, as it was again in 1997, was to devise \na plan to balance the budget, while providing long-term Federal \nspending constraints and incentives for economic growth. I opposed the \n1990 agreement, believing it was seriously flawed on all those counts, \nand I see similar problems looming in the latest agreement.\n  Let me focus first on the issue of taxes. The deal with the Clinton \nWhite House is different from the 1990 plan in that it includes some \nvery modest tax cuts. But because the amount of tax reductions \nPresident Clinton would agree to is so small--less than 2 percent of \nthe revenue that the Federal Government expects to raise over the next \n5 years--it remains to be seen whether there is any tax relief here \nworthy of the name.\n  I know that some might ask why we even need a tax cut when the \neconomy continues to grow at a relatively healthy clip. There are two \nreasons. First, think of families. A $500-per-child tax credit can make \na world of difference to a mom and dad sitting around the kitchen table \ntrying to find a way to pay for their daughter's education, to pay for \nsummer camp or braces for the kids. What single mom could not use a \n$500-per-child credit to help make ends meet?\n  Yes, the Federal Government could keep the money and try to provide \nsome kind of aid to these families. But if families could keep more of \ntheir hard-earned money to do for themselves, we probably would not \nneed government to do so many things. It seems to me that we ought to \nput our trust in families to do what is right by their own children. \nAnd unfortunately, it is not clear we can accommodate the full $500-\nper-child credit under this plan.\n  What about tax relief for small businesses, including the new \nbusinesses started by women and minorities? After all, that is where \nmost of the new jobs around the country are created. Provide a \nmeaningful tax cut, and small businesses and family farms could expand, \nhire new people, pay better wages, and do the things necessary to \nbecome more competitive.\n\n  Alternatively, Government can keep the taxes. But remember, it then \nturns around and provides a whole host of subsidies to businesses \nbecause they do not have the resources to do for themselves.\n  It is an endless cycle. When people are not left with enough to care \nfor themselves, the Government tries to do more. When it does more, it \ntaxes more, and people are left with even less. It has to stop \nsomewhere. Americans need some relief.\n  Mr. President, it is also important to understand how important a \nhealthy and growing economy is to balancing the budget. We just \nreceived word from the Congressional Budget Office [CBO] that this \nyear's deficit is expected to decline to $70 billion. That is $55 \nbillion less than President Clinton's budget assumed as recently as \nFebruary. And it is largely the result of two things:\n\n[[Page S4689]]\n\n robust economic growth during the last few months, and Congress \nfinally beginning to restrain spending growth during the last 2\\1/2\\ \nyears.\n  Limiting spending just takes some discipline, but how can tax policy \nhelp the economy to grow and prosper? It may come as a surprise to \nsome, but lower tax rates not only help make people better off, but can \nproduce more tax revenue for the Treasury as well. Just think what has \nhappened during the last few months. The growing economy helped reduce \nthe deficit $55 billion just since the President's February \nprojections. CBO estimates that economic growth will produce an extra \n$45 billion a year for the next few years. So it is important to \nsustain that growth into the future.\n  The economy grows like any prudent business enterprise grows. It is \nlike a weekend sale at the Target store. When prices are slashed, \npeople buy more goods, and the increased volume of sales more than \nmakes up for the price reduction. The converse is also true--higher \nprices cause people to shop elsewhere. Higher taxes cause people to \nshelter income, or make less, to avoid paying more taxes.\n\n  Mr. President, based upon what we know about the current agreement, \nit does not seem to me that we will be able to achieve either of these \ngoals: providing families and small businesses with tax relief, or \nkeeping the economy growing at a healthy rate. But what about spending? \nDoes it do anything to constrain Federal spending--since it was \nexcessive spending that caused the 1990 budget agreement to fail?\n  Well, here is how domestic spending totes up compared to the levels \nCongress approved a year ago in the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution. \nThese are figures developed by our colleague, Senator Phil Gramm, a \nmember of the Budget Committee. And I will note that the Budget \nCommittee will not begin marking up the budget resolution until this \nafternoon, so these numbers may change. But they suggest an alarming \ntrend in any event.\n  According to Senator Gramm's figures, domestic spending in this deal \nwill amount to $193 billion more over 5 years than we were willing to \napprove just 1 year ago. It is $79 billion more than President Clinton \nhimself asked for just a year ago, and $5 billion more than he asked \nfor in February.\n  Mr. President, the budget agreement with the White House would \nprovide an additional $16 billion for new Government-provided health \ninsurance, and another $18 billion to repeal parts of welfare reform \nand expand the Food Stamp Program. It puts more money into education, \nbut because of the way this is done, the extra resources are likely to \nbe eaten up by tuition increases. Or they will simply help those who \nhad the means to go to college anyway.\n  Medicare savings in the plan come largely from reductions in provider \nreimbursements, which either will diminish the quality of care provided \nto older Americans or drive more doctors and hospitals out of the \nMedicare Program altogether, leaving seniors with limited health-care \nchoices. Medicare solvency occurs as a result of shifting the costs of \nhome health care from part A to part B--a gimmick that we roundly \ndenounced when the President proposed it before.\n  The Medicare savings are enough to forestall the bankruptcy of the \nprogram for a few years, but they are not enough to ensure that \nMedicare remains safe and sound to take care of Americans in the baby-\nboom generation who will begin retiring within the next decade. The \nMedicare features of this agreement certainly will not protect the \nsystem for young people who are just entering the work force today.\n  Defense spending in this agreement is also insufficient to protect \nfuture generations. We have cashed in on the much-heralded peace \ndividend so many times that our military service chiefs have been \nwarning about increased risks due to budget cuts.\n  I know that many believe this is a time when the United States can \ncut back its defense budget. But history teaches us the opposite. We \nhave always enjoyed a period of calm before a storm. With the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction that is occurring today, \nand the emergence of movements hostile to the West, we do not have the \nluxury of waiting until after we have been threatened to invest in our \nmilitary. We must remain ready and fully capable, both to deter and to \ndefeat any aggression against American citizens.\n  Mr. President, it is instructive that the first piece of legislation \non the Senate floor after this deal was struck was the supplemental \nappropriations bill, which will add $6.6 billion to the deficit over \nthe next few years. In other words, we have already added to the \ndeficit before the ink on the budget agreement is even dry.\n\n  We had the chance to change that with the amendment that Senator \nGramm offered--an amendment which I supported. But it did not pass, and \nso for all practical purposes the budget agreement will have to be \nmodified to account for this extra spending. At least that part of it \nwill need to be fixed.\n  I think we need to learn a lot more about the agreement this week \nbefore signing off on it. Unless parts of it can be modified down the \nline as the House and Senate begin writing the tax and spending bills \nto implement it, I believe it will not lead to balance. It will \ncertainly not lead to balance after the $6.6 billion that was added to \nthe deficit by the supplemental spending bill.\n  Mr. President, it may even usher in a bigger, more powerful Federal \nGovernment, as happened in 1990. And that is not what many of us came \nhere to do.\n  We can compromise on details without compromising our principles. We \nshould never be afraid to take legitimate differences to the American \npeople when we are unable to resolve them here. I ask that a column by \nSenator Phil Gramm, which includes some additional information about \nthe budget agreement, be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 9, 1997]\n\n                         Deceptive Budget Deal\n\n                            (By Phil Gramm)\n\n       After two years of partisan confrontation on the budget, \n     the president and Congress have reached a bipartisan deal \n     that appears to be all things to all people. The president \n     gets more social spending, Republicans get a tax cut, and the \n     American people get a balanced budget. If it all seems too \n     good to be true, that's because it is.\n       Because the budgeting arms of both the administration and \n     Congress assumed--before the budget debate even started--that \n     the strong economy we now enjoy would produce sustained \n     growth beyond the year 2002, the amount of deficit reduction \n     required to achieve a balanced budget immediately declined \n     from $642 billion over the next five years to $330 billion. \n     Then it got even better. At the very moment of impasse in the \n     budget negotiations, the Congressional Budget Office \n     discovered that even its previous estimates of an improving \n     economy understated the revenue windfall expected in the next \n     five years and predicted that windfall alone would lower the \n     deficit another $225 billion. Negotiators then rolled up \n     their sleeves and assumed $15 billion of additional savings \n     from lower consumer prices and $77 billion in additional \n     savings from the even stronger economic growth that would be \n     generated by balancing the budget.\n       The net result is that before a single change in public \n     policy became part of the budget compromise, deficits of $317 \n     billion--96 percent of the total deficit--had simply been \n     assumed away. Only $14 billion, or 4 percent of deficit \n     reduction in the budget compromise, comes from actually \n     changing policy.\n       The most distinctive feature of the budget compromise is \n     the size of domestic discretionary spending increases. While \n     it is fashionable for Republicans to claim that this budget \n     deal achieves the goals of the Contract With America, in \n     reality it spends $216 billion more on domestic discretionary \n     programs than the contract contained. The compromise \n     increases domestic discretionary spending by $193 billion \n     above the 1997 budget resolution and by $79 billion above \n     President Clinton's actual budget request for 1997. In fact, \n     if you look at the president's 1998 budget as scored by the \n     Congressional Budget Office, the budget deal actually gives \n     the president $5 billion more in discretionary spending than \n     his own budget would have provided.\n       The most permanent feature of the bipartisan budget \n     compromise is an increase in domestic spending on social \n     programs, which the president has rightly compared to the \n     explosion of social spending that occurred in the 1960's.\n       In addition to these increases in discretionary spending, \n     the budget compromise contains new entitlement benefits in \n     Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and SSI, and it overturns \n     part of the one major reform of the 104th Congress: It \n     reestablishes welfare benefits for legal aliens.\n       The budget compromise proudly trumpets $115 billion of \n     savings in medicare, but by committing to accept the \n     president's plan to simply cut reimbursement for doctors and \n     hospitals, Congress buys into a policy that has been \n     implemented over and over again in the past 30 years without \n     achieving substantial savings. Like other forms of price \n     controls, reducing reimbursement for physicians\n\n[[Page S4690]]\n\n     and hospitals has historically been circumvented as the \n     recipients have invented ways to work around the limitations. \n     In addition, the compromise requires that the fastest growing \n     part of Medicare, home health care, be taken out of the \n     Medicare trust fund and financed from general revenues.\n       Perhaps the most perverse aspect of the compromise is that \n     this budget will trample an emerging bipartisan commitment to \n     real Medicare reform. This budget agreement virtually \n     guarantees that five years from now Medicare will be in much \n     worse shape than it is today. Moreover, virtually every penny \n     of the $115 billion claimed from Medicare savings will be \n     spent on increases in social programs and new entitlement \n     benefits.\n       That brings us to my party's favorite part of the deal, the \n     much-discussed $85 billion tax cut. The cut is largely funded \n     by odds-and-ends measures, the largest of which is at least \n     $25 billion of revenues assumed to be derived from auctioning \n     off broadcast and non-broadcast spectrum--the right to use \n     public airways for everything from broadcasting the 6 o'clock \n     news to setting up a cellular phone system.\n       Last year Congress assumed a limited spectrum auction of \n     $2.9 billion as an offset to new spending. When actually \n     auctioned, the spectrum brought in just $13.6 million, or \n     roughly $1 for every $200 that Congress had assumed would be \n     raised. Given our experience of last year, it is highly \n     unlikely that anything like $25 billion will be raised from \n     spectrum auction unless television stations are forced to buy \n     spectrum to broadcast their new digital signals, something \n     the Federal Communication Commission, the White House and \n     Congress have opposed.\n       The budget agreement claims a net reduction in taxes of $85 \n     billion. Some $5 billion of that tax cut will be lost to the \n     public because the assumed reductions in the consumer price \n     index will raise income taxes by $5 billion. Of the remaining \n     $80 billion, the Clinton administration's education tax \n     credit will absorb roughly $35 billion, leaving Republicans \n     some $45 billion in net tax cuts to fund their tax-cut \n     priorities.\n       Unfortunately, the full Republican tax package costs $188 \n     billion. Republicans on the House and Senate tax-writing \n     committees now will be forced to try to stretch a net tax cut \n     of $45 billion to cover a $500-per-child tax credit that \n     costs $105 billion, capital gains relief that costs $32 \n     billion, estate and death tax relief that cost $18 billion \n     and individual retirement account expansion that costs $32 \n     billion.\n       Even if $50 billion of offsetting tax increases can be \n     found, it is a certainty that the individual tax credit will \n     be dramatically curtailed, probably by ensuring that many \n     middle- and upper-middle-income working families don't get \n     any child tax credit. Capital gains and estate tax relief \n     will be similarly truncated. In the end, despite all the talk \n     of achieving a major tax cut, it is hard to see a substantial \n     impact in a $7 trillion economy being created by a $45 \n     billion tax cut.\n       Obviously, in a budget deal such as this, the logical \n     question is: ``Is it better than nothing?'' And, as is \n     usually the case, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But \n     in the final analysis, two factors ultimately make this \n     budget agreement worse than no agreement. The first is the \n     false perception it creates that the deficit problem has been \n     fixed. This notion already has given rise to the largest \n     increase in social spending since the '60s in this budget \n     agreement and is likely to further open the floodgates as \n     Congress convinces itself and the American public that the \n     deficit is behind us. Second, by claiming to have solved the \n     Medicare problem for 10 years, we will take the pressure off \n     the president and Congress to reform Medicare even though the \n     trust fund is careening toward bankruptcy, and Medicare will \n     produce a $1.6 trillion drain on the federal Treasury over \n     the next 10 years.\n       Historically, America has looked to its two great political \n     parties to contest over principles and new ideas so that the \n     highest principles and best ideas could become the governing \n     consensus for the country. But divided government often \n     produces massive pressure for bipartisanship, and the current \n     budget deal is an example of how bipartisanship sometimes can \n     manifest itself not in compromise policy but in a decision to \n     join together to mislead the public. The opposite of gridlock \n     is not necessarily efficiency, it is sometimes \n     deception.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/19/senate-section/article/S4688-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MAY 20, 1997\n\n  Mr. COATS.

For the information of all Senators, at 10 a.m. tomorrow \nmorning it is hoped the Senate will be able to reach an agreement \nallowing for the completion of the partial-birth abortion ban bill. If \nthat agreement is reached, Senators should anticipate a vote on passage \nof that legislation at approximately 2:30 p.m., on Tuesday.\n  Also, Senators should be reminded that it is the intention of the \nmajority leader to begin consideration of the budget resolution \ntomorrow afternoon.

Members who intend to offer amendments to \nthat resolution should be prepared to offer those amendments during \ntomorrow's session.

All Members will be notified \naccordingly as any votes are ordered with respect to any of this \nlegislation.\n  I thank all Members for their attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/19/senate-section/article/S4690-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
