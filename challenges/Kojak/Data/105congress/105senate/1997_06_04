We are privileged to live in this free land You have so \nrichly blessed.\n  You have created each of us to know, love, and serve You. \nThanksgiving is the memory of our hearts. You have shown us that \ngratitude is the parent of all other virtues. Without gratitude our \nlives miss the greatness You intended, and remain proud, self-centered, \nand limited. Thanksgiving is the thermostat of our souls opening us to \nthe inflow of Your Spirit and the realization of even greater \nblessings.\n  But so often we need to thank You for the problems that make us more \ndependent on You for Your guidance and strength. When we have turned to \nYou in the past, You have given us the leadership skills we needed. \nThank You, Lord, for taking us where we are with all our human \nweaknesses, and using us for Your glory. May we always be distinguished \nby the immensity of our gratitude for the way You pour out Your wisdom \nand vision when with humility we call out to You for help. We are \nprofoundly grateful, in the name of our Lord and Saviour.

For the information of all Senators, today the Senate will \nimmediately resume consideration of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace \nAct. By previous consent, Senator Kennedy or his designee will be \nrecognized for 30 minutes of debate to be followed by Senator Ashcroft \nfor up to 30 minutes. At the expiration of that time, the Senate will \nproceed to a vote on cloture on the substitute amendment to S. 4. \nSenators can therefore expect that cloture vote at approximately 4 p.m. \ntoday. I guess it will probably be shortly after 4. Senators are also \nreminded that they have until 3:30 this afternoon in order to file \nsecond-degree amendments to the substitute to S. 4. It is my hope that \ncloture will be invoked and the Senate can then proceed to conclude \naction on this very important measure. If that is the case, Senators \nshould be prepared to continue the debate and vote on amendments to S. \n4.\n  In addition, as previously announced, it is my hope that we can \nconclude work on the budget conference report--and I understand the \nconferees have met today and should be able to complete the conference, \nif not this afternoon, sometime tomorrow--and the supplemental \nappropriations conference report as soon as those items are available \nfor consideration.\n  Now, I understand that some of my colleagues are concerned about the \nsupplemental appropriations conference report and are now talking about \nextensive debate. I do want to say that I have just been advised that \nthe conferees have been working and they feel they have made real good \nprogress and, as a matter of fact, they could conclude action on the \nconference report even within the hour now. Knowing how conferences \nwork, sometimes when you get right to the end, that last 10 percent or \n2 percent causes a problem and they may still encounter further delays. \nBut the appropriators and the conferees are meeting, they are working, \nand I believe they are making progress. Hopefully, they will get to \nsome conclusion this afternoon on the conference report that we could \nvote on.\n  I understand the frustration of Members on all sides. It is very \nimportant language here. The administration needs to understand that \nPennsylvania Avenue is a two-way street. It doesn't just come from the \nCapitol down to the White House, where we send down billions of the \ntaxpayers' dollars; we have to get a little cooperation. We feel very \nstrongly about the importance of a law enforcement commission to take a \nlook at the overall application of law enforcement in America. We feel \nvery strongly about the census issue. How do we make sure that it's \nfair and thorough and complete and accurate? We may come to an \nagreement on how that can be done, either in terms of actual count or \nsome modification, but not without consultation and not without the \nCongress being involved in a constitutional issue. We also remind \npeople that the only way--the only way--the disaster funds will stop \nflowing from FEMA or SBA--and the money is flowing right now--is if we \nhave some sort of fun and games at the end of the fiscal year with a \nGovernment shutdown.\n  I think we can work these matters out. We should. But everybody needs \nto understand these are important issues. This is not abnormal. I have \nbeen through supplemental bills probably 24 times or more in my career \nin Congress. I have been through disasters. There is nothing new here. \nThere is nothing out of order here. We need to keep working together, \nand if we heighten the rhetoric and the partisanship, it doesn't help.\n\n  I tried my very best to make sure that the Senate in fact is a family \nfriendly workplace. I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, we have \nflexibility in our schedules and we have tried not to work into the wee \nhours of the night. In fact, I think only one night this year have we \ngone beyond 8:30. I think that is wise, because over the years I have \nnoticed that any time the Congress, House or Senate, stays in\n\n[[Page S5278]]\n\nafter about 8 o'clock, they start making mistakes. And some of us still \nhave wives that we like to see or spouses that we like to see or \nchildren that we enjoy being with. So the threat of staying up all \nnight tonight to talk about a bill that in fact we hope we can come to \nagreement on shortly rings hollow to me. Let's just do our work and \nkeep calm and we can get this thing solved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/04/senate-section/article/S5277-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \ndisagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the concurrent resolution \n(H.

Mr. President, I rise today to join in marking \nthe eighth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre, a tragic day \nwhen a still unknown number of Chinese--some say hundreds, others \nthousands--died at the hands of the People's Liberation Army.\n  This anniversary is significant because it is the first since the \ndeath of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, the man who \norchestrated the bloody crackdown against the pro-democracy movement. \nUnfortunately, even with Deng out of the picture, the Chinese Communist \nParty remains unwilling to re-examine the events of June 4, 1989. \nIndeed, China's leaders would like nothing more than to have Tiananmen \nfade from the world's memory.\n  But Tiananmen is still very much a part of the present. As all of us \nare aware, Wang Dan, a student leader of Tiananmen, was sent back to \nprison last October for continuing to advocate democratic reform. \nAccording to Amnesty International, 303 people remain in prison for \ntheir role in the 1989 demonstrations. Certainly for these people and \ntheir families, Tiananmen remains a part of daily life.\n  Today, Tiananmen is still very much on the minds of Hong Kong's \npeople. The 1989 prodemocracy demonstrations created an outpouring of \nsupport from the British colony. Hong Kong residents donated hundreds \nof tents and sleeping bags to the students occupying Tiananmen Square. \nThousands are expected to gather this evening in Hong Kong's Victoria \nPark for a candlelight vigil. Many are worried that public observance \nof Tiananmen will be banned once Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule this \nsummer. After the transfer of Hong Kong is completed, commemoration of \nJune 4 will become the ultimate test of whether China will allow Hong \nKong to maintain its cherished freedoms.\n  For those of us who are concerned about human rights in China, June 4 \nis still a powerful reminder that the Chinese Government has not \nchanged. I was appalled to hear that, during his visit to Washington \nlast December, China's Defense Minister Chi Haotian said that ``not a \nsingle person lost their life in Tiananmen Square.'' That was an insult \nto the memory of those who died on the streets of Beijing that night.\n  Mr. President, yesterday Senator Helms and I submitted a resolution \nof disapproval of the President's decision to renew most-favored-nation \ntrade privileges to China. I feel strongly that the decision in 1994 to \ndelink human rights and MFN was a mistake. Disconnecting the two has \nhelped make China's leaders feel secure enough to renew their crackdown \non the democracy movement and commit further human rights atrocities in \nTibet. I believe that denying MFN is the best way to communicate to the \nleadership in Beijing that the United States still values human rights.\n  It is the best way to tell the Chinese Government that we will not \nforget Tiananmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/04/senate-section/article/S5279-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5279-S5280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IN MEMORY OF TIANANMEN\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to note the solemn \nanniversary of the massacre of Chinese students and prodemocracy \nactivists in Tiananmen Square, and to honor the memory of the men and \nwomen who were so cruelly murdered by the totalitarian regime of the \nPeople's Republic of China.\n  No one who witnessed the events will soon forget the images of \nstudents and others rallying around the Goddess of Democracy statue, \nmodeled on Bartholdi's Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World in New \nYork harbor.\n  The Chinese Government has long argued that democracy is inimical to \nAsian values and that Americans' insistence on human rights is a form \nof cultural imperialism. The students in Tiananmen Square provided the \nmost compelling refutation of such tripe.\n  Our hope that we were witnessing the dawn of a new era in China was \ndashed when, on June 4, 1989, the so-called People's Liberation Army \nmoved into Tiananmen to thwart the aspirations of the Chinese people. \nThe photograph\n\n[[Page S5280]]\n\nof one lone Chinese individual--Wang Weilin--confronting a column of 18 \nPLA tanks is both a tribute to the courage of the Chinese people and a \nfitting emblem for a regime that believes it can crush ideas with 120 \nmillimeter guns and hold back the tide of history with bayonets.\n  I am sorry to say that since 1989, China has continued to silence \ndissent. So much so that the State Department reported this year that \nby 1996, ``all public dissent against the party and government was \neffectively silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison \nterms, administrative detention, or house arrest. No dissidents were \nknown to be active at year's end.''\n  On this occasion, let us honor the memory of those who were slain and \nreiterate our solidarity with Chinese dissidents imprisoned by their \ngovernment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/04/senate-section/article/S5279-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   WE THE PEOPLE . . . THE CITIZENS AND THE CONSTITUTION COMPETITION\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nfollowing students of Dunwoody High School in Dunwoody, GA, and their \nteacher for their excellent performance in the We the People . . . The \nCitizens and the Constitution: Deno Adkins, Leslie Alterman, Chuck \nAskew, Querida Brisbane, John Brown, Alice Bui, Kevin Campbell, Carrie \nChu, Jeff Guggenheim, Susie Ham, Adam Hassler, Judy Hong, Michael \nLandis, Rachel Moore, Regan O'Boyle, Youn Park, Kim Pham, Ahmer Siddiq, \nDavid Stewart, Adam Tate, Brad Thomas, David Tran, Christin Voytko, \nMorhan Willis, Brent Wolkin, and teacher Celeste Boemker. I would also \nlike to recognize the efforts of the State coordinator, Michele Collins \nand district coordinator, John Carr, who helped these students make it \nto the finals.\n  This bright young group of students competed against 50 other classes \nfrom around the Nation, testing their knowledge of the U.S. \nConstitution and our Government. They spent hours roleplaying and \ntesting to prepare themselves for this competition. This 3-day program \nsimulates a congressional hearing in which students' presentations are \njudged on the basis of their knowledge of constitutional principles and \ntheir ability to apply them to historical and contemporary issues.\n  Mr. President, it is with great pride that I offer my congratulations \nto these students from Dunwoody High School for their outstanding \nperformance at the We the People competition, and wish them continuing \nsuccess with their future studies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/04/senate-section/article/S5280-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INDONESIAN ELECTIONS\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to draw the Senate's \nattention to the parliamentary elections that took place in Indonesia \nlast Thursday, May 29.\n  Actually, it does not seem accurate to call this event an election \nsince the polling was conducted amid worsening political repression and \nhuman rights abuses by the Indonesian Government. As in past elections, \nall candidates were prescreened and new political parties banned. \nIndividuals who posed even the slightest challenge to President \nSuharto's power were not allowed to participate. We cannot mistake this \nprocess for a real election. Rather, it was a pitiful example of a \nbrutal authoritarian Government attempting to masquerade as a \ndemocracy.\n  Clearly many in Indonesia are angry about not having a voice. This \nlatest election was the most violent in 30 years. Rampant corruption \namong Indonesia's ruling elite and continued high unemployment have \ncreated a deep vein of discontent. Yet Indonesians are given no choice \nother than Suharto, who already has ruled Indonesia for more than three \ndecades.\n  Mr. President, the human rights situation in Indonesia remains as bad \nas ever. Five demonstrators were killed by troops last July after the \nGovernment engineered an attack on the office of an opposition party. \nIn addition to the 5 dead, 23 protestors are still missing. Also last \nsummer, labor leader Muchtar Pakpahan was arrested on trumped-up \nsedition charges. Mr. Pakpahan's only crime was to demand democracy, \nrespect for human rights, and decent labor conditions.\n  The State Department's 1996 human rights report indicates that \nprisoners like Mr. Pakpahan frequently die at the hands of their \ninterrogators. The report states that Indonesian ``security forces \ncontinue to employ torture and other forms of mistreatment, \nparticularly in regions where there were active security concerns, such \nas Irian Jaya, and East Timor. Police often resort to physical abuse, \neven in minor incidents.''\n  Indeed, the human rights situation in East Timor continues to be a \nmatter of great concern. Since last Tuesday, as many as 41 people--both \nEast Timorese citizens and Indonesian soldiers--have died in election-\nrelated violence. Unfortunately, such killings are a part of daily life \nin East Timor. Human rights monitors estimate that as many as 200,000 \nEast Timorese have died under the Indonesian regime. Two hundred \nthousand. That represents a full third of East Timor's population \nbefore Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony back in 1975.\n  On the day before Indonesia's election, East Timorese activist and \nco-winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize Jose Ramos-Horta visited \nWashington. Mr. Ramos-Horta carried with him graphic evidence of human \nrights abuses that have occurred in East Timor in the last few months, \nevidence that includes disturbing photographs of Indonesian military \nofficers torturing East Timorese detainees with electric shocks and lit \ncigarettes.\n\n  In his statement on the elections, Mr. Ramos-Horta notes that the \nunrest in East Timor is now spreading into Indonesia as people grow \nmore frustrated with the existing political system. According to Mr. \nRamos-Horta ``a spiral of violence can be anticipated for Indonesia \nfrom now on as dissent grows. It will be met with the customary \nrepression by the military-backed regime, now increasingly desperate as \nits grip on power begins to slip, leading to an extended period of \ninstability, disruption to peace and much human suffering.''\n  I agree that the violence in Indonesia will only subside after \nPresident Suharto initiates real democratic change and, for example, \nallows all parties to compete equally in the political process.\n  However, like their counterparts in China, Indonesian authorities try \nto argue that greater democracy will lead to instability which in turn \nwill impede economic development. I fundamentally reject this idea. \nClearly, with so many Indonesians venting their anger against the \npresent regime, the problem is not too much democracy, but too little. \nJust because President Suharto's government has boosted economic growth \ndoes not mean it has the right to murder and torture Indonesians and \nEast Timorese.\n  Mr. President, the events of last week only further my discomfort \nregarding United States policy in Indonesia. As you know, the United \nStates has supplied Indonesia with military training and weapons. \nRather than aid Indonesia's military, we should encourage the \ndemocratic forces within Indonesian society. As a world leader with \ngreat influence in Jakarta, the United States should work to convince \nIndonesia's leaders that holding real elections, the kind that give \npeople a true say in how they are governed, is a sign of national \nstrength, not weakness. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/04/senate-section/article/S5280-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5280-S5281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ISADOR LOUIS KUNIAN\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Isador Louis \nKunian, a long-time friend who passed away on March 5, 1997. Born in \nAtlanta, GA as Isador Louis Kunianski, he shortened his last name, but \neveryone who knew him called him Sonny. We are honoring Sonny not only \nbecause he was successful, but because he used the fruits of his \nsuccess to help others. One of Sonny's greatest personal drives was to \nhelp people who wanted to help themselves. His participation in the \neducation of hundreds of persons will provide a legacy to Sonny. In \nSonny's own words, ``Providing for a person's education is the greatest \ninvestment that I have ever made.''\n  In 1980, he established the Mildred and I.L. Kunian Scholarship Fund \nat Georgia Tech that has helped more than a hundred students pay their \ncollege bills. In addition, he founded the Georgia Tech Satellite \nLiteracy Program, which broadcasts, via satellite\n\n[[Page S5281]]\n\ntelevision, adult basic education classes to over 100 classrooms in \nrural Georgia. Sonny was instrumental in securing funding for the \nprogram from Federal, State and foundation sources.\n  Sonny was a graduate of Atlanta's Boy's High School and then Georgia \nTech, receiving his degree in textile engineering in 1934. Sonny played \nfreshman football for Georgia Tech, was on the student council and was \na member of several honor societies. Following college, he went to work \nin the textile industry until needed by the Navy from 1943 to 1945. \nFollowing this, he distinguished himself in the business world as a \npast president and partner with Atlanta's Kay Developers and later his \nown real estate development company, Kunian Enterprises.\n  In civic affairs, Mr. Kunian was active and held office in a number \nof organizations, including the Center for Rehabilitative Technology, \nInc., the Georgia Chapter of the Arthritis Foundation, the Atlanta \nSymphony Orchestra Association, the Southeastern Regional Board of the \nAnti-Defamation League, Families First, the American Jewish Committee, \nthe Georgia Council on Adult Literacy, the Southern Regional Education \nBoard and the National Jewish Welfare Board.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you join me in recognizing the impact Sonny \nmade on the world in which we live. He will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/04/senate-section/article/S5280-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5281-S5290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FAMILY FRIENDLY WORKPLACE ACT\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will now resume consideration \nof S. 4, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 4) to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \n     to provide to private sector employees the same opportunities \n     for time-and-a-half compensatory time off, biweekly work \n     programs, and flexible credit hour programs as Federal \n     employees currently enjoy to help balance the demands and \n     needs of work and family, to clarify the provisions relating \n     to exemptions of certain professionals from the minimum wage \n     and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n     1938, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Grassley amendment No. 253, to provide protections in \n     bankruptcy proceedings for claims relating to compensatory \n     time off and flexible work credit hours.\n       Grassley modified amendment No. 256, to apply to Congress \n     the same provisions relating to compensatory time off, \n     biweekly work programs, flexible credit hour programs, and \n     exemptions of certain professionals from the minimum wage and \n     overtime requirements as apply to private sector employees.\n       Gorton modified amendment No. 265, to prohibit coercion by \n     employers of certain public employees who are eligible for \n     compensatory time off under the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n     1938 and provide for additional remedies in a case of \n     coercion by such employers of such employees.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on the family friendly workplace bill \nitself, the comptime/flextime issue, I hope that we can come to an \nagreement on this. Senator Daschle has indicated he would like to work \nwith us on it. The President said during the election campaign and, in \nfact, 2 weeks ago, he would like to work with us on giving some \nflexibility to workers' schedules. I believe he has indicated that \nagain today. Senator Ashcroft has done such a magnificent job on this \nbill. In fact, I believe the President said flextime is very \nimportant--flexibility is very important. I wrote it down and gave a \ncopy of it to the Senator from Missouri.\n\n  So, we all agree that having a little option of taking your comptime \nin terms of higher pay or the option of it being some time off, that's \na good idea. We all agree, I think, that working spouses ought to have \na little flexibility in their schedules. That is who really benefits \nfrom the flextime portion of this bill.\n  Now, if there are questions or concerns about making sure that it is \nfair and there is no intimidation, it is truly voluntary, hey, let's \nwork that out. We ought to do that. We want those protections. We want \nthose guarantees. But I want somebody to explain to me how I can \nexplain to the hourly workers in my State that they should not have \nthese options even though Federal employees do. And, as a matter of \nfact, in truth, so do salaried employees. If they want a little time \noff, they take it off. But, no, not the hourly workers, not the blue \ncollar workers in my State, not the people out there pulling the load. \nThey don't even have this option.\n  Protect them, make sure that the law doesn't get out of control, that \nit's abused--let's do that. But to have this type of flexibility, to \nhave a more family friendly workplace, isn't that a worthwhile goal? \nCan't we do this?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts and I worked together on some bills \nthat he forced me to work with him on. I didn't particularly want to, \nbut we wound up doing it. We got health insurance reform last year, \nthanks to the good help of the Senator from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum. \nThis very day, an unbelievable achievement was signed by the President \nof the United States: IDEA, I-D-E-A, Individuals With Disabilities \nEducation Act. Last year we gave up in exhaustion. We couldn't get it \ndone. This year, because of a lot of good staff work, administration \ninput, Democrats, Republicans, all regions, all races, all ethnic \nbackgrounds, all degrees of philosophy, we came together on a bill that \nwill help education in America--not just for the disabled, but I \nbelieve all of our children will be better off because of this bill. We \ngot it done because we put aside our prejudices and our determinations \nthat we were going to be committed to this position or that position \nand we said we need results and we got results.\n  We need to do this on this legislation. Let's get started. Let's work \ntogether. If you have amendments, put them up. I would like them to be \ngermane. I would rather we not solve some irrelevant issue. Let's stick \nto the subject at hand. And I believe the American people would be the \nbeneficiaries.\n  So I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will vote for \nthis cloture, or if they don't, tell us how we can come together and \ngive this opportunity to working Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I was listening to the comments of our \nfriend and our majority leader with regard to the cooperative effort on \nthe IDEA legislation, and he has correctly characterized that. He \nhimself deserves great credit. This was worked out in a strong, \nbipartisan way.\n  I am hopeful that we can have that same kind of cooperative effort on \nour children's health insurance proposal, which Senator Hatch has \nintroduced and which I have cosponsored, which has such broad \nRepublican and Democratic support across the country and which I \nbelieve a majority of the Members of this body, Republican and \nDemocrat, support as well.\n  The Senator made a very eloquent statement about how we want to be \nfamily friendly. I would like to see some progress for the sons and \ndaughters of working families who are making $20,000 to $25,000. I \nwould like to see some progress for the single heads of households with \ntwo children who are unable to afford the premium for their health \ninsurance. Those Americans need to have what I would consider to be one \nof the most, if not the most important, family friendly protection, and \nthat is to make sure that their children can have the same healthy \nstart as do children of so many of the Members of this Congress and \nSenate.\n  So, I know that the next business before the Senate is the cloture \nmotion on S. 4. But I am very hopeful that we will find an opportunity \nto address this important proposal. The majority leader felt our \namendment on the budget was inconsistent with other terms in that \nagreement. Yet, I would say to my friend and colleague, it was \ninteresting yesterday when the House Members went down to see the \nPresident that they introduced a new concept, a medical savings \naccount, which Republicans and Democrats had agreed to last year on the \nKassebaum-Kennedy bill, for 750,000 people. And the Republicans also \nproposed a limitation on punitive damages to protect doctors, even \nthough we have some 50,000 Americans who die in hospitals every year \nfrom preventable injuries. Yet I didn't hear that that proposal was \npart of the budget deal.\n  So, I hope, as we move forward, we will be able to gain the attention \nof the majority leader on the issues of children's health. The majority \nleader knows very well the administration is\n\n[[Page S5282]]\n\ntrying to help children covered by Medicaid, who are the poorest of the \npoor. We commend that. The Rockefeller-Chafee proposal is a bipartisan \neffort to target resources to make sure those children who are eligible \nfor Medicaid will continue to be covered. We believe that proposal will \ncover about 3 million poor children. But we cannot forget the other 7.5 \nmillion children. Our proposal is paid for in its entirety--so we would \nnot interfere with the general outlines that have been agreed to in the \nbudget--with a cigarette tax, which has the added benefit of \ndiscouraging teenagers from smoking.\n  I know, when the Senator was talking about the areas where there has \nbeen cooperation, I want to commend him for the great leadership he \nprovided on IDEA. He also referenced the progress that was made last \nyear and commended Senator Kassebaum. I look forward this year, when we \npass the Hatch-Kennedy bill, to commending a similar bipartisan effort. \nI believe if we just had a little more favorable view from our majority \nleader, that proposal could go through here in incredibly rapid time.\n  But I see our leader on the floor at this time, so I will withhold \nfurther comments to permit him to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, let me commend the distinguished senior \nSenator from Massachusetts for his comments.\n  Let me say I completely associate myself with his remarks and \nappreciate his extraordinary leadership on children's health issues in \nparticular. I came to the floor just to respond to the distinguished \nmajority leader. I didn't hear all that he said, but it was reported to \nme. I know he made comment about the progress we are making on the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. I must say, I am pleased to hear \nmaybe some progress has been made.\n  We have been patient, and I think he would concede that we have been \npatient. And we have been very tolerant of the extraordinary delay that \nhas existed now for some time in moving this legislation forward. He \ntried, prior to the time of the Memorial Day recess, to negotiate some \nsettlement, as did the rest of us, and failed to find some way with \nwhich to resolve the differences.\n  The problem we have, though, Madam President, is that we continue to \nsend the message that even though people in the Dakotas and Minnesota \nare losing sleep, even though mayors and city councilmen and business \npeople and homeowners and farmers continue to be exasperated and \nfrustrated with the lack of progress here, it is business as usual on \nthe Senate floor. It is business as usual in the Congress. We send the \nmessage that it doesn't seem to matter how grave the circumstances, we \nare not going to change the way we are doing business here; we will \ncontinue to do business as usual.\n  So our message to them was that we don't care how long it takes, this \nCongress ought to stay here tonight, tomorrow, tomorrow night, the next \nnight until we get an agreement on this conference report, until we can \nfind some way to resolve these differences, until we can say to those \npeople without equivocation, we know it is not business as usual, we \nknow that we have to get something done, we know that you are hurting \nand we are going to respond. But we are not sending that message when \nwe adjourn, when we don't meet, when we don't make progress on any of \nthe contentious issues for which there has been disagreement now for \nweeks. When does it end? When do we break some new ground and move the \nbill on?\n  I am pleased, if the majority leader is accurate, with the report \nthat we could have some resolution to some of these issues this \nafternoon. At long last, we may be able to send the right message to \nthe people waiting now all this time. But there are 33 States \ndetrimentally affected, probably no States more detrimentally affected \nthan those States in the Midwest, Dakotas and Minnesota. So, clearly, \nsomething has to be done. I hope if we are not going to resolve the \nconference report this afternoon, the majority leader will allow us to \nstay in, will allow us to continue to address these issues, that we \nwill not accept business as usual, and that we can send as clear a \nmessage as possible that we understand how grave this situation is, and \nwe are going to respond just as effectively and as quickly and as \ncompletely as we possibly can. That is what the message ought to be.\n  We are going to have a compensation vote again this afternoon, a \ncomptime vote. I must say, I am disappointed. The majority leader \ntalked about it being a two-way street on the supplemental \nappropriations. I would like it to be a two-way street on comptime. I \nwould like the Republican leadership and our Republican colleagues to \ntake a good look at what we are suggesting as a way with which to \nresolve this impasse. That has not happened yet. Whether it is the \nsupplemental, comptime or any one of a number of issues, the only way \nwe can demonstrate this two-way street is if we can find some common \nground and work together. At least let's recognize today that we will \nnot leave, we will not adjourn, we will not pretend it is business as \nusual so long as we haven't resolved the outstanding differences on the \nsupplemental bill.\n  I urge the leader to do that, and I hope that he can work with us to \nensure that we send that message out to those who are detrimentally \naffected all across this country and are looking for some hope and some \nunderstanding of our appreciation of the seriousness of the problems \nthat they are facing. I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I join in the urging of our \ndistinguished leader in hopes that there can be some resolution to this \nenormous human tragedy in the Dakotas and in parts of the Midwest. \nMassachusetts is not affected, Madam President, but it was not long ago \nthat we had hurricanes that came across the Massachusetts coast, that \ntraveled through New England and brought devastation, hardship, and \nplight to many communities. Many New Englanders lost their homes, their \nbusinesses, and their property. And, when the hurricanes went through \nSouth Carolina, I remember the words of our friend and colleague, \nSenator Hollings, who spoke on that issue so passionately. And I \nremember how this institution responded so quickly. I think all of us \nremember the tragedies caused by the recent hurricanes in Florida. \nHomestead Air Force Base was devastated and many of the communities in \nthe surrounding areas were destroyed. And all of us must remember how \nwe in the Congress reacted.\n  Every American has been touched by what has happened in the Midwest. \nWhen the Senator from South Dakota speaks about this issue, as the \nSenator from Minnesota did yesterday, and the Senators from North \nDakota did in the past few days, they are really speaking for all \nAmericans. This is not just a regional issue, it is a national issue, \nand it is of national importance. I think all of us who have watched \nthe courage and the strength of those families as they have faced this \nextraordinary human tragedy are challenged to say why not now? Why not \ntake the action now? This is special. It is unique. It is a crisis. It \nis affecting children. It is affecting families. It is affecting \nelderly people. It is affecting them in many different ways, and we \nshould be able to respond.\n  I commend our colleagues from those areas, who know it best, for \ntheir very constructive recommendations. We have given them assurances \nfrom all parts of the country that we stand behind them. As we are \nabout to use the last of the time before the cloture vote, I join with \nthe Democratic leader in being troubled by the earlier statement that \nwe would not see any further action on this measure today. I was unable \nto speak on this issue yesterday. We have other Members on the floor \nwho want to address the Senate on S. 4, but I see the Senator from \nSouth Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will be very brief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me just thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his \nwords of support. As he has indicated, even though perhaps it is the \nupper Midwest that is most detrimentally affected, States all over the \ncountry are affected, even in those areas where there hasn't been a \ndisaster, as in the State of Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S5283]]\n\n  The Senator speaks eloquently about the degree of support and \nsensitivity that we find across the country for the plight that we have \nin the Dakotas and Minnesota, particularly. Let me just say, we have \nhad a remarkable degree of response within our caucus. Virtually every \nSenator has indicated they would be willing to stay tonight and speak \nfor a period of time about the circumstances in their State or the \ncircumstances involving the legislation. Every Senator has expressed a \nwillingness to come to the floor, whether it is 2 or 3 or 5 o'clock in \nthe morning. They have indicated a willingness to be here.\n  Let me thank all of my colleagues for their expressions of interest \nand participation and my hope that we can participate in a meaningful \nway, not in a controversial or confrontational way necessarily, but \nsimply providing the rest of the country a better opportunity to \nunderstand the extraordinary situation that we are facing and the need \nfor us to respond as quickly as possible, given this late date.\n  So I thank my colleagues. I hope that we get \nRepublican participation. I certainly hope that this notion that we are \ngoing to adjourn rather than to have a good debate is nothing but a \nfalse rumor and that we will have the opportunity to participate in \nthat colloquy tonight. I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I say to my friend and colleague from \nSouth Dakota that churches all over Massachusetts last Sunday had \ncollections for people in the Dakotas. This is illustrative of the \nfeeling all over this country.\n  Madam President, how has the time been allocated and what remains \nbetween the Senators?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 13 minutes; \nthe Senator from Missouri has 23 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will take 2 minutes, and then I will yield to our \ncolleagues.\n  On the issue, Madam President, of the so-called Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act, I believe it is basically a cruel hoax on American \nworkers. It is really a one-sided bill that provides maximum \nflexibility for employers and no flexibility for employees. It deserves \nno support from any Senator. It received none from any Democrat on the \nfirst cloture vote 3 weeks ago. In fact, two Republicans broke with \ntheir party to oppose cloture, and I encourage my colleagues to oppose \ncloture again today.\n  Some have suggested that with this second cloture vote, the \nRepublican proponents of S. 4 are simply playing out an elaborate \ncharade. By forcing further debate on S. 4 in this way, they hope that \nthe Ballenger bill in the House will seem less extreme.\n  That strategy will fail. Less extreme is still extreme. Our \nDemocratic alternative--and I pay tribute to Senator Baucus, Senator \nLandrieu, and Senator Kerrey for the development of that alternative--\nremedies the gross defects of both the Ashcroft Senate bill and the \nBallenger House bill. It is a realistic approach to comptime that is \nnot slanted in favor of employers and against employees. It is the only \ncomptime bill that is worth the name and it deserves to pass.\n  The Democratic alternative is superior in many ways. First, it \nprotects the 40-hour week, while the Ashcroft bill abolishes that \nfundamental principle.\n  Second, our alternative forbids discrimination against workers who \nneed overtime pay and cannot afford to take the time off instead. The \nAshcroft bill permits employers to assign all the overtime work to \nemployees who will accept comptime.\n  Third, the Democratic alternative guarantees employees the right to \nuse comptime when they need it the most. That is the key element. The \nemployees have the right, that is the key in any evaluation of which \nbill deserves support. The alternative provides that the employees have \nthe right to use the time when they need it. The Ashcroft bill does not \ngive employees a right to use the comptime even in the most serious \nfamily or medical emergencies.\n  Finally, the Democratic alternative imposes no pay cut on working \nfamilies, while the Ashcroft bill would reduce workers' wages \nsubstantially.\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture. The \nAshcroft paycheck reduction act does nothing for working women. It does \nnothing for working men. It does nothing for working families. It \nshould be rejected out of hand, and I urge my colleagues to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Landrieu.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Three minutes is just fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Madam President. To my distinguished \ncolleague from Massachusetts who has been such a strong and solid voice \nfor working families and working people throughout this country, I \nappreciate his help on this issue.\n  I am here today with my colleagues, Senator Baucus and Senator \nKerrey, to offer some thoughts as to how we can make this particular \nbill more meaningful to working families.\n  There is an architect, Bill McCuen, in South Carolina who is now \nrunning for Congress. He recently changed his political affiliation \nfrom the GOP to the Democratic Party. Mr. McCuen has suggested that the \nnational GOP is ``substituting rhetoric for wisdom and * * * building \nwalls instead of opening windows.'' With all due respect to my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, I have concluded that Mr. \nMcCuen's analysis is applicable in this instance. Perhaps he has had an \nopportunity to study S. 4.\n  This bill, in its current form, is not about families nor is it \nfriendly. The issue before us today is about workplace fairness. The \nbill is harmful to families in its current form. Our distinguished \nmajority leader says S. 4 provides much-needed flexibility to workers. \nBut Madam President, this measure is not about giving flexibility to \nworkers; this bill is about flexibility only to employers or bosses. \nThe 40-hour work week and the protections it affords have been in place \nsince 1938. Under S. 4, these protections are clearly abolished. I \nbelieve that as Members of this body we have a real obligation to \ncreate truly family-friendly legislation as opposed to the proposal \nbeing offered by the majority.\n  There has also been a lot said Madam President about this bill \nhelping women who are now working more than ever before. Today, 60 \npercent of mothers with young children are in the workplace.\n  This bill does not offer any relief for mothers to spend more time \nwith their children or to meet necessary family obligations.\n  Madam President, this bill neither makes for a better workplace nor \nis it family friendly. This legislation is merely a comptime scheme \nthat will hurt the hard-working families of America--it will cut their \npay, decrease their benefits and pensions, and threaten their long-term \nplans.\n  It will take decisions that should be made by a worker and give them \nto an employer and it abolishes a standard that this Nation has abided \nby for the last 60 years--the 40-hour work week.\n  Madam President, my Democratic colleagues want real flexibility and \nchoice that will protect the working families of this country. We \nDemocrats understand and support the desire employees have for more \nflexibility between work and family. Democrats fought for an increase \nin the minimum wage and the Family and Medical Leave Act so that \nworkers would not have to choose between serving their family and \nserving their employer. Between taking their child to the doctor or \ngetting to work on time.\n  However, we also recognize that we need to have innovative \narrangements in the workplace so that both employers and employees can \nbe sure that their basic interests are protected. Madam President, the \nBaucus-Kerrey-Landrieu alternative would provide this real flexibility \nto working families because: Employees could decide when to accept \novertime pay and when to accept comp time; employees could decide when \nto use their comptime; health and pension benefits for workers would be \nprotected; and the 40-hour work week would be preserved.\n  Madam President, the legislation that my distinguished Republican \ncolleagues have introduced is wrong for working families and would be \nharmful\n\n[[Page S5284]]\n\nto the continued economic success of this Nation because it does not \noffer workers any flexibility in meeting their obligations to their \nfamilies and fulfilling their duties to their employers.\n  Instead, S. 4 gives employees less control over both their time and \ntheir paychecks. Critical decisions that affect time spent at work, \ntime spent at home, vacation, sick leave, and compensation are all in \nthe hands of the employer instead of where they belong--with the \nemployee.\n  S. 4 undermines the 60-year tradition of the 40-hour work week--a \ntradition that has helped build this Nation into the world's leading \neconomy. This bill, as it stands, would create an 80-hour work period \nbefore an employee could earn overtime. Workplaces have been governed \nby the principle that asking employees to work more than 40 hours would \nbe a serious infringement on their personal lives--what working parent \nwould want to have even less time with their children than they have \nnow?\n  Under the bill offered by my distinguished colleague from Missouri, \nemployees would make less money and have less choice. Hours of comptime \nused would be counted as hours worked. This means that an employee who \nused 5 hours of comptime on Monday to take care of a sick child at home \ncould be forced to work on a Saturday or Sunday to make up the hours \nbut would not be paid overtime.\n  Furthermore, Madam President, the health and retirement benefits of \nmany employees are linked to the number of hours they work so their \nbenefits could be slashed under S. 4. Also, nothing in this bill would \nprevent an employer from substituting an existing paid leave plan, such \nas vacation or sick leave, with comptime. Employees could be forced to \nwork overtime and choose comptime if they wanted a vacation or needed \nsick leave.\n  The bill offered by my friend from Missouri is also unrealistic, \nemployees couldn't really take advantage of comptime when they needed \nit. Employers could deny an employee's request to use comptime if the \nemployer could claim that the business would be unduly disrupted--\nregardless of why the employee needed the time off. This bill forces \nemployees to take a chance that they may be able to take time off when \nit is as valuable to them as overtime pay.\n  For example, Madam President, take an employee who wants to chaperone \nher daughter's fourth grade class on a field trip. She chooses to \naccept comptime for overtime hours worked in order to earn enough paid \ntime off to spend that time with her child and her classmates. Her \nemployer agrees. But when it comes time for the field trip, after the \nemployee has already worked enough overtime to account for any time \noff, the employer could claim that the employee's absence for the trip \nwould unduly disrupt the business and then justifiably, under this \nbill, replace the time off with overtime pay. How much money could \nreplace that field trip--the time off that the mother earned and worked \nfor?\n  Would it be enough to pay for the nonrefundable cost of the trip?\n  Would it be enough to make a child forget about a lost chance to \nspend quality time with a parent?\n  Would it be enough to make up for the inconvenience that the school \nwould have in getting another chaperone?\n  Madam President, I believe that, at that point, the overtime pay just \nisn't enough.\n  Madam President, public employees have long had protections that \nprivate sector workers do not enjoy. For example, Federal workers can \nonly be fired for just cause under the Civil Service system. \nAlternative work schedules like comptime and flextime went into effect \nfor Federal employees as a 3-year experiment in 1978. They were \nextended in 1982 and made permanent in 1985. In all cases, employees \nmay elect but cannot be compelled to accept comptime in lieu of \novertime pay.\n  Madam President, I agree with my distinguished colleague from \nMissouri that private sector workers should have greater flexibility \nand I commend Senator Ashcroft for his honest effort on behalf of the \npeople of his State and the country. However, S. 4 does not provide \nworkers the flexibility my Republicans colleagues are looking for. The \nBaucus-Kerrey-Landrieu substitute, though, does.\n  Our measure, a meaningful substitute to S. 4, protects working \nfamilies by providing: That employers cannot discriminate in offering \ncomptime or overtime pay; employees could use comptime for any purpose, \nas long as they give their employers at least 2 weeks prior notice; \ncomptime could be used with less notice if the business would not be \nunduly disrupted; overtime for over 40 hours worked in 1 week would be \npreserved, maintaining the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act; employers \nwould be prohibited from intimidating, threatening, or coercing \nemployees into participating in a biweekly flexible credit hour \nprogram; comptime is treated as hours worked in calculating retirement \nand health benefits; comptime could not be used to replace or \nsubstitute for vacation or sick leave plans; and construction, garment, \nand other seasonal workers would be exempt.\n  Madam President, S. 4 is a total sham. It is not friendly toward \nworking families. Employers, not employees, maintain the ultimate \ncontrol over use of comptime earned under this bill.\n  The unfairness of this bill is further borne out by the fact that \nduring the Labor Committee markup of S. 4, the majority refused to \nprovide workers real choices in the workplace by rejecting an amendment \nthat would have ensured that employees could take compensatory time for \nany of the reasons currently covered under the Family and Medical Leave \nAct such as to take care of an ill parent if the absence of such \nworkers would not cause ``substantial and grievous injury to the \noperation of the employer.''\n  Madam President, the Baucus-Kerrey-Landrieu substitute gives real \nflexibility and protection to working women and their families but, \nmost importantly, it allows both employers and employees to work \ntogether to create the right kind of cooperation in the workplace while \nat the same time allowing working families to choose if and when and \nhow they take and use comptime. I urge my colleagues to support and \nadopt this substitute.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, 56 percent of hourly workers are women, nearly 60 \npercent of those earning minimum wage are women, more than 80 percent \nof overtime recipients have annual earnings of less than $28,000; and \n61 percent earn $20,000 per year or less.\n  Working women need their overtime pay. They need flexibility but it \nneeds to be the choice of the workers, not the employers.\n  Finally, I would like to say that I believe most employers in this \ncountry want a bill that is fair both to their businesses and to their \nworkers.\n  I reach across the aisle to my colleagues and say: Let us work toward \na compromise that establishes real comptime for working families in \nAmerica. Let us substitute wisdom for rhetoric. Let us open windows \ninstead of building walls as we work to create a policy that will help \nall Americans in the workplace.\n  I thank the Senator for the additional time, and yield to Senator \nBaucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor \nand controls the time, unless the Senator from Missouri seeks \nrecognition.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Four minutes?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Five?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Five.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you, Madam President. I also thank my good friend \nand colleague from Massachusetts.\n  Madam President, I rise today in very firm opposition to the cloture \nmotion on S. 4, the so-called Family Friendly Workplace Act, sponsored \nby my colleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft. Why do I do so? In \nspeaking against cloture, I do not wish to convey that I oppose the \nidea of comptime. Quite the contrary, comptime is an idea whose time \nhas come. Indeed, Federal workers get comptime. I think that other \nemployees should also get comptime.\n  We all hear from people in our home States--I know you do, Madam \nPresident--we all do--how pressed people\n\n[[Page S5285]]\n\nare, particularly working moms, pressed for time, and do not have the \ntime to keep their job as well as take their children to Babe Ruth \nballgames or to parent-teacher conferences, and are very pressed for \ntime. It only makes sense, Madam President, that employees, women and \nmen on the job, get a little more flexibility so they can take time off \nto be with their family, with their children.\n  It is not an easy task that parents have these days. Comptime would \nlet working parents balance the needs of their families with the \ndemands of their jobs. I believe it is only fair that we give America's \nfamilies that tool.\n  Unfortunately, the bill we are now debating, the so-called Family \nFriendly Workplace Act, fails to live up to its name. It is not family \nfriendly at all. Why do I say that? First of all, the bill does not \ngive workers the choice they need to make comptime effective. Under \nthis bill, the employer can decide when a worker takes time off, not \nthe employee. That means there is no guarantee that a parent would have \ntime off when he or she needs it the most. That completely undermines \nthe very concept of comptime.\n  In addition, this bill dismantles two important safeguards that are \nfundamental to protecting the rights of workers.\n  First, the bill eliminates the 40-hour workweek and replaces that \ntime-honored tradition with an 80-hour, 2-week system, which means, \nunder their bill, a worker who works 60 hours in 1 week may not be \nentitled to 1 minute of overtime.\n  Second, this legislation would allow an employer to discriminate \nagainst a worker who chooses to take their overtime in the form of pay. \nWhy? Because by assigning overtime only to workers who they know will \ntake their accrued time in the form of vacation, the employer can save \nsome money. But the worker gets pinched.\n  Both of these changes will result in a pay cut for people who punch \nthe clock. Lots of families depend on that extra money to make ends \nmeet. We cannot risk taking it away from them.\n  So that is why I rise in opposition to the cloture motion today, \nMadam President. But, as I said earlier, I am not speaking today \nagainst the idea of comptime. I like comptime. That is why I have \noffered a substitute amendment joined by Senators Kerrey and Landrieu. \nWe will offer that substitute at the appropriate time. I think our bill \ngives workers the right kind of comptime.\n  We offer employees comptime where they can choose when they take \ntheir own time off, comptime where they can take pay or time off \nwithout worrying about discrimination from their employers, and \ncomptime that preserves the 40-hour workweek.\n  Our amendment, I think, is clear. It is more reasonable and it is a \nbetter choice. I believe, Madam President, that when Senators look at \nboth choices, the substitute that I plan to offer, as well as the \ncurrent bill, they will realize that the better approach is the \napproach that we are suggesting.\n  Madam President, the President has indicated that he would veto the \ncurrent bill but he would sign the bill that we will be offering at the \nappropriate moment. I urge my colleagues again to vote against cloture.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Madam President, I oppose S. 4, the so-called \nFamily Friendly Workplace Act, for the basic reason that it is not \nfamily friendly. This legislation, as written, will disrupt family \nschedules, decrease family incomes, and make it harder for working \nfamilies to balance the competing needs of work and family.\n  S. 4 will serve to decrease family incomes by eliminating overtime \npay for many workers. Under S. 4, an employer has the ability to select \nwhich worker is given extra hours to work. An employee who wants \novertime pay instead of comptime may be passed over for the additional, \nand often needed, extra work. The lost income can mean a pay cut of up \nto 15 percent for many families.\n  In this country, more than 80 percent of overtime recipients earn \nless than $28,000 a year and 44 percent of those who count on overtime \nearn as little as $16,000 a year or less. These are hard working \nmothers and fathers, willing to work extra hours to help support the \nfamily. These are not families that can afford a pay cut. S. 4 has been \ncalled the paycheck reduction act exactly because these families will \nbe forced to lose the extra work or to take comptime in lieu of \novertime.\n  S. 4 will interfere with the carefully crafted schedules of families \nstruggling to work and raise children for several reasons. First, \nemployers are given enormous control over how, when, and if workers can \nearn overtime or comptime. Workers who are given the option to choose \ncomptime by their employer and do so, cannot necessarily use the \ncomptime when they want. Employers can deny a comptime request if it \nwould unduly disrupt business. There is no consideration of the \nimportance or necessity of the time off for the family. If a family \nsacrifices to earn comptime, there is no guarantee that they will ever \nbe able to use it.\n  S. 4 would eliminate the 40 hour work week for many hourly workers. \nUnder this legislation an employee could be asked to work 65 hours one \nweek and 15 hours the next. In the next 2-week period, the employee \ncould be given a schedule of 23 hours one week and 57 hours the next. \nThis would wreak havoc on the home life of employees, particularly ones \nwith children at home.\n  Under S. 4, employers are given flexibility--the flexibility to \nchange workers' schedules to meet the demands of the factory or office. \nThis is flexibility in only one direction. A real comptime bill would \nprovide workers with the flexibility to change their schedules to meet \nthe demands of the home and the family.\n  The majority of hourly workers are women and many of these women are \nalready struggling with the issue of working and raising a family. The \nissue of child care is particularly relevant. Constantly fluctuating \nwork hours make it difficult to find good child care. The interests of \nchildren, who may be home alone more now because of the loss of \nschedule certainty, are denied here. Flexibility in only one direction \ncan be coercion, and that is not the balance we should strive to \nachieve.\n  Six organizations representing working women throughout America are \nopposing S. 4, precisely because this bill is so hard on working women; \n9-to-5--the National Association of Working Women, the American Nurses \nAssociation, the Business and Professional Women, the National Council \nof Jewish Women, the National Women's Law Center, and the Women's Legal \nDefense Fund are all on record as opposing this legislation, because \nthey ``believe passage of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act, \nfails to offer real flexibility to the working women it purports to \nhelp *  *  *''\n  I support making workplaces more family friendly. Unfortunately, that \nis not what S. 4, does. I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture \nand against S. 4. This legislation will be bad for workers, bad for \nwomen, bad for children, and bad for families. Let us make the 105th \nCongress a family friendly Congress by opposing S. 4.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about S. 4, the \nFamily Friendly Workplace Act of 1997 and the alternative that has been \noffered by my friends and colleagues, Senators Baucus, Kerrey and \nLandrieu.\n  Mr. President, while the goals embodied in S. 4 may, on the surface, \nappear to be family friendly, the legislation passed by the Labor \nCommittee is decidedly worker unfriendly.\n  Unlike the bill recently passed by the House, S. 4 is not limited to \nthe issue of compensatory time. Instead it includes provisions related \nto flexible scheduling and flexible credit hours that repeal the 40-\nhour workweek, which has been the bulwark of employee protection for \nalmost 60 years, and turn the purported choice for employees that \nsupporters claim S. 4 provides into no real choice at all.\n  S. 4 provides compensatory time to employees in lieu of time-and-a-\nhalf. While this is an idea that resonates with a great number of \npeople, I believe the compensatory time provision of S. 4 does not \nprovide sufficient autonomy to employees in selecting compensatory time \nin lieu of overtime and that many employees will be forced to take the \noption of flextime.\n  By allowing employers to choose which of the three options to offer, \ncompensatory time, flexible scheduling, or flexible credit hours, it is \ninevitable that they will offer either the\n\n[[Page S5286]]\n\nflexible 80 hour work schedule or flexible credit-hour program.\n  That is because, unlike comptime which is in lieu of overtime and \ntherefore must be exchanged for 1\\1/2\\ hours off, the flexible schedule \noptions require only a one-to-one exchange. Any employer looking at his \nbottom line will make the choice for the employees and the choice will \nbe flextime over overtime or comptime. The obvious solution to this is \nto do what the House did and pass a comptime only bill, one that \nincludes the protections for workers contained in the Baucus-Kerrey-\nLandrieu alternative.\n  S. 4 does not adequately protect employees' rights to choose \ncomptime, to use it when they want and to be free from discrimination \nagainst employees who choose not to agree to take comptime or work \nflexible schedules. As written, S. 4 provides that an employee who \nrequests the use of comptime off shall be permitted to use the time so \nlong as it does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer.\n  The alternative offered by my friends and colleagues, Senators \nBaucus, Kerrey and Landrieu, would allow an employee to take banked \ncomp after giving 2 weeks notice so long as it will not cause grievous \ninjury to the employer, as well as for qualifying Family and Medical \nLeave Act purposes. It is important to remember that the banked hours \nare hours that the employee has earned. She should have control over \nwhen she uses them and the employer should have to meet a high standard \nfor denying the request of employees to take the earned hours.\n  While S. 4 does not provide sufficient protection for vulnerable \nsectors of the economy such as garment and agricultural workers, the \nBaucus-Kerrey-Landrieu proposal does. It exempts part-time and garment \nindustry workers, and provides the Secretary of Labor with authority to \nexempt other vulnerable categories of employees if she determines there \nis a pattern of violations of the act or to ensure that employees \nreceive the compensation they have earned. These are important \nprotections that should be included in any compensatory time bill we \nconsider.\n\n  S. 4 allows too many comptime hours to be ``banked'' and does not \nsufficiently protect those hours in the event of bankruptcy. Senator \nBaucus' alternative allows 80 hours to be banked and does protect those \nhours in bankruptcy. It is interesting to note, that even the House-\npassed bill allows only 160 hours to be banked.\n  The Baucus-Kerrey-Landrieu also provides significant penalties for \nemployers who violate it's provisions by discharging or otherwise \ndiscriminating against employees who choose not to take comptime in \nlieu of overtime.\n  Another important distinction between S. 4 and the Baucus-Kerrey-\nLandrieu alternative is that S. 4 does not sunset the provisions \nrelating to either comp or flex time. Senator Baucus' proposal sunsets \nthe provisions relating to compensatory time after 4 years and requires \na Presidential commission to study the impact of the compensatory time \nprovisions. Mr. President, even the House comptime bill sunsets after 5 \nyears. This is yet another reasonable and sensible change to S. 4 that \nwe should adopt and that will go a long way toward making S. 4 a truly \nworker-friendly bill.\n  Briefly, with regard to flexible credit hours and flexible \nscheduling, I believe these provisions are simply unnecessary and will \nbe harmful to workers if enacted. Employers currently have a wide range \nof options with regard to offering flexible scheduling options to \nemployees within the context of the 40-hour workweek. Employees can, \nfor example, work 4, 10-hour days and be allowed to take the fifth day \noff. What the flexible scheduling and flexible credit-hour provisions \nof this bill do instead is present employees with a Hobson choice; \neither take the flexible credit hour or flexible scheduling option or \nforgo the chance to earn overtime. Simply put, S. 4 does away with the \n40-hour workweek without providing anything for employees except a \nsmaller paycheck. Despite claims to the contrary about the support for \nthe idea of flexible scheduling, I sincerely doubt that American \nworkers want to give up the 40-hour workweek in exchange for a \npotential 80-hour workweek.\n  Mr. President, I believe that many American workers could benefit \nfrom the option of choosing compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay. \nAs many have said during debate on this measure, the workplace has \nchanged significantly since enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act. \nThe American family has changed too. While many families might like to \nbe able to take extra time to spend with their children or on other \nfamily matters, I don't believe that they would be willing to do so \nunder the guise of S. 4.\n  As with many bills that come before the Senate, S. 4 embodies \nprinciples that both Democrats and Republicans can support. I hope that \nwe will be able to do the right thing when it comes to S. 4 and limit \nthe bill's scope to compensatory time and include the additional, \nneeded protections for American families and workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Parliamentary inquiry. Am I correct that we have our 30 \nminutes and then the Senator from Missouri has the second 30 minutes? \nUsually under a cloture motion, the time is evenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the agreement last night, the order was \nthat the Senator from Massachusetts would have the first period of time \nfollowed by the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I will yield myself the final minute \nand 45 seconds. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes and fifty seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Madam President, I want to just end up this debate by talking about \nwomen in our work force.\n  Madam President, 38 percent of hourly workers earning overtime pay \nare women; 11.6 million women work over 40 hours each week. This is 22 \npercent of all working women. Why do they work more than 40 hours a \nweek? Because they need the overtime pay.\n  And 6.2 million women work over 48 hours a week each week. This is 12 \npercent of all working women. Why? Because they need the overtime. They \nneed the pay.\n  And 3.6 million multiple job holders are women. This is 47 percent of \nall job holders. More women are getting second jobs. Why? Because they \nneed the overtime pay.\n  And 1.8 million women hold two or more jobs and work over 44 hours \neach week. This is half of all women with two or more jobs. Why? \nBecause they need the money.\n  The Ashcroft proposal abolishes the 40-hour week. Those women would \nnot get the overtime because this bill abolishes the 40-hour week.\n  Under the Ashcroft proposal, the decision about whether employees \nwill be able to take the time off is left to the employer. This is not \nthe case under the Landrieu and Baucus and Kerrey bill, where the \nemployee makes the decision. This is not the case under the Murray \namendment, where the employee makes the decision whether to take a \nmaximum of 24 hours over the course of the year. That amendment was \ndefeated in our committee. Why? Because the employee makes the \ndecision.\n  This bill is a pay reduction act for those women. That is why every \nwomen's organization that has fought for economic opportunity and \nprogress for women--whether it be the minimum wage, the day-care \nprogram, pay equity, right across the board--every women's organization \nhas condemned this bill because of what it would mean for working \nwomen.\n  Madam President, I hope that the cloture vote will fail. This bill \ndoes not deserve the support of this body. We have an alternative that \nwill address those issues. And with the leadership of Senators \nLandrieu, Baucus, and Kerrey, that is the way we should go.\n  I yield the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished majority whip, \nSenator Nickles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, if my colleagues from Massachusetts and \nLouisiana and Montana wish to offer a substitute, they can vote for \ncloture. We can consider their amendment. I am happy to vote on their \namendment. If other Senators have different ideas, we would like to get \nto the bill. Yet,\n\n[[Page S5287]]\n\nour colleagues on the other side, they say, ``We've got amendments,'' \nbut they do not let us vote on the amendments.\n  They want to filibuster. They want to talk. But they do not want to \nvote. We want to vote. We want to give all Americans the same rights \nthat we give Federal employees.\n  If flextime is so bad, why don't my colleagues introduce a resolution \nor amendment to stop flextime for Federal employees? They can offer \nthat as an amendment on this bill. Let us find out. Federal employees \nhappen to like flextime. It works. It has not been abused. It is not \nemployer-only. If my colleagues on the other side read the bill, it \nsays ``mutually agreeable.'' It does not say the employer has the sole \ndecision or the employee has the sole decision. It says ``mutually \nagreeable.'' That is in the bill.\n\n  It works for Federal employees. Why don't we make it available for \neverybody else in America? Because my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle do not trust Americans? They do not trust businesspeople? \nThey do not trust employees to be able to make this decision?\n  The bill allows people, if they try comptime and they do not like it \nand they accumulate some hours and they did not use it, they can cash \nout. The employer has to pay. That is not optional. If the employee \nwants out and says, ``Hey, I don't like it. I want to go back to the \nold time where I can be paid overtime, be paid instead of comptime,'' \nthey can be paid.\n  Our colleagues do not trust employees to be able to make that \ndecision. They do not want to give them the choice to be able to say, \n``Wait a minute. I have something coming up next week. I would like to \nwork an extra hour, maybe every night for 5 days so I can have Friday \nafternoon off with my kids.'' They do not trust American women and \nAmerican men to be able to make that kind of decision.\n  They are saying they are going to deny that kind of decision. That is \nwhat they are doing by filibustering this bill. They are saying to all \nAmericans, we think you should not be able to make that decision. We \nare going to preempt you from making that decision.\n  I think that is a serious mistake. They do not trust American \ncitizens, employers and employees, to be able to work out what is \nmutually agreeable. They are not going to allow employees, women or \nmen, to be able to work, say, 9 hours a day for 8 or 9 days, and be \nable to take off every other Friday.\n  Why won't they let them do that? Why don't we give Americans that \nopportunity to have that choice, have that option? We are not mandating \nit. We are trying to give them that option.\n  So I want to compliment my colleague from Missouri. I ask unanimous \nconsent for an additional minute, or ask my colleague for an additional \nminute.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield the Senator 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want to compliment my colleague from the State of \nMissouri who has given great leadership on this issue to give all \nAmericans the same choice and options that we give Federal employees. I \ncannot believe my colleagues on the other side will not allow us to go \nforward with this bill. They can filibuster it. They may kill it. They \nmay kill the whole darn thing. But I think they ought to be ashamed. If \nthey want to vote for the Baucus amendment, let us vote for cloture. \nThe Baucus amendment would be in order. Let us vote on it.\n  Then for my colleague to say this is against working women, that is \nhogwash. Working Women magazine and Working Mother magazine both \nendorse this bill. This bill, particularly the flextime provision, is \nvery positive for working women.\n  I compliment my colleague and urge all of my colleagues to vote for \ncloture so we can help the working men and women of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n4 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I am pleased to co-sponsor the Family \nFriendly Workforce Act. I have always had a long-standing interest in \nhelping workers balance the competing interests of work and family.\n  Ten years ago, I introduced the Federal Employee Leave Act of 1987. \nThis act established a type of leave sharing in which employees could \ndonate some of their annual leave to a coworker who faced a personal \nemergency, but who lacked sufficient leave to attend to the problem. \nThe Leave Act was good for workers because it provided an innovative \nway for employees to balance work and family when faced with a serious \nor unexpected illness.\n  I now stand before you co-sponsoring another bill which will provide \nrelief to American workers when it comes to balancing work and family. \nThe Family Friendly Workplace Act is not only good for American \nworkers, but it is particularly good for women and children.\n  This bill recognizes that the American workforce is changing--\nespecially for women. The number of women in the workplace has \nincreased. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women now \naccount for 46 percent of the labor force. Over 67 percent of women \nwith children under the age of 6 are working. That is compared with \nonly 10 percent of working women 50 years ago. Moreover, 81 percent of \nAmerican women will be in the work force, by the year 2000.\n  While the numbers of women in the workplace have changed, one thing \nthat has remained constant is the difficulty in balancing family and \ncareer. Ask any working parent, particularly mothers, and they will \ntell you that there are never enough hours in the day when it comes to \nthe children. We all know the countless women who spend hours \nchauffeuring their children from one event to another. There are always \nschool plays, baseball games, dance recitals, PTA meetings, Boy Scout \nand Girl Scout meetings, doctors visits, school field trips, dental \nappointments--all in need of a parent's company. This list does not \neven cover household errands like: Going grocery shopping, picking up \nthe dry-cleaning, running to the pharmacy to get medicine for a sick \nchild, or picking up the children from daycare.\n  It is about time for the American workplace to recognize the need for \nworking parents to have flexibility in their work schedules. I think \nthe 58.2 million working women of America want this too. I also think \nthe millions of children currently in daycare deserve to spend more \nquality time with their mothers.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the No. 1 issue women want \nto bring to the President's attention is the difficulty of balancing \nwork and family obligations. This is not surprising considering that \nsince 1965, time spent with children has dropped 40 percent.\n  The Family Friendly Workplace Act is good for working mothers because \nit provides choice and flexibility. For women who work overtime, this \nbill would allow them to choose time-off or comptime instead of \nreceiving pay for their overtime work. For example, an employee could \naccrue up to 240 hours of comptime which could be used to attend a \nchild's soccer game or school play.\n  For the majority of women who do not work overtime, this bill \nprovides for flextime in the form of biweekly work schedules and \nflexible credit hours. With biweekly work schedules, a mother could \nschedule 80 hours over a 2-week period in a way that would let her have \nevery other Friday off to spend time with her children.\n  With flexible credit hours, a working mom could accumulate up to 50 \nhours of paid time-off. If her child gets sick, she could then use some \nof her banked hours to stay home and care for the child. The idea of \nflexible work schedules is what women want--81 percent of women support \nmore flexible work schedules like those this legislation would make \npossible.\n  I support this bill because it is voluntary. Nothing in the bill \nrequires employees to adjust their work schedules. Nothing in the bill \nrequires employers to implement comptime or flexible hour programs. \nInstead, this legislation encourages employees and employers to work \ntogether. There are tough penalties in the bill to prevent\n\n[[Page S5288]]\n\nemployers from coercing or intimidating employees. An employer cannot \nforce a worker to take comptime instead of paid overtime.\n  In listening to the debate on the floor, I am appalled by the \nopposition to this bill by the Democrats and the labor unions.\n  Labor unions of the United States have a problem with flextime. \nFrankly, if we end this debate with American women asking: What are the \nlabor unions doing in this mess? Why are they interfering?--I am \nafraid, in the final analysis, the labor unions will find out they were \nworking for the wrong cause.\n  I do not understand what is wrong with giving parents flexibility in \nthe workplace to spend more quality time with their children. I also \nfail to see why my Democratic colleagues are against giving working \nwomen in the private sector the same luxury of work flexibility that \nwomen in the public sector have. Isn't it about time that the \nflexibility afforded to Federal employees for almost 20 years now be \nextended to the 80 million private sector employees in this country \nwith this bill?\n  This bill is long overdue. It clearly makes it easier for the working \nmother to juggle the ever-challenging responsibilities of motherhood \nand work. I think it is high time for flexibility and fairness in the \nworkplace. What is good enough for Federal employees is also good \nenough for private sector employees.\n  Madam President, these remarks are addressed to the Democrats on the \nother side of the aisle. It was not long ago that they took a great \ndeal of pride in saying they were for family and medical leave. \nEverybody knows what family leave is. It is an effort to get businesses \nto give people time off when there is a family illness or when they \nneed time off because something very serious has happened.\n  Frankly, family leave versus flextime is like an ant versus an \nelephant. Now, I do not know why I chose elephant, but in this case it \nis good, because the Republicans are for the real--real--family time.\n  Plain and simple, this bill modernizes the labor laws of America to \nmeet the challenges of our day. There are no recessions. There is no \ndepression. What we have is five times as many women working and \nraising children, and they need flexible time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Missouri for \nthe great job he has done.\n  In survey after survey, the American people endorse the ideas and the \nbasic principles of this bill. More flexibility in the workplace, \nletting workers choose how they want to be compensated for overtime, \nletting workers decide what they need most--time with their family, \ntime to study, time to relax; or time-and-a-half overtime pay to meet \ntheir financial obligations.\n  Madam President, an article in the Cincinnati Enquirer, I think, \nsummarized it very well. ``A little flexibility would be a godsend to \ngood workers who also want to be good parents.'' The article went on to \nsay, ``It could benefit employers, too, who'd find it easier to recruit \nand retain productive workers.''\n  President Clinton has stated, ``We should pass a flextime law that \nallows employees to take overtime pay in money or in time off, \ndepending on what is better for their family.''\n  Clearly, what we have here are the makings of a national consensus. I \nbelieve it would be a terrible shame if we let this popular and this \nnecessary legislation fall victim to partisan wrangling here on the \nSenate floor.\n  Madam President, this is a proworker bill. The bill requires that all \nparticipation be voluntary. Let me say it again--voluntary. All \nparticipation under this bill must be voluntary. If a worker does not \nwant it, he or she can just say no. No punishment, no retribution, no \nconsequence. Under no circumstances will participation be a condition \nof employment.\n  Further, Madam President, the bill has powerful anticoercion \nprovisions in very strong penalty language for any employer who \nviolates those provisions. I believe, Madam President, we have already \nestablished some level of cooperation in this bill. For example, during \nthe markup, Senators Kennedy and Wellstone were very concerned about \nthe status of unused accrued comptime hours in the event of a \nbankruptcy--a legitimate concern. They wanted to create stronger \nprotections for employees. In the spirit of compromise, I asked our \ndistinguished colleague Senator Grassley, whose Judiciary subcommittee \nhas the proper jurisdiction and expertise on this issue, to draft \nlegislation to deal with these concerns. Yesterday, Senator Grassley \ncame to the floor and offered his amendment to improve this bill. \nUnfortunately, regrettably, we have not yet been able to vote on \nSenator Grassley's amendment.\n  Madam President, we should build on this bipartisan spirit of \ncooperation, the bipartisan spirit of that amendment, and work toward \npassage of this bill. I believe, Madam President, we need to put the \nfocus on the needs of those workers. We should look at this issue from \nthe perspective of the working people who are going to be directly \naffected. Let us pass a bipartisan response to their very legitimate \nconcerns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I wish to add my thanks to my \ndistinguished colleague from Missouri for his leadership on this bill.\n  I rise today in support of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. I will \nread a letter from a small businessperson, Gary Tharnish, in Lincoln, \nNE, dated April 30, 1997. I will read this because I think it does, in \nfact, cut directly to the essence of what this bill is about. As my \ndistinguished colleague before me made very clear, this is a voluntary \nbill. This is not a mandate. This is about flexible work time for our \nmen and women.\n  I will read this letter from Gary Tharnish, the owner of Burton's \nFlowers:\n\n       Dear Senator Hagel: It is my understanding that S-4, \n     ``Compensatory Time'' will soon come to the floor for a vote. \n     I would like to urge you to vote in favor of this bill. As a \n     small business person my employees are begging me to offer \n     them compensatory time. I explain to them I can not offer \n     this. They do not understand the governments intrusion into \n     their personal affairs. I would like to explain the situation \n     an employee is in.\n       Elaine is a mother of 3 children. This day and age it is so \n     important for a mother to be home when her children get out \n     of school. In order to make ends meet Elaine needs to work. \n     Her options are a full time job and children home alone, or \n     part time work. I offer her and 2 other women a part time job \n     from 9:00 to 3:00 so they can be home when their kids get \n     home. However in the summer they are not able to work. They \n     would love to take their overtime pay and use it at that \n     time. At Valentines Day and Mother's Day they receive a lot \n     of overtime. They would love to use their ``time and a half'' \n     hours to receive pay during the summer.\n       Please, I am asking that you vote in favor of S-4. All \n     Small Businesses and the thousands of constituents working \n     for them will benefit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gary J. Tharnish.\n\n  Madam President, this really does say it very effectively, very \nsuccinctly, and I think it encompasses what we are trying to do with \nthis bill.\n  I ask my colleagues to spend some time in the remaining minutes that \nwe have, reviewing their own constituencies, reviewing their own \nsituations for their own workers in their States. I strongly urge \ncloture be invoked this afternoon and my colleagues vote in favor of \nthe Family Friendly Workplace Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, the Senate once again has the opportunity \nto move beyond rhetoric and pass a bill that will really help working \nparents and their families.\n  This afternoon's cloture motion represents the second time those of \nus who support the Family Friendly Workplace Act, S. 4, have worked to \ninvoke cloture--to move this issue to a vote. And yet, the minority has \nblocked consideration of this measure despite S. 4's wide public \nsupport and bipartisan support here and in the House.\n  The Family Friendly Workplace Act will help working parents balance \nthe\n\n[[Page S5289]]\n\ndemands of having a family and holding down a job. Working parents, \nparticularly women, are looking for more flexibility in their schedules \nand more time with their children. In fact, according to a recent Labor \nDepartment report, ``the number one issue women want to bring to the \nPresident's attention is the difficulty of balancing work and family \nobligations.'' And, according to Lynn Hayes, author of ``The Best Jobs \nin America for Parents,'' when working parents are asked what they \ndesire most in a job, a majority answer ``flexibility in scheduling.'' \nSimilarly, according to a study commissioned a few years ago by \nArizona's Salt River project of the Southwest region, a majority of \nparents with children under 13 are willing to trade salary increases \nfor flexible time, leave, and dependent-care benefits.\n  There are other studies showing that Americans want flexibility in \nthe workplace. In a work/family study conducted by Johnson & Johnson, \nfor example, the company expected a need for child care to surface. \nInstead, ``the big issue that popped out was that of all the things \nthat we would do as a corporation in support of parents, the biggest \nfactor was that they wanted a flexible work schedule.'' And Federal \nemployees, who already have this flexibility, support it in large \nnumbers.\n  As the parent of two children and grandparent of four, I have seen \nfirst hand how difficult it can be to effectively balance work and \nfamily responsibilities today. Parents are working just as hard or \nharder than ever before just to make ends meet without gaining \nadditional time or money for their families. That's because our tax \nlaws take too much of working parents' hard-earned dollars. It is also \nbecause our outdated labor laws make it impossible for many employees \nto work together with their employers to develop schedules that better \nrespond to the demands of work and family.\n  The problem was highlighted in a recent Newsweek cover story on the \nproblem parents and their children encounter when parents do not have \nenough time to spend with their children. In the article, Kevin Dwyer, \nassistant director of the National Association of School Psychologists, \ncites research showing that, when parents do not have enough time to \nspend with their children, it leads to kids being ``more aggressive, \nmore deviant and more oppositional.''\n  That brings us back to why passage of S. 4, the Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act, is so important. S. 4 will give millions of working \nparents, and in particular an estimated 28.8 million women paid by the \nhour in the private sector, the flexibility to better juggle their \nresponsibilities both as parents and employees.\n  By updating the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act will allow hourly wage workers and their employees to \ndevelop flexible work schedules. Under the FLSA, hourly workers in the \nprivate sector are not allowed to develop flexible work arrangements \nwith their employers, even though public sector employees and salaried \nprivate sector employees can.\n  In fact, as noted, Federal employees have been allowed to participate \nin flexible scheduling programs since 1978. It has worked well, and \nfully three-quarters of these employees report more time for their \nfamilies and higher morale. Eight out of ten Federal workers surveyed \nby the General Accounting Office are pleased with the flexible \nscheduling option and want the program continued.\n  The Family Friendly Workplace Act will extend such opportunities to \nthe private sector by guaranteeing, upon agreement between employer and \nemployee, specific flexible work options.\n  First, it will allow hourly wage employees and their employers \ntogether to choose whether the employee will be compensated with time-\nand-a-half pay or, compensatory time-and-a-half time. Some families \nneed additional income; some families need more time to juggle the \ndemands of parenthood. Whereas current law provides many working \nparents with the opportunity only for extra pay, S. 4 provides a choice \nbetween increased pay or time.\n\n  The Family Friendly Workplace Act also provides, if agreed to by both \nemployer and employee, a way for employees to bank overtime hours (up \nto six weeks of paid time) so that, when needed, employees will have a \nway to take extended leave and still receive a paycheck. Allowing \nemployees to bank overtime hours, and be paid for those hours, is \npreferable for most workers, since many employees cannot afford to take \nextended unpaid time off to take care of a sick child or other \ndependent.\n  Moreover, under S. 4, at the end of the year, employers must cash out \nby paying the employee for the unused accumulated hours. The employee \nmust also be able to cash out his or her accumulated leave within 30 \ndays.\n  S. 4 also allows employees to develop biweekly, or flextime \nschedules. For example, under current law an employer cannot allow an \nhourly wage employee to work 45 hours one week in exchange for 35 hours \nthe next week so that the worker can attend, for example, a child's \nbaseball game, a parent-teacher conference, or doctor's appointment. S. \n4 will change this rigid interpretation of the FLSA. It will allow \nworkers the ability to arrange biweekly work schedules--the employee \ncould work any combination of 80 hours over two weeks, if agreed to by \nthe employer. Someone could work a long week and then a short week to \nbest fit the needs of his or her family.\n  As a safeguard against abuse, S. 4 requires that any flexible work \narrangement or banked overtime hours be agreed upon by both the \nemployer and the employee, without coercion. Collective bargaining \nagreements would remain unaffected, and revised work schedules could be \nworked into a collective bargaining agreement.\n  Madam President, the Family Friendly Workplace Act will update labor \nlaw to allow for increased flexibility in the workplace and to better \nreflect the needs of today's families. As we all know, today's parents \nare under a great deal of pressure--to provide for their children \nfinancially and provide the time needed to raise a healthy child, \ncapable of contributing positively to society. We in Congress should \nrespond by correcting the law, when possible and without mandate, to \nimprove the ability of parents to provide for their children.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote to invoke cloture, pass S. \n4, and send it to the President for signature.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I would like to speak briefly about the \namendment I have introduced to S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. \nThis bill, in my estimation goes a long way toward giving Americans \nmore flexibility in how they fulfill their responsibilities to work and \ntheir families. S. 4 provides working Americans an option which is \nalready available to public sector employees, the ability to choose \ncompensatory time off in lieu of cash overtime pay. Further, the bill \nassures private sector employees that their choice to take either \ncompensatory time or overtime pay will be protected. The use of \ncoercion, intimidation, or harassment to force a private sector \nemployee to take either compensatory time or overtime pay as a \ncondition of employment is expressly prohibited under this bill. My \namendment simply extends those same assurances to public safety \nofficers.\n  In my State of Washington, Jim Mattheis, president of the Washington \nState Council of Police and Sheriffs, reports that compensatory time is \nextremely popular with the families of working law enforcement. Access \nto compensatory time has increased the morale, efficiency, and safety \nof law enforcement officers. More importantly, compensatory time \nprovides law enforcement families some much needed flexibility in work \nschedules which are exceptionally stressful.\n  Unfortunately, my law enforcement constituents in Washington State \nreport that the experience in the public sector has demonstrated a need \nto ensure that employees are free to choose whether to work for \novertime pay, to use their compensatory time within a reasonable amount \nof time once it is earned, or to preserve their comptime banks.\n  Police officers provide a tremendous service to our communities. They \nput their lives on the line each day to protect our families and our \ncommunities. Public safety officers deserve to have the simple \nassurance that their choice of compensatory time or cash overtime pay \nis preserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. May I inquire as to the time remaining?\n\n[[Page S5290]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes and 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am grateful for this opportunity to speak in behalf \nof the Family Friendly Workplace Act. Unfortunately, so many statements \nabout it this afternoon do not reflect the act. They may reflect some \nattacks on the act or what someone has said about the act, but the \ntruth is this act is a totally voluntary way for employees to cooperate \nwith their employers to provide more flextime, more time for people to \nspend with their families.\n  This is not some new potential that has never been tried anywhere. We \nbegan in 1978 in the Federal Government to offer these kinds of \nbenefits to Government workers. They have been tried in the \ngovernmental setting during the 1970's, all through the 1980's, and now \nthrough most of the 1990's. I have been in the Senate for a couple \nyears, almost 3 years now, and I have not had a single Federal worker \ncome to me and say this is a terrible means for abusing workers. When \nyou survey those workers, the General Accounting Office, which surveyed \nthe workers, found out that at a 10-1 ratio those workers said this was \na very important way to help them accommodate the needs of their \nfamilies.\n  The Senator from Montana said if Federal Government workers get \ncomptime, so should other workers. Well, Federal Government workers do \nget comptime and so should other workers. That is what this bill is \nabout. But Federal Government workers get flextime and so should other \nworkers. And that is what this bill is about.\n  Now, I appreciate the patience of Senators on this flextime cloture \nvote. This is not the way we intended for this to unfold. We have made \nan effort to reach out to those on the other side of the aisle. We have \nconferred with them about constructing some amendments because they \nhave raised concerns. Now, when they raised concerns, we sort of \nthought it would be appropriate if they would bring amendments to the \nfloor to address those concerns. As a matter of fact, no amendment from \nthe Democratic side was offered for consideration--no amendment was \noffered for consideration.\n  So in an effort to address the concerns, we developed amendments that \nwould meet those concerns that the Democrats had been raising. As soon \nas we developed those amendments--and there were a number of Senators, \nand Senator Grassley has already been mentioned on a bankruptcy \namendment, there were two amendments about worker choice between \ncomptime and overtime pay, and also amendments about so-called \ndiscrimination so to make sure in spite of the fact that the language \nthat is already in the bill that prohibits an employer from selecting a \nworker to do overtime work because he is one that would only take one \nkind of compensation or another, we wanted to prohibit that. We not \nonly wanted to reflect their concerns, we were willing to bring our own \namendments. There were probably seven or eight amendments yesterday \nready to come to the floor to assuage the concerns raised on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle. And what happened? Instead of addressing \nthis bill, they chose to filibuster this bill and talk about other \nthings.\n  I am at a loss, when they talk about the need for two-way \ncooperation. The Senator from Louisiana comes today. She says she comes \nto offer amendments and offer thoughts. Well, I got the thoughts part. \nBut we have not had any amendments offered. There has been an \nopportunity to offer amendments. If you really want to offer \namendments, we want them. I stood here on this floor Monday afternoon \nand pled for people to bring amendments, to come and let us consider \nthem. I stood here yesterday afternoon and pled, ``If you have \namendments to this bill, please come and bring them. Let us correct any \ndefects.'' And did they come? No.\n  Yet when we brought amendments to try and address the very problems \nthat they mentioned, they filibustered. They talked about things much \nas they did today. With the 30 minutes allowed in the bill, the \nDemocrats chose to spend most of the time talking about other things.\n  The truth of the matter is we have a tremendous opportunity to extend \nto the American workers some very important rights and benefits that \nare enjoyed by the boardroom folks, the salaried folks, the supervisors \nand managers of America, and all the Government workers of America have \neither comptime or comptime and flextime. In enactment after enactment \non the floor of this Congress we have extended those rights both to \nlocal government workers, to State government workers, to Federal \nGovernment workers, and we have reinforced that, and the President has \neven extended those rights by Executive order. This morning, while I \nwas at the White House for the signing of the IDEA law, the President \npulled me aside and said, ``John, there is nothing more important we \ncan do for American families--nothing more important than to provide \nflexible working arrangements for American families.'' We do want to \ncooperate. My intention to cooperate will not be extinguished no matter \nwhat happens today.\n\n  I think what we have here is a filibuster to kill flextime without \nreal debate and without offering real changes. It is a search and \ndestroy mission targeted at killing flextime, flextime that would help \nthe men and women of America accommodate the competing needs of their \nfamilies and their home place.\n  Madam President, 57 Senators who now sit in this body, and Vice \nPresident Gore, voted to extend flextime benefits to Federal employees \nin the last decade and they voted to extend them to State employees and \nthey voted to do it without anywhere near the protections we have put \nin this bill. The protections simply were not there, and they say that \nemployees cannot make a decision about when they can use their \ncomptime--that simply does not reflect this bill. The bill says that an \nemployee cannot be forced to use his or her comptime at anytime, so the \nemployee makes the decision, and if the employee makes the decision to \ncash it in, the employee can get the money back. Right now, there are \n60 million hourly workers who are waiting for an opportunity to have \ncomptime and flextime benefits.\n  I challenge Senators to match their words with deeds and to vote to \ngive millions of Americans the benefits that Federal workers have \nenjoyed since the 1970's. Today's cloture vote is far more than it may \nseem. Every vote against cloture is a vote to kill flextime for \nmillions of working American families.\n  No one defends current law as adequate to meet the needs of today's \nfamily, especially President Clinton. As I mentioned before, this \nmorning President Clinton expressed to me his belief that flexible work \narrangements are the most important thing we can do for families. The \nPresident wants a bill he can sign.\n  I, again, challenge Senators to be serious, start negotiating and \nstop stalling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/04/senate-section/article/S5281-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5290-S5291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
