Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period \nof morning business until noon. Following morning business, under a \nprevious order, the Senate will begin consideration of S. 1723, the \nAbraham of Michigan immigration legislation. Any votes ordered with \nrespect to the Abraham bill will be postponed to occur beginning at \n5:45 this evening. We have modified the time of the vote just a little \nto accommodate some Senators who will be coming in close to that time. \nSo it will be 5:45 instead of the earlier indication of 5:30. It could \ninvolve one, two, or three votes, depending on how the amendments go \nduring the day.\n  Following those votes, the Senate will begin consideration of S. \n1415, the tobacco bill. Members should expect busy sessions every day \nthis week as the Senate considers this important issue.\n  Also this week, the Senate may consider the ISTEA transportation \nconference report. I understand that the conferees have basically \nreached an agreement on the broad parameters, broad issues of the ISTEA \ntransportation bill. They are running the numbers to make sure they \nhave numbers that reflect what their agreements were. We hope to have a \nvote on that Thursday, or Friday at the latest. We may also consider \nthe Coverdell A+ savings account conference report, if available.\n  The cooperation of all Senators will be necessary so that the Senate \ncan complete its work prior to the Memorial Day recess. There will be \nample opportunity for Senators to be heard this week, and there will be \nample opportunity for Senators on either side of the aisle on the \nissues involved to be frustrated or to lose their temper perhaps. But I \nhope everybody will remain calm and be thoughtful in their debate. I \nbelieve we can proceed and get to a conclusion that will be acceptable \nto, hopefully, a large number of Senators in a bipartisan way.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S4945-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about an \nissue dealing with agriculture. Later this week, sometime this weekend, \na boat will pull up at a dock in California loaded with 1.4 million \nbushels of European barley. This barley was sold into this country with \na subsidy of well over $1 a bushel. It is now being hauled from the \nEuropean Union to the shores of the United States, deeply subsidized, \nunfair trade, undercutting our family farmers. It is an outrage, and it \nshould not happen. We suggested that the sale be terminated when it was \nannounced, but it was not. I suggest today that perhaps somebody ought \nto refuse to unload the barley when it reaches the shores of \nCalifornia.\n  Let me describe for a few moments why this is just a symbol of a very \nserious problem in the farm belt. I want to show a series of charts \nbecause I want the American people and my colleagues\n\n[[Page S4946]]\n\nto understand that we are confronted with the question of whether we \nwant any family farmers in this country's future. We are seeing family \nfarmers going broke in record numbers. In my State, there was a 55-\npercent increase in auction sales over last year. They are calling \nauctioneers out of retirement to handle the auction sales, because \nthere are so many sales of family farmers having to quit.\n  Now, farming isn't just a business. These are families living on the \nfarm. There is a yard light that illuminates the place that represents \nthe dreams of a family that wants to farm. These farms represent the \neconomic blood vessels that pump life into our small towns. It is a way \nof life that is very important to this country.\n  There is a real difference between family farmers and the agri-\nfactories that farm from California to the State of Maine with large \nmechanized corporate farming. The family farm makes a difference in our \nsociety. It is the seedbed of family values that has nurtured and \nrolled itself from the family farms to small towns, to America's \ncities. If America decides it doesn't care about whether there are \nfamily farmers, it will have lost something valuable.\n  I received a letter from a farmer just the other day. Its just one of \nmany such letters from other farmers. I am getting many calls and \nconsiderable mail from farmers. This particular letter says, ``It has \ncome to my attention now as a farmer that the United States is \npreparing to let an entire industry''--that is, family farmers--``die. \nIf an airline strikes, the President intervenes; if UPS strikes, the \nPresident intervenes; if a railroad suggests a strike, the President is \nup in arms. But when farm commodity prices fall and family farmers are \nin peril, nobody seems to say much.''\n  Let me describe the circumstances of our North Dakota farmers. I met \nwith a group of North Dakota producers this past Saturday with my \ncolleague, Senator Conrad, in Fargo, ND. We visited, once again, about \nthe problems and what can be done about them. Here is what they face. \nOur three largest crops--spring wheat, durum wheat, and barley--had a \n41-percent reduction, a 21-percent reduction, and 41-percent reduction \nin gross income from reduced yield and price. Ask yourself, if you were \nin business and you have a 40-percent reduction in your gross sales and \na reduction in your price, what is going to happen to your business?\n  These are family farmers. They don't have deep pockets. So here is \nwhat has happened, as a result, to net farm income. Take all the \nfarmers out there in North Dakota and evaluate what happened to the net \nfarm income. Net farm income in 1996 was $764 million, divided among \n30,000 farmers. In 1997 net farm income was down 98 percent, down to \n$15 million in net farm income. Divided among all those farmers, that \nis less than $500 net income per farm. But this doesn't tell the whole \nstory, because almost all of that net farm income goes to the state's \nlargest farmers, and almost all of the middle- and lower-income farmers \nare seeing huge losses. Let me show my colleagues what has happened to \nthe price of wheat.\n  One can make the case, or not make the case, that this has something \nto do with what Congress did. It probably has some small amount to do \nwith what Congress did in passing a new farm bill, and maybe it has \nsomething to do with a lot of other things happening in the world.\n  Let's look at the price of the wheat. We passed a new farm bill back \nin April 1996. You see what happened to the prices received by farmers \nfor wheat since May 1996. It has gone down, down, down, way down. It is \nnow at the lowest level in five years. That is what farmers live on. \nThe price determines whether they are going to make a living and stay \non the farm. The price of wheat has gone down 44 percent. It is down, \ndown, way down.\n  Let me show you what has happened to farmers' costs of production. \nSeed, fertilizer, fuel. They are all up, up, up, way up, month after \nmonth, year after year.\n  Let me show a chart, if I might, that talks about some of these \nspecific trends. If you are a farmer, you need to have a tractor to \nplow. We don't do it with mules anymore; we do it with tractors. What \nhas happened to the price of tractors? Farmers can tell you in an \ninstant. The price goes up, up, straight up. The price of a combine is \nalso up, up, straight up. How about the price of anhydrous ammonia, the \nfertilizer needed to provide the nutrients to these crops? You can see \nwhat has happened. There has been a huge spike in the last few years. \nThe price of fuel is up. In the last five years, there has been a 70-\npercent increase in the cost of the inputs that many farmers have to \nbuy to put a crop in the ground.\n  This isn't like other businesses. When you are a family farmer, you \ncan't pass these costs along. People do not think much about family \nfarmers, unfortunately. They get their butter from a carton; they get \ntheir milk from a bottle, or a carton; food from a can, or perhaps a \nbox. But it all comes from the farm. It all comes from someone who gets \nup early to do the chores, and then gasses up the tractor, and goes out \nand plants the field.\n  Will Rogers some 60 years ago said, ``If all the cows in the country \nfailed to show up at the barn one morning to be milked, why, that would \nbe a problem.'' He said, ``If all the lawyers and accountants in \nAmerica failed to show up for work one morning, we wouldn't miss a \nlunch.'' He was describing what is really important. Where does all of \nthis come from? It comes from the ingenuity and risks taken by families \nwho decide they want to farm as a way of life.\n  The price of a loaf of bread has almost no money in it for farmers. \nHere is the price of a loaf of bread. Here is what the farmer gets. \nJust about the heel, if that much.\n  So wheat 2 years ago was $5.50 a bushel, and now it is $3.20 or \n$3.30. Has anybody seen the price of a loaf of bread come down? I don't \nthink so. What is happening is, the people who make the bread are \nmaking record profits. The people who haul the grain on the railroad \ntracks are making record profits. The people who put it in a plant and \nthen perhaps puff it and then sell it on the grocery store shelf as \nPuffed Wheat are making a profit because it is more profitable to puff \nit than it is to grow it.\n  I wonder if there is not something wrong with this picture for \nAmerica. The snap, crackle, and pop, the puff, and the crisp all have \nmore value than the wheat. The package, the advertising, and the \ntransportation have more value than the wheat.\n  This country can't decide on a policy that says family farming has \nmerit and it is important to this country?\n  Finally, bread profits soar at the same time that wheat prices come \ndown and family farmers go broke. Something is wrong with that picture.\n  This chart shows it on the same page. Bread costs continue to rise, \nand the price of wheat continues to fall.\n  I went to a small school. There were nine students in my class. They \ntaught math at my school, maybe not higher math, but I can add and \nsubtract. I understand what adds up and what doesn't. This doesn't add \nup. It does not add up if you care about whether this country has a \nfuture for family farmers. Farming is not just a business.\n\n  There are a lot of reasons that we are in trouble on the farm. \nFarmers are told by Congress that, we are not going to have a safety \nnet for you anymore, and that we are going to pull that safety net out \nfrom underneath our farmers.\n  Farmer are unlike most other business. They take huge risks: First, \nthey risk that when they plant a seed, it may not grow. So the cost of \nthat seed might represent a loss in the farmers' pockets. Second, if \nthe seed grows, it may be in June or July that a hailstorm will come \nand destroy the crop. Or the bugs will come and eat the crop; or crop \ndisease, scab or vomitoxin, will come and destroy the crop.\n  Maybe none of those things happen. Maybe you plant a seed and it \ngrows and none of those natural disasters occur. Then you combine the \ncrop to get it off the field and take it to the grain elevator, only to \ndiscover that it costs you $5 a bushel to produce it and you get just \n$3.35 a bushel to sell it. The result is that your family is going to \nhave to move from the farm. That yard light is going to go out. Someone \nwill farm that land. It will be a big operator, or a big corporate \nfarm. They will just fold it into their bigger corporate farm, and \nthere will be tractors that will plow for miles. But that yard\n\n[[Page S4947]]\n\nlight will be out forever, and that small town will continue to die. \nThe county will shrink. The rural life style will wither.\n  A wonderful author from my home State, who was a world-renowned \nauthor, died a couple of years ago. He made a prediction in his book. \nHe stated it more eloquently than I can . He said that this country \nresulted from an agrarian lifestyle which created the family values \nthat nurtured America and refreshed America. He reminded us that the \nfamily values that refreshed America continually came from the family \nfarm, where neighbors understood that you have to help each other \nbecause the people can't do it alone. Without our family farms, those \nfamily values that rolled from rural America to our cities will be \nlost.\n  It is not to say that farmers are better than anybody else or have \nmore value. It is just that farming is different. It is a family \noccupation. Yet, it has enormous risks. For years in this country we \ndecided that we were going to try to provide some help to offset those \nrisks. They do it in every other country.\n  We are the only superpower. We are the only nuclear superpower, \nmilitary superpower, left. We are certainly an economic superpower. \nAlmost any other country with any economic clout decides that, as part \nof its budget, it makes sure it continues to have a network of family \nfarms. Therefore, it provides some price supports against all of these \nrisks that family farmers face. But not us. We decided farmers should \ncompete in the open market despite the fact that there isn't an open \nmarket.\n  As I said when I started, the ship that is going to dock in \nCalifornia at the end of this week will haul 1.4 million bushels of \nEuropean Union barley subsidized to the tune of more than $1.10 cents a \nbushel. There is no American farmer that can compete with that. It is \nsimply unfair.\n  But that is just the tip of the iceberg. In every direction you look \nin international trade, our farmers are injured. The California dock is \nnot the only place. Go to the Canadian border, where we are flooded \nwith unfairly traded Canadian imports. Go to the Mexican border and see \nwhat NAFTA has done with respect to the unfairness of agricultural \ntrade. Go to China and ask why we can't get sufficient amounts of wheat \nor pork into China. Go to Japan and ask why it costs $30 a pound to buy \na T-bone steak in Japan because you cannot get enough American beef in \nJapan.\n  We are rife with trade problems that injure the American farmer every \nsingle day. And our trade policy is apparently to sit on our hands and \ndo nothing about it.\n  It seems to me that we can't enforce trade agreements. But first of \nall, we need to negotiate good agreements. Let me mention Will Rogers \nonce again. Some 60 years ago, Will Rogers also said that, ``The United \nStates has never lost a war and never won in a conference.''\n  First, we ought to get trade negotiators to go out and negotiate good \nagreements for this country. They ought to be hard-nosed economic trade \nagreements and not some soft-headed foreign policy negotiations about \nwhat we ought to do to help other countries.\n  I am not against helping other countries, but first I am for helping \nfamily farmers. We need trade policies that do not injure them. We need \nto help them. If they had any gumption, they would be at that dock out \nin California this week meeting the ship and suggesting that the ship \nshould never be unloaded on American shores because it is symptomatic \nof everything that is wrong with our trade policy.\n  Second, we ought to decide that it matters to have a support price \nfor family farmers. No, it would not be a giveaway nor a subsidy to \nfarmers. The subsidy in American food policy is that we have the \nhighest quality food anywhere in the world for the lowest price \nanywhere in the world. We have a cheap food policy that provides a \nsubsidy to the consumer. This is at the expense of family farmers who \ncan't make a living because what they grow they have to sell at well \nbelow the cost of what it took them to grow it. That adds up to a \ndeficit, and that adds up to serious trouble.\n\n  In my judgment we ought to use every tool that is available to us as \na country. Could the export enhancement program help? Maybe. Is it \nbeing used now? No. Why have we decided to disarm ourselves? The \nEuropean Union uses their export subsidies to sell their grain from \ntheir family farmers into North African markets and they have 10 times \nthe subsidies we have ever considered using. So, why does our country \nsay, if they are going to take our African markets away from us, that \nis just fine, and we can't do anything about it? Would we disarm in any \nother way? Why would we disarm on trade competition? Why would we not \nsay, on behalf of American producers, that we will stand up for you? \nThis country believes in you. This country cares about you. Why on \nEarth will this country not decide that it will stand up for its \nproducers?\n  We, in my judgment, must begin as a Congress now to evaluate whether \nthe path we are on from the previous farm bill passed a couple of years \nago is the right path or the wrong path. It was called the Freedom to \nFarm bill. Part of it was just fine. Part of it was to take government \nout of the decision of what crops a farmer was going to grow. I \nsupported that part. But part of it was a devastating blow to farmers. \nIt said, by the way, we are going to pull the rug out from under you in \nprice supports, and we are going to say to you, compete in the free \nmarket when in fact there is no free market.\n  It asks our farmers--the Johnson's, the Larsen's, the Olson's, \nbecause I come from that part of the country where we have a lot of \nfolks with those names--it asks those farmers to compete not just \nagainst French farmers, not just against German farmers or Italian \nfarmers. It asks them to compete against all those governments as well \nthat deeply subsidize their sales into foreign countries.\n  I ask the question today of Congress and also this administration \nwhether they are willing to stand up and ask some tough questions about \nagricultural policy in this country. Do family farmers matter? Do you \ncare? When you fly across the Dakotas and Nebraska and Kansas and the \nbreadbasket of our country at night and look out the window of an \nairplane, do you care whether you see yard lights? Do you care about \nour farmers out there who are trying to make a living with great risk? \nDo you care whether they really have an opportunity to make it? Do you \nthink they provide worth to our economy? Or is this just an economy now \nwhich says bigger is better, concentration has virtue, and that mergers \nand combinations have merit, because they have the financial clout and \nthe capability to suggest that an economic system that rewards size and \nrewards bigness is the best system. I don't necessarily believe that.\n  Oh, I think the market system is a wonderful system, but I also \nbelieve that in this country agricultural producers have never \nexperienced a free market and will never experience a free market \nunless substantial changes are made not just in this country but other \ncountries as well.\n  I want to make one additional point. We now have a number of \ncountries in this world in which our farmers can't market because we \nhave embargoed them through sanctions. We have said we don't want to do \nbusiness with Cuba; we don't like Fidel Castro. So wherever Cuba is \ngoing to buy wheat, it is not going to be from the American farmer. In \nLibya, we don't like Qadhafi. So where is it going to get its grain. It \nis not going to be from this country. Iraq, well, in the last year or \nso, we have shipped them a bit, but not much. Most of Iraq's grain \ncomes from elsewhere because everyone knows the problems with Iraq.\n  I can go through a list of countries in which the American farmer \npays a price because we have decided to embargo them. I happen to \nbelieve that you ought never under any circumstances decide to cut off \nshipments of food. Nobody is going to shoot food back at you. It seems \nto me it makes good sense in this country as a matter of public policy \nto decide that food shipments and food sales ought to be the last thing \nyou would ever sever. We have a lot of hungry people in the world. It \nmakes no sense to me to see a country with as bountiful an opportunity \nand as bountiful a harvest as we often get decide that somehow this \ngrain doesn't have value. Gosh, I think this grain is more valuable \nthan nuclear weapons. I think this grain is\n\n[[Page S4948]]\n\nmore valuable than most of what people produce. This is a hungry world \nand a growing hungry world.\n\n  It breaks my heart to see family farmers write to me day after day \nand come to me in North Dakota as they did this weekend and call day \nafter day and tell me that their dream is ending.\n  A woman called a couple of weeks ago, and she began crying on the \nphone. She and her husband, just out of high school, began to farm. \nThey have never done anything else. And they scraped and struggled and \nrented some land and then bought a little bit of land. She said, ``We \ndon't go to town on Saturday nights. We don't buy frills. We scrape by \nand we have always scraped by. We do nothing that is extravagant.''\n  She said, ``But, we finally have come to the end of the road. We are \nnow in our mid-thirties. We have farmed for nearly 15 years and we have \nno other skills, but we just can't continue to make it unless farm \nprices improve. Our banker won't give us a loan. We can't put in the \nspring crop.''\n  When you hear those stories, it breaks your heart because we are \nlosing something valuable.\n  I would conclude today by simply saying this: My colleague, Senator \nConrad and I, have spoken on the floor I guess a half dozen times on \nthis subject. We want people to understand that this issue matters. \nThis makes a difference to our country. There is a big difference \nbetween the right public policies and the wrong public policies. One \noffers people hope and one despair. One will help move us forward in \ntrying to nurture and protect and help family farms in our future and \none will move us backward towards farm failures and desolation and \ndespair on the family farm.\n  Let me end as I began. North Dakota State University did a study and \nshowed us that just in the last year there have been almost $400 \nmillion in losses in net farm income. That is $400 million just from \nthose three crops: spring wheat, durum, and barley. The problem is that \nin that circumstance I have described in our State, family farmers just \ncan't make it.\n  Something has to change. We need better trade policy, better price \nsupports, commodity loan rates that give farmers a chance to market \nwhen it is advantageous to them, not just to the miller or the grocery \nmanufacturer. We must fight for changes in policies. I know my \ncolleague, Senator Conrad, and others will be talking about this issue, \nbut it is critically important. I will come to the floor again and \nagain to talk about what we must do to solve this problem.\n  Recently, Dale Thorenson, a farmer from Newburg, ND wrote an opinion \nletter for the New York Times. He had received a gift subscription to \nthe New York Times from his father-in-law, and thought that as a new \nsubscriber he should write an article about the conditions facing \nfarmers in North Dakota. I don't know if it has been printed yet in the \nNew York Times, but it did get printed in the Grand Forks Herald. I \nhope the Times does print it because he eloquently captures the \neconomic and policy dilemma that now surrounds our nation's family \nfarmers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Grand Forks Herald, May 10, 1998]\n\n            The Farm Crisis That Nobody Wants To Hear About\n\n\n    as the nation prospers, farmers in the northern plains flounder\n\n                         (By Dale A. Thorenson)\n\n       Newburg, N.D.--On April 3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average \n     broke above 9,000--a new high-water mark in what seems to be \n     an unending spiral upward. At the present rate of growth, a \n     12,000 Dow will be seen by the end of the year. Highly \n     unlikely . . . but who is willing to step in front of this \n     freight train?\n       Ten days later, on April 13, the price of the nearby \n     contract of wheat at the Chicago Board of Trade broke the $3 \n     mark--only this price was heading in the opposite direction \n     of the Dow. The $3 offered for a bushel of wheat on April 13 \n     was a far cry from the $7.16 mark reached just two years \n     prior--a time when the new Freedom to Farm legislation was \n     being enacted in our nation's capital.\n       The sponsors of Freedom to Farm promised this legislation \n     would revolutionize the farming industry. Gone were the \n     planted acreage mandates from the federal government. The \n     farmer was given the flexibility to plant what the market \n     wanted--hence the name Freedom to Farm was coined.\n       In return for this flexibility, the farmer signed a seven-\n     year contract to receive declining support payments decoupled \n     from production--severance pay, for lack of a better \n     explanation--as he was weaned from federal subsidies. The \n     farmer was told the rest of the world also would end \n     subsidies and this new world market free from government \n     intervention would cause unending growth in exports as \n     markets expanded because of increased demand. The \n     conventional wisdom of the time assumed the United States \n     farmer--given this level playing field--would dominate world \n     agriculture.\n\n\n                       good intentions gone awry\n\n       Well, Freedom to Farm has revolutionized farming, but not \n     in the way intended. And the playing field is far from being \n     level. This farm program--called by many as Freedom to Farm--\n     enacted in conjunction with historically high commodity \n     prices, has turned out to be a sham. In what could almost be \n     described as an ill-advised acceptance of a bribe, the farmer \n     pocketed a first-year subsidy payment and a decent price for \n     his crop. It has been downhill since--at least in wheat-\n     producing regions of the Great Plains. But make no mistake \n     about it. The corn and soybean farmers of the Midwest will \n     get their turn on the rack. The $3,000-per-acre land costs of \n     the Corn Belt will not be competitive with the new land being \n     developed in South America at a cost of $50 per acre.\n       As if on cue, the costs of producing a crop--fertilizer, \n     chemicals, machinery required--increased dramatically. The \n     ``bribe'' went directly into the hands of the petro-chemical \n     companies who make the vast array of inputs needed for \n     production agriculture. And, as the $3 price suggests, a \n     downward spiral in wheat prices commenced.\n       One of the many important details left out of this so-\n     called Freedom to Farm legislation was an iron-clad assurance \n     from the European Union that they would agree to reduce their \n     farm subsidies simultaneously. Supposedly, the EU was to \n     phase out subsidies over the same time period. But the simple \n     fact is that their phase-out is from a much higher level--and \n     as speedy as a tortoise on a cold day. Also, unlike the \n     intentions of the United States, the EU's subsidies will not \n     end entirely.\n       Specifically, the 300 million or so people of the EU spent \n     $47 billion to $48 billion on their farm program this past \n     year. This is in comparison to the United States expenditures \n     of a little more than $5 billion. In the matter of export \n     enhancements--a procedure where the seller pays the buyer to \n     buy the product--the EU spent about $7 billion to $8 billion. \n     The United States anted up about $150 million, or about 50 \n     times less. The negotiator from the EU who sold this bill of \n     goods to the United States policy-makers could easily get a \n     job selling furnaces in hell.\n\n\n                     shortchanged in wheat country\n\n       As bad as this is, the wheat farmers of the Great Plains \n     states were shorted in another way in comparison to the corn \n     and soybean farmers in the Midwest. The federal loan rate for \n     wheat was capped in the Freedom to Farm bill at $2.58, about \n     52 percent of the United States Department of Agriculture's \n     most recent five-year average cost of production projection \n     for a bushel of wheat--which was pegged at $5. In contrast, \n     the federal loan rate for corn and soybeans stands at 72 \n     percent and 89 percent, respectively, of USDA's recent cost \n     of production estimate.\n       The United States produces about 9 billion bushels of corn \n     and 2.5 billion bushels of soybeans annually. Annual \n     production of wheat has been about 2.7 billion bushels in \n     recent years. Uncapping the loan rate for wheat and raising \n     it to the percentage of production costs enjoyed by the corn \n     and soybean producers--$3.75--culd potentially cost the U.S. \n     Treasury up to $3 billion annually if the EU continued to \n     insist on their predatory marketing tactics. But not doing so \n     puts the U.S. wheat farmer in the position of competing not \n     only with his contemporary in Europe, but also with the \n     government treasuries in Europe. There should be little doubt \n     as to who will survive this grain war if the situation \n     remains the same.\n       North Dakota and northern Minnesota farmers especially have \n     been hard hit with economic misfortune even beyond the \n     disastrous collapse of wheat prices. This region is now going \n     on five years of a serious wheat disease outbreak called \n     Fusarium head blight brought on by abnormally wet periods \n     during the flowering stage of the crop. Couple this dilemma \n     with the harsh winter blizzards of 1996 to 1997, which then \n     produced the well-publicized flood of the century in the Red \n     River Valley, highlighted by the almost complete inundation \n     of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks. Another pitfall is the \n     proximity of this region to the Canadian wheat producing \n     area, called the Prairie Provinces--Manitoba, Saskatchewan \n     and Alberta. The North American Free Trade Agreement has \n     allowed Canada to dump its excess wheat in the United States \n     while maintaining the support for its farmers at the same \n     time. Guess where in the United States Canada dumps this \n     wheat?\n       The March 30 issue of Agweek, one of North Dakota's weekly \n     agricultural news journals published by the Grand Forks \n     Hearld--the paper whose ``Come Hell and High Water'' headline \n     last April made it world-famous--listed approximately 180 \n     farm auctions. Those were not poor operators or retirement \n     sales, but good farmers--many of\n\n[[Page S4949]]\n\n     these farms were fairly large operations--in their prime who \n     have simply given up. These farmers had survived the \n     bloodbath in agriculture of the 1980s but were unable to \n     survive Freedom to Farm. They will never be replaced.\n       This country, with all its abundance and prosperity, needs \n     to come to the realization that a wheat farmer needs to \n     receive more than a few pennies of the $1.50 a consumer pays \n     for a loaf of bread. Europe, having starved twice in this \n     century during two world wars, understands that and intends \n     to keep its agricultural industry intact.\n\n\n                            trivial pursuit\n\n       All the fuss lately about President Clinton's sex life or \n     what a certain special prosecutor is thinking as he picks up \n     his morning paper is really quite trivial in comparison with \n     the many national and international problems now at hand. It \n     is for this reason the public considers the current situation \n     in Washington much ado about nothing and not because of the \n     bemoaned fact that a new low in moral standards has been \n     established.\n       In particular interest to more than a few Great Plains \n     wheat farmers is if this country will stand up and fight for \n     them. Or does the United States consider these farmers \n     expendable in order to maintain this nation's long-standing \n     policy of cheap food--even if in the end the reverse will \n     surely happen?\n       A couple final questions on this subject this country needs \n     to ask itself: If the agricultural sector of this country is \n     deemed expendable and not worthy of preserving, will the \n     United States one day become as reliant on food for foreign \n     countries as it is for oil? If so, does the United States \n     really want to take this risk?\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Conrad, is recognized to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from North \nDakota, Senator Dorgan.\n  Senator Dorgan and I participated in meetings this weekend with \nrepresentatives of major farm organizations and people who are watching \nthe farm economy, those who are charged with doing the statistics and \nthe analysis from the university, also the head of the farm service \nagency who has been made part of a crisis response team by the \nSecretary of Agriculture to deal with the cash flow crisis that is \noccurring in North Dakota and other farm States as well.\n  Last week, I made a series of speeches on what I called the stealth \ndisaster that is affecting North Dakota. Last year, many may recall \nthat we were faced with more visible disasters--flooding and fires of \nunprecedented nature in the Grand Forks and Red River Valley area. This \nyear, we have another disaster, but it is getting almost no attention. \nIt is a stealth disaster. It is a stealth disaster because it is flying \nbelow the radar screen. It is not getting the kind of attention these \nother disasters did. And part of the reason is it is not so visible. It \nis not a story that you can easily put on television, but it is a \ndisaster nonetheless.\n  As I showed last week, farm income in North Dakota declined from 1996 \nto 1997 by one measure by 98 percent. Those are statistics available to \nus from the Labor and Commerce Departments. By another measure, a study \njust done for Senator Dorgan and myself by North Dakota State \nUniversity, farm income declined in that period by 59 percent. By \neither measure, these are dramatic and precipitous declines that are \nleading to a cash flow crisis that is engulfing the producers of our \nState. We anticipate losing perhaps as many as 10 percent of the \nfarmers in North Dakota this year. We have lenders who are telling us, \nfor the first time in history there is farmland in the richest part of \nNorth Dakota, which is the richest farmland in the world, that will not \nbe farmed this year. That is a stunning development.\n\n  Growing up in North Dakota, we were always told that the Red River \nValley of North Dakota used to be the bottom of a lake, it used to be \nthe bottom of Lake Agassiz. Because it was the bottom of a lake, the \nlake deposited this extraordinary land, loam that is 6 to 8 feet deep. \nAs I was growing up, we were told there had never been a crop failure \nin the history of North Dakota in the Red River Valley.\n  In the last 5 years, we have had 5 years of dramatically reduced \nproduction because of overly wet conditions and an outbreak of a \ndisease called scab that took a third to a half of the crop last year \nin much of North Dakota. Scab is a fungus, and it is absolutely \ndevastating. What we have learned is that the farm policy that is in \nplace in this country cannot cope with this combination of disasters--\ndisease and adverse weather coupled with very low prices. That is a \ntriple whammy that is putting thousands and thousands of farmers out of \nbusiness.\n  I thought it might be helpful to compare our agriculture policy in \nthis country with our chief competitors', the Europeans, to see what \nthey are doing versus what we are doing. Senator Dorgan made reference \nto what I have said--repeatedly last week on the floor--that it is one \nthing to say to our farmers, you go out and compete against the French \nfarmer and the German farmer and we will see who wins, who is the best \nproducer, who is the most efficient. We are willing to take on that \nfight any time, any place. But what we are being asked to do is not \nonly compete against the French farmer and the German farmer, we are \ntelling our producers to go and compete against the French Government \nand the German Government as well. That is not a fair fight. You can't \nask a farmer out in North Dakota to take on that French farmer and that \nGerman farmer and while he is at it take on the combined resources of \nthe French Government and the German Government. But that is exactly \nwhat we are doing.\n  This chart shows, for 1997, total agricultural expenditures, the \nUnited States versus the European Union. The European Union is in red; \nthe United States is in blue. You can see, in 1997 they spent almost \n$46 billion supporting their producers. We spent $5 billion. That is \nnot a fair fight. When we look to their spending on exports, the United \nStates versus the European Union--again, the European Union is in red; \nthe United States is in blue. This is to support exports. The Europeans \nspent almost $8 billion. We spent $56 million. That is a ratio of 138 \nto 1. That is not a fair fight. We are sending our troops into the \nbattle and they are armed with BB guns and the other side is firing \nlive ammunition. How are you going to win this kind of fight? We would \nnever do this in a military confrontation. We would never allow \nourselves to be in a situation in which the other side had the \npredominance of resources. But that is what we have done in a trade \nconflict, and it makes no sense.\n  Unfortunately, the pattern continues because, if you look at the \nexpenditures of the two sides for market development, you see the \nEuropeans spending $350 million a year; the United States, $225 \nmillion. Again, they are simply outgunning us at every turn in these \nbattles for agricultural markets. They are winning these markets the \nold-fashioned way--they are buying them. And make no mistake, they have \na strategy and they have a plan and their strategy and plan is to \ndominate world agricultural trade.\n\n  Let's look and see how successful they are with this strategy and \nplan. This chart shows what has happened to wheat exports from the \nEuropean Union over an extended period of time, starting back in 1960, \nand going through 1996, the last year for which we have full \ninformation from the Europeans. Look at this trend and pattern. They \nhave gone from being major importers of wheat to major exporters of \nwheat. And their improvement has really occurred, the most dramatic \npart, in the last 20 years. This did not happen by happenstance. This \nhappened as a result of a concerted plan, a concerted strategy. Because \nthe Europeans have been hungry twice, they never intend to be hungry \nagain, and they recognize the critical importance of dominating world \nagricultural trade. That is the pattern, in terms of what they have \ndone.\n  What have we done? From 1982 to 1996, this is what has happened to \nwheat exports from the United States. We are going nowhere. Worse than \nthat, we are in steep decline. From 1995 to 1996, we have seen a very \ndramatic reduction in U.S. wheat exports. If you go back to 1995, that \nwas not exactly a stellar performance in the last 16 years of history. \nSo, while the Europeans are on the march, they are on the move, the \nUnited States is in retreat.\n  It doesn't happen just with wheat. This is the outlook with barley. \nFrom 1982 to 1996, net barley exports from the European Union--not \nquite the same pattern. They suffered a very steep loss in 1992 to \n1994, but since then they are coming back and coming back strongly. \nDuring that same period, the United\n\n[[Page S4950]]\n\nStates has seen dramatic slippage. In 1992 to 1996, we have actually \ngone below the line. We have become an importer. In fact, we have just \nhad a case where subsidized exports from the European Union have come \ninto the United States for the first time. We are asleep at the switch. \nWhat is happening in this country?\n  We are going to have the same thing happen to us in agriculture that \nhappened in electronics and automobiles and all the rest. We are going \nto wake up someday and we are going to find out that we have gone from \nbeing the major agricultural player in this world to being a second-\nclass citizen, because we have been asleep at the switch. This is not \nthe whole story. It is a part of the story, but there is much more to \ntell. If we look at trade policy, we see that too often the United \nStates negotiates agriculture away for other sectors of the economy. We \nsaw it in the Canadian Free Trade Agreement that now allows Canada to \npump millions of bushels of unfairly traded Canadian grain into this \ncountry, weakening our markets, weakening our prices, and costing us \nsubstantially. That is happening today because of a loophole in the \nCanadian Free Trade Agreement where our people simply got outtraded.\n  We saw the same thing develop with NAFTA. In NAFTA, you recall, we \nnegotiated a 10-percent reduction in tariffs by the Mexicans. They then \nturned around and devalued their currency by 50 percent. The net \nresult, we went from a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico to a $16 \nbillion trade deficit. And some call that a success. If that is a \nsuccess, I would hate to see failure. I wonder what would happen if we \nsaw failure in our trade negotiations, based on what has been happening \nwith the Canadian Free Trade Agreement--so-called free trade; the so-\ncalled NAFTA agreement, again so-called free trade agreement--and what \nhas happened now with the European Union.\n  It is unbelievable, that they are sending into the United States from \nEurope--barley. It is so heavily subsidized in their country that it \nundercuts our producers right here at home. It is not because they are \nmore efficient. It is not because they are more productive. It is \nbecause their country is buying these markets. They are spending $47 \nbillion to support their producers when we are spending $5 billion. On \nexports, they are spending $8 billion a year when we are spending $56 \nmillion. And we wonder why we are losing the fight? If we were in any \nmilitary confrontation we would understand very quickly that we are \njust outgunned.\n  Mr. President, it is time for the United States to fight back. We \nhave to put the resources into this battle to win it. That is what we \ndo in a military fight. That is what we ought to do in this trade \nconfrontation. We ought to send a message to our friends in Europe that \nthey are done having a free ride. We are in this fight and we are in it \nto win.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArkansas, Mr. Hutchinson, is recognized to speak for up to 30 minutes. \nThe Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S4945-8", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4950-S4952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NEW EVIDENCE OF PLA MONEY GOING TO THE DNC\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, last week the Senate, by adopting two \nof the remaining eight House-passed China provisions, I believe took an \nimportant first step in reversing this Nation's failed, flawed and \ncounterproductive policy of so-called ``constructive engagement'' with \nthe People's Republic of China.\n  The first amendment we adopted last week, an amendment to the Defense \nDepartment authorization bill, requires the Department of Defense to \nmonitor enterprises which are owned by the People's Liberation Army and \ngives the President increased authority to take action against these \ncompanies should circumstances warrant. It does not mandate the \nPresident to act, but it would give him enhanced authority to act \nshould the evidence warrant it.\n  The second amendment we adopted gives the U.S. Customs Service \nincreased funding and authority to stop the importation of goods \nproduced in Chinese slave labor camps. The importation of goods \nproduced by slave labor has been prohibited in this country for half a \ncentury, and yet the practice is continuing, unfortunately, and thus, \nthis enhanced monitoring and enhanced authority for the Customs Service \nis essential.\n  These were two very, very important amendments, I believe, but there \nare six bills still remaining in the Foreign Relations Committee. I \nbelieve the Foreign Relations Committee will be taking those bills up \ntomorrow. I hope they will. But the votes that we cast last week could \nnot possibly have been more timely. Their importance is best seen by \nnew information uncovered last Friday by the New York Times, one day \nafter we cast those two important votes on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  That story, covered by the New York Times, and now by every major \nnewspaper in the country, revealed that Johnny Chung, the central \nfigure in the Justice Department's campaign finance investigation, has \nnow told investigators that a large part of the nearly $100,000 that he \ngave to the DNC and to other Democratic causes in the summer of 1996 \ncame from the People's Liberation Army of the People's Republic of \nChina.\n  Let me say that again. A large part of the $100,000--in fact, $80,000 \nof it--went to the DNC, and that money came from the Chinese Red army. \nThis was the front-page story in the New York Times on Friday, May 15. \nThen inside the newspaper the headline is: ``Fund-raiser is Said to \nTell of Donations from China Military to Democrats.''\n  This is a very, very serious allegation that Mr. Chung has made in \nhis cooperation with the Justice Department alleging that this money \ncame not just from Chinese sources, but came from the Chinese Red \nmilitary. Worse yet, this was no low-level PLA effort. It wasn't low-\nlevel figures in the People's Liberation Army, but according to Chung, \nthese monies were provided by a Chinese lieutenant colonel and \naerospace executive whose father, General Liu, was at the time China's \ntop military commander and a member of the leadership of China's \nCommunist Party.\n  This reaches to the very top echelon of the Chinese Government and to \nthe very top levels of the PLA command system. Their very top \nleadership apparently hatched, planned, and carried out this so-called \n``China plan.''\n  Let us not forget, Mr. President, that this whole investigation was \nstarted after an interception of a telephone communication suggesting \nthat the People's Republic of China was considering a covert plan to \ninfluence United States elections. It would now appear that this so-\ncalled ``China plan'' was actually carried out by the top leadership of \nthe PLA and the Communist Party.\n  Why would China and the PLA want to influence American elections? \nWhat motive would they have to pick and choose winners and losers in \nour own Presidential sweepstakes? The answer appears to be given in \nthis very same New York Times article:\n\n       At the time (of these payments from the PLA), President \n     Clinton was making it easier for American civilian \n     communications satellites to be launched by Chinese rockets, \n     a key issue for the PLA and for Liu's company, which sells \n     missiles for the military and also has a troubled space \n     subsidiary.\n\n  There was a very, very vested interest by Lieutenant Colonel Liu in \nensuring that Chinese rockets would be able to launch American \nsatellites. Thus, while the DNC and the Democratic Party was being \nflooded with money from the head of the PLA, the head of the Democratic \nParty, President Clinton, was making it easier for the PLA to receive \nadvanced technological support for its missile and space programs. The \nonly question left to be answered seems to be, was it a quid pro quo?\n  To put the harmful effects of this ``missiles for money\" trade into \ncontext, or more appropriate, the ``PLA Gate,'' it is important to note \nthat until last year, China lacked the intelligence or technologies \nnecessary to manufacture boosters that could reliably strike such long \ndistances. This made China a weaker adversary.\n  In fact, in a debate that I had on the campus of the University of \nMississippi at Oxford, a Firing Line debate that was carried nationwide \nby public television, Dr. Kissinger made this statement:\n\n\n[[Page S4951]]\n\n\n       I also do not believe that it is possible to argue that \n     China can represent a military threat to the United States \n     for the next 20 years.\n\n  I remember very vividly Secretary Kissinger making that statement. He \nalmost ridiculed and disdainfully dismissed those who said that China \ncould pose a military threat to the United States at any time in the \nnext two decades. That is a direct quote from the Firing Line \ntranscript.\n  My how time flies, because now we find, less than a year later, that \nall but five of the Chinese nuclear missiles are aimed and directed at \nthe United States and, in fact, they do pose a threat. According to \nthis article in the Washington Times, China targets nukes at the United \nStates, according to a CIA report that was recently released. China now \nappears to pose a very real threat to the United States. This article \nnoted that 13 of China's 18 long-range strategic missiles with ranges \nexceeding 8,000 miles and have single nuclear warheads are aimed at the \nUnited States. These missiles are in addition to China's growing \narsenal of other weapons that can now reach the United States, many of \nwhich are mentioned in this article regarding the CIA report.\n  How could one of this country's leading China experts and most \nrespected foreign policy adviser have been so far off when Secretary \nKissinger said it would take two decades? Like those of us in the \nSenate, Dr. Kissinger may not have known that two U.S. companies, Loral \nSpace and Communications and Hughes Electronic, illegally gave China \nspace expertise during cooperation on a commercial satellite launch \nwhich could be used to develop an accurate launch and guidance system \nfor ICBMs.\n  I am sure Dr. Kissinger would not have foreseen that this \nadministration, in the middle of investigating this illegal transfer, \nwould allow Loral to launch another satellite on a Chinese rocket and \nprovide them the same expertise at issue in the criminal case. Nor is \nit likely that Dr. Kissinger would know that Motorola, under a waiver \nfrom this administration, has also been involved in ``upgrading'' \nChina's missile capability, this according to the chairman of the House \nScience Subcommittee on Space and Technology.\n  The New York Times ran a follow-up article today providing some \ninsight into this administration's policy on China and the transfer of \nsensitive technology. According to the article that appeared today in \nthe New York Times, United States and China industry groups urged that \nsatellite technology be taken off the list of banned exports, known as \nthe munitions list.\n  The State Department sided with the Defense Department and the \nintelligence agencies, and the President's key advisers and noted that \nsatellite technology holds secrets that hold ``significant military and \nintelligence'' information and thus should remain banned for export.\n  That was the position of key advisers to the President. That was the \nposition of the Department of State and the Defense Department. The \nClinton administration, though, sided with business groups and \ntransferred this decision away from the State Department and left the \ndecision up to the Commerce Department, which was then headed by his \nclose friend, Ron Brown. In the end, satellite technology was removed \nfrom the munitions list. China was free to negotiate with U.S. \nbusinesses to obtain assistance with its space program.\n  The People's Liberation Army is engaged in a massive military buildup \nwhich has involved a doubling since 1992 of announced official figures \nfor military spending by the People's Republic of China. This is \nincredible. It is amazing that we would at this time be circumventing \nour own ban on technology transfers and the launching of American \nsatellites and the sharing of that valuable, valuable missile \ntechnology at the very time we see this massive military buildup.\n  The PLA is working to coproduce the SU-27 fighter with Russia. It is \nin the process of purchasing several substantial weapons systems from \nthe Republic of Russia, including the 633 model of the Kilo-class \nsubmarine and the SS-N-22 Sunburn missile system specifically designed \nto incapacitate United States aircraft carriers and Aegis cruisers.\n  Mr. President, this increasingly aggressive military, the PLA, which \ncracked down on its own citizens in Tiananmen Square, killing over \n2,000 Chinese students, that we are aware of, which held threatening \nwar games off the coast of Taiwan, closing two of its largest ports, \nwhich has taken over disputed islands once claimed by the Philippines, \nwhich now has all but five of its long-range nuclear missiles pointed \nat the citizens of the United States, is being coddled, pampered and \npandered to and appeased by this administration.\n  The gross irony here is that while the administration continues to \nallow the transfer of technology to China and the PLA, the People's \nLiberation Army, U.S. consumers are unwittingly funding China's \nmilitary by purchasing items sold by PLA-owned enterprises operating in \nthe United States.\n  The PLA operates literally thousands and thousands of businesses. It \nis unlike any other military in the world. It is not just funded from \nthe general revenue of the Chinese budget, the Chinese Government \nbudget. It rather is funded partially through enterprises and business \noperations by the military itself. It is estimated that the PLA earns \nbetween $2 billion and $4 billion annually through the many enterprises \nthat it operates that deal in nonmilitary commodities, and that these \nenterprises profit handsomely from their activities right here in the \nUnited States of America.\n  A report released earlier this year indicated that vast quantities of \ngoods, as varied as toys, ski gloves, garlic, iron weight sets, men's \npants, car radiators, glassware, swimsuits, and much more, are being \nsold to U.S. consumers by PLA-owned firms and almost always without the \nknowledge of the American consumer.\n  Mr. President, this country was shocked last week by India's \nexplosion into the nuclear family. We were all dismayed that a new \nthreat to world security loomed on the horizon in India's completed \nnuclear tests. Why? Why would a country suffering from rampant poverty \nand class instability choose to spend its limited and valuable \nresources on a new nuclear weapon's program? The answer, I believe, \nlies in the failed policies of this administration.\n  It was just over 35 years ago that China last invaded India in an \nattempt to take over disputed territory. Since that time, there has \nbeen an uneasy and often hostile relationship between India and China, \nits larger neighbor to the north.\n  In addition to China's own military buildup, China was assisting \nother enemies of India in the development of their own nuclear and \nmilitary capabilities, particularly the nation of Pakistan. In fact, \nthe People's Liberation Army transferred technology relevant to the \nrefinement of weapons-grade nuclear material, including the transfer of \nring magnets, to the nation of Pakistan.\n  Mr. President, as this country moves closer to China, as we continue \nto assist its military machine, as we continue to turn a blind eye to \nChina's transfer of technology to Pakistan, why would we be surprised \nthat India would move to arm itself with nuclear weapons? Why are we \nsurprised that a country that is surrounded by a much larger and better \narmed neighbor, that that nation would develop a defense similar to our \nown policy of ``mutually assured destruction,'' a policy that prevailed \nduring the cold war? Mr. President, it was U.S. policy that led to \nthese tragic, sad developments in that entire arena in the world.\n  With all but five of China's long-range nuclear missiles pointed at \nthe citizens of the United States, it is obvious that the increasingly \naggressive People's Liberation Army views the United States as its most \nserious adversary.\n  It is a sad paradox that U.S. consumers are unwittingly funding the \nmilitary that has their hand on the nuclear buttons which threaten our \nvery existence and that our leadership is accepting money in return for \nrelaxed controls on the transfer of military technology, or at least \nthat is the allegation that has been made. That is the source and the \nsubject of the investigation that is ongoing.\n\n  Not only is China an increasing threat internationally, but within \ntheir borders they continue to oppress their own people. The latest \nState Department report on human rights, to which I have referred \nrepeatedly, says\n\n[[Page S4952]]\n\nand shows that China is still a major offender of internationally \nrecognized human rights. You pick the category, whether it is coerced \nabortion, the so-called one-child policy, whether it is slave labor and \nthe refusal to allow international inspection teams to go in and look \nat these slave labor camps, whether it is the repression of all free \nexpression or criticism of the Government, or whether it is other forms \nof human rights abuses like the repression of freedom to worship by \nreligious minorities in China, you pick the category, and you will find \nthat there is an absolute intolerance of freedom and that these ongoing \nabuses show us that they have not made progress under the current \npolicy.\n  According to a recent report in the Washington Post entitled, ``U.S.-\nChina Talks Make Little Progress on Summit Agenda,'' we find that the \nUnited States is getting very few concessions from China relating to \nthe inspection of the technology that we share with them. We are \ngetting very few concessions on limiting the proliferation of \ntechnology to third parties like Iran. We are getting very few \nconcessions on human rights conditions, particularly in the nation of \nTibet.\n  So as we make our agenda, as we make the plans for the President's \ntrip to China, what are we getting? Out of the negotiations that have \nbeen going on, what kind of concessions do we find from the Chinese \nGovernment? There have been four major high-profile prisoners who have \nbeen released. There are thousands that remain incarcerated, thousands \nwho remain languishing in Chinese laogai camps, yet we are expected to \nsay there is progress in human rights because four high-profile \nindividuals have been released.\n  So, Mr. President, with your administration currently under \ninvestigation by your own Justice Department relating to this \n``missiles for money'' transfer, it is inconceivable to me how you can \ngo forward with your planned June 24th trip to China. The cloud now \nbrewing over your administration's relationship with the leadership of \nthe People's Republic of China makes suspect any agreements that may be \nreached or any statements that may be made during this summit.\n  Mr. President, until this cloud of criminal and ethical \ninvestigations has blown over and been resolved, I urge you to delay \nyour planned trip in June, and to postpone it. It is imperative that \nthis country present a unified foreign policy. It is imperative that we \nbe united in our international relationships, and particularly our \nrelationship with this, the most populous nation on the globe.\n  But in order to have that kind of unity, one that is free of \npartisanship, one that is untainted by allegations of illegal dealing, \nit is imperative that this planned trip in June be postponed. It is \nhard for me to imagine with such a cloud over our relationship with \nChina, with such allegations of an organized, planned, if you will, \nconspiracy by the Chinese Government to influence the outcome of \nAmerican elections, how any good could come from this trip to China at \nthis stage. The atmosphere surrounding this summit has now been \npolluted.\n  Mr. President, here again is what we know. We know that the CIA \nintercepted a call which hinted at a plan by China to influence our \nelections. And may I say, my colleague, Senator Thompson, should feel \nvindicated. And those who ridiculed his allegation in this regard \nshould apologize to him personally, I believe. The American people owe \nhim a debt of gratitude for his untiring efforts to reveal this \nnefarious plan.\n  We know that the CIA intercepted that call. We know that Johnny Chung \nhas testified that the PLA, through one of their top leaders, General \nLiu, provided $80,000 to the DNC and $20,000 to other Democratic \ncauses.\n  We know that at the same time as these moneys were being given to the \nDNC, the same time those contributions were being made, Loral and \nHughes provided key missile technology to China and the PLA--under a \nwaiver granted by the Clinton administration.\n  We know that the State Department has said that this technology \ntransfer ``harmed our national security.''\n  We know this, that an executive at Motorola also claims they are \nassisting China's missile program under a waiver from the Clinton \nadministration.\n  We further know that the Clinton administration shifted the key \ndecisionmaking authority on satellite and missile technology from the \nState Department to the Commerce Department, which was a much more \nChina-friendly agency or Department.\n  We know this, that China transferred key military nuclear technology \nto Pakistan and to other rogue states like Iran, all without any action \nor denunciation by this administration.\n  We know that all but five of China's long-range nuclear missiles are \npointed at the United States.\n  We know that the PLA continues to profit from selling consumer goods \nin the United States. And we know that the PLA continues to profit from \nslave labor.\n  We know that human rights continue to be abused in China and that \nthis administration has soft-pedaled very serious human rights \nconcerns.\n  This is an ugly list, detailing a tangled relationship that now \nappears to have forever damaged our national security, a relationship \nthat now may have escalated the risk of nuclear war on the Asian \ncontinent and that will forever make it more difficult to keep the \nnuclear genie in a secure bottle.\n  This relationship must be investigated. I believe appropriate Senate \ncommittees will be doing that investigation. We know that the Justice \nDepartment is continuing this investigation, but all questions relating \nto how this relationship progressed must be answered, and the President \nshould delay and postpone his planned trip to China until those answers \nare forthcoming. The American people deserve to have those answers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S4950-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4952-S4954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TOBACCO LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, possibly later today we will begin on this \nfloor the debate and voting on the language relating to the tobacco \nsettlement. This is obviously a fairly significant piece of \nlegislation. It has the potential to represent one of the most complex \npieces of legislation ever considered by this body--at least certainly \nin my time in Government. It also represents, potentially, one of the \nlargest tax increases that this Congress will consider assessing. It \nrepresents a dramatic step in a number of different areas of law in \nwhich this Congress has toyed with but has never really fully \nparticipated.\n  I want to talk about one specific area of that issue, which is the \narea of granting to a manufacturer of a product in this country product \nliability protection, or immunity, as the term has become known. There \nare a lot of products made in this Nation today, a lot of products made \nfor the purpose of improving the lives of people, a lot of products \nmade for enjoyment, products that are made to get us through a day, and \nproducts like tobacco. Most of these products--in fact, the vast \nmajority of these products--have no special protection should they be \nproduced in a manner that harms someone. And if an individual in our \ncountry is harmed by the use of a product, they have recourse through \nour court system. It is a very integral part of the free marketplace \nthat an individual who buys a product have the ability to go into court \nand address the safety of that product as it affected that individual.\n  Why is that critical? Because a long time ago we rejected the concept \nof caveat emptor in this country--that if you sell somebody a product, \nthe person who buys the product assumes all the risk. In order to \ndiscipline the marketplace, in order to make sure we had a safe \nmarketplace where things being sold in our country in the capitalist \nsystem would have some discipline in the quality of those items, we \nhave developed a large amount of case law that allows an individual who \nthinks they have been impacted or can prove they have been impacted by, \nor harmed by, a product sold to them has a right to go into court and \nproceed to get recovery for that harm, if they can prove it.\n  It is one of the really core elements that makes our marketplace \nwork. It is one of the core elements that makes\n\n[[Page S4953]]\n\nour Nation function as a dynamic economic engine. When we start \naddressing that issue of what rights an individual has in relationship \nto purchasing a product, we have to be very sensitive to the importance \nof maintaining the capacity of an individual to get redress in the \ncourt system. I say that in reference to the tobacco bill coming at us \nin an action that I think is absolutely inexplicable from the \nstandpoint of maintaining a disciplined marketplace and from the \nstandpoint of protecting individuals, which grants to the tobacco \ncompanies of this country--and internationally for that matter--\nprotection from lawsuits where they have harmed individuals.\n  Why is this so outrageous, such an act of incomprehensibility from my \nstandpoint? Because the product we are talking about here--tobacco--has \nthree characteristics.\n  First, we know that it kills people, and the tobacco companies that \nproduced it knew and know that it kills people.\n  Second, we know that it is an addictive product, and the tobacco \ncompanies that produced it knew it was addictive and, in fact, \nstructured the product in such a way by putting a certain amount of \nnicotine into it, that they produced an even more addictive product \nthan had they simply gone forward with pure tobacco.\n  Third, the tobacco companies intentionally, purposefully, with the \nidea that they would create a larger marketplace, targeted the sale of \ntheir product on children.\n  So we have a product that kills people, and the manufacturer of that \nproduct knew it; we have a product that was addictive, and the \nmanufacturer of that product created it so that it would be addictive \nand knew it was; and we have a product where the companies that \nproduced that product targeted children to try to produce a larger \nmarketplace and a lifetime user once they get that child addicted--\nknowing that it would kill the children as they grew older. Knowing \nthat.\n  And we have picked this product, with those three incredible \ncharacteristics that are applied to the tobacco industry, to be the \nfirst product to receive major protection--or we may pick this product. \nHopefully, we won't. The bill coming before us chooses this product to \nbe the first product to receive major product liability protection--to \nsay to the companies that have produced this product that kills people, \nis addictive, and was targeted on kids: you will not have to pay the \nfull cost of the harm you have created because the U.S. Congress is \ngoing to protect you, the tobacco industry, from the liability that the \nmarketplace would force on you were we to go directly to the capitalist \nsystem which has dominated our country for over 200 years.\n\n  It is an absolute outrage that we are considering pursuing this \ncourse of action as a Congress.\n  Equally significant, I think, is the fact that we are doing this in a \nmanner where we are claiming that we are actually harming the tobacco \ncompanies. This argument is being made in the marketplace of ideas \naround here that this tobacco bill is somehow, in some way, an attack \non big tobacco, when with the immunity language in it, it is just the \nopposite--it is a protective blanket. It is an iron curtain of \nprotection for big tobacco. And it is ironic that we put this immunity \nlanguage on the table at the same time the tobacco companies have said \nthey no longer will participate in the development of this settlement.\n  This immunity language was originally designed because we said if we \ndidn't have immunity--or somebody said it; I didn't say it--it was said \nthat if immunity did not exist for the tobacco industry, the tobacco \nindustry would not come to the table and limit its advertising directed \nspecifically at children. Now the tobacco industry has said: The heck \nwith you guys. We don't like the bill, we are walking out, and we will \nhave no more to do with this. So you don't limit us in any way on our \nadvertising. And still we go forward with a bill that gives them \nimmunity.\n  And for the immunity, what do we get? A tobacco industry that has \nwalked away from the table. To begin with, we made a deal with the \ndevil--or somebody made a deal with the devil. Now the devil has walked \naway from the table, and we find that this Congress is thinking about \nfollowing the devil on its knees and saying: Please, Mr. Devil, take \nimmunity, take it; we want to throw it at you even if you won't give us \nanything for it.\n  It is beyond comprehension that we are considering pursuing this \ncourse of action, but we appear to be considering that. I just wanted \nto highlight that at this point because I think the debate has gotten a \nlittle topsy-turvy. It is a little topsy-turvy when a bill is giving, \nfor the first time in the history of our Nation, and in the \njurisprudence history of our Nation, product liability protection of \nimmense value to an industry that has produced a product that is \ninherently deadly and is addictive and is targeted on kids--the first \ntime we are going to do that, and that bill is, for some reason, \nperceived as being antitobacco. It is not antitobacco. It is actually \nvery protobacco.\n\n  Let's remember something else here as we think about this. We don't \ngive this type of protection out easily around here. It took 6 years, I \nthink it was--maybe longer--for us to give just a narrow little amount \nof protection to the airplane manufacturing industry for small planes \nbecause our airplane industry had been wiped out for small planes and \nnobody could buy a small plane made in the United States back in the \nmid-1980s. The whole industry had been wiped out by product liability \nlitigation. So we put a little sliver of protection in order to \nresurrect that industry.\n  That industry does not produce an inherently deadly product that is \naddictive and that is targeted on kids. It took us 6 years to produce \nthat little sliver of production. That is the only product liability \nprotection passed by this Congress since I have been here. We don't \ngive product liability protection to the doctor who develops and \ncreates a new valve for somebody's heart which gives that person an \nextra amount of life, or a new hip design that allows a person to have \nthe freedom to walk again. We don't give any protection to those \nindividuals. If those valves don't work and regrettably a patient is \nharmed, there is a lawsuit, and there is recovery. We don't give any \nprotection to innumerable, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of \nproducts that are lifesaving products that are produced for the \npurposes of bettering the life of an American citizen, or citizens \naround this world, whether it is a drug product, whether it is a \nmedical device product, or whether it just happens to be an automobile. \nWe don't give any product liability protection. But the first product \nliability protection we are going to give, if we pass this bill, will \nbe to an industry that is producing and that has produced a product \nthat for years--maybe generations even--it knew was deadly, it knew was \naddictive, and at least in the last 10 or 20 years it has targeted on \nkids for sale. It is beyond comprehension that we would consider doing \nthat.\n  As we move forward in this bill, I certainly hope that we will \nreconsider that proposal, because what are we getting for that immunity \nprotection? Absolutely nothing. The tobacco companies walked away from \nthe table. We have gotten nothing. And I hope that we would reconsider \nthat.\n  There will be a lot of talk about the fact, well, there is \nprotection. It isn't really protection because there is a $6 billion, \n$8 billion--we don't know. We haven't seen the final language. The \nlanguage is being written right now. It is being shifted around--I note \nfor the press that might be listening, if there is any listening--\nshifting the language all around this bill, because it will be very \ndifficult to target the immunity language in this bill. They are \nintentionally trying to make it procedurally very difficult to go after \nthis language. But they keep shifting the numbers around, too. But the \nnumber is almost irrelevant because you are dealing with an industry \nthat has the capacity to produce the profit to pick up the number. You \nwould have to put out a fairly astronomical level to have any \nsignificant impact on the profitability over the long term of this \nindustry.\n  You are giving this industry, as long as you give them immunity, the \nright to go out in the marketplace and sell this product and target it \non kids. That is what you are doing. You are giving them the right to \nsell a product that\n\n[[Page S4954]]\n\nkills kids, kills people, is addictive, and is targeted on kids. It is \njust absolutely inexcusable that we would consider doing this.\n  I certainly hope to be able to offer amendments that strip this out \nof the bill. It will be difficult because there are a lot of \nparliamentary games going on around here right now. But it would be my \nhope that we could accomplish that.\n  Mr. President, I yield such time as I may have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S4952-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n  (At the request of Mr. Abraham, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Senate is today considering The \nAmerican Competitiveness Act of 1998, a modest, balanced, and critical \nchange in our immigration laws.\n  The bill does three very important things: (1) it raises the limit on \nthe annual number of temporary visas allowed for highly skilled foreign \nborn professionals for a five-year period; (2) it increases enforcement \nand penalties to ensure the program works as intended; and (3) it \nincreases the opportunities for American students and workers to fill \nthe shortage of skilled high tech workers.\n  As we approach the 21st century, Mr. President, we face a critical \nchallenge with respect to our workforce. The challenge concerns whether \nand how America's businesses and America's educational institutions are \npreparing the potential workforce for the 21st century.\n  It is estimated that about ten percent of this country's current \ninformation technology jobs are vacant and that this critical shortage \nof programmers, systems analysts, and computer engineers will increase \nsignificantly in the next decade.\n  In few places is this shortage more acute than in my own state of \nUtah where the high tech industry grew by 12 percent in 1996 and where \nour 1,900 high tech companies plan to add almost 20,000 jobs annually \nin the next three years. The primary potential impediment to our \nstate's growth is the shortage of skilled workers.\n  Frankly, as I see it, we are only facing a real crisis if we fail to \nrespond. For now I view it as an opportunity and a challenge; perhaps \nthe greatest challenge of the next century. This challenge is to match \nthe needs of high tech employers with the preparedness of and \nopportunities for the American worker.\n  Meeting this challenge effectively will demand the attention and \ncommitment of businesses large and small; of our educational system at \nevery level; of government, principally at the state and local level; \nand of parents and students as well. All of these entities must be \nworking in partnership.\n  Just weeks ago, Mr. President, a new comprehensive international \nstudy listed American high school seniors as among the industrial \nworld's least prepared in mathematics and science. Further, in advanced \nsubjects like physics and advanced math not one of the countries \ninvolved scored lower than the U.S. If we ever needed a wake-up call, \nthis is it.\n  It is in everyone's individual interests, as well as in the overall \ninterests of this country, to enter the next century with a well-\ntrained workforce that will help keep American companies competitive in \nthe global economy.\n  Admittedly, as the grandparent of 17 young children who will be \nentering the workforce in the next century, I am enthusiastic that \ntechnology has opened so many tremendous opportunities. It remains \nclear that human capital is still the greatest asset this country has. \nWithout human know-how, the most sophisticated of computers is just a \ndumb machine.\n  Given that, there is no reason for any individual in our society who \nis willing to work should be left behind--not women, minorities, or the \ndisabled. Responding aggressively and intelligently to the need to \neducate, train, and retrain the potential pool of high tech workers in \nthe next century is the kind of affirmative action that can ensure that \nall individuals have the opportunity to work hard and prosper in the \nnext century.\n  It is, however, an unfortunate reality that this kind of long term \nsolution is insufficient to meet our most immediate needs. Thus, this \nlegislation focuses on a limited short-term measure to raise the annual \ncap, currently at 65,000, for temporary visas for highly skilled \nworkers. Notably, the cap for this year was reached last week!\n\n  Mr. President, as I understand it, critics of this legislation have \nfocused on two arguments. First, some argue that there is no real \nshortage in high tech workers. While this will be addressed in more \ndetail in due course, let me just say that I think any member with \ndoubts over which bureaucratic study to believe ought to check the help \nwanted ads in their Sunday home town papers. I think those long list of \njob vacancies for computer and engineering jobs tell the story.\n  Further, critics argue that in exchange for this modest, five year \nincrease in temporary visas, we need vast new bureaucratic requirements \nto protect American workers.\n  Mr. President, we will debate this question in more detail later, but \nlet me respond briefly now.\n  First, I think the record is pretty clear that the temporary use of a \nlimited amount of foreign talent--many of whom have attended U.S. \nuniversities and graduate schools--creates more, not fewer jobs for \nAmericans. It also insures that American employers do not move to other \ncountries with more and cheaper labor.\n  Second, there are already important limits in the law to make sure \nthis program is not abused and that these visas\n\n[[Page S4955]]\n\nare not used to hire cheaper labor. This bill enhances both the limits \nand restrictions on the use of these visas.\n  But at some point, Mr. President, you can go so overboard that a \nprogram becomes a bureaucratic nightmare of regulation and it is just \nnot worth it, particularly for small and medium sized employers. I \nthink that some of the alternatives proposed here--in response to a \nfive year increase in temporary visas by about 25,000 a year--cross \nthat line.\n  Finally, as we debate these so-called ``labor protection'' \nprovisions, I think we need a little perspective here on what aspect of \nour immigration policy really puts American jobs at risk. (A) We have \nhundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants entering this country every \nyear on top of the estimated 5 million illegal immigrants already here. \n(B) This Administration has a terrible record of failing to identify \nand deport criminal aliens who are released from prison and remain in \nthis country. (C) We have a horrible situation of an inestimable number \nof smuggled immigrants being used as slaves and indentured servants.\n  I think that these areas ought to be our principal focus if we want \nto protect jobs for American workers, not finding more bureaucratic \nhurdles for a small and limited program with a history and record of \nlittle abuse.\n  I want to close for now, Mr. President, by recognizing the hard work \nand leadership of the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee's \nsubcommittee on Immigration, Senator Abraham.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this important bill.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, Senator Hatch had hoped to be present for \nthe launching of this legislation, and when last week it appeared, on \neither Wednesday or Thursday, that was going to take place, he was \ngoing to be in the manager's chair, at least initially, to begin the \ndebate. He is not able to be here today, so we wanted to make sure his \nstatement was included at the appropriate spot in the Record, which we \nhave just done.\n  Mr. President, we are here to discuss a piece of legislation, the \nAmerican Competitiveness Act, which passed the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee a few weeks ago by a 12-to-6 vote, a piece of legislation \nwhich is extraordinarily important, I think, to our country at this \ntime if we wish to remain strong and competitive and wish to have an \neconomy that continues to grow with the success we have seen in recent \nmonths.\n  Basically, we are learning as we examine the economy that a very \nsubstantial reason for the recent economic growth stems from the \ntremendous success we have had in the development of our high-\ntechnology industries. Frankly, we are growing in those areas so fast \nthat our labor force cannot even keep up with the speed of that growth. \nIndeed, studies conducted by a variety of organizations have suggested \nthat we currently have a gap between the number of jobs in the \ninformation-technology and high-technology areas and the number of \nworkers needed to fill them.\n  A study by Virginia Tech University has indicated that there are an \nestimated 340,000 current vacancies in information-technology jobs in \nAmerica today. A study by the U.S. Department of Commerce indicates a \nprojected growth of information-technology and high-tech jobs over the \nnext decade of approximately 130,000 per year, and yet that very same \nstudy suggests we will only be producing something in the vicinity of \n25 percent of the graduates needed to fill these jobs over that \ntimeframe. Clearly, that suggests we have to get busy to make sure that \nour educational system, our job training system, and so on, meet these \nchallenges.\n  We also know that this isn't just a bunch of statistics. You need \nonly pick up the want ads of a newspaper or trade journal today and \nbrowse them and you will see, as these various newspapers I have here \ntoday suggest, the spectacular number of jobs available in these \nareas--high-tech jobs going unfilled, companies not able to find the \nskilled workers needed to fill them.\n  At the same time, the extent to which companies are being forced to \nimprovise in order to meet this challenge is also interesting as well. \nRecently, in fact, in the Washington Post, we read of the story of \nvarious young people in high school in Fairfax County, VA, who are \nbeing tapped to fill some of these positions. In fact, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record at this time one such story.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 1, 1998]\n\n   Teens With Tech Talent Rise to Top; Not Even Out of High School, \n                    Computer Jocks Rake in Big Bucks\n\n                            (By Eric L. Wee)\n\n       Life is good. That's what Doug Marcey will tell you as he \n     sits in his basement on this Friday morning.\n       While others fight their way to the office, he's writing \n     computer code in his jeans and bare feet in front of two \n     blazing 21-inch monitors. The job pays well. For his work \n     three days a week, a software company forks over $50,000 a \n     year, enough to rent his three-bedroom town house in Fairfax \n     County. Not a bad life.\n       Especially considering that Doug Marcey is only 17.\n       Computer companies in Washington and elsewhere, facing a \n     shortage of tech talent, increasingly are turning to \n     teenagers such as Doug to help fill out their employment \n     rosters. Computer jocks as young as 14 are working as \n     programmers, graphics artists and Web page designers, some of \n     them drawing very adult salaries, using skills acquired in \n     high school classes and during hours of surfing the Internet.\n       The rich job market even has some of the teenagers facing \n     the sort of decisions that gifted athletes make: Do I stay in \n     school or turn pro and make some big money?\n       ``I got tired of high school,'' said Doug, who last fall \n     chose not to return for his senior year at Fairfax's Thomas \n     Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.\n       ``It got too boring. I took all the computer courses I \n     could and basically learned all that I could,'' said Doug, a \n     6-foot-4-inch baby-faced teenager in new Armani glasses who \n     figures he'll still get a college diploma. ``I was realizing \n     that I could go out and work. . . . The cool thing about \n     computers is that I can make lots of money doing what I \n     really like doing.''\n       So three days a week, Doug does everything from Web site \n     work to helping make the company's programs more enticing to \n     customers. The rest of the time, he takes classes at George \n     Mason University. He's considering working full time, which \n     would bump his salary to $70,000.\n       David Rosenfeld hired Doug at Nu Thena Systems Inc., a \n     McLean company that creates software programs to let places \n     such as Boeing Co. and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory model \n     and test ideas on computers.\n       Rosenfeld figured if he didn't snap up Doug, someone else \n     would. Indeed, Doug said he got a half-dozen offers after his \n     junior year.\n       ``There aren't that many programmers out there that are \n     really creative,'' Rosenfeld said. ``There are plenty who \n     will do what you tell them to do, but there aren't many who \n     can see a new way to do things. That's another tier of \n     people, and I thought Doug was one of them. If you can get \n     your hands on someone like that, you never let them go.''\n       Washington area computer executives say that it's unclear \n     how many teenagers are getting full- and part-time work from \n     the area's high-tech companies but that they're sure it's \n     becoming more common. The Washington Post interviewed nine \n     such teenagers.\n       Nationally, the U.S. Department of Labor says, 22,000 \n     teenagers ages 16 to 19 worked in the computer and data-\n     processing industry last year, more than four times the \n     number three years earlier.\n       Mario Morino, one of the Washington area's early successful \n     technology entrepreneurs who now runs a Herndon-based \n     technology think tank, said the nationwide shortage of high-\n     tech workers has made those teenagers more attractive to \n     companies. But even without the labor drought, Morino said, \n     the youths would be enticing because of their incredible \n     skills.\n       Employers say teenagers have an advantage in the cyber job \n     market because they're often up on the newest technologies. \n     While adult workers have time commitments such as families, \n     teenagers can spend hours on the Internet, downloading and \n     experimenting with the latest programs.\n       Federal work regulations don't allow anyone younger than 14 \n     to work for pay. And 14- and 15-year-olds can put in only 18 \n     hours a week during the school year. Those restrictions \n     disappear at 16. The rules are there in part, Labor \n     Department officials say, to make sure that work doesn't \n     interfere with studies.\n       That's a concern of Donald Hyatt, director of Thomas \n     Jefferson High School's computer laboratory. He said he \n     constantly gets requests from companies for prospective \n     employees and doesn't have enough students to fill all the \n     summer internships offered. Every one of his seniors, he \n     said, could leave school and make a large salary.\n       But he tries to convince them that they won't develop to \n     their full potential that way. College offers opportunities \n     to learn from top programmers, he argues, not to mention the \n     value of getting a solid, broad-based education. And when it \n     comes time for cyclical layoffs, he adds, those without \n     college degrees often will be the first to go.\n       Seth Berger, a sophomore at Langley High School, isn't so \n     sure. He said his computer work has taught him much more than \n     any class. Seth looks like any other 16-year-old.\n\n[[Page S4956]]\n\n     He wears faded jeans and Nike Airs. He says ``cool'' often, \n     and when he smiles, his braces show. But Seth is the computer \n     graphics core of a company called Creative Edge Software \n     Inc.--maker of a new martial arts computer game called ``The \n     Untouchable.''\n       Travis Riggs, Seth's boss, said that soon after he was \n     hired last year at age 15, it become clear that Seth was the \n     company's best computer graphics specialist. Seth will get a \n     percentage of the net profits from the game, which he said \n     could add up to more than $50,000. Riggs has hired him for a \n     second game and made him the sole computer graphics artist, \n     bumping his cut to a six-figure sum if the game does well.\n       ``I don't know if I'm going to go to college, especially \n     since I can make money like this,'' Seth said. ``If college \n     costs 25 grand, for me it's going to cost $25,000, plus that \n     I could be making. I'm going to go to college and spend [the \n     equivalent of] $80,000 a year, to learn stuff I already know? \n     That doesn't make sense to me when I look at it that way.''\n       His mother, retired physician Amy Dwork-Berger, said she \n     and her husband have accepted that Seth probably won't attend \n     college. She sees him as an extremely bright person who would \n     be frustrated by college's regimentation. And she sees his \n     success in computer work as a positive influence on his life.\n       ``It's been marvelous,'' she said. ``College isn't the only \n     way to learn. Seth doesn't fit the mold, and to make the most \n     of his potential, you have to let him do what he needs to do. \n     . . . He's happy. He's good at it. What more could a parent \n     want?\n       Bruce Hurwitz takes a somewhat different view for his son, \n     Gus, 17, who worked last summer for Netrix, a Herndon \n     computer networking company. Gus also sells a program over \n     the Internet that lets people access their computers remotely \n     or set up Web pages. That now brings in from $750 to $2,500 a \n     month.\n       Gus said that last year he was seriously considering not \n     returning for his senior year, in part because computer work \n     seemed more challenging. But he decided to stick with school \n     and college plans after talking it over with his parents.\n       His father, a data communications executive for a French \n     company, said he has worked to explain to Gus that college is \n     a valuable time for exploring new, varied interests. And he \n     warns his son that he won't always be the young hotshot, \n     because new technologies will surface down the road.\n       ``I'm nervous that he's 17 about to go on 40,'' he said. \n     ``I want him to be a child and enjoy himself. I want him to \n     be exposed to the liberal arts and other things. I don't want \n     him to be just a computer guy.''\n       But as a computer guy, Gus is clearly exceptional. He \n     tackled some of the company's most difficult tasks at the \n     bargain rate of $9 an hour. Netrix's senior engineers ``had \n     their jaws to the ground'' in amazement as Gus showed them \n     new ways of doing things.\n       Randy Hare, Gus's former boss, estimates that Gus is as \n     qualified as a typical senior-level system administrator in \n     his thirties making $80,000 a year.\n       Although employers rave about such young computer aces, \n     they say hiring teenagers can complicate workplace dynamics.\n       Datametrics Systems Corp., in Fairfax, got a taste of that \n     when it hired Brent Metz, now 17, for the last two summers. \n     The company, which sells a program that examines large \n     computer systems for inefficiencies, gave Brent a project \n     predicted that it would take him six to eight weeks. He \n     finished it in a week and a half.\n       ``I think there were a couple of [adult programmers] who \n     felt threatened,'' said Grady Ogburn, a manager at \n     Datametrics. ``Up to that point, their programming efforts \n     were shrouded in mystery. * * * They're experienced \n     programmers taking x number of weeks to accomplish tasks, and \n     everybody thinks that's a reasonable amount of time. Now \n     here's this 16-year-old bringing all those estimates into \n     question.''\n       Brent's salary soon shot to $20 an hour, and Ogburn \n     believed he was worth double that. Now Brent is starting his \n     own Web page design company.\n       Although the junior employees generally blend in, employers \n     say, you can't get away from the fact that they are, well, \n     young.\n       Seth Berger's employer often has someone spend nearly an \n     hour traveling to pick him up after school and bring him to \n     the Dulles area office, because he can't drive yet.\n       A California software company that hired a 10-year-old for \n     the summer two years ago had to get used to seeing its new \n     software evaluator play with the copy machine on his breaks. \n     They also had to accept the grammatical errors in his \n     reports--understandable because he learned to write only a \n     few years before.\n       But most say the young people's raw enthusiasm can be like \n     a shot of adrenaline for other company employees. And \n     Rosenfeld, like other bosses, said he'll give some jobs to \n     17-year-old Doug Marcey rather than an adult programmer \n     because Doug doesn't yet know ``what's impossible.'' Adults \n     might give up, he said, but Doug will keep pushing.\n       Elliott Frutkin also believes in young talent. Last summer, \n     he dug through 200 resumes but still couldn't find the right \n     person to create graphics for his Georgetown startup Web page \n     company, Ideal Computer Strategies. Finally he found the \n     person he was looking for: the company's 14-year-old unpaid \n     intern, Josh Foes.\n       Frutin said Josh, unlike others, could do advanced graphics \n     work and understood how to translate the customers' concepts \n     onto the computer. His pay jumped to $10 an hour and later to \n     $25 an hour for urgent projects.\n       Josh, now 15, said it's changed the way he thinks about \n     money. He recalls a friend who worked at a toy store saying \n     he made more than $100 after putting in a long week. ``That's \n     the kind of thing I could make in a day, not working very \n     hard,'' Josh said.\n       Now Frutkin does everything he can to entice Josh back, \n     including offering to pay him an hourly rate equal to at \n     least $35,000 a year.\n       ``In today's market, it's impossible to find someone with \n     those skills,'' Frutkin said. ``The next ad I run may be in a \n     high school newspaper rather than The Washington Post.''\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. This story basically says, ``Teens with tech talent rise \nto the top. Not even out of high school, computer jocks rake in big \nbucks.'' And it talks about how high school students working just part \ntime are making $50,000 here in the Virginia suburbs filling some of \nthese high-tech jobs for which it is difficult to locate sufficiently \nskilled personnel.\n  The unemployment rate, of course, as we all saw in the most recent \nnumbers, is at a 30-year low, and that is great news. We want to see \nthe unemployment rate go lower. But the fact that it is so low \nbuttresses what these various statistics I have just described suggest; \nnamely, that we are at a point now where we are having a hard time \nfilling these high-tech jobs. And if we don't fill them and if the \nexpansion can't continue, I fear we will start to see the unemployment \nrate going in the other direction, because we will not be able to \nsustain the economic growth we have and because, as a consequence of \nthat, we will also start to see American companies forced to look \nelsewhere for the employees they need.\n  But the bottom line is this. There is a gap, and what we need to do, \nin my judgment, to address it is to provide both a short-term solution \nand a long-term solution as well. The long-term solution is very \ndependent on better targeting and more efficient operation of our job \ntraining programs and an educational system, a K-12 educational system, \nthat gets more young people headed in the direction of filling these \njobs as well as a higher education system that properly trains them to \ntake these jobs.\n  The legislation which we have for consideration today, as I will \nindicate a little later on, aims to address the long-term solution that \nwe are seeking. But until the education system can adjust, until the \njob training programs can be reconfigured, we need to do something in \nthe short term, and that is also what S. 1723 is about.\n  What we need in the interim is to attract and find, be able to bring \nto this country from anywhere on the globe where they might reside, the \nhighest skilled workers we can find to fill these jobs until we can \nproduce enough workers here in this country to fill them. And that is \nthe goal of this legislation.\n  There is a program under the existing immigration laws that allows \npeople to come into this country on a temporary basis to fill high-\nskilled jobs. This is a program which is called the H-1B visa program. \nSince its inception about 8 years ago, the H-1B program has had a cap \nof 65,000 visas per year that may be made available for highly skilled \npeople to come to this country to fill the types of jobs we are talking \nabout here today. Until the 1997 fiscal year, however, we had never \nreached the 65,000 cap. It was not assumed we would reach it when the \nprogram was originally created. It was set at a fairly high level--at \nleast it seemed to be the case at the time. But in 1997 the cap was \nhit, Mr. President. It was hit approximately early in July of 1997. \nWhat that meant was that at that point and from that point forward \nuntil the end of the fiscal year, companies in desperate need of high-\ntech workers, unable to find them in the United States, were also \nunable to bring them here from another country.\n  We estimated at that time in the Immigration Subcommittee that the \ncap would be hit even earlier in the 1998 fiscal year, and our estimate \nwas correct. The cap was hit 1 week ago Friday. It was hit, in other \nwords, at the very beginning of May in this fiscal year. It is our \nprojection that if we do not increase this cap, it will be hit even \nearlier in the 1999 fiscal year, perhaps as early as February.\n  What it means for this year is very simple. Companies in the United\n\n[[Page S4957]]\n\nStates, high-tech companies that need skilled workers and cannot locate \nthem here in the United States at this time--because in spite of all \nthese want ads, there just aren't people adequately skilled to meet \nthese specialized jobs--are not going to be able to bring another \nindividual here until next October.\n  What that means in terms of its implications on the economy is very \nsignificant. There are a lot of ramifications to not increasing the \ncap. First, as I have alluded to already, there will be the potential \nto impair our economic growth. If we can't fill these jobs, the \ncompanies are forced to defer and delay the initiation of new projects \nand new product lines and a variety of other similar types of programs, \nthen clearly it will have an impact and effect on economic growth. It \nmeans key projects will be put on hold. And we have a list. Since this \ncap was hit the other day, Mr. President, I have heard from an array of \ncompanies indicating that they envision in this year being forced to \neither take people off payroll or not to hire prospective candidates \nbecause they will not be able to get the talent they need to fill these \nkey spots.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the full list.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n   Organizations Endorsing the American Competitiveness Act (S. 1723)\n\n\n                         business organizations\n\n       American Business for Legal Immigration.\n       American Council of International Personnel.\n       American Electronics Association.\n       American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n       The Business Roundtable.\n       Business Software Alliance.\n       Computing Technology Industries Association.\n       Electronics Industry Association.\n       Information Technology Association of America.\n       National Association of Manufacturers.\n       National Technical Services Association.\n       Semiconductor Industry Association.\n       TechNet.\n       U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n       Motion Picture Association of America, Inc.\n       PHARMA.\n\n\n                          ethnic organizations\n\n       Advocates for the Rights of Korean Americans.\n       American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.\n       American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin.\n       American Latvian Association in the United States.\n       Congress of Romanian Americans.\n       The Indus Entrepreneurs.\n       Joint Baltic American National Committee.\n       Korean Americans Association.\n       Lithuanian American Council.\n       National Albanian American Council.\n       National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium.\n       The Polish American Congress.\n       Portuguese-American Leadership Council.\n       Slovak League of America.\n       U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.\n       U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce.\n       National Federation of Filipino American Associations.\n       Emerald Isle Immigration Center.\n       India Abroad Center for Political Awareness.\n       B'Nai B'Rith International.\n       National Immigration Forum.\n       Immigration and Refugee Services of America.\n\n\n                        university organizations\n\n       American Association of Community Colleges.\n       American Association of State Colleges and Universities.\n       American Council on Education.\n       Association of American Universities.\n       College and University Personnel Association.\n       Council of Graduate Schools.\n       Madonna University.\n       Michigan State University.\n       Michigan Technological University.\n       NAFSA: Association of International Educators.\n       National Association of Independent Colleges and \n     Universities.\n       National Association of State Universities and Land Grant \n     Colleges.\n       University of Michigan.\n\n\n                         michigan organizations\n\n       Bay de Noc Community College.\n       Citation Corporation-Automotive Sales & Engineering \n     Division.\n       Compuware Corporation.\n       ITT Industries.\n       Energy Conversion Devices, Inc.\n       Michigan Manufacturers Association.\n       Swiftech Computing, Inc.\n       ERIM International, Inc.\n       Lansing Regional Chamber of Commerce.\n       Meijer Corporation.\n       Northern Initiatives.\n       Phillips Service Industries, Inc.\n       The Right Place Program-Grand Rapids.\n       Sensors, Inc.\n       Software Services Corporation.\n       Suomi College.\n       Superb Manufacturing, Inc.\n\n\n         leading scientific and medical research organizations\n\n       American Society for Biochemistry.\n       American Society for Cell Biology.\n       Association of Independent Research Institutes.\n       Biophysical Society.\n       Genetics Society of America.\n\n\n                          other organizations\n\n       Americans For Tax Reform.\n       Empower America.\n\n\n                         editorial endorsements\n\n       The Washington Post.\n       Washington Times.\n       Miami Herald.\n       Detroit News.\n       Ann Arbor News.\n       Seattle Times.\n       The Courier-Journal, Louisville, KY.\n       The Atlanta Journal.\n       Chicago Tribune.\n       The Columbia Dispatch.\n       Fairfax Journal, Fairfax, VA.\n       Crain's Detroit Business.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Let me just mention a few of the companies we have heard \nfrom already: Intel, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Ford Motor Company, Eli \nLilly. The list goes on and on, and it spans a variety of areas from \nmedical research to information technology. And as those projects go on \nhold, it means not only that the company will not be growing as fast as \nwe would like to see, it also means that we will not be filling as many \nnew job opportunities with people WHO currently are hoping that those \ncompanies will begin their new product lines. It is estimated by the \nHudson Institute that if we don't increase this cap, we could see a \nsignificant impact on economic growth. They have even projected it to \nbe as much as $200 billion in lost output. That almost works out to \nnearly $1,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States.\n\n  But the ramifications actually go beyond simply not being able to \nfill those positions until next October. There are other implications \nas well. For example, if we can't hire these talented people and bring \nthem here now, foreign competitors can and will fill that gap, and we \nwill lose people to other countries who will then be the ones \ndeveloping the technologies that we are talking about. At the same \ntime, if we don't even reach the cap and if American companies can't \nbring the talent here to fill their needs, it increases the \npossibility--in fact it is a very real possibility--that they will \nbegin to move some of the operations we are talking about overseas. \nThat means we don't just lose that one job which we are attempting to \nfill through a temporary worker. It means existing jobs in the United \nStates could be lost if product lines of divisions, if new projects, \nare initiated in another country.\n  Obviously, we don't want to lose American jobs simply because we \ncan't get certain specific skilled workers to this country to begin \nthese kinds of operations. The types of operations we are talking about \nare also very significant. We are not just talking about a new widget \nbeing developed. We are talking about dealing with enormous important \nproblems confronting our country at this time. We have all heard in \nrecent weeks from Senator Bennett, our colleague from Utah, who is the \nSenate's foremost expert on the problems we confront with the year 2K \nsituation. Now, we have a Senate task force to examine those issues \nspecifically with what the intent is for us in the Senate, but what we \nclearly know is there is not one sector of our economy that is not \ngoing to be impacted by the year 2K problems.\n  I have heard from numerous companies and numerous individuals trying \nto meet the year 2K challenges, who said it is absolutely vital that we \nincrease the H-1B visa program at this time so we can bring in \nsufficient talent to deal with the year 2K problems between now and the \nend of 1999. Yet, as I say, we have hit the cap.\n  I will be talking about this in greater detail as we go along this \nafternoon, but let me talk specifically about what our legislation \nwould do to meet these challenges, both the short-term problem we have, \nsuch as the year 2K problem, and the long-term problem we are trying to \naddress, the challenge of having enough American workers to meet the \ndramatic increases in job creation\n\n[[Page S4958]]\n\nin the information technology sector of the economy.\n  Our legislation would do the following: First, it would temporarily \nincrease from 65,000 to 95,000 the cap on H-1B visas. That means an \nincrease of 30,000 per year.\n  In addition, we have created as a safety valve--so we would have at \nleast the possibility of congressional oversight and examination if we \nhit that 95,000 cap sooner than anticipated--a safety valve which would \npermit us to use up to 20,000 visas from the H-2B program, if such \nvisas were available and unused by that program in the previous year. \nAs I say, our legislation has a 5-year sunset to it. In short, we tried \nto make this a short-term rather than a long-term focus piece of \nlegislation in the hope that in that 5-year period we can develop \nthrough job training programs and our educational system the talent we \nneed right here at home. So it would be a 5-year program. Those \nincreases we have mentioned would be for 5 years.\n  In addition, starting in the 1999 fiscal year, we would separate out \nof the H-1B program health care workers, and create a new category, the \nH1-C program with a limit of 10,000 annual visas for health care \nemployees. We do that because a number of people have expressed \nconcerns about the high-tech program, the skilled worker program. That \naddresses concerns that if we make this significant increase in the \nnumbers, too many of those will end up being used in areas which do not \nnecessarily, right now, seem to have the need that the high-tech \ninformation technology sector requires. So what we have decided to do \nin the legislation is essentially to create a new category of 10,000 \nvisas that would be the limit annually for health care workers. That \nwould reach 85,000 for the information technology and other high-\nskilled categories.\n  In addition, our legislation calls upon the INS to provide us with \nmore information with regard to the H-1B program. One of the \nfrustrations that we have all had, and I know the Senator from \nCalifornia and I have talked about this in the subcommittee when we \ndiscussed this program, is that we don't actually know how many workers \nare coming in, into various categories, because the records are not \nthat explicit. We have records of who applies for these H-1B visas, but \nwe do not and are unable to get a count on how they actually are \ndistributed. We need that information if we are going to do the kind of \nlong-term focus that I think necessary to properly oversee this whole \nprogram.\n  To that end, and in addition to getting numbers--thanks to an \ninitiative that Senator Kyl, a member of our subcommittee, has \nproposed--we include in the legislation the conducting of a study by \nthe National Science Foundation to try to more accurately gauge our \nhigh-tech, skilled worker needs.\n\n  During the deliberations on this legislation in the committee when we \nhad our hearings and so on, a lot of different issues were raised as to \nwhat the real long-term needs will be. Senator Kyl, I think, has wisely \nproposed because our program is a 5-year program with a sunset that we, \nin a shorter period of time, study the actual situation, what the real \nneeds are today, what are likely to be long term, to determine whether \nthe projections in such things as the Commerce Department study bear \nout.\n  Finally, as I said, our legislation is aimed at being both a short-\nterm as well as a long-term fix. The short-term fix is to increase the \nnumber of H-1B visas. The long-term fix is to provide various \nmechanisms by which American workers can be trained to fill these jobs. \nThus, a key part of our legislation is a scholarship authorization \nwhich authorizes funds for scholarships in science and math for needy \nstudents. We have worked very closely with the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee on this part of the legislation. We will be talking \nabout it, I think, a little bit later. We have worked with Senators \nCollins and Reed who have been involved in the higher education \nreauthorization bill to try to make sure our language tracks the \nlanguage in that legislation. And we believe that, by focusing more \nresources on science and math and computer science training, we can \nhave an excellent chance of meeting some of the long-term needs that \nhave been referenced in my remarks today.\n  That is essentially what the legislation attempts to do. It also \nattempts to provide protection, protection for American workers to make \ncertain the H-1B program is not abused. Already in the existing program \nI believe there is a very firm set of protections that stand as \nsafeguards for American workers. Essentially, what those protections \nare is a requirement that anyone who brings somebody to this country \nunder the H-1B visa program must pay that individual the higher of the \nprevailing wage or the salary in their company paid to people of like \nexperience and skill. We think that is a pretty effective approach and \nit has proven to be effective. In the entire history of the H-1B \nprogram there have been only eight willful violations determined to \nhave existed. But it was our view that if we were going to increase the \nnumbers we should also increase the vigilance with which we look at \nthis program and the penalties against anyone who might seek to take \nadvantage of it.\n  So in addition to the aforementioned components of the legislation, \nour bill does the following: It increases from $1,000 to $5,000 per \nviolation the fines to be imposed on any company that fails to meet \nthat standard I indicated of requiring an H-1B individual to be paid \nthe higher of the prevailing wage in the industry or the actual \nsalaries paid in that company for this type of position.\n  Furthermore, in an attempt to make certain that no one in any way \nattempts to lay off an American worker to bring in an H-1B employee, we \nimpose a $25,000 fine per violation and a 2-year debarment from the \nprogram where anyone violates the prevailing wage rule and it is \ndetermined has laid off somebody to fill the position with an H-1B \nworker.\n  In short, I think we have taken the steps necessary to guarantee that \nabuses in this program will not occur. And, as I said, at least in its \nhistory so far, very few have occurred. The legislation enjoys broad \nsupport, support here on the floor of the Senate on a bipartisan basis, \nsupport throughout the business community. It has been endorsed by the \nUnited States Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of \nManufacturers, Tech Net--a high-tech trade organization--the \nInformation Technology Association of America, the Motion Picture \nAssociation of America, and numerous other organizations.\n  It, likewise, enjoys broad support of the academic community, because \nmany of these H-1B workers actually come to the country and assume jobs \nin academia teaching American kids the skills needed to fill these \nhigh-tech jobs. As a consequence, the legislation is endorsed by the \nAssociation of American Universities, the National Association of State \nUniversities and Land Grant Colleges, and the American Council on \nEducation.\n  It is similarly supported by a broad array of heritage groups, \nincluding the National Asian Pacific-American Legal Immigration \nConsortium, National Immigration Forum, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of \nCommerce, the Polish-American Congress, B'nai B'rith, and a variety of \nothers.\n  I will summarize later why this legislation must be passed, but I \nthink in this opening statement I have laid out the key essentials. \nRight now, against the backdrop of very low unemployment in this \ncountry, we have a shortage of skilled workers. We need to address that \non both the short- and long-term basis. Our legislation tries to do \nboth.\n  In the short-term sense, we increase the cap on H-1B workers to come \nto this country. We need that or else we are going to see American jobs \nlost, not gained. This is not a zero sum situation, Mr. President. \nWithout change in this cap, without doing it soon, we will start to see \na very significant impact, I believe, in our high-tech industries.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. We expect to have additional \nspeakers on our side as the afternoon goes on.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, very shortly, Senator Kennedy, the \nranking member of the Immigration\n\n[[Page S4959]]\n\nSubcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, will be presenting an \namendment which I will strongly support. It is very similar to the \namendment which was offered in committee, proposed both by the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and myself representing California. I voted for it \nthen, and I will vote for it now.\n  I did in committee also vote for the Abraham bill, because Senator \nAbraham is correct, there is a problem. The high-tech industry is \nconsistently turning to foreign nationals to fill low-level computer-\nrelated jobs.\n  In my State of California, this is a very big deal. High tech \ncurrently provides about 814,000 jobs in California. That is 18\\1/2\\ \npercent of the total California employment. So it is a substantial \nindustry. When this industry says to their Senator, ``We can't hire \nhigh school or college graduates to fill our needs,'' I obviously have \nto be very concerned.\n  I have become very saddened by our high-tech CEOs who repeatedly tell \nme they cannot find qualified workers. As a matter of fact, during the \nhearings in the Judiciary Subcommittee, we even heard one CEO say that \nthey advertised a brand new, I think it was a Ford Mustang for any \nindividual who would take one of these computer-related jobs.\n  Senator Abraham is correct, the industry will reach the cap of 65,000 \nby May of this year. As Senator Abraham stated, this presents a very \nserious problem.\n  Let's talk for a moment about this 65,000 cap and the way it is now. \nThe 1996 Labor Department report shows that only 41 percent of the H-\n1Bs presently are computer-related professions. Another 26 percent are \nphysical therapists and health professionals. It is not only computer-\nrelated people who are presently coming into this country on a H-1B \nvisa, 26 percent of them are physical therapists, which is kind of \ncanny to me to think we can't find American health therapists for these \njobs? The IG's report also shows that some H-1B employers have \ncontracted their employees out to other companies functioning as job \nshops, companies that hire predominantly or exclusively H-1B's and \ncontract them out. Current law does not prohibit this practice of \nrunning these job shops, despite the concern that these job shops are \npaying the H-1B's less than the prevailing wage and have a negative \nimpact on the American worker's ability to keep his or her job.\n\n  The 1996 Labor Department report also indicates that 48 percent of \nemployment-based, permanent immigration is admitted through the H-1B \nprogram, and this is a major point I want to make. The H-1B program is \nnot necessarily just a temporary worker program. Fifty percent of these \nworkers achieve permanent status and remain in this country essentially \nforever. This is a big problem.\n  From the CRS report on this issue, dated May 13, 1998, I read the \nfollowing:\n\n       In practical terms, the H-1B visa links the foreign student \n     to legal permanent residence. Anecdotal accounts--\n\n  And I think Senator Abraham mentioned correctly that we really don't \nknow; the recordkeeping in this program is very bad--\n\n       Anecdotal accounts tell of foreign students who are hired \n     by U.S. firms as they are completing their programs. The \n     employers obtain H-1B visas for the recent graduates, and if \n     the employees meet expectations, the employers may also \n     petition for the nonimmigrants to become legal permanent \n     residents, through one of the employment-based immigration \n     categories. Some policymakers consider this a natural and \n     positive chain of events, arguing that it would be foolish to \n     educate these talented young people, only to make them leave \n     to work for foreign competitors. Others consider this a \n     pathway program.\n\n  This is really my point and my concern about the Abraham legislation. \nThe Abraham legislation essentially is a 5-year program, and over 5 \nyears, it would permit 555,000 new foreign nationals to come into this \ncountry, 50 percent of whom would remain. This is the 555,000 that is \nspecially targeted for high tech by the Abraham legislation. However, \nthe Abraham legislation also provides an additional 10,000 workers per \nyear for non-high-tech jobs. That is a total of 50,000 over 5 years. So \nwhen you add that together over 5 years, this is an additional 605,000 \nforeign workers coming into this country, taking jobs which many of us \nbelieve should be filled by American young people, American high school \nand college graduates. This is over a 77-percent increase in numbers, \nMr. President.\n  The amendment that Senator Kennedy will offer is essentially a 3-year \nprogram which is a total of only 270,000 workers coming in targeted for \nhigh tech over the 3 years. The program would sunset after 3 years, and \nwe would have an opportunity to take a good look at that program at the \nend of that period of time, hopefully have better records by then and \nhopefully be better aware of what the needs are after that period of \ntime.\n  I mentioned that there are about 815,000 high-tech workers in this \ncountry in California alone. So this is really a huge new immigration \nprogram over 5 years. Nobody should think to the contrary. It will let \nin over 600,000 foreign nationals, one-half of whom, by our own past \nstatistics, will remain in this country as legal aliens able to work in \nthis country. In other words, they will have green cards, and they will \ncontinue to go from temporary worker to permanent worker, thereby \ntaking up a job which an American young person could occupy.\n  Now, this troubles me. It really troubles me. And the reason it \ntroubles me is because these workers are not necessarily superstars. \nThe superstars come in. These are lower level computer programmers. \nThey really are $50,000-a-year job occupants.\n  As a matter of fact, there is a chart that essentially shows the \nsalaries. Seventy-five percent of the workers who have been coming in \nunder this program are at salaries from $25,000 to $50,000. So these \nare not, in the main, the jobs of $100,000 or more. These are exactly \nthe jobs that graduates of the new age, graduates into the global \neconomy from our schools all over the United States should be taking to \ndevelop a sinecure in an industry that is only going to bloom in the \nfuture.\n  So I am troubled by the Abraham bill's numbers. Again, they are \n605,000 over 5 years. And 550,000 would go for high-tech workers as \nopposed to the amendment that Senator Kennedy will shortly make, which \nwould be a 3-year program, 270,000 jobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor at the present time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, thank you.\n  I would like to put a couple of points into perspective, first of \nall, which relate to the statements of the Senator from California with \nregard to the numbers. I indicated in my opening statement we have a \nvery significant problem just understanding exactly what the numbers \nare.\n  For instance, the issue with respect to physical therapists taking 26 \npercent of these positions--we do not know that is the percentage of \napplications that have come to INS. And our legislation attempts to do \ntwo things to address it.\n  First, it attempts to force INS to tell us not what the application \nnumbers are but who actually gets the H-1B positions. We need to know \nthat to shape this program more effectively.\n  Second, with respect to health care workers and physical therapists, \nand so on, our legislation actually attempts to put a cap on that \ncategory of 10,000, so that, in fact, 26 or 30 percent of whatever of \nthe H-1B visas cannot go into that category. The legislation that the \nSenator from California alludes to, that would not put that cap in \nplace, means that literally all of the positions could go to these \ncategories that I think most of us would agree do not need to be filled \nwith H-1B workers. In fact, our legislation, the bill before us, \nattempts to move us in a direction to attempt to address that problem.\n  Next, with respect to the actual numbers themselves, the statistics \nof the Senator from California are not accurate. Currently, if we do \nnothing legislatively, 325,000 people will come in over the next 5 \nyears under the H-1B program. Our legislation increases that amount by \n30,000 per year to 475,000. And the amount that was referenced with \nrespect to health care workers comes out of that 95,000. It is not in \naddition to the 95,000; it is 10,000 under the 95,000 per year cap. So \nthe numbers that were just referenced simply are not correct.\n  Lastly, I would like to just comment this is not a bill about foreign \nexchange students, but I just say this: We\n\n[[Page S4960]]\n\nalready have in place a system by which individuals can get permanent \ngreen cards annually. Approximately 140,000 such cards are available \neach year. We do not use all of those. So whether or not people coming \nin under the H-1B program end up becoming permanent employees has not \nforced that number higher. We do not even use the 140,000. But to the \nextent that we do use permanent green cards for anyone, it seems to me, \nat least, that it makes more sense for the people who receive them to \nbe people who came to the United States, were trained in our colleges, \nthen worked in our companies and paid taxes. It seems to me they are \nmore valid permanent green card recipients than individuals who did \nnone of the above.\n  Why should we train people at our colleges to take on these very \nimportant 21st century jobs and then see them leave and go work for \nforeign competitors? Again, it would make some sense to bring that \nissue up if we were going to be limiting the number of permanent green \ncards available on an annual basis, but this legislation does not \nattempt to do this, nor was that part of anyone's proposal.\n\n  So I think, in sum, that the earlier statements I made remain \naccurate and certainly are on point to deal with the worker shortage we \nconfront right now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The amendment that the Senator from Massachusetts \nwill propose will not have a 3-year limit on it at this time. That was \nour bill we had in committee. Rather, it will require that employers \nlook for American workers first before they hire foreign workers and \nthat they have not laid off American workers 6 months prior or 3 months \nafter they put in an application.\n  So I am happy to be able to make that clarification. And I believe \nSenator Kennedy will be here momentarily.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Missouri to speak \non the bill.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask unanimous consent at the conclusion of the 5 \nminutes speaking on this bill that I be able to continue for 10 minutes \nas in morning business to address other issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to begin by thanking Senator Abraham of Michigan for his \nattention to this very important issue. It seems to me that this is a \nfundamental issue that relates to the success and survival of this \nculture in the next century.\n  The long-term impact of a Government-imposed shortage of high-tech \nworkers is clear. If workers cannot come to these jobs, then the jobs \nwill have to go to the workers.\n  We have an option here, an option of whether or not we bring workers \nto these jobs and have the industry in the United States or these \ncompanies decide to take these jobs to wherever the workers are \notherwise.\n  Let us not fool ourselves. There are several countries that have the \nresources to begin a strong technology sector. I believe it would \nbehoove us to make sure that the technology sector continues to exist \nin the United States of America.\n  Some of my colleagues seem to view this bill too narrowly. They view \nit as an immigration issue and an immigration issue alone. My \ncolleagues are not to be blamed for wanting to make certain that \nGovernment policies respect the needs and interests of American \nworkers. This legislation, however, does not threaten American workers \nin any way. No one is being replaced.\n  We are not dealing with a situation in which legal immigrants are \ncoming to the United States to compete with low-income, native-born \nworkers or, worse yet, coming to live off the Federal dole. That is not \nthe situation here.\n  The shortage of workers in this industry is well documented. Filling \nthese jobs with skilled workers, whether born here or overseas, is in \nAmerica's best interests. We have a chance to either import the workers \nor export the jobs. It seems to me that clearly we would want to bring \nin these critical workers who can sustain this industry and help us \nsustain it as an American industry.\n  Indeed, it would be a grave mistake, in my judgment, to send even any \nportion of this dynamic and critical sector abroad in search of \nworkers. It would send the wrong signal. It would be the wrong \nstrategy. The economic and national security benefits of keeping this \nindustry in the United States are substantial. They should not be \noverlooked. This industry will continue to flourish. But if the U.S. \nGovernment needlessly restricts one of the key inputs--that is, the \nnecessary labor for growing--it will flourish somewhere else. We don't \nneed for this industry to flourish on someone else's shores. We want \nthis industry to flourish on our own.\n  I understand some of our colleagues will seek to amend the \nlegislation. These amendments have noble sounding purposes and titles, \nbut they are wolves in sheep's clothing. Excluding those that the \nsubcommittee chairman has agreed to accept, these amendments are \ndesigned to kill the bill and should be defeated for that reason. Isn't \nit ironic that some Members are unwilling to help an industry do \nexactly what we want every industry in this country to do, and that is \nto become the best in the world. Some people want to keep our industry \nfrom attaining that standard.\n  We make the same mistake over and over again in Congress. We already \nare forcing the encryption industry to relocate to foreign shores \nthrough antiquated export restrictions, and now Members entertain \namendments that will make difficult the United States success in the \nentire technology sector by restricting the import of needed skilled \nworkers.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing amendments are those that would let loose \na swarm of Federal bureaucrats into the high-tech industry to \ninvestigate hiring practices. Is this the role that we want Government \nto play in any industry--to create another set of regulatory hurdles \nthat stifle growth and productivity? The energy of this recovery, the \nenergy of our economy, has been provided by the high-tech industry, and \nit has been able to do so absent Government interference and control. I \nbelieve it would be an inappropriate decision, it would be a tremendous \ninsult, and, frankly, an injury to this industry if we were to move \nGovernment in massively, as some of these amendments will propose.\n  As I have said before, we can allow workers to come to these jobs in \nAmerica, or we can force those who want these jobs done to take the \nproduction facilities and the jobs that go with them someplace else. It \nseems that would be insanity. It does not take a highly trained \ncomputer expert to figure out what we want. We want to keep the jobs \nhere. If we have the jobs here, and we can get the people, then keep \nthe jobs here rather than export the jobs to where the workers may \nhappen to be.\n  The technology sector of our country has had tremendous success by \nalmost any measure--in productivity, in capital, in growth and in \nsales.\n  However, this thriving sector is running into a problem that even the \nbest engineers cannot design around--a lack of individuals with the \nnecessary skills to power the growth of American ``high-tech'' \nindustries. The common approach of Silicon Valley of ``Just Fix It'' \ndoesn't work in this instance--the engineers cannot overcome design \nflaws or test for efficiencies because the problem is imposed not by \noutdated technology but by the outdated laws of the federal government. \nThe high tech sector has come to the federal government to ask for \nassistance in an area that is in the control of the federal \ngovernment--the granting of visas to highly skilled technical workers.\n\n[[Page S4961]]\n\n  I rise today to applaud an industry that is so dynamic that it has \ndepleted the tremendous human resources available in this country so \nswiftly. We, as a nation, should take great pride in our technology \nsector, and even greater pride that this robust sector of our economy \ncontinues to thrive.\n  One frightening trend that has begun to emerge in this Congress is \nthe consideration of laws that would directly involve the federal \ngovernment in the operations of the technology sector. Any number of \nbills introduced with the best of intentions would have ignored budding \nand dynamic technology and instead imposed a quick legislative fix that \nwould have remained in the code for years. This push for instant \ngratification and instant solutions will lead to disastrous results in \nthe dynamic area of high technology. Instead, Members of Congress must \nstart making the tough decisions on how to allow our technology sector \nto continue to be an engine of growth for our economy, continue to \nprovide greater efficiencies for business, guarantee lifestyle \nenhancements to all people, and continue to position the United States \nas the world's technology leader. We need to focus less on imposing new \ngovernment obstacles to tomorrow's technologies and more on removing \ngovernment as an obstacle to growth in this dynamic sector.\n\n  This brings me to Senator Abraham's legislation, the American \nCompetitiveness Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important \nlegislation because it removes a government-imposed limit on the growth \nof the technology sector. We should all support the Abraham legislation \nas a means to facilitate the continued growth and success of an \nindustry that is so important to our nation.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I must call attention to another troubling \naspect of this debate, the glaring omission of leadership from the \nClinton Administration. I am frustrated by this Administration's \ncontinuing talk of support for the industry of Silicon Valley. As I \ncast about in search of that support I find precious little. So I just \nask--where is the Administration support for this important \nlegislation? Where is the support for a well thought-out encryption \npolicy, for the elimination of arbitrarily imposed taxation of the \nInternet--which currently remains international in scope but subject to \ntax by any municipality, or for leadership in confronting what may be \nthe most dangerous threat to our economy, The Year 2000 bug? Mr. \nPresident, where was the Administration just two weeks ago when we were \nfighting to take a truly damaging provision on digital signatures out \nof the IRS bill?\n  I urge the Administration live up to its words and help us create \njobs and growth in the technology sector. It is time for the \nAdministration to stop talking the talk and begin walking the walk.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I commend the \nsubcommittee chairman, Senator Abraham, for his outstanding work in \nthis respect. It is not merely an immigration bill; this is a bill that \nrelates to the success of the high-tech industry, an industry in which \nAmerica continues to be the No. 1 power.\n  What is the situation regarding time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank you for informing me of that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S4954-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4961-S4962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TOBACCO SETTLEMENT LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I rise in opposition to the massive tax increases that \nare contained in the so-called tobacco settlement. I want the Senate to \nknow that I will fight to kill any tobacco bill that contains a tax \nincrease of the magnitude being considered, $868 billion.\n  The proposed tobacco bill is nothing more than an excuse for \nWashington to raise taxes and spend more money on Federal programs. It \na shame that bad decisions made by free people in Washington, DC, \nbecome the basis for a monumental task. The decision to smoke isn't a \ngood decision, but it is something that people are free to do. And we \nare using it as the basis for an incredible and substantial tax.\n  Let me just say that this tobacco settlement is the largest proposed \nincrease in Government and bureaucracy since the proposed health care \nscheme, which both this Senate and the American people had the good \njudgment to reject.\n  It would be a travesty for Congress to use tobacco as a smokescreen \nfor imposing this massive tax increase on the people of America and to \ncover an expansion of the ``nanny'' state.\n  This massive tax increase would be levied against those who are least \ncapable of paying for it. According to the Congressional Research \nService, ``Tobacco taxes * * * are perhaps the most regressive tax \nlevied.''\n  Here we have a tax that falls most heavily on poor people. About 60 \npercent of this tax would fall on families earning $30,000 or less. Let \nme go to this chart. People earning under $30,000 would pay 59.4 \npercent of this tax; people paying $115,000 or more, 3.7 percent of \nthis tax. This is nothing more or less than a massive tax increase, the \nincidence of which falls most heavily on poor families earning $30,000 \nor less. I think many times these are young families--mom and dad, \nmaybe a couple of kids--stretching to make ends meet on $30,000 or \nless, and the lion's share, the overwhelming lion's share, is coming \nout of the pockets of individuals making less than $30,000 a year.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, households earning \nless than $10,000 would feel the bite of the tax most of all. Smokers \nmaking less than $10,000 would pay in excess of 5 percent of their \nincome in additional taxes. This is a massive tax increase on the poor. \nIf Washington gets its way, cigarette excise taxes will rise by $1.50 a \npack. For someone who smokes two packs a day and whose spouse perhaps \nsmokes one pack as well, this amounts to a tax increase of $1,642.50 \nannually. And that tax increase for three packs a day on the family \nwould be the same, whether the family was very poor or the family was \nvery wealthy. To find out the magnitude of this tax, if you take $1,642 \na year out of the income of poor Americans, you are really impairing \nsignificantly their ability to provide for their families.\n  It is immoral for this Government to tell poor families, you cannot \nprovide for yourselves; we are going to take the money from you and \nforce you to come to the Government to ask us to provide for you. \nMoreover, the new taxes paid by someone smoking two packs daily would \nexceed the per capita tax relief contained in the Senate budget \nresolution by a factor of 50.\n  The Senate budget resolution proposed tax relief for America. For the \naverage smoker, smoking two packs a day, they would have a tax burden \nadded to them 50 times as great as the tax relief that we proposed in \nthe budget. I think that is unconscionable. It is obvious that the most \naddictive thing in Washington is not nicotine, the most addictive thing \nis taxing and spending.\n  In the 15 years prior to 1995, Congress has passed 13 major tax \nincreases. A list of those tax increases includes the Crude Oil \nWindfall Profit Tax of 1980, the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980, \nTax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, Social Security \nAmendments of 1983. Last year's Taxpayer Relief Act was the first \nmeaningful tax cut since 1981.\n  The tobacco tax increase will more than erase--more than erase--all \nof the benefit to the American people of the tax cut passed last year. \nThe tobacco tax increase also exceeds by a factor of 3 the relief \nprojected in the budget resolution passed by the Senate last month, \neven as it applies to the entire population, not just to smokers.\n  The Congressional Budget Office expects the budget surplus will swell \nto between $43 billion and $63 billion this year. Why is that? \nTaxpayers are working longer, they are working harder, they are paying \nmore taxes. You don't have the swelling of revenue to the Federal \nGovernment because people aren't paying taxes; you have it precisely \nbecause they are paying taxes. Taxes are going up. And we should be \ndebating how to return money to the taxpayers, not how to siphon more \nout of their pockets--especially out of hard-working Americans at \nlower-income levels. The proposed tobacco bill is nothing more than an \nexcuse for Washington to raise taxes and spend more money on new \nFederal programs. I will fight to kill any tobacco tax bill that \ncontains a tax increase of the magnitude being considered. It is an \naffront to the dignity of Americans and\n\n[[Page S4962]]\n\nit is immoral to take this kind of money away from poor families, which \nwill force them into dependence on government in some circumstances, \nrather than allow them to have the money they earn to spend on their \nfamilies.\n\n  To paraphrase President Reagan, the whole controversy comes down to \nthis: Are you entitled to the fruits of your own labor, or does \nGovernment have some presumptive right to tax and tax and tax?\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S4961-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4962-S4975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know we have the time allocation. Could \nthe Chair tell me how much remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's side has 47 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield such time as I might use.\n  Mr. President, as of May 7 the immigration quota for skilled \ntemporary foreign workers was full. The 65,000 visas available each \nyear under the H-1B visa category have been claimed. For the remainder \nof the fiscal year--almost 5 months--no more visas are available. The \nquota filled rapidly this year because U.S. high-tech computer \ncompanies are bringing in foreign programmers in record numbers. \nAmerica's high-tech industry is undergoing extraordinary growth, and \nthe demand is high for more workers, so they have turned to the \nimmigration laws to bring them in from abroad. A temporary increase in \nthe immigration quota is justified. We all want to ensure that our \nhigh-tech industries get the workers they need to remain healthy and \ncompetitive.\n  I have always felt that with regard to our immigration laws we ought \nto, first of all, recognize the importance of families and family \nreunification; and then, secondly, if they are going to bring in those \nwho have special skills, which is going to expand the American economy, \na case could be made for those individuals. They could make that--\nparticularly in the years of 1980 and as we came into 1990, we are \nfacing the unemployment that we are facing, we did recognize the \nimportance of these special skills that will result in expanding the \nAmerican economy and expanded employment. That does make sense.\n  The demand for more foreign workers is an embarrassing indictment of \nour failure to provide adequate training for American workers. These \nare good high-tech jobs in the modern economy. Over the next decade, it \nis estimated that high-tech computer companies will need 1.3 million \nadditional employees, and American workers deserve help in obtaining \nthe skills to compete for them.\n  It is not enough just to raise the immigration quota. Any bill that \npasses this Congress should, I believe, have two additional things. \nFirst, it must assure American workers that they will get the training \nopportunities they need to compete for these good jobs. It makes no \nsense to throw in the towel by increasing the immigration quota, even \ntemporarily, without also investing substantially in the training of \nU.S. workers. We must not give away these good jobs forever. We must \ninvest in our workers, and that means putting real money on the table \nfor training American workers.\n  The bill that came out of our committee, I believe, failed. It was a \ngood-faith effort to try to do so, but I believe it failed in making \nthat kind of commitment. We have been working with the chairman of the \ncommittee to address that particular issue. There is no reason in the \nworld why we should not provide these kinds of skills for American \nworkers. That is really what this debate here this afternoon is all \nabout. We recognize that we may very well have a need to increase this \ncategory in order to bring in some of those that have particular skills \nthat might be important in terms of our American industry, and we can \nhave a chance to go over the record on that particular issue. I think, \nquite frankly, it is a mixed issue. Nonetheless, given the evaluation \nof the information that is out there, I think we should take a \ntemporary step. But beyond that, there is no reason why we should not \ndevelop the kinds of training programs and the kinds of initiatives to \nmake sure, to the extent possible, that we are going to provide the \nskills to American workers so they can have the jobs, and not just have \na more open-ended immigration policy in these categories for foreign-\ntrained workers. That really is an important part of this debate.\n  A second very important part of this debate is how we are going to \ntreat the American workers. We find that at least we will have a \nchance, probably, to go into this in some detail, and that there is at \nleast a record out there that a number of these individuals come into \nthis country, and they know that if they have their job terminated, \nthey are effectively deported; they can't retain their green card. \nThere is some evidence that these individuals have displaced American \nworkers who were holding those jobs.\n  Then, subsequently, there has been an adverse impact on the wages of \nthose workers who are virtually handcuffed, so-to-speak, and trying to \ncomplain about it, because if they complain, they are shipped back \noverseas. We want to make sure that, one, as a great Nation that has \nthe capacity to train our workers, we are going to provide skills for \nthose workers. For every worker that goes into the job market today, \nthey are going to have seven different jobs. Under the excellence bill, \nwhich was passed just over a week ago by the leadership of Senators \nDeWine, Jeffords, and Wellstone, we have tried to bring our training \nprograms up to the demands of the turn of the century, so that \nAmericans are going to have a continuing possibility for upgrading \ntheir skills. They are going to need that.\n  We as a nation should make sure that those kinds of opportunities for \nself-improvement are going to be available to working families in this \ncountry. That is very, very important, I believe.\n  The Senate went on record a week ago with a very strong bipartisan \nvote to do just that. We don't want to carve out an area. We don't want \nto say we will train Americans for some jobs but we are not going to \ntrain them for the computer jobs in this Nation. That makes no sense. \nThat virtually turns our back on what we committed to American working \nfamilies just a week ago. We shouldn't carve this area out and say, \n``We are not going to provide that.'' That is why we have been working \nwith our friend and colleague, the Senator from Michigan, to try to \naddress that. I think we have seen some important movement on this \nissue. I certainly appreciate his understanding of that importance. We \nare trying to work out an approach on that. That is going to meet some \nof the concerns that he and others have.\n  But a second important point is that we don't want to say to American \nworkers who are working in the computer industry now, to have their \nboss come up to them and say, ``You are fired because we have someone \nelse who will replace you at the same wage.'' That is legal in America \ntoday. Any of these large companies can bring in the temporary workers \nhaving met some rather fundamental kinds of requirements and just \ndisplace Americans. I think that is wrong. I think that is absolutely \nand fundamentally wrong. We will have an amendment to try to address \nthat issue.\n  Second, we want to make sure that there is going to be at least an \neffort, some effort. All we are talking about in this case is an \nattestation; we are saying to the employer that you attest that you \nhave made an effort to try to hire an American worker. What we are \nsaying is we are not setting up any type of rule or regulation. We are \nsaying whatever the industry requires, whatever the pattern is in the \nparticular industry. So if a particular industry is just publishing \nsomething on the Internet, e-mail, whatever, that is sufficient in \nterms of meeting that requirement. Whatever the industry does, we say \nthat is fine. All the company has to do is just say OK, we have done \nthat. That is all. That is the total\n\n[[Page S4963]]\n\namount of paperwork. But what we are trying to do is say that we are \ngoing to give some priority to American workers. The company is just \ngoing to have to follow whatever the industry does in recruiting, is \ngoing to have to do so with regard to these workers. I think that is \nvery important. We don't want to displace American workers, and we want \nto make sure than an American worker who has those kinds of skills is \ngoing to be able to get that job. Those aren't, I don't think, very \nradical kinds of concepts if we are talking about what we are \ninterested in--looking after American workers' families.\n  What are these jobs? When you come down to it, we will probably come \nback to revisit this issue a little later in the debate. But, according \nto Department of Labor figures, from 1997 on the H-1B jobs, on the \ncertification of what these jobs are, and what they pay, this chart is \nan indication of what the pay is for these particular jobs. If you look \nat this particular chart, Mr. President, you will see that 76 percent \nof these jobs are from $25,000 to $50,000 a year. These are good jobs. \nIt is difficult for me to believe that we cannot develop training and \neducation programs so that American workers can get those particular \njobs. Those are good jobs for working families. We are not prepared to \nsay that we are going to turn our back on Americans for these kinds of \njobs.\n\n  Another 16 percent go from $50,000 to $75,000. Those are good jobs, \ntoo. What you are talking about here is that more than 5 percent of \nthose are below $75,000.\n  Then you have these in the smaller group, approximately 5 percent, \nthat are in excess of that $75,000. Those are represented by those, I \nthink, that we call the ``Best and the Brightest'' in this category. We \nsaid they don't have to go and have an attestation or requirement in \nterms of seeking alternatives for those individuals who are going to \nuniversities or doing research. They don't have to go through even \nthese very preliminary steps. What we are trying to do is to say for \nthe basic jobs that are in these categories that fall roughly in \n$75,000 or less that they should not displace American workers and that \nAmerican workers ought to get the first crack at it. That is basically \nwhat the amendment I will be offering later this afternoon calls for, \nand what we, I believe, should bring to our attention.\n  Mr. President, it matters to U.S. high-tech companies that want more \nvisas. But it also matters to workers who are laid off by unscrupulous \nemployers and replaced by foreign workers. It matters to middle-aged \ncomputer programmers who work hard to keep up their skills but are laid \noff in favor of younger workers who will work longer hours at cheaper \npay. And it matters to working families who would love to get one of \nthese jobs and make $30,000, $40,000, or $50,000 a year. Many of the \nworkers who come in under the H-1B visa program are obviously talented. \nWe should put out the welcome mat for accomplished people who have \nunique skills to improve our economy and create jobs, but accomplished \nworkers represent only a fraction of the foreign workers who come to \nthe United States under the H-1B program.\n  I have indicated that more than 75,000 would be about 5 percent. We \nmight even stretch it to up to 20 percent. Most of those who are coming \ninto this program are lower-level computer programmers. Many are \nphysical therapists, occupational therapists, nurses, and 80 percent \nare paid less than $50,000, as I referred to. These are good jobs, and \nthe working families of America should get the first crack at them.\n  The bill before us does little or nothing to enhance the \naccountability and enforcement of the H-1B visa program. Some say the \ncurrent program is satisfactory. They cite the low number of violators \nfound by the Labor Department as evidence that the terms of the program \nare widely observed. But the reason so few violations are discovered is \nthat the Labor Department's hands are tied. The Department cannot \nintervene unless a complaint is filed. And few workers dare complain. \nAs I mentioned before, if they complain, they are shipped overseas and \nthey are gone. No matter how poorly they are being trained and how \noverworked they are being worked, if they complain about that part and \nget fired, they lose their green card, and it is back to their country \nof origin. That has to be, and it is, an important factor. The fact \nthat we have not had the complaints is because to do so would \njeopardize their immigration status. So they either accept the abuses \nor change employers. But they don't complain.\n  We know there are serious problems. This is the issue. Two years ago, \nthe Labor Department's inspector general completed the largest study of \nthe program. That is the basic program, the fundamental, the temporary \nworker program, which is the issue that we are talking about here \ntoday. They reviewed some 720 cases in 12 States. The results were \nappalling. In 75 percent of the cases, the inspector general could not \neven tell from the employer's records whether the employer paid the H-\n1B foreign worker the proper wage. If those are good documents on what \nthey paid, 19 percent of the employers paid less than the wage that \nthey had promised on their applications.\n  Any bill that the Congress sends to the President must remedy this \nproblem. The Labor Department should have the same authority to enforce \nthe rules under this program as they have to enforce workplace \nstandards and the minimum wage, and they should have the same authority \nthat the Immigration and Naturalization Service has to ensure that \nemployers do not hire illegal immigrant workers. That means giving the \nLabor Department authority to enforce the rule where there is \nreasonable cause to believe that they have been broken.\n  We permit the enforcement. If we do not have enforcement, we have \nabuses. Your rights are diminished if you do not have the ability to \nhave a remedy. That is just basic fact. We don't have to spend the time \non the floor to really debate that issue. Unless we are going to have \nthat kind of protection, you are going to have the kind of abuses that \nhave taken place and continue to take place.\n  Stephen Schultz is an engineer who was laid off from his job in \nModesto, CA.\n  He was then asked to come back to his company on a temporary basis in \norder to train his foreign replacement. There was nothing Mr. Schultz \ncould do about it. He was laid off and replaced by a foreign worker. To \nadd insult to injury, he was asked to train his foreign replacement. \nCan you imagine that, Mr. President. Here is the person who is laid \noff. The company hires someone from overseas, brings them over here, \nputs them in that job and then hires the worker that had been working \nthere, I believe in this case 5 to 7 years he had been working there, \nto train that worker to fill that person's job. That was happening. \nThat was happening. Now, that is absolutely and fundamentally wrong, \nand we do not want to permit, as we are seeing in the expansion of this \nprogram, those kinds of practices.\n  I commend Senator Abraham for recognizing the problem, but \nunfortunately the antilayoff provisions in the bill, I believe, are \ninadequate. They apply only in a very limited circumstance. The \nemployers who lay off U.S. workers and replace them with foreign \nworkers can be penalized under this bill only if they break the law \nfirst. Only if they break the law first. Under this bill, you can lay \noff American workers and replace them with foreign workers as long as \nyou don't underpay them or use them as strikebreakers or commit some \nother violation first. We should require employers to state that they \nhave been unable to find qualified workers in this country before they \napply for workers from abroad.\n  Now, a high-tech facility in New Mexico announced a hiring freeze and \nrefused to accept job applications, but at the same time they brought \nin 53 foreign workers under the H-1B visa program. Alan Ezer, a 45-\nyear-old computer programmer with 10 years of experience in the field, \nhas kept his skills up to date. He was willing to take a cut in pay to \nstay in the industry. After he was laid off, he sent out 150 resumes. \nHe got one job interview and no job offers. Rose Marie Roo is an \nexperienced computer programmer. When no one would hire her to do \ncomputer work, she and her husband opened a bed and breakfast in \nFlorida. Peter Van Horn,\n\n[[Page S4964]]\n\nage 31, with a masters degree in computer science, lives in California. \nEmployers won't hire him either. The list goes on and on.\n  Many of the Nation's high-tech firms are blatantly turning away \nqualified U.S. workers while appealing to Congress for more foreign \nworkers. Not all but some. And those are the ones that need the \nattention. It is that kind of injustice these amendments which I will \nbe introducing focus on. So this, too, must change. Employers should be \nrequired to state that they have made an effort to recruit in this \ncountry first. Some argue that if we impose these new requirements, the \nprogram will bog down in redtape. They say employers will have to wait \ntoo long to get their workers from abroad.\n  Our solution, as I mentioned, is very simple. Employers must simply \nstate on one sheet of paper they have laid someone off and that they \nhave been unable to locate workers in this country. That is all. If you \nare concerned about redtape, then look at what the bill does. It \ntransfers the program to the most overwhelmed and most backlogged \nagency in the Federal Government, the Immigration and Naturalization \nService. It takes a year for American citizens to bring spouses or \nchildren here. That is supposedly our highest immigration priority, \nuniting citizens with their families, but it takes years just to \nprocess the paperwork to bring these families together. \nAfter individuals actually qualify for citizenship, it takes 2 years or \neven longer for them to have the forms completed.\n\n  So we have an opportunity today to pass legislation that responds to \nthe needs of the high-growth high-tech industry and our workers. We \nshould increase the quota temporarily. We must provide our workers with \nthe training they need to assure them that our immigration programs do \nnot unfairly disadvantage them as they compete for the new jobs.\n  Now, Mr. President, I will make some comments with regard to both of \nthese amendments and then we can have some discussion. I will offer \nthem with the understanding of the chairman so that we can move this \nprocess.\n  Before going further, Mr. President, on the recruitment amendment, I \nknow that Senator Abraham has announced the endorsement of this bill by \ncertain groups. I have here in my hand 150 letters from American \nworkers who are opposed to the bill. They are computer programmers and \ncomputer engineers who want a shot at these jobs. These are American \nworkers. We believe they ought to be listened to.\n  I might just selectively insert some of these letters, not to unduly \nburden the Congressional Record, but we have more than 150 and scores \nmore back at the office. I will introduce a select group to be able to \nreflect the concern that these American workers have about this \nparticular bill.\n  It is interesting, Mr. President, when we were looking at what the \nneeds were and we heard a good deal of testimony from different groups \nthat one of the things that was pointed out by the General Accounting \nOffice was the salaries in these particular areas have not increased \neffectively over time. At least some of the economists in the General \nAccounting Office found that sort of interesting because, generally \nspeaking, when there is a greater demand for these kinds of skills, the \nsalaries all go up. If you want to recruit people, with supply and \ndemand, the salaries are going to increase, but they did not find that \nincrease in the salaries. They sort of stayed standard in terms of \nother skilled occupations. That is where they had drawn some concerns \nabout the legislation.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would I ask unanimous consent that the time I \nnow use be allocated to the recruitment amendment, if there is no \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will just reserve the other time for general debate, \nif I could. And then I could stop and put that in. But I think this is \nOK with the chairman, or if the Senator wants to make some comments.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Actually, I was about to yield to Senator Brownback. I \nthink he would like to speak when the Senator is finished.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. I will just make some brief comments here and then \nI will yield.\n  My amendment says that before employers can bring in foreign workers \nunder the H-1B visa program, they must attest that they have tried to \nhire U.S. workers first.\n  These are good well-paying jobs created by the high tech American \neconomy. My amendment assures that U.S. workers will get first crack at \nthese jobs. If employers cannot find U.S. workers who are ready, able, \nand willing to do the job, then--and only then--should foreign workers \nbe available. Employers should be required to recruit in Boston, \nDetroit, and Los Angeles before they recruit in other countries.\n  We hear a great deal about the impressive contributions of foreign \nworkers to our economy. We should welcome outstanding workers who are \nexceptional in their fields and have impressive track records of \naccomplishment. In fact, my amendment rolls out the red carpet for such \nworkers.\n  It exempts universities and non-profit research institutions from \nthis requirement. The researchers they bring in from abroad under this \nprogram help to train college students for the future. There is no \nsignificant evidence of abuses in their recruitment.\n  But 80 percent of the applications received under the visa program \nare for jobs paying $50,000 or less. Half the applications are for \ncomputer programmers, most of them at lower levels. A quarter of the \napplications are for health care workers, particularly physical \ntherapists. Other applications are for teachers, accountants, \ndietitians, piano tuners, drafters, realtors, construction workers, and \nmany others.\n  Many of these workers are in the early stages of their careers. As \nthe Republican views in the Committee report on this bill correctly \nnote, ``many H-1Bs are foreign students recruited off U.S. college \ncampuses.'' U.S. workers should have first priority for these jobs.\n  In fact, American college students are specializing in computer \nstudies in growing numbers. According to the Computer Research \nAssociation, the number of college students majoring in computer \nscience increased by 91 percent from 1995 to 1997. My amendment will \nassure that when they graduate, they will not have to worry that they \nmust compete with foreign workers for U.S. jobs.\n  Some argue that this amendment creates unnecessary additional \npaperwork. In fact, the amendment requires only that employers attest--\non a simple, one-page H-1B application form--that they have tried to \nrecruit U.S. workers for the job and failed. They are required only to \nuse recruitment procedures that are common for the industry.\n  If the standard practice among computer companies is to post the job \non the internet for five days, that's all they have to do to satisfy \nthis requirement.\n  The Labor Department does not investigate the application in advance \nof the foreign worker coming here. In fact, the Labor Department is \nrequired to act on the application within seven days. So all the \nemployer would do, under my amendment, is complete the one-page form. \nNothing more.\n  Most high tech companies should have no problem meeting this simple \nrequirement. They say they recruit in the U.S. constantly and still \nhave hundreds of openings.\n  All they have to do is check the box on the form, and send it in.\n  The problem is that many American workers have applied for high tech \njobs, only to be turned away.\n  Peter Van Horn is a 31-year-old from Mountain View, California. He \nhas a master's degree in computer science. He is an expert in computer \ngraphics. But he can't get a job in his field.\n  Bard-Alan Finlan is a computer engineer in his 40s. He knows the \nlatest computer languages. He's received one interview in a year and a \nhalf, and still no job.\n  Kurt Granzen is an electronics worker. He was laid off from a Silicon \nValley firm after it started hiring H-1B workers. He has been unable to \nfind a job in his field for the past four years, after hundreds of \ninterviews.\n  These well-trained U.S. workers deserve to know that we will not \nallow employers to bring in foreign workers before they have a fair \nopportunity to fill these jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n\n[[Page S4965]]\n\n  I see other colleagues who desire to speak so I will withhold at this \ntime, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Kansas at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Michigan \nyielding time to me to speak on this very important amendment. I have \nbeen listening to the earlier debate about the ability of U.S. workers \nto get these jobs versus workers coming in from overseas. I think the \ncritical point that maybe is not being clearly put forward on this is \nwhat we are talking about here is being able to keep U.S. businesses in \nthe United States, and, thus, access to these jobs dominantly by--\nindeed, in many cases exclusively--by U.S. workers. We are trying to \nkeep the businesses here. Many of these businesses could easily and \nrapidly move overseas, particularly ones in developing computer \nsoftware and programming. That is something they could rapidly and \neasily move overseas. We want those jobs here so our workers have \naccess to them.\n  What we are talking about in the amendment put forward by the Senator \nfrom Michigan, Senator Abraham, is a present crunch that we have \ngetting some workers into some of these jobs. This seriously needed \nlegislation will raise the visa cap for professional workers from the \npresent maximum of 65,000 to an additional 30,000 visas for 1998 with a \n5-year sunset for additional H-1B visas. A failure to act would be a \nblow to many American companies, which are striving to obtain these \nworkers at this immediate need and juncture in a very highly \ncompetitive marketplace. Without the visa increase, they will be denied \nthe ability to secure workers central to their immediate needs.\n  I agree, we need to offer benefits and help more and make sure that \nU.S. workers have the greatest access, and they should. What we have is \nan immediate problem, and we don't want these businesses moving \noverseas. The legislation seeks to address this problem.\n  There is an immediate, severe, technical worker shortage in America \nwhich can only be met by this legislation. It is reported by the INS \nthat by early May the present cap of 65,000 will have already been \nreached--already reached. This means that American businesses will be \nentirely foreclosed for over half a year from obtaining some of the \nhighly skilled professional workers that they need under this option \nfor immediate need--immediate work and immediate help--rather than \nmoving these businesses overseas to be able to access those workers.\n  This legislation will help to maintain America's competitive edge in \nthe global marketplace. It will encourage--not hurt--American business \ngrowth and, thus, job creation in the United States, which is presently \nat an extraordinarily high level. It will enable technical businesses \nto retain the workers required to develop their products in a highly \ncompetitive market. It will empower companies to maintain timely \nproduction schedules.\n  Companies from throughout the country say that they must have this \nadditional ability to hire needed workers to be able to remain in the \nUnited States. This is especially true for high-tech industries across \nAmerica which specialize in computer-related products. This industry is \nextremely time sensitive, requiring speedy product development and \nproduction. For example, computer software is frequently developed in \n6-month cycles. Failing to deliver within these time frames because of \ntechnical worker shortages can severely compromise a company's \ncompetitive edge. One observer of the current system said:\n\n       Critical projects will be abandoned or put on hold--at the \n     cost of many more American jobs. This can be disastrous for \n     our industries with short product cycles that are trying to \n     compete against fierce global competitors.\n\n  Who supports the legislation? Businesses, universities and ethnic \norganizations, all back this effort, as well as workers concerned that \ntheir companies might be forced to move offshore.\n  Speaking of that subject, the New York Times recently wrote this:\n\n       If U.S. companies are told to put up ``No Vacancy'' signs, \n     they are inevitably going to move more operations overseas, \n     and that will spur more innovation, wealth creation, and jobs \n     over there. By contrast, this legislation helps to encourage \n     companies to stay within American shores and keep jobs here \n     in America, and growth taking place here in America.\n\n  At this time of economic growth, our Government must be sensitive to \nrespond to needs as they arise in the marketplace. This legislation is \na sensible response to a legitimate problem, and represents that \nAmerican Government is a partner to encouraging, not discouraging, \ngrowth, job creation, retention of jobs, and prosperity in America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and commend Senator Abraham for \nsponsoring this important legislation, needed for American jobs to be \nable to stay in America. I urge my colleagues to support it. I yield \nthe time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might use \non my other amendment called the layoff amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, under this amendment, employers cannot \nlay off American workers and then import foreign workers to fill the \nsame jobs. Believe it or not, it is perfectly legal today for an \nemployer to lay off qualified American workers and replace them with \nforeign workers under the H-IB program, and unscrupulous employers have \ntaken advantage of this loophole in the law.\n  In recent weeks, we have seen announcements of layoffs from many of \nthe biggest U.S. companies, and many of these companies have asked \nCongress to increase immigration quotas so they can bring in more \nworkers from abroad. We owe it to those laid-off U.S. workers to make \nsure their employers do not bring in foreign workers to fill their \njobs.\n  On April 13, the Wall Street Journal reported:\n\n       The past couple of weeks have seen a steady drum beat of \n     layoff announcements in industry sectors that until recently \n     have complained about personnel shortages.\n\n  The article included a long list of high-tech computer companies \nlaying off thousands of workers. For example, on April 13, Intel \nCorporation announced plans to cut 3,000 jobs. Earlier in the month, \nCompaq Computer announced that it plans to lay off 15,000 workers as \npart of its merger with Digital, and the list goes on. Not all of these \nlost jobs are the same jobs that would be filled with foreign workers \nunder the H-1B visa program. But we must be certain that no employer \nturns around and brings in a H-1B worker to fill a job from which \nAmerican workers were laid off.\n  Stephen Schultz of Modesto, CA, an engineer, was laid off in November \nof last year. While he was looking for a new job, his former company \ncalled him back to train the foreign worker they had brought in to \nreplace him. Mr. Schultz filed a complaint with the Department of \nLabor, complaining that he had been laid off and displaced by the \nforeign worker, but this offensive practice is currently legal under \nthe current law. There is nothing the Labor Department can do about it. \nAnd that is plain, fundamentally wrong. This amendment addresses that \ninjustice.\n  My amendment would give those laid-off workers a fighting chance. It \nsays, ``You have just been laid off. You are trying to feed your \nfamily. You are struggling to find a new job. So we will not compound \nyour suffering by letting your former employer bring in a foreign \nworker to replace you.''\n  As I mentioned earlier, I commend Senator Abraham for acknowledging \nthe problem. But, as I mentioned, the layoff protections in the pending \nlegislation, I think, do not do the job. They offer little help to \nworking Americans who lose their jobs in today's changing labor market. \nBut under this bill, employers don't have to promise that they have \nnot--and will not--lay off U.S. workers as a condition of their \nparticipation in the program. Under this bill, the only time that an \nemployer can be penalized for replacing U.S. workers with foreign \nworkers is if the employer also violates other requirements of the H-1B \nprogram.\n  That is under the Abraham proposal. It is not bad enough for an \nemployer to\n\n[[Page S4966]]\n\nlay off U.S. workers, but then they replace them with foreign workers. \nThe employer has to underpay them to have some other violation of the \nlaw before the Labor Department can act. We believe that we should not \ndisplace American workers with foreign workers who are doing the same \njob--and we have language which effectively is the same in both bills; \nours has a different triggering mechanism--we believe that we should \nnot displace Americans with foreign workers who are doing the same job. \nThat is what my amendment will do with regard to the layoff proposals.\n  Under the current bill, the engineer that I mentioned who was laid \noff in Modesto would have a case only if the employer who laid him off \nviolated some other requirement of the program. He could be laid off, \nso to speak, as I understand the Abraham proposal, and they could hire \nanother worker for his identical job, pay him less and, as in this \nparticular case, if this person who was laid off wanted to, he could \ncome back and train his replacement, and that American worker would \nvirtually have no cause of action.\n  Under the current bill, an employer can lay off 1,000 American \nworkers and bring in 1,000 H-1B workers to replace them as long as the \nemployer pays them the same wage, and it is OK. Some argue that \nemployers are unlikely to go through the effort to lay off an American \nto replace with a foreign worker. They cite studies to suggest foreign \nworkers are actually paid higher wages than their American \ncounterparts. If that is the case, then the employer should have no \nproblem attesting, as a condition of their participation in the visa \nprogram, that they have not and will not lay off U.S. workers.\n  The fact is, employers do lay off American workers and replace them \nwith foreign workers. That happens to be the information that we have. \nThey want foreign workers because such workers are less likely to \ncomplain if their hours are extended and their working conditions are \nnot as good. The Labor Department inspector general found that 75 \npercent of employers in the program could not even document that the \nwage they paid the foreign worker was the proper prevailing wage, and \nunscrupulous U.S. employers also want foreign workers because they are \nless likely to protest long hours and harsh working conditions. If they \ndo, they know they may lose their jobs and have to leave the country.\n  An American software developer called my office recently and asked to \nremain anonymous for fear of reprisal by his employer. He spoke of how \nthe high-tech firms are abusing their foreign workers. He said, ``I had \na good talk with an H-1B worker. He told me he was so anxious to work \nin this country that he would accept any salary. Even a pitifully low \nsalary by our standards was high in his country. He has been here for 6 \nmonths and working 80-plus hours a week. The company knows they can \npick up a well-educated foreign worker who will work many more hours \nfor half as much salary. I have seen this, en masse, first hand.''\n  The unscrupulous employers who engage in these flagrant abuses put \nhonest employers at a severe competitive disadvantage.\n  Mr. President, what happens is, the American worker is displaced and \nthat impacts that American worker. But if they get some foreign workers \nand then work them harder and longer, they have a competitive advantage \nover a company that just has American workers, and that threatens those \nAmerican workers. The other company that has foreign workers is \ncompeting with the company that has American workers, and they are not \nmeeting their responsibilities.\n\n  All we are trying to do is make sure that all play the game by the \nsame rules by which so many companies are willing to play. We want to \nmake sure we are not creating abuses, which have been recognized in the \npast, and we want to make sure that, since we are expanding this \nprogram, we are going to give American workers first shot; we are not \ngoing to displace American workers, and we are going to give them the \nfirst shot at those jobs. Also, we are going to work out a training \nprogram over the period of this legislation so that at the end of the 5 \nyears, we will have in place a training mechanism so that these jobs--\nthe 80 percent which go to families earning less than $75,000, good \njobs--will be going to Americans because they are going to have the \ntraining to do so. That is effectively what we are saying, Mr. \nPresident.\n  We need to address the abuses. We need to protect the workers. We \nshould outlaw the abuses to protect the vast majority of American \nemployers who play by the rules. We are protecting the American \nbusinessmen who are playing by the rules. They are playing by the rules \nbecause they are paying a fair salary for these computer experts and \nthey are respecting them for their working conditions and are out there \ncompeting fair and square, while someone who is unscrupulous brings in \nthe foreign worker in these circumstances and, in too many \ncircumstances, displaces the American worker and has that worker \nworking longer hours and under more difficult conditions. You have one \nworker who has already lost his or her job, and if you get several \nworkers, they are going to be able to compete on an uneven playing \nground with the American firm.\n  All we are saying is, No. 1, you can't displace an American worker \nwith a foreign worker; No. 2, you have to at least attest that you have \nmade a reasonable effort to hire an American worker; and, No. 3, we are \ngoing to work out the training program so that at the end of this \nprogram, in a period of years, we are going to have sufficient training \nso that Americans are going to be qualified to get those jobs, which \nare good jobs. That is what this issue is really about, Mr. President.\n  I did not want to leave the impression, but in my earlier comments, \non which my staff has corrected me, if the foreign worker is paid less \nthan Abraham, then the Abraham layoff does kick in, assuming a worker \ncomplains.\n  My point is, under Abraham, they can lay someone off as long as they \nmeet the other rules of the program. They can still lay off the \nAmerican worker. They see a layoff as a freebie, a free ride for \nemployers who want to bring in the foreign workers.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The time will run against the \nbill or the amendment. Will the Senator indicate his preference in \nregard to time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Time on the amendment. How much time remains on the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes remaining on the \nlayoff amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to make a quick inquiry. Are we on \nan amendment at this point or are we on the bill generally?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Technically, we are still on the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2412\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide for \nspecial immigrant status for NATO civilian employees in the same manner \n            as for employees of international organizations)\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham] for Mr. Warner, for \n     himself and Mr. Robb, proposes an amendment numbered 2412.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2413.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 41, after line 16, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION.\n\n       Section 212(n)(2) (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2)), as amended by \n     section 5 of this Act, is further amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (C), by inserting ``, or that the \n     employer has intimidated, discharged, or otherwise retaliated \n     against any person because that person has asserted a right \n     or has cooperated in an investigation under this paragraph'' \n     after ``a material fact in an application''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(F) Any alien admitted to the United States as a \n     nonimmigrant described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), who \n     files a complaint pursuant to subparagraph (A) and is \n     otherwise eligible to remain and work in the United States, \n     shall be allowed to seek other employment in the United \n     States for the duration of the alien's authorized admission, \n     if--\n       ``(i) the Secretary finds a failure by the employer to meet \n     the conditions described in subparagraph (C), and\n       ``(ii) the alien notifies the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service of the name and address of his new \n     employer.''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, currently the Labor Department can \ninvestigate violations under the H-1B program only if a complaint has \nbeen filed by an aggrieved party. The complaint can be filed by a \ntemporary foreign H-1B worker, and affected American workers. Few \ncomplaints are filed because workers are afraid of retaliation. And the \nH-1B workers are afraid if they complain, they could lose their jobs \nand then have to leave the country. American workers are afraid they \nwill be blackballed in the industry if they complain.\n  So this amendment offers them the whistle-blower protection, and it \npenalizes employers if they retaliate against a whistleblower. So \nwhether the whistleblowers are H-1B workers or affected American \nworkers, the employer cannot retaliate against them.\n  In addition, under my amendment workers who filed a successful \ncomplaint against an employer can switch jobs if they wish and still \nremain in the United States for the duration of their visa. They just \nhave to let the INS know their new address.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from \nMassachusetts on this amendment. I think it addresses a large part of \nthe concern that he previously registered with respect to the way the \nprogram functions.\n  As I will indicate as we continue this debate this afternoon, it is \nnot the intent of either this Senator or those of us who cosponsor the \nAmerican Competitiveness Act to put any American worker at a \ndisadvantage. We believe the protections that are already in place in \nthis legislation--both in the existing laws as well as in my bill--will \nprotect American workers.\n  Basically, you cannot bring a foreign worker in for lower pay and \nreplace an American worker with that individual. If you do, you are \nviolating the law. The Senator from Massachusetts earlier raised the \nconcern that no one will complain because the H-1B visa holder, the \nforeign worker, will be afraid of consequences if they do so.\n  In my judgment, this whistle-blower provision will allay any such \nconcerns. I think it ties nicely into the protections which we have \nbuilt into S. 1723, the protections that come in the form of very \nsevere penalties for anyone who willfully violates the law with respect \nto bringing in an H-1B employee.\n  So for that reason I am comfortable with and supportive of this \namendment. We worked closely with Senator Kennedy's staff on the \ncrafting of the amendment, and I think it has been done in a way that \neffectively supplements what is already in place.\n  But let me, as long as we are on this, just briefly talk about this \nwhole system. In his earlier statement with respect to his amendment, \nthe Senator from Massachusetts expressed concern that no one would \nbring a complaint, that the complaint-driven system that currently \nexists is one which masquerades many violations. I do not believe it \ndoes. I think that complaints are very likely to occur under the \ncurrent system simply because competitors could bring the complaints.\n  The salaries with which foreign workers are paid must be posted, not \nonly posted at the job site, but at secondary sites and at the \nDepartment of Labor. If somebody believes that someone is gaining an \nunfair advantage by bringing in cheaper labor, they can complain as \nwell. It does not necessarily have to be the foreign worker who brings \nthe complaint; it can be a coworker who is mad because they see the \nforeign worker is coming in and driving his friends out of a job, or it \ncan be a competitor.\n\n  It is possible, I suppose, although we do not have any documental \nevidence to this, that someone might be intimidated about bringing such \ncomplaints. For that reason, I think the whistle-blower provision is an \neffective way to address this one area that might be a loose end. I \nthink it tightens up the process in such a way that we can have the \nconfidence in a complaint-driven system necessary to maintain that \nsystem as it is working. And it is working effectively.\n  As I said earlier, as I will be saying in further debate on these \namendments, in the entire history of this program there have only been \neight willful violations in 8 years--one per year. And only one of \nthose involved a situation where an employee was laid off.\n\n[[Page S4968]]\n\n  We have heard descriptions of several of those, I think, already in \nthe comments of the Senator from Massachusetts. Indeed, because there \nare so few, we have already heard about several of those instances on \nmore than one occasion here today. They are wrong. They were punished. \nI think they should have been punished even more severely. I do not \nthink they should bring a foreign worker in the United States, pay them \na lower salary than you are paying an existing worker, and lay somebody \noff. I think if you do that, you ought to suffer stiff consequences, \nand our legislation administers those stiff consequences.\n  To the extent someone might have failed to raise a concern or a \ncomplaint because of fear of reprisal, I think Senator Kennedy's \namendment, which I am prepared to support at this time, closes that \nloophole as well and I think puts in place a system that can and should \nwork effectively.\n  So, for that reason, I support the amendment. And I think we can move \nforward to adopt it here presently.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment No. 2413 offered by \nthe Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The amendment (No. 2413) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the American Competitiveness Act, of which I am a cosponsor.\n  The American Competitiveness Act is important to the American economy \nand to our Nation's high standing in a global economy. It will also \nhave a positive and direct impact on promoting job creation and \neconomic growth in Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, as the 21st Century quickly approaches, American \ncompanies, businesses and universities increasingly find themselves in \na fiercely competitive global economy. Thus far, the United States has \nbeen able to succeed and benefit overwhelmingly from this increased \n``globalization.''\n  However, our continued economic growth is being threatened by a \nshortage of highly skilled and internationally experienced workers, \nWhile companies around the U.S. have invested billions of dollars in \neducating and training employees, demand for qualified people continues \nto grow faster than the supply of available workers. This is \nparticularly true in the area of information technology.\n  The shortage of workers with technical or computer-related skills is \na real concern to Nebraska. My colleagues may not realize that Nebraska \ncurrently has an unemployment rate of 1.6%, which is the lowest rate in \nthe country. While this is very good news, it also presents a challenge \nfor many of Nebraska's employers.\n  Employers in Nebraska have told me over and over again that the state \nis unable to meet their increased demand for labor, particularly high-\nskilled labor. In fact, the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce estimates \nthere are currently 1,500 to 2,000 job openings in the field of \ninformation technology in the Omaha area alone.\n  While the Chamber, other business community leaders, and the Nebraska \nstate government, have been actively recruiting workers from within the \nState, across the country and around the world, they have not been able \nto produce enough skilled workers to keep pace with job growth.\n  The United States Senate can take an important step toward addressing \nthis problem by passing the American Competitiveness Act. This \nlegislation will immediately help America's companies and universities \nby raising the current ceiling on the number of foreign-born \nprofessionals we allow to work in the United States under the H-1B visa \nprogram. These temporary visas are used to attract the best and \nbrightest minds from around the world to U.S. companies and \nuniversities, which helps them to compete in global markets.\n  We must also address our Nation's long term employment challenges by \npreparing more American students for the high technology, global \nworkforce of tomorrow. Not enough of our students are being prepared, \nor preparing themselves, to excel in an increasingly high-tech economy.\n  The American Competitiveness Act takes steps to correct this \nsituation by creating 20,000 scholarships annually for low-income \nAmerican students to study math, engineering, and computer science. It \nalso authorizes $10 million a year to train unemployed U.S. workers for \njobs in the information technology industry.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support Senator Abraham's bill, \nwhich will keep American companies in this country, create and save \nAmerican jobs and contribute to the growth of the economy. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill because it will help ensure that \nAmerica remains a great, industrious and rich nation both culturally \nand economically.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter sent to me by \nthe Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce in support of this legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                     Greater Omaha\n\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                           Omaha, NE, May 8, 1998.\n     Senator Chuck Hagel,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hagel: The Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce \n     has been working for several years on the challenge of \n     Nebraska's shortage of skilled workers. We believe Senate \n     bill 1723, known as the ``American Competitiveness Act,'' \n     will aid employers across the country in hiring the skilled \n     workers needed to grow their businesses, especially in the \n     information technology field. We are especially interested in \n     the portion of the bill which increases the number of H-1B \n     visas granted each year. At the current rate, the United \n     States will reach the statutory quota on H-1B visas by the \n     end of June, a full three months before the end of the fiscal \n     year.\n       Currently, Omaha has approximately 1,200 H-1B visa holders \n     employed in the metro area. There is room for considerable \n     growth, and there are jobs to be filled. Omaha's unemployment \n     rate is about 1.7%. It is one of the lowest in the nation and \n     has consistently been so for the past several years. It is \n     estimated the Omaha area currently has 1,500 to 2,000 job \n     openings in the filed of information technology.\n       The business community in Omaha has stepped up to the plate \n     and is actively recruiting workers from across the country \n     and around the world. Over the last four years, the Chamber \n     has organized and attended numerous job fairs, initiated \n     Internet recruiting and job posting programs, coordinated and \n     funded national advertising campaigns and image marketing in \n     an attempt to grow the size of our work force.\n       In addition to recruiting, Omaha has placed great emphasis \n     on ``growing our own.'' Omaha is a national leader in the \n     School-to-Work arena and was one of the first six communities \n     nationally to embrace and promote Work Keys, a work-based \n     skills and job profiling assessment to better prepare our \n     students for the work place. The University of Nebraska, with \n     close to $50 million worth of private support, has \n     established an innovative Institute which encompasses a new \n     College of Information Science and Technology along with the \n     inter-related engineering disciplines.\n       All of these efforts however, are not enough. The passage \n     of Senate bill 1723 is imperative to the continued growth of \n     the high-tech industry in Nebraska and the rest of the \n     nation. It is reliably estimated that there are 346,000 \n     computer related jobs vacant in the United States and that \n     number will only increase in the coming years. Even with our \n     best efforts nationwide, we will not produce sufficient \n     qualified workers at a rate fast enough to keep pace with the \n     job growth. By allowing greater numbers of skilled workers \n     from other countries to fill available jobs in the United \n     States, our employers will be better equipped to continue to \n     fuel this country's and state's booming economy.\n       By not increasing the number of H-1B visas granted each \n     year, the government is in effect encouraging United States \n     businesses to enter an all-out civil war for the information \n     technology workers we currently employ here. At a time when \n     the United States is at an historically low rate of \n     unemployment, it is unreasonable for the Federal Government \n     to embrace a policy that in effect robs Peter to pay Paul.\n       On behalf of the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, I again \n     wish to reiterate our strong support for this legislation and \n     urge immediate passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                C.R. ``Bob'' Bell,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of S. 1723, the \nAmerican Competitiveness Act introduced by Senator Spencer Abraham  to \nincrease the cap on H-1B visas to allow our companies to continue to \ncompete.\n  We find ourselves in the midst of a booming American economy, now in \nits 87th month of the longest peacetime economic expansion experienced, \nand with the lowest inflation and unemployment (4.9%) in 25 years. \nHowever, we find that 350,000 information technology (IT) jobs \nnationwide are unfilled. As we speak, the ability to bring\n\n[[Page S4969]]\n\nforeign nationals temporarily into the country on H-1B visas to fill \nthose jobs has been halted as of Monday, May 11. As of last Friday, the \n65,000 H-1B visa cap has been reached in this temporary immigrant \ncategory. New applications will be turned away and the information \ntechnology industry, as well as our universities and colleges will be \nharmed.\n  Minnesota companies affected by this cap have aggressively supported \nthis legislation. 3M estimates its projected research effort will lack \n80 technical employees for slots paying between $60,00 to $100,000. 3M \nhad $15 billion in 1997 worldwide sales. Through the efforts of foreign \nnationals working in their research and development departments, 3M has \nbeen awarded 578 patents. We should continue to encourage this \nprogress.\n  Cargill, another Minnesota-based company, has 10 to 15% of their \ntechnology department unstaffed--about 99 to 110 people with a starting \nsalary of $44,000. They have not been able to meet their needs through \nlocal labor pools and universities. They have been forced to turn to \ntemporary foreign nationals. Furthermore, they tell me they have a 15% \nturn-over because of competition from other U.S. companies.\n  Honeywell has 7,500 Minnesota employees and does not hire a large \nnumber of H-1B nationals--only those of needed technical skills. \nHowever, these shortages affect the productivity of the whole company.\n  Even labor has agreed that there is a temporary need for this \nadjustment; that it may be warranted due to current market conditions \nand global demands. Education and training of the U.S. labor pool is \nbeing outstripped by racing technological advances and industry \ncompetition. The Department of Labor has projected the high tech \nindustry will create 130,000 jobs each year for the foreseeable future.\n  This is at a time when the U.S. Chamber of Commerce tells us our \ndomestic labor pool is shrinking. Baby boomers are leaving a 23 million \npeople labor short fall, and often it is difficult to replace them with \nemployees who have the training and expertise to meet the needs of many \nhighly technical areas.\n\n  Reports show fewer Americans seeking higher education are choosing \nthe high tech fields of electrical engineering, computer science and \nmathematics. The number of Americans graduating with engineering \ndegrees has declined 16% since 1985. Ironically, on the other hand, Mr. \nPresident, the United States is educating a higher percentage of \nforeign nationals in these subjects--48% of PHDs are foreign, 22% of \nundergrads are foreign nationals, and 42% of Master of Sciences \ncandidates are foreign nationals.\n  There is great global competition for all of these graduates. Japan, \nGermany, India and China are trying to lure them away with better deals \nand more benefits. However, the American life style and standard of \nliving are a strong incentive in keeping them here.\n  Another sector affected by the H-1B cap is the university/college \ncommunity. A great deal of research and development is carried on at \nU.S. schools of higher learning. Temporary visiting scholars and \nresearch fellows from abroad have extended our base and expanded our \nscope of understanding in many fields.\n  The University of Minnesota has written me asking for my strong \nsupport of this issue. Their ability to bring foreign scholars and high \nlevel faculty to their campus has raised their standards and \nstrengthened their international stature. Their need has become even \nmore critical since the cap has been reached, because they process 40% \nof their applications for these positions between May and September. \nThey need help now.\n  However, I would like to point out, Mr. President, we do need to look \nfor a more permanent solution to this problem. We cannot rely on \nforeign expertise forever. We need to educate our young people to fill \nthese vacancies. I applaud the inclusion in S. 1723 of the training and \nscholarship incentives for educating our own information technology \nworkers. 20,000 college scholarships a year will be made available to \nlow-income students in math, engineering and computer science through \nthe State Student Incentive Grant program. It will increase training \nfor the unemployed and help people cross-train into these fields. After \nthe bill expires in 5 years, I am hopeful the supply of permanent, \nskilled American workers will be sufficient to meet industry's needs.\n  This bill enhances the current H-1B visas by increasing the penalties \nfive times and improving enforcement against willful offenders, \nalthough there have been few enforcement actions in the past.\n  S. 1723, also, provides no-layoff protection for American workers and \nprohibits underpayment of temporary foreign nationals. In an industry \nwhere starting salaries for these skilled workers are between $35,000 \nand $75,000, by law H-1Bs are to be paid the middle wage of the \nprevailing scale. This wage is posted at the work site and registered \nwith the Labor Department.\n  Let me close, Mr. President by saying that Minnesota companies such \nas Guidant, ADC Telecommunication, Ceridian (formerly Control Data), \nImation (a 3M spin-off), Medtronic and the Carlson Companies should be \nable to fill their IT vacancies now with temporary foreign nationals \nwithout having to shift production off-shore. We need to keep jobs at \nhome and benefit by the expertise and innovation brought to us by these \nglobal technicians. But more importantly, we need to review, upgrade \nand strengthen our U.S. educational system to the point where it can \nbest serve our need for permanent talent driving the information \ntechnology explosion.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I note that this bill contains \nauthorization for programs that will assist in educating and training \nAmerican workers for these positions. It is essential that we include \neducation and training provisions within this bill, but I believe it is \nimportant that we go further.\n  In particular, I believe that employers who are using this program to \nfill short term needs should also contribute to programs that will \neducate and train American workers to fill these positions in the \nfuture. If we are going to increase the immigration quota, then I \nbelieve we have an obligation to assure American workers that they can \nget the training to compete for these goods jobs.\n  So Mr. President, I would hope that as this bill moves forward, we \ncan continue to work together to secure funding for these programs as \nan integral component of this legislation, and in ways that assure that \nwe are not taking away resources from other training programs to meet \nthis need.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am very pleased we could agree on language in the \nmanagers' amendment which authorizes new demonstration programs for \ntechnology skills training for American workers, provided that funding \nfor such training does not diminish funding for existing federal job \ntraining programs. It is important that job-training provisions of this \nbill are consistent with extremely significant legislation we recently \npassed overwhelmingly to improve the federal workforce education and \ntraining system. I thank my colleagues for working with me to achieve \nthat end.\n  Still, while many employers in this country are doing a great deal to \neducate and train technology workers, the clamor for a large increase \nin non-U.S. citizens to fill high-skill jobs here seems clearly to \npoint to a lack both in those efforts and in our public job training \nsystem. Therefore I believe we also need to be sure that those who will \nbenefit the most from any adjustment in immigrant policy will help us \nto address the underlying problem. We in the Senate cannot originate a \nrevenue measure to fund the new training we authorize here. But it \nwould be a serious mistake to enact a final bill that does not call on \nemployers who have pushed for it and will benefit substantially from it \nto help pay for the new training authorized in the bill.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I too am committed to seeing to it that there is funding \nfor these programs. As the Ranking Member knows, I believe that as far \nas the shortage of highly skilled workers is concerned, we have both a \nshort term and a long term problem, and I believe these programs are an \nintegral part of addressing our long term problem. I also believe the \nbusiness community is already doing a great deal to help educate and \ntrain workers. That being said, I pledge to work with you, the other \nmembers of this body, the business community and other affected\n\n[[Page S4970]]\n\noutside interests to seek ways to help fund these programs consistent \nwith the principle you articulated.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of S. 1723, I rise \ntoday to support the American Competitiveness Act.\n  Mr. President, the H-1B immigrant visa program is not the preferred \navenue of hiring by our U.S. high tech companies. Hewlett-Packard, \nwhich is one of Oregon's largest high tech employers, currently employs \nmore than 65,000 people in the United States and uses only 140 H-1B \nvisas. Of these 140 H-1B visas, 17 of them have Ph.D. degrees and the \nremaining of them have at least an equivalency of a Masters degree.\n  Our American companies would prefer to invest in Americans and retain \nthe current domestic workforce. These companies collectively already \nspend, and will continue to spend, billions of dollars each year on \ntraining and educating American workers. Notwithstanding the current \nworkforce, they are unable to fill key personnel slots, and it is \ncritical in order to remain competitive, that they have access, through \nthe H-1B visas, to these foreign-born professionals.\n  According to the American Electronics Association, the U.S. \nelectronics and information industry creates high-skilled, high value-\nadded jobs. The rapid advances in computer technology have increased \ndemand for trained specialists like computer engineers, computer \nsystems analysis, database administrators, and computer support \nspecialists.\n  Even the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that demand for these \noccupations will more than double by 2006. Oregon's largest employer in \nthe state is Intel. And with more than 10,000 employees in Oregon, \nIntel's job growth has grown 167 percent since 1990, creating almost \n40,000 jobs worldwide.\n  In this age of a global marketplace, it is imperative that American \ncompanies have access to a legal supply of skilled professionals in the \nUnited States so that they can continue to grow and expand in the \nUnited States.\n  Failure to increase the H-1B cap will create significant uncertainty \nabout the U.S. government's commitment to enable American companies to \ncompete and participate effectively in the global economy. These \ncompanies will be faced with the tough decisions to either stay in the \nU.S. without a sufficient number of highly skilled staff or possibly \nmove their research and development facilities overseas.\n  Mr. President, the American Competitiveness Act raises the current \ncap for temporary foreign workers to 95,000 in fiscal year 1998 and \ncontains a five-year sunset for the additional H-1B visas. While \nraising the temporary H-1B cap, the American Competitiveness Act also \nincreases education and training in the high technology field for \nAmerican citizens and establishes a data bank on the Internet that \nmatches domestic applicants with available technology jobs.\n  Mr. President, I commend Senator Abraham for his leadership on this \nissue and urge my colleagues to support the American Competitiveness \nAct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there is little question that our \ncountry faces a skills shortage in industries with a concentration of \nworkers who utilize high technology and information technologies. In \nMinnesota, we have very low unemployment in general, and Minnesota \ntechnology industry employers are having a hard time finding workers \nwith the skills they need. The Minnesota Department of Economic \nSecurity released a study last week called ``Beyond 2000: Information \nTechnology Workers in Minnesota,'' which indicated that over 60 percent \nof information-technology employers in the state believe the shortage \nof qualified information technology workers is ``moderately'' or \n``extremely'' serious. Representatives of the Minnesota High Tech \nCouncil have been in touch with my office. They believe that the \nprovisions of the Abraham bill which raise the cap on the number of \nnonimmigrant workers allowed to come temporarily to work in the United \nStates are necessary.\n  I agree that we want to make sure that immigration policy is \nconsistent with our overall desire to remain the world's leader in high \ntechnology industries. The high tech sector is crucial in Minnesota. It \nis an engine of growth and a pillar of current very good economic \nperformance by the state. I take seriously the argument that if the \ncap, which has been reached for this year, is not lifted, then a \nsignificant amount of U.S. high-tech business and a significant amount \nof jobs could actually be moved oversees.\n  At the same time, however, there are three areas of concern that I \nbelieve must be resolved in the bill before it merits support. First is \nthe matter of job training for workers who are U.S. citizens. Much of \nthe debate over the bill is focused on high tech workers. Clearly we \nwould hope that when we are talking about good jobs--jobs that require \nsignificant information technology skills and which pay well--then we \nare making every effort to see to it that U.S. workers have a shot at \nthose jobs. That means training.\n  As ranking member of the Labor Subcommittee on Employment and \nTraining, I'm extremely pleased that we were able to complete and pass \nwith an overwhelming vote recently a bill to reform the country's \nworkforce training and education system. Still, even once that reform \nis enacted, following a conference with the House and passage of a \nconference report, I believe that the fact we are talking about a \nserious shortage of workers with technology skills indicates that our \ncurrent federal job training system, even combined with the large \namount of employer-sponsored education and training that is happening, \nremains inadequate. The skills shortage points to a failure in our \nefforts to educate and train.\n  I had intended to offer an amendment to improve the Abraham bill in \nthis area. I am pleased, though, that we were able to agree to changes \nin the bill which first of all authorize new demonstration programs for \ntechnology skills training for American workers. That provision is in a \nmanagers' amendment, which it is my understanding will be accepted. The \nprovision ensures that funding for that new training will not diminish \nfunding for existing federal job training programs. It therefore is \nconsistent with the workforce education and training reform we passed \nwith such a large vote. It is crucial that a bill which aims to address \na skills shortage in industries that have good jobs available take \nevery step to make sure that our own citizens ultimately can become \nqualified for those jobs.\n  In my view, the new training authorized in the bill should be paid \nfor largely with proceeds from a modest fee collected from employers \nfor each application for the specialized visas. The Senate cannot \ntechnically originate a revenue measure to fund the new training we \nauthorize here. But it is my hope that the House will include such a \nfunding mechanism for new training of U.S. workers and that such a \nprovision will be included in the conference bill. It would be a \nserious mistake to enact a bill that allows a large increase in the \nvisas but does not call on those employers who will most benefit from \nthe bill to help pay for the new training. I appreciate my colleagues' \nwillingness to work with me on the provision that is included in the \nmanagers' amendment, and I appreciate as well the colloquy between \nSenators Abraham, Kennedy and myself indicating support from each of us \nfor funding job training in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I also strongly support both amendments offered by my \ncolleague Senator Kennedy--one of the recruitment of U.S. workers for \navailable high technology jobs and one regarding non-displacement of \nU.S. workers currently holding jobs in the information technology \nindustry. They are moderate amendments and should be included in the \nbill.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time not run against either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at this time, I yield 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, to speak on the bill.\n\n[[Page S4971]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor S. 1723, the American Competitiveness Act, of which I am proud to \nbe an original co-sponsor. Although it deals ostensibly with the visa \ncap on foreign-born high-tech workers, its effect would be far more \nprofound--to enhance the competitiveness of the American economy at a \ntime when U.S. companies, if given access to the necessary resources, \nare poised to dominate the Information Age for decades to come. As the \nrepresentatives of the American people, we in Congress should do all we \ncan to contribute to their potential for success in the global economy.\n  Mr. President, I want to say a special thanks to the Senator from \nMichigan, Senator Abraham. Senator Abraham brought this issue to the \nattention of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle a long time ago. \nIt is a critical issue. It is far more important than it appears on its \nsurface. As I mentioned earlier when we discussed this bill upon the \ncontemplation of it coming before the Senate, the high-tech community, \nthe ``silicon valleys'' all over America, are saying that they need to \nhave skilled workers if we are going to maintain the dominance of this \nindustry and remain competitive throughout the world.\n  The fact is that this piece of legislation is as important to our \nhigh-tech community as any that we will consider this year before the \nU.S. Senate. The taxing of the Internet is close. The issue of \npornography on the Internet is close. But this issue of being able to \nhave enough skilled workers to continue this incredible revolution \ngoing on in Silicon Valley, I believe, is of the utmost importance. The \nSenator from Michigan has led on this issue, and all of us are very \ngrateful for his participation.\n  I might add that he had to go through some very delicate negotiations \nwith the other side of the aisle in order to bring this issue to its \nconclusion.\n  I am convinced that the best thing government can do to advance the \nfortunes of the private sector is to stay out of its way. I support \nthis bill because it makes progress toward that end while providing for \nthe regulatory framework and new educational opportunities to protect \nand promote American workers. By raising the arbitrary cap on temporary \nimmigrant visas for skilled foreign workers--a cap set in 1990, when \nthe Democrats controlled Congress and the American economy was in \nrecession--this legislation gets government out of the way of American \ncompanies, universities, and research labs which simply cannot hire the \nskilled professionals they need in the domestic labor market because of \nan arbitrary, anachronistic cap on H-1B visas that does not reflect the \nforces of supply and demand in the American economy today.\n  Opponents of this legislation surely cannot believe that government \nknows better than business what's best for business in America. We \ncannot and should not condemn American companies for wishing to remain \ncompetitive in the global marketplace. Indeed, we should encourage the \ncompanies that employ our citizens, contribute to our tax base, and \nproduce the goods and services we consume daily to retain the \ncompetitive edge that has sustained them by whatever means are \navailable within the law. If we do not consent to raising the cap on H-\n1B visas for skilled foreign workers, we will be handicapping the very \nAmerican companies and their employees we profess to support as \nlegislators empowered by the people to advance the public interest.\n  Critics having charged that this legislation subordinates the public \ninterest to the private interests of American companies engaged in a \nvast conspiracy to hoodwink Congress and the American people so that \nthey may replace American professionals with skilled foreign workers \ncontent with below-market salaries and no benefits.\n  Had these critics read our bill or spoken with those of us who \nsupport it, they would have had to devise new arguments against raising \nthe H-1B cap by virtue of the emptiness of their own rhetoric. It is a \nfact that this legislation penalizes any employer which lays off an \nAmerican worker in order to replace him with an H-1B visa holder and \npays that individual anything less than the average prevailing wage in \nthat line of work--a standard which often results in a higher salary \nthan made by American entry-level workers. It is also a fact that the \nDepartment of Labor is empowered under the law to investigate and \npenalize willful abuse of the H-1B visa program and has done so \nrepeatedly since the program began in 1990--a fact which disarms those \nmilitants who insist that there exist rampant fraud and abuse within \nthe H-1B market.\n  This is not a debate about the facts, which are unambiguous. This is \na debate about the way in which American society responds to the new \nchallenges and opportunities offered by economic globalization and a \nknowledge-based economy. We can row with the tide or against it, but we \nwill not have an equal prospect for success. Allowing more skilled \nprofessionals to enter the U.S. job market to fill jobs Americans are \nnot filling will enhance the dynamism of the American economy by \nallowing it to more efficiently produce the goods and services demanded \nby the American consumer and those who buy American exports overseas.\n  Erecting barriers to the inflow of valuable human capital will not \nhelp American businesses, workers, or consumers. Businesses will suffer \nfrom the costs of a labor shortage which they are powerless to change \nin the short term. Workers will suffer when their companies lose the \nprofits that would accrue from hiring the skilled workers that are \nunavailable. And consumers will pay higher prices for the goods and \nservices which are available while going without those which are not. \nEveryone will lose as American companies shift production overseas to \nthe sources of the specialized labor they cannot attract in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, the Information Technology Association of America \nestimates that there are more than 346,000 unfilled positions for \nhighly-skilled workers in American companies today.\n  A recent Department of Labor study estimates that the American \neconomy will generate 1.3 million new jobs during each of the next ten \nyears in the computer and information-technology industries. The same \nstudy predicts that American universities will be able to supply only a \nquarter of the graduates needed to fill those jobs during that period. \nThe Hudson Institute predicts that in a few years this worker shortage, \nif not addressed, will cause a five percent drop in the growth rate of \nthe gross domestic product, which breaks down to a startling $200 \nbillion loss in national output.\n  In the words of T.J. Rodgers, President and CEO of Cypress \nSemiconductor Corporation, ``It takes two percent of Americans to feed \nus all, and five percent to make everything we need. Everything else \nwill be service and information technology, and in that world humans \nand brains will be the key variable. Any country that would limit its \nbrain power to single select group from that country alone is going to \nself-destruct.''\n  I support this bill because I do not wish to encourage more U.S. \ncompanies to set up shop in India, Pakistan, Costa Rica, and other \nsources of skilled labor unavailable in sufficient quantities in the \nUnited States. I support this bill because I do not think a job is \nbetter going unfilled that going to an educated foreign national on a \ntemporary visa to the United States. I support this bill because I \nbelieve the Information Age will be built upon a globalized market for \npeople and technology, not upon barriers to the free flow of goods, \nservices, and professional workers. I support this bill because I do \nnot believe the endless advertisements for specialized labor at \nattractive salaries in the Employment section of the Sunday newspaper \nrepresent a conspiracy by Big Business to fool us all into thinking \nthere really are jobs on offer in many of America's fastest-growing \ncompanies. I support this bill because I do not think the government is \na better judge of the needs of American companies, universities, and \nlaboratories than are the very companies, universities, and \nlaboratories that have urged us to write this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I, for one, do not take the health of the American \neconomy or the fabulous returns offered by Wall Street for granted. \nAmerica prospers when we allow entrepreneurs, small businesses, \ncompanies, universities,\n\n[[Page S4972]]\n\nand research labs to create wealth and knowledge. Government does not \ncause economic growth; hard-working people do. It is appalling to think \nthat we would stand in the way of those who would temporarily come to \nour country to add their value to the economy by working in jobs \nAmericans cannot and do not fill.\n  Over the long term, we must see to it that American workers possess \nthe skills and know-how to fill the jobs created by American high-tech \nfirms. For this reason, our legislation provides for 20,000 new college \nscholarships annually for low-income students in math, engineering, and \ncomputer science through the State Student Incentive Grant program. Our \nbill also sunsets the higher H-1B visa cap after five years so we can \ndetermine whether an increased supply of foreign professionals remains \nnecessary to our economic well-being.\n  American unemployment levels stand at their lowest levels in over two \ndecades. Americans are not responding to the ``Wanted'' ads in their \nlocal newspapers for high-tech and other skilled positions at U.S. \ncompanies, universities, and research centers. Company recruiters are \nhounding college students--on campus, in the libraries, even at the \nbeach during Spring Break--to sign on to lucrative contracts with \nAmerican firms.\n  Mr. President, we simply cannot afford to allow this desperate trend \nto continue. The 65,000-person cap on H-1B workers for Fiscal Year 1998 \nwas reached last week. American companies cannot meet their hiring \nneeds until the new Fiscal Year begins on October 1 unless Congress \nacts now. Should we fail to do so, we will all pay the price imposed by \nour shortsightedness. The Information Age and the global marketplace \nare a reality which we neglect at our peril when we refuse to provide \nthe regulatory framework within which the American economy can thrive \nand Americans can prosper. The American Competitiveness Act deserves \nour support.\n  Mr. President, in addition, this is the last of several bills that we \ncall high-tech bills. I think it is the most important one. I hope that \nwe in the Senate recognize that we need to enact further legislation to \nhelp high-tech industries in America.\n  What has happened is remarkable. What has happened is fragile. And \nwhat has happened deserves our attention and support as we provide an \nenormous growth in opportunity, growth in the way of economy and \nopportunity to provide knowledge to all Americans and all citizens of \nthe world in the most unprecedented fashion; in fact, the most \nremarkable changes taking place in the world since the industrial \nrevolution.\n  I appreciate the cognizance by the Senator from Michigan of this fact \nand his responsibility for this important legislation.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nArizona for his support of this legislation. He has been a great ally \nwith regard to not only this bill but, as the Presiding Officer knows, \na variety of other similar legislation to make America more \ncompetitive. I thank him for having helped me to move the legislation \nto the floor today. He has been a great friend and ally on this.\n  I now yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Washington to speak \nwith respect to the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this debate on the bill of the Senator \nfrom Arizona and his opponents, or those who would significantly change \nit and limit it, is a debate between optimists and pessimists about the \nAmerican condition. Senator Abraham's proposal stems from the \nproposition that we are in a society so dynamic, changing so rapidly, \nwith so many new technologies on each and every day, that we can do \nnothing but benefit by recruiting into that economy the most highly \nskilled people from dozens of nations around the world who seek to make \ntheir contribution to humanity as a part of the United States of \nAmerica as against the nations from which they come, hobbled by \nsocietal and governmental restrictions. A large number of the men and \nwomen on whom this battle is being waged have been educated here in the \nUnited States and have already begun to become a part of our culture. \nIt is the theory of this bill, a theory borne out by the experience of \nH-1B so far, that not only are these men and women who seek to become \nAmericans contributing to their own well-being and to the progress of \nour society but are, in fact, creating jobs for others.\n  The opponents of this bill, those who would restrict it, those who \nwould tie it by all kinds of restrictions so as to make it \nimpracticable for most of the high-tech companies of the United States \nto use, still believe implicitly in a zero sum economy--that any job, \nno matter how skilled, taken by someone who was born somewhere else \nwill inevitably result in a job being deprived from some person born in \nthe United States of America.\n  They do this despite the fact that at the hearing on this bill, as I \nunderstand it, the Department of Labor could come up with only one \nexample of a true displacement and a guess that there might be two or \nthree others somewhere across the United States.\n  So, Mr. President, if you believe that we are not really competitive, \nthat we can't grow, that every job that one person takes of a skilled \nnature simply comes at the expense of another job already there, then \nof course you can support the amendments proposed by the Senator from \nMassachusetts and by the administration, and wreck a system that has \nalready been so successful that we need to expand it in order to meet \nthe expanding needs of a dynamic and growing American society and \nAmerican economy.\n  I find it particularly curious that these attempts to say that every \nrecruiting company must follow rules set out by the Government in \nrecruiting and in retention, detailed rules with major penalties for \nnoncompliance, have made no such proposal with respect to the great \nbulk of American immigration.\n  We get tens, hundreds of thousands of immigrants every year who come \nto the United States under the guise of family reunification, as \nseekers of political asylum, as refugees, the great bulk of which have \nfew, if any, skills and over whom there has been a major debate lasting \nover the last 3 years as to their eligibility for various forms of \nwelfare and who, when they get jobs in order to get off welfare, will \nbe taking the lowest skilled jobs that the United States has to offer \nwhere there may well be a real displacement. Yet, these requirements, \nthe requirements of the amendments we are about to deal with, do not \ndeal with these immigrants coming in far larger numbers than the extra \n30,000 skilled employees about whom we are speaking at the present \ntime.\n  Mr. President, the proposal of the Senator from Michigan is a \nproposal for a dynamic future for the United States. It is a proposal \nthat will not only create opportunities for men and women, many of whom \nare educated in the United States, and others of whom are exceptional \npeople for themselves, but for the new jobs and the new opportunities \nthey will create.\n  Let me just take one or two examples of a specific company and the \nway in which it would be impacted by the proposed amendments. My \nfriends at Microsoft tell me they will have hired an individual for a \n12-month contract to do a very specific task, say, to develop an \nInternet site for stamp and coin collectors but then determined that \nthere wasn't enough to warrant going on with the project and dismissed \nthe employee. The proposed amendments backed by the administration \nwould prevent Microsoft from hiring any new H-1B worker for any project \nfor a period of at least 3 to 9 months, or if someone is dismissed \nbecause they have worked on a project and are experts at something \nwhich is now an anachronism, you cannot hire a new one through H-1B for \nsomething that looks to the future and is totally and completely \ndifferent without meeting all of these restrictions.\n  Today we have an example of the Clinton administration's desire to \nhave lawyers and judges design computers. In the amendments this \nafternoon, quite consistent with that philosophy, we have its desire to \nact as an employment agency for all of the high-tech companies in \nAmerica, to tell them who they can hire, when they can hire\n\n[[Page S4973]]\n\nthem, when they can fire them, and what the restrictions on them will \nbe.\n  That is not the way we caused our economy in the course of the last \n10 years to be one about which we have many questions, many jealousies \nof the Japanese and of others to the point at which we clearly dominate \nthe world in the very fields in which this bill by the Senator from \nMichigan is designed to keep us preeminent.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Michigan for his dogged determination \nto see to it that we get to this vote and to say that we should deal \nwith it with no amendments other than those of which he approves.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just while my friend from the State of \nWashington is here, I would ask him if he would read through both the \namendments which I intend to offer about protection against \ndisplacement of U.S. workers, because the Senator has misstated what my \namendment does and then differed with it. The amendment is very clear. \nIt says:\n  For purposes of this section the term ``replacement'' means the \nemployment of the nonimmigrant at the specific place of employment in \nthe specific employment opportunity from which the United States worker \nwith substantially equivalent qualifications and experience in the \nspecific employment opportunity has been laid off.\n  That is identical language to what is in the Abraham amendment. So it \nis difficult--when the Senator talks about Microsoft talking about \nlaying off some employee, not being able to hire someone for 6 months \nis completely inaccurate. I intend to speak further, but if the Senator \nwanted to make some comment I would be glad to hear it. But I hope \nperhaps he might look at page 2 at the definitions of the amendment and \nI think he would find it is different from what the Senator has stated.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this Senator simply wishes to report that \nthe Kennedy amendments place the Department of Labor in the shoes of \nmost of these employers with respect to the criteria with which they \nwill engage in employment. We have sent the amendments that the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts proposes to the companies that will be affected by \nthem and asked them, the people who are engaged in these hiring \nactivities, what the impact will be. They report to us exactly what I \nhave told the Senate here today. They report, in fact, that the Kennedy \namendments are so disastrous for their recruiting they will be worse \noff with 95,000 H-1Bs and the Kennedy amendments than they would be to \nretain present law.\n  I, for one, am willing to accept the views of the employers in the \nhigh-tech community on the impact of these amendments as being exactly \nwhat they feel would apply to them. They do not want the Department of \nLabor making more of their employment decisions than they are making \ntoday.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Mr. President, this is the problem. Some companies \ndistort and misrepresent what these amendments are. All The Senator has \nto do is read the amendment. In the recruitment area, our amendment \nsays:\n  Take such steps to include a good faith recruitment in the United \nStates using procedures that meet industry-wide standards.\n  Those are industry-wide standards. All we are trying to do is protect \nAmerican workers. If there is a job out there and an American can do \nit, we are saying let him or her have the first crack at it. Let's not \ndisplace an American worker with a foreign worker and then find the \ncorresponding pressure that is put upon them.\n  As I mentioned before, over 90 percent of the workers who are coming \nin are making $75,000 or less. So it is difficult for me to listen to \nthe Senator from Washington talk about the kind of esoteric job he was \nlooking at in terms of what might be needed for Microsoft and relating \nit to the more than 90 percent of workers who earn less than $75,000 \nper year. These are the workers--75 percent earn less than $50,000 and \n16 earn more than $75,000. It seems to me we ought to be able to \ndevelop the training programs for those workers.\n  I would like to read through a few of the letters we have here that I \nmentioned earlier. One is from February of this year from Mr. \nWhittlinger in Torrance, CA.\n\n       Chalk up a Republican's support for your stand on not \n     allowing foreign high tech immigrants in until and unless \n     more Americans are given a chance first. I am unemployed \n     (downsized) and cannot get a job, yet I see companies bring \n     in foreign programmers over hiring me who is already trained \n     (although perhaps not to latest technology/ program \n     languages). But I also see a reduced quality and wages (which \n     I think is the primary goal of these companies.)\n\n  This is from a technology information worker who expressed his views \non this particular provision.\n  Jay Roberts from the State of Maryland writes:\n\n       Currently, I work in the information industry as a senior \n     level individual. My observation is there is little if any \n     shortage.\n\n  This is a recruiter who says he is in the information industry. And \nhe says:\n\n       We are quite capable of hiring all the qualified help that \n     we need at currently prevailing wages. Should there be any \n     question on this point, prepare the most qualified software \n     resume of which you can think and send it to Microsoft. There \n     is a 95 percent chance that they will not even acknowledge \n     it.\n       There not being a true software professional shortage makes \n     us face this for what it is--the H1B program is in effect an \n     indentured servant program. H1B workers typically work at \n     lower wages than Americans, and with less complaint.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The current technology revolution has the promise of \n     restoring broad middle class prosperity, which has been \n     severely eroded. . . .\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       If wages do increase to reflect temporary shortages, this \n     soon corrects itself by more college graduates and career \n     challenges.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Please demonstrate that you support the goals, prosperity, \n     and future of your constituency by opposing increases in the \n     H1B quotas. Furthermore, please begin efforts to force H1B \n     employers to proactively demonstrate that they are hiring and \n     training U.S. citizens prior to any H1B approval.\n\n  This is to President Clinton on the same issue, from Mr. Burns, of \nPortland, OR.\n\n       If companies are truly so desperate for engineers they \n     should try raising salaries or expanding in areas of the US \n     outside of Silicon Valley. And if the visa limit must truly \n     be raised, then companies who hire H1B engineers should be \n     willing to never layoff US citizen engineers, but I doubt \n     they'll ever accept that.\n       High-Tech companies are always in favor of a free market \n     and want to limit government intervention. But, when it comes \n     to employment, they demand special treatment rather than \n     letting supply and demand dictate salaries.\n\n  I guess he must be referring to what the GAO report showed, that \nthere hadn't been any noticeable, significant increase in salaries in \nthese areas. Generally, when you get a shortage of the professional \npersonnel, salaries go up: Supply and demand. The GAO review of the \nCommerce Department's study indicates there is no increase, virtually, \nin these salaries. That is what we are seeing, and we are hearing from \na lot of these American workers, who are trying to find employment.\n  Here is a letter dated February of this year:\n\n       Dear Mr. President,\n       I am graduating with a degree of computer science this \n     spring. I am in deep debt and hope to find work quickly so I \n     may repay it.\n       If you allow them to raise or eliminate the current 60,000 \n     person quota on foreign computer workers it will be nothing \n     less than a knife in my heart.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       I hope you are on the side of indebted college students on \n     this one.\n\n  You know, the list goes on. Here is the letter from Martin Rojo, San \nMateo. He said:\n\n       . . . I am a professional software engineer who conducts \n     hiring interviews. I can state that in my experience there is \n     no shortage of qualified workers. While it is rare that \n     someone exactly matches a job description in the esoteric \n     world of software and hardware, the candidate's mental acumen \n     is a more important indicator of success than any specific \n     language or platform.\n       The real purpose behind any attempt to lift visa \n     restrictions is, in my opinion, to allow importation of cheap \n     labor. Part of my past coworkers were hired on H-1B visas, \n     and they were tied to an employer in the manner of an \n     indentured servant, while perfectly qualified American \n     citizens did not get the job. This might be fine in farm \n     labor, but there are many Americans who would fill the open \n     positions if allowed.\n\n  We are basically saying OK, let's increase the numbers in a temporary \nway. But let us also develop training programs so Americans can fill \nthose jobs in the future. And let's say no to displacing American \nworkers with foreign temporary workers. And let's also\n\n[[Page S4974]]\n\nsay that there must be at least minimum efforts to recruit Americans, \nfollowing whatever the industry standard is.\n  All they have to do is attest, check the box, ``We have followed the \nindustry standard and attest we have tried to hire an American.''\n  I find it difficult to understand, among our colleagues here--what is \nwrong with seeking American workers for these jobs? What is wrong with \njust asking employers to observe a requirement to recruit American \nworkers? That is what these amendments do. They ensure that employers \nare at least going to make an effort to try to recruit Americans and \nmake assurance they are not going to lay off Americans and to displace \nthose Americans from a job that will then be filled by a foreigner.\n  It seems to me, if we had those two measures and an effective \ntraining program, then we could respond to whatever the needs of the \ninformation technology industry are for the best and the brightest \nworkers.\n  But it comes down, Mr. President, to what we do for American workers \nwho, despite doing a good job, in many instances, have been displaced. \nWe find out that there is basic prejudice and discrimination against \nthem. I think that is wrong.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Perhaps, Madam President, I owe the Senator from \nMassachusetts an apology. Perhaps it is true that he knows better than \nthese high-tech companies whom they ought to hire and when they ought \nto hire them. Perhaps his effectively granting to the Department of \nLabor the determination of when a layoff is a layoff and when it is \nnot, when a replacement is an appropriate replacement and when it is \nnot, will be dealt with entirely benignly and will not harm any of our \ninternational competitiveness.\n  But, Madam President, I think not. I believe that these companies are \nbetter judges of their own needs than is the Senator from Massachusetts \nor the Department of Labor. And I am convinced that, looking around us, \nwe can see how well this system has worked for the last 10 years, as \nevidenced by the dynamism and the growth of the American economy \nmatched by no one else. Let's extend what already works rather than \ndestroying what already works. Let's be optimists and not pessimists.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I will yield at this point to the \nSenator from Ohio, up to 10 minutes. I believe we have used all of our \ntime on the bill, so I yield 10 minutes to him, off of one of the \namendments that are time controlled.\n  Before he speaks, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his work and his \nstaff's efforts to work with our staff and the staff of the ranking \nmember and Senator Lieberman and several others, and especially the \nSenator from Vermont, the chairman of the Labor Committee, to craft \nwhat will be ultimately a provision in the managers' amendment that I \nthink effectively begins to address the issue of job training as a part \nof this legislation.\n  At this point, I yield to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 1723, \nthe American Competitiveness Act. I'd like to commend Senators Abraham \nand Hatch for introducing such a well crafted piece of legislation.\n  I think the title of this bill--the American Competitiveness Act--is \nespecially appropriate, since we are talking about a bill that will \nmake our companies stronger and more able to compete in the global \nmarketplace. None of our businesses can run efficiently when they are \nunderstaffed--and in today's marketplace there are plenty of overseas \ncompetitors who will pick up the slack and take away our customers if \nwe give them that opportunity.\n  When the Commerce Department, using the Labor Department's data, \nprojects that our economy will continue to grow at such a rate that \nmore than 1.3 million new information technology jobs will be created \nover the next decade--but that our universities will produce less than \na quarter of the necessary number of information technology graduates, \nsimple math tells us that there will be a shortage of these highly \nskilled workers.\n  It may surprise people that the high-tech industry is not just about \nSilicon Valley. Ohio now ranks 10th in the nation in high-tech \nemployment and 8th in high-tech exports. In Ohio, these jobs, on \naverage, pay close to $14,000 higher than Ohio's average private sector \nwage--$14,000. I want to keep these jobs in Ohio and I don't want to \nsee them moved overseas.\n  But let's look beyond statistics at what some of the largest \nemployers in our country are telling us. They are the one we need to \nlisten to. NCR, a leading high-tech company based in Ohio, has \nexpressed concern that the estimated 340,000 high-tech worker shortage \nnationwide could affect NCR's ability to fill key high-tech positions. \nTRW, which is also based in Ohio, is a good example of how this \nshortage of skilled workers affects more than just the information \ntechnology industry. TRW, which produces safety equipment for the \nautomotive industry and equipment for the defense industry, tells me \nthat only one U.S. citizen for every 10 foreign students apply at TRW \nwhen they go onto a college campus to recruit. The company currently \nhas 1,100 openings nationwide. These unfilled jobs are not helping this \ncompany to expand and create more jobs.\n  Procter & Gamble is another Ohio-based company that uses H-1B visas \nto hire about six to ten foreign nationals a year. Some people may \nwonder why such a low number of employees are so essential to a \ncompany's productivity, but these specialized scientists, many with \ndoctoral degrees, are needed for key projects. Reaching this year's \narbitrary limit on H-1B visas will prevent all employers from filling \nsuch specialized positions until the next fiscal year begins, thus \ndelaying some key projects for up to six months. When those key \nprojects are delayed, this means other American workers cannot work, \nother American workers will not be able to work on these projects. In \nour global marketplace, competitiveness demands that our companies be \nable to beat their overseas competitors to market. Any delay in the \nproduct cycle--from innovation or creation to production--impedes such \ncompetitiveness and could result in such companies moving their \noperations overseas where such hiring limitations do not exit for their \noverseas competitors.\n\n  Also, in a global marketplace, it only makes sense that small and \nlarge domestic companies must cater to a wide range of customer \npreferences and needs--they must know what the traditions and cultures \nof all of the countries are that they serve. I would rather have these \ncompanies hire a few foreign workers under our H-1B visa program, \nrather than have these companies move their base of operations--and \nAmerican jobs--overseas.\n  The best and the brightest of the foreign workforce are brought into \nour country under the H-1B system. These are productive men and women \nwho create innovative technologies--many receiving patents for the U.S. \ncompanies they work for--and whose ideas launch new projects and, thus, \ncreate new jobs for our domestic workforce.\n  I am a firm believer in educating and training our domestic workforce \nfrom within, so that this shortage of highly skilled labor may one day \nbe solved. I strongly believe that part of the solution to this \nshortage depends on how we raise and educate our children and \nteenagers--this is why the 20,000 scholarships per year created under \nthis bill (some for low income students) for math and engineering and \ncomputer science majors is such an important part of the bill, and such \na strong contribution. I again salute my colleague from Michigan for \ninclusion of this Provision in the bill. Improving the educational \nprocess--whether it is job training focused on teens and adults, or \nmath and science courses for children--is not something that can be \nachieved overnight. We must realistically face the shortage of highly \nskilled, high-tech workers and allow our companies to hire the workers \nthey need to stay competitive in this global marketplace. The world \nwill not wait for us to catch up in the math and science fields. We \nmust move forward.\n  The enforcement penalties included in the bill will also help us \nprotect our\n\n[[Page S4975]]\n\ndomestic workforce form those who willfully violate the H-1B program. \nFirst, the bill increases penalties for such violators by 5 times the \ncurrent penalty--by increasing fines from $1,000 to $5,000. The bill \nalso provides for a 5-year probationary period during which spot \ninspections of the violating firms may occur at the discretion of the \nDepartment of Labor. The bill also adds a $25,000 fine per violation, \nand a two-year debarment from all employment immigration programs, in \ncases where an employer lays off a U.S. worker and willfully underpays \na H1-B worker to replace the U.S. worker.\n  This bill also modifies the per-country limits an employment based \nvisas. This modification will help prevent further discriminatory \neffects that the current per-country limit creates for otherwise \nqualified people from China and India.\n  I strongly support Senator Abraham's bill. I believe it contains \nessential provisions to protect our domestic workforce from willful \nviolators by increasing fines and investigative or probationary \nperiods. Out domestic employers and workforce need to have the cap on \nH-1B visas raised in order to remain competitive. I urge my colleagues \nin the Senate to vote in favor of the Abraham bill.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his \nsupport and help on this legislation. As I said before, it is \nespecially appropriate to thank him because of his leadership on the \nentire topic of workforce development. He is the chairman of the Senate \nsubcommittee that deals with preparing our workforce, job training and \nother similar topics. I know his support of the approach we are taking \nin this legislation should satisfy Members on both sides of the aisle, \ngiven the respect with which he is held on these issues, that the \nlegislation which we are working on today addresses the concerns of the \nlong term of how we are going to prepare American workers to hold these \njobs when this short-term solution expires. I thank him.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the \ntime not be assessed to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 11 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S4962-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4975-S4976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE TOBACCO LEGISLATION AND YOUTH SMOKING\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we will be moving towards the votes as \nset out by the two leaders for votes on these amendments in \napproximately 2 hours. But while there is a brief moment, I would like \nto address the Senate on one of the issues that we will be addressing \nlater this evening and on tomorrow. That is the amendment that will be \noffered hopefully in a bipartisan way by Republicans and Democrats on \nthe tobacco bill to raise the cost per pack of tobacco from $1.10 to \n$1.50.\n  I have hopes that this will be a bipartisan amendment since there \nhave been Republicans and Democrats who have supported that position \nboth in the Finance Committee when the Finance Committee accepted that \nconcept last week and also in the Budget Committee. I think that there \nare those on both sides of the aisle that support that particular \nmeasure.\n  I will strongly support the measure and welcome the opportunity to be \none of those who commends that position to the Senate, when it is \nhoped, we will have some determination on that as one of the first \norders of business. I believe that under the proposition, which will be \nannounced later on this evening by the two leaders, that will be one of \nthe measures which will be addressed and voted on tomorrow. So I will \njust take a few moments now to express my strong support for increasing \nthe cigarette price by $1.50 per pack.\n  Mr. President, youth smoking in America has reached epidemic \nproportions. According to the report issued last month by the Centers \nfor Disease Control Prevention, smoking rates among high school \nstudents have risen by nearly a third between 1991 and 1997. Among \nAfrican-Americans, the smoking rates have soared by 80 percent. And \nmore than 36 percent of high school students smoke--a 19-year high.\n  With youth smoking at such a crisis level and still increasing, we \ncannot rely on half measures. Congress must use the strongest \nlegislative tools available to reduce youth smoking as rapidly as \npossible.\n  The amendment we will have before us tomorrow will provide for a \ncigarette price increase of $1.50 per pack over the next 3 years. The \n$1.10 per pack increase over 5 years in the managers' amendment is not \nadequate to achieve the youth smoking reduction goals of 60 percent. \nAnd by raising it by $1.50 instead of $1.10 a pack, we can deter an \nadditional 750,000 children from smoking over the next 5 years. That \nwill mean 250,000 fewer premature deaths from tobacco-induced \nillnesses.\n  Public health experts have overwhelmingly concluded that an increase \nof $1.50 a pack is the minimum cigarette price increase necessary to \nachieve our youth-smoking reduction goals.\n  Dr. C. Everett Koop and Dr. David Kessler, the National Academy of \nSciences, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, \nthe American Lung Association, the American Medical Association, the \nENACT Coalition, and the Save Lives Not Tobacco Coalition have all \nstressed the importance of a price increase of at least $1.50 a pack. \nIt is the single most important step we can take to reduce youth \nsmoking.\n\n  More than a third of the Senate have already cosponsored bills \nproposing the $1.50 a pack increase. The Senate Budget Committee \nendorsed $1.50 on a bipartisan vote of 14-8 in March. Last Thursday, a \nbipartisan majority in the Finance Committee voted for a cigarette \nprice index of $1.50. Too many young lives are at stake for us to \nignore the advice of all the public health experts.\n  Mr. President, the $1.10 increase, on the other hand, simply will not \ndo the job. According to the University of Illinois' Professor Frank \nChaloupka, the Nation's leading authority on the impact of higher \ncigarette prices on teenage smoking, an increase of $1.50 a pack would \nreduce youth smoking by nearly 50 percent. When combined with the youth \naccess provisions and other tobacco control measures, the $1.50 per \npack increase will reduce youth smoking by 60 percent and reach the \ntarget that we have set. In addition, if the tobacco industry plays by \nthe rules and no longer targets young Americans with their \nadvertisements and promotions, no look-back penalties would need to be \napplied above the $1.50 a pack increase.\n  According to Professor Chaloupka, the $1.10 increase will reduce \nyouth smoking by only a third. Even with the nonprice provision in the \ntobacco legislation, it would be very difficult to achieve the targets \nfor reducing youth smoking.\n  Ask any parents if saving 750,000 additional children from a lifetime \nof nicotine addiction and tobacco-induced disease is worth the extra 40 \ncents needed for the $1.50 price increase instead of the $1.10 \nincrease.\n  Ask any person who is concerned about the health of the Nation's \nchildren whether we should do all we can to prevent these young \nAmericans from taking up this deadly habit.\n  The vast majority of the American people support the $1.50 per pack \nincrease and Congress should support it, too. Ask any taxpayer if they \nwant to continue to shoulder the burden of paying the health costs of \nthe Nation's smokers. Seventy-five percent of Americans do not smoke, \nyet the Department of Treasury finds that they pay $130 billion each \nyear for the health costs in lost productivity of the 25 percent who do \nsmoke.\n  Ask any American if they have had enough of the tobacco industry's \ndistortions and denials of the addictiveness of nicotine or about the \nindustry's cynical marketing of cigarettes to children or about the \nindustry's decades-long coverup of the health risks associated with \nsmoking.\n\n[[Page S4976]]\n\n  This is an industry which once argued that cigarettes are no more \naddictive than Gummy Bears. This is an industry that used Joe Camel in \nadvertising blatantly designed to hook children on smoking, yet they \nnow ask us to believe that a $1.10 or $1.50 increase will lead to big \ntobacco's bankruptcy and a rampant black market for illegal cigarettes.\n  The challenge is clear. One million young people between the ages of \n12 and 17 take up the deadly habit each year--3,000 new smokers a day. \nThe average smoker begins smoking at age 13 and becomes a daily smoker \nbefore age 15. One-third of these children will die prematurely from a \ntobacco-induced disease.\n  Once children become hooked on cigarette smoking at a young age, it \nbecomes increasingly harder for them to quit. And 90 percent of current \nadult smokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18. Ninety-\nfive percent of teenaged smokers say they intend to quit in the near \nfuture, but only a quarter of them actually do quit within the first 8 \nyears of beginning to smoke.\n  The tobacco companies have known these facts for years. They are \nfully aware that they need to persuade children to take up smoking in \norder to preserve their future profits. That is why big tobacco has \nlong targeted children with billions of dollars in advertising and \npromotional giveaways that promise popularity, excitement and success \nfor young men and women who take up smoking.\n  The recent documents released in the Minnesota case against the \ntobacco industry reveals the true extent of the industry's marketing \nstrategy to children.\n  In 1981, in the Philip Morris memo, ``Young Smokers, Prevalence, \nImplications and Related Demographic Trends,'' the authors wrote that:\n\n       It is important to know as much as possible about teenage \n     smoking patterns and attitude. Today's teenager is tomorrow's \n     potential regular customer. The overwhelming majority of \n     smokers first begin to smoke while still in their teens.\n\n  The smoking patterns are particularly important to Philip Morris. \nFurthermore, it is during the teenage years that the initial choice is \nmade. Nothing is done to reverse this trend in adolescent smoking. The \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 5 million of \ntoday's children will die prematurely from smoke-caused illnesses.\n  The American public has had enough of the daily tragedy of death and \ndisease caused by tobacco use. They are demanding dramatic action by \nCongress to drastically curb youth smoking. This Congress will be \njudged in large measure by whether or not we respond effectively to \nthat challenge. Increasing cigarette prices by $1.50 is the most \neffective way to reduce teenage smoking. The public health community \nagrees it is the minimum increase needed to achieve the national goal \nof reduced youth smoking by 60 percent over 10 years. Study after study \nhas shown that raising cigarette prices is the most powerful weapon in \nreducing cigarette use among children, since children have less income \nthan adults to spend on tobacco, and most children are not yet \naddicted.\n  Philip Morris, the Nation's largest tobacco company, concedes as much \nin an internal memorandum as far back as 1981. That memorandum stated, \n``It is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the smoking \nprevalence of teenagers.'' And the goals of reducing teenage smoking \nand balancing the budget would both be served by increasing the Federal \nexcise tax on cigarettes. In 1982, R.J. Reynolds said essentially the \nsame thing in that ``the key finding is that younger adult males are \nhighly sensitive to price. Price may create a barrier which prevents \nthe appeal from developing into an ongoing choice to become a smoker.''\n  Canada increased its cigarette prices between 1980 and 1981 until \nthere was a $3 difference in cigarette prices with the United States \noverall. An increase of $1.50 a pack is clearly realistic. In addition, \nit is not likely that the $1.50 increase in the manufacturers' level \nwill turn into a much higher real price increase at the retail level.\n  The difference between a $1.10 increase and a $1.50 increase is \nliterally that 750,000 more children will be deterred from smoking over \nthe next 5 years. We shouldn't sacrifice these children to a lifetime \nof tobacco-induced illnesses. The lives of these children hang in the \nbalance.\n  The American people are calling on you to have the courage to act. \nThe $1.50 increase has broad public support. The public health \ncommunity deserves the support of the full Senate, too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S4975-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4976-S5001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, would the distinguished chairman of the \nImmigration Subcommittee yield me 5 minutes to speak on behalf of his \nbill and against the Kennedy amendments?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield the Senator from Texas such time as he may need. \nI believe this would have to be yielded from time that is to be \navailable for the amendments\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There is 1 minute 20 \nseconds remaining on the bill.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield 5 minutes from the time reserved for our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I thank our dear colleague for yielding. \nI congratulate him on this bill, the American Competitiveness Act.\n  Over the years, we have wisely attracted the best and brightest to \nAmerica. We have recognized that having talented people come to our \ncountry to work has not only not displaced American workers, but it has \ncreated an intellectual base that has help create millions of jobs.\n\n  I want to congratulate Senator Abraham for this bill. I think it is \nvitally important, and I am proud to be a supporter of the bill. I \nthink it is interesting to note that the companies most strongly \nsupporting Senator Abraham's bill are America's fastest growing \ncompanies. These are the companies that are creating most of the new \njobs in America. Especially those companies that are in high-tech areas \nand research areas that are primarily responsible for generating the \nnew products, the new know-how and the new technology that will create \njobs now and in the 21st century.\n  I understand that Senator Kennedy will be offering two amendments. \nAlthough they have not technically been offered yet, I know enough \nabout the amendments to know that I am opposed to them. Senator Kennedy \nis trying to preserve the jobs of the 1950s. Senator Abraham is trying \nto create jobs now and in the 21st century. Senator Kennedy believes \nthat if we can keep new, talented people out of America, as a \ncontributory factor to the intellectual base of our country, we can \ninduce innovative businesses to hire more Americans. Senator Abraham \nunderstands that we need an intellectual base to help us create the \nproducts and the technology that will create thousands and ultimately \nmillions of new jobs.\n  In these two amendments that will be offered, we really have a debate \nbetween the past and the future. The past deals with the idea that we \ncan somehow protect jobs by keeping talented people out of the country. \nThe future is a recognition that America has literally drained the \nbrain talent of the world by bringing talented people to America, and, \nin the process, talented people here have found more opportunity, more \nfreedom, than any other people who have lived. They have created an \neconomic system that is unrivaled throughout the world.\n  The first amendment Senator Kennedy will offer states that if a \ncompany brings in an H-1B visa worker, and later has to lay someone \noff, the company is in violation of the law. The problem is that in \ndealing with innovative companies, people are hired based on creating \nnew products and based on success of their research. To force a company \nto guarantee that it will not, in the next 6 months, have to lay anyone \noff is to ask them to guarantee the success of their research. As we \nknow from the experience of Europe, which is still trying to follow the \npolicies of the 1950s that are built into the Kennedy amendments, if a \ncompany does not have the right to lay people off when a project fails, \nit can not take the risk to\n\n[[Page S4977]]\n\nhire the very people who make it possible for it to succeed.\n  The second amendment deals with giving the Labor Department the \nability to make a final judgment and to second-guess an employer as to \nwhether or not a person who is a resident of the United States could \nhave been found to do the work. I simply want to remind my colleagues \nthat the existing law states that a company can not bring in an H-1B \nworker from outside and pay them less than either the prevailing wage \nor the actual wage. So it is not a case of bringing in people who will \nwork for less.\n  Also, the bill offered by Senator Abraham strengthens current law by \nproviding a $25,000 fine and a 2-year debarment from the program for \nthose who willfully violate the law.\n  So the question is: If there are talented people who can come to our \nuniversities, to our research labs, to our high-tech companies bringing \nwith them human capital that can help us create technology and products \nthat will put millions of our own people to work, why not ask them to \ncome to America, instead of inducing American companies to invest \nabroad in order to employ them in their country?\n  It seems to me that the most revealing thing about this whole debate \nis the companies that use this H-1B program are the companies that have \nthe fastest growing employment base of American citizens. We are not \ntalking about companies that are experiencing declining employment \ntrying to bring in technical people from abroad. It is companies in \nSilicon Valley that want to bring in people with special expertise. \nThis will allow these companies, through the application of their \ngenius to practical business problems, to hire hundreds and ultimately \nthousands more people.\n  If Senator Kennedy's amendments were valid, the companies that use \nthis program would be companies where employment is declining. But the \nplain truth, as is evident to anyone who looks at the data, is that the \ncompanies using these programs are companies that are creating the \nlargest number of jobs in America.\n  So if Microsoft--assuming the Government doesn't put them out of \nbusiness by trying to limit technology--can put hundreds of thousands \nof Americans to work by bringing someone to this country who has \nspecial expertise, why not let them do it. Especially when this bill \nstrengthens the law by imposing a $25,000 fine on companies that \nviolate procedures aimed at dealing with the legitimate problems raised \nby Senator Kennedy and others---that people will be brought here who \nwill work for less and therefore undercut the wage base of American \nworkers.\n  So I hope these two amendments will be defeated. I think it is very \nrevealing that our high-tech industries say they would rather not have \nthe bill if the Kennedy amendments are adopted. That suggests to me \nthat the purpose of the amendments are to kill the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield myself 4 minutes on the \namendments.\n  As I am sure the Senator from Texas knows, about 85 percent of these \njobs earn $75,000 a year, or less. I am just wondering what we have \nagainst Americans and American workers that we are so prepared to turn \nover these good jobs to foreigners.\n  Now, if the Senator wants to say, well, what about these $75,000 \njobs? The GAO pointed out that there is no increase in the salary of \nthese workers. I thought supply and demand said that if we have that \ngreat a demand, we are going to see an increase in salaries; right? \nWrong. The GAO report says there is no indication of that.\n  So these are good jobs. I say, let's try an American first. Let's \ndevelop the kinds of skills employers need so that we won't need to \nhave this continue after the expiration of this particular proposal. \nLet's try an American first. And if we are not going to do that, let's \njust ensure that an American who is in that job and working, as the \nrecord demonstrates today, isn't going to get laid off and replaced by \na foreign worker who then is going to work longer hours and be \nthreatened day after day that if they complain at all, they are going \nto have their green card taken and they will be shipped overseas. That \nis the case, in many instances.\n  Madam President, I find it difficult to just accept the Senator's \nargument that this really is just the pure free market system working \nat its best. I think we owe something to American workers. It is so \ninteresting that all of these companies want to have a free enterprise \nsystem--except when it comes to paying wages and salaries. Then they \nwant to do it and get cheaper workers in from overseas and then exploit \nthem. We want to protect against that. That is what those amendments \nwould do.\n  I withhold the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Michigan to yield \nme an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I yield an additional 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, first of all, I always welcome Senator \nKennedy giving me lectures about supply and demand. I wish I believed \nin my heart that he believed in supply and demand.\n  Secondly, one of the purposes of the bill is to add teeth to the \nprovision about hiring Americans first. This is done by imposing a \n$25,000 fine on people who displace American workers in order to hire \nH-1B workers, or people who violate the law that prohibits hiring these \nworkers at less than the current wage rate.\n  Obviously, we are talking about very talented people when we are \ntalking about people coming in for salary of $75,000. I have to admit \nthat I am somewhat struck by the paradox. Only last week, we were \ndebating an effort I had undertaken to make people who come to America, \ncome with their sleeves rolled up, rather than their hand held out to \nget food stamps; and last week the Senate voted to give them food \nstamps for 7 years.\n  When the Senator from Michigan says, we should let very talented \npeople come and not let them work for less than Americans, and if they \ncan bring talent that will make American products more competitive and \nhelp create American jobs, we should let them come in and work in \nlimited numbers, under strict requirements. I think one might be \nconfused to hear that we are perfectly willing to let people come here \nand go on welfare; it is when they want to come and go to work that we \nhave an objection. Well, I do not.\n\n  I go back to the point that the companies who are hiring these people \nare not companies that are in decline. I know the Senator feels this \nconcern in his heart, and I have no doubt about the sincerity of his \nposition. If these were companies in decline and they were trying to \ndrive down their wage base by simply hiring people with standard skills \nto displace Americans, I would be siding with Senator Kennedy. But what \nis happening here is companies that are using this program are our most \ninnovative companies. They are the companies that have the most \ntalented workers that they can hire in our country. They are our \nfastest growing companies. They are companies that are creating jobs \nnow, and they are laying the technological foundations that will create \nhundreds, thousands, and ultimately millions of jobs in the future. \nThey want to reach out in the world and pick the most talented, the \nbest and the brightest, to come to America on a temporary basis and \nhelp us develop the technology that will create jobs--good jobs, high-\npaying jobs, $75,000-a-year jobs--for our own workers.\n  So I strongly support the provision offered by the Senator from \nMichigan. I do believe that the amendments offered by the Senator from \nMassachusetts are well intended, but I think they are wrongheaded in \nthe sense that, in the name of protecting jobs, we are keeping out a \nvery small number of very select people who are working at labs at \nHarvard University, or working in Silicon Valley, or working in \nresearch institutes all over the country to create technology that puts \nmillions of our people to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I have 150 letters and scores more back \nin my office of Americans who have training and skills in computer \nknowledge and technology and are unable to get the jobs. You can, under \nthis proposal, hire 1,000 foreign workers and displace 1,000 American \nworkers and it doesn't violate any law. It violates no law. I think we \nought to protect American workers, and if there is a job out\n\n[[Page S4978]]\n\nthere, an American worker ought to have a crack at it before it goes \noverseas.\n  Madam President, I see my friend and colleague from Nevada who, under \nthe agreement, is to be recognized to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, let's put ourselves in the situation that \na woman from Las Vegas found herself in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Nevada offering his \namendment?\n  Mr. REID. I will offer it at the appropriate time. I have the floor \nnow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Unless time is yielded to the Senator under \nthe agreement on the bill, the Senator----\n  Mr. REID. My amendment has no time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2414\n\n (Purpose: To require that applications for passports for minors have \n                          parental signatures)\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2414.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC ____. PASSPORTS ISSUED FOR CHILDREN UNDER 16.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1 of title IX of the Act of June \n     15, 1917 (22 U.S.C. 213) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Before'' and inserting ``(a) In \n     General.--Before'', and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(b) Passports Issued for Children Under 16.--\n       ``(1) Signatures required.--In the case of a child under \n     the age of 16, the written application required as a \n     prerequisite to the issuance of a passport for such child \n     shall be signed by--\n       ``(A) both parents of the child if the child lives with \n     both parents;\n       ``(B) the parent of the child having primary custody of the \n     child if the child does not live with both parents; or\n       ``(C) the surviving parent (or legal guardian) of the \n     child, if 1 or both parents are deceased.\n       ``(2) Waiver.--The Secretary of State may waive the \n     requirements of paragraph (1)(A) if the Secretary determines \n     that circumstances do not permit obtaining the signatures of \n     both parents.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to applications for passports filed on or after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, let's assume that you are a mother, you \nhave a 6-year-old child, you have recently been divorced, and you go to \npick the child up from school and he is not there. You wonder what \nhappened to your child. You call the police; the police have no \nknowledge of his whereabouts. No one seems to know what happened to \nyour child. But as things are pieced together, you learn that your \nhusband, who you recently divorced, has taken the child from school and \nto Croatia. This happens during the time of the Balkans war. What as a \nmother are you to do? Your child is in Croatia. You were married to a \nCroatian.\n\n  This is a situation that 1,000 parents face every year in our \ncountry. Over 1,000 children are taken from this country, normally as a \nresult of the mother and father not getting along, or recently \ndivorced, and they are taken many times to a country where one of the \nparents was born. Sometimes the parent just takes off to a country they \nare familiar with. They want to get away from the wife or husband, \nrecognizing that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to get the \nbaby back.\n  The tragedy is of a thousand stories a year; there are many thousands \nof stories I could retell.\n  The Las Vegas Review Journal reported about a woman by whose name is \nLilly Waken. Her two daughters left home for a party. The children \nnever came back. Frantically, she called the police. She called the \nhospitals. She learned that her husband had taken them away and had \nbought three one-way tickets to Damascus, Syria. That was 18 months \nago. She hasn't seen her children since.\n  My amendment is all about fairness and prevention. It is about \npreventing a problem that plagues this country, the international \nchildren's abduction problem. As I have indicated, 1,000 or more \nchildren are abducted every year in our country. These children, as I \nhave indicated, are abducted during or shortly after a contentious \ndivorce, sometimes even by an abusive parent, at a time when these \nchildren are most vulnerable and uncertain about their future. They are \nthen snatched from custody of one parent and hauled over to a foreign \ncountry.\n  In the case that I first spoke of, a young boy by the name of Mikey \nKale from Las Vegas was taken to Croatia. His mother worked for months \nand months, and was finally able, after spending a tremendous amount of \nmoney trying to get the return of her son--remember, this is in a \ncountry that was Mikey Kale Passport and Notification Amendment at \nwar--she was able to get her child back.\n  I am proposing this legislation, the Mikey Kale Passport Notification \nAmendment, after this young boy taken to Croatia, Mikey Kale. This \namendment is very simple. It will require that parents who are married \nmust both sign for a passport for their child. If there has been a \ndivorce, the one with primary custody must sign for the child to obtain \na passport. We have a provision in this bill so that, under extreme \ncircumstances, the Secretary of State can waive the requirements if the \nSecretary determines that the circumstances do not permit the obtaining \nof the signatures of both parents.\n  Madam President, this legislation was passed before in this body. It \nwent to the House where it was knocked out in conference. Why? For the \nsame reason that the State Department indicated in a recent article in \nParade Magazine, it is going to create too much paperwork. I say, Madam \nPresident, that is too much baloney. It may be too much paperwork for \nthem. But for the parents and the children involved in this, it is \nbetter to spend a little extra time when someone comes to get a \npassport to make sure that the passport is obtained properly. It is not \nasking too much of the State Department to insure that people who are \ngoing to get a passport for a child to check out that the child is, in \neffect, not being kidnaped.\n  The aim of the amendment is prevention. It prevents parental \nabductors from obtaining U.S. passports for their minor children. One \nof the best ways to prevent international parental abductions is to \nmake it more difficult for the abductors to obtain a passport.\n  Madam President, prior to coming to this body I practiced law and did \ndivorce work, among other things. When Mikey Kale's mother came to me, \nit flooded memories back to my mind about a case that I had where there \nwas a contested divorce. I represented a police officer from Henderson, \nNV. Suddenly, my client picked up the two children and went to Mexico. \nHe called me from Mexico, and said, ``I'm not coming back until I get \nwhat I asked for from my wife.'' So I called the opposing counsel and \ntold him what had happened. My client stayed down in Mexico for years \nuntil finally the mother of the two children, in effect, gave him what \nhe wanted. It was a difficult situation. The children were never in \nschool during that period of time.\n\n  Madam President, this is a very serious problem. We who are parents \nand grandparents know that we are the ones who are looked upon as \nprotectors of our children. But those who should be protecting children \nare doing the worst for the child by taking them to a strange country, \nrecognizing that the standards and customs in that country are much \ndifferent from ours, and that it is going to be difficult, if not \nimpossible, to get that child back.\n  It is reported that the State Department has had thousands and \nthousands of these reported kidnapings, and that they just write them \noff after a year or two, closing 80 percent of their files.\n  This amendment is a simple legislative solution which will implement \na system of checks prior to the issuance of a minor child's passport \nthereby protecting both parental rights and the rights of the child.\n\n[[Page S4979]]\n\n  Two years ago the same amendment passed. The State Department and \ntheir lobbyists prevailed upon those in conference to remove this \nprovision. In the meantime, 2,000 children in this country have been \nabducted to other countries--2,000 children. Think of the grief that \nhas been caused to those children and to the parents of those children. \nThis, Madam President, should stop. We should not listen to what the \nState Department says, that because they are understaffed and don't \nwant to go into the details of who has custody, they cannot implement \nthis preventive measure. I say let's save some pain and suffering of \nthese little children, and also of one of the parents.\n  This problem is more common than one would think. As I stated \nearlier, 1,000 children are abducted every year. Here in the United \nStates missing and abducted children are counted meticulously, in some \ncountries they keep no records whatsoever. Forty-five nations have \nsigned a Hague treaty designed to resolve international child custody \ndisputes. Most countries have not.\n  Finding a missing child is very difficult. This problem is no better \nillustrated, as I have indicated, than that of Mikey Kale for whom this \namendment is named.\n  Let me repeat. On Valentine's Day in 1993, Mikey was abducted by the \nex-husband of Barbara Spierer and taken to Croatia--kidnaped, for lack \nof a better description. As I have said, after tremendous emotional and \nfinancial efforts, Barbara was one of the lucky ones. She got her baby \nboy back.\n  Regardless of the number of cases--whether it is 1,000 cases, which \nit is, or 10 cases a year, which it isn't--one case of abduction is one \ntoo many. My amendment seeks to prevent even that one tragedy from \noccurring. One of the most difficult and frustrating elements for \nparents of internationally abducted children is that the U.S. laws and \ncourt orders are usually ignored in a foreign country. If they are not \nignored, the possible pain and expense of legal representation in that \ncountry are unbearable.\n  Many of these cases involve parents who have relatively no assets. So \nthe one who is, in effect, left behind, when the child has been \nkidnaped, can do nothing.\n  One country alone has 45 cases of American children being abducted. \nLetters to that foreign head of state have had no effect, and none of \nthe 45 have been voluntarily returned.\n  An inconceivable, irrefutable fact is that once a child is abducted \nfrom the United States, it is almost impossible to get the child back.\n  Madam President, once again, the aim of this amendment is \nprevention--prevention of anguish to families, prevention of parental \nrights being violated, prevention of a child being abducted. Until more \ncan be done, I believe a simple, cost-effective legislative solution to \nprotect our children's rights is essential, and I ask my colleagues to \njoin me.\n\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I would like to speak on the amendment, \nbut what I will do is note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I will speak very briefly in support of \nthe Reid amendment.\n  I think the concerns he has raised here are very important ones and \nneed to be addressed. I would actually add to the examples he used \nother situations which have occurred to constituents of mine in which \nfollowing a divorce decree in this country, a spouse who maintains dual \ncitizenship in some fashion goes to a country of his or her other \ncitizenship with the child after there has been an agreement with \nregard to visitation. The American citizen spouse who remains in the \nUnited States then seeks to visit on the basis of that visitation \nagreement and finds, when visiting the foreign country, the child is \nnot available, cannot be found, has disappeared, usually just to \nanother city or another relative's home or something else, but \nbasically because of the limited amount of time the visiting spouses \nhave in the country, they no longer have the opportunity to see their \nchildren.\n  This is not the case of an abduction per se, but it is relatively \nsimilar in terms of the implications. So I think the outlawing this \namendment takes helps to address the most egregious form of this \nproblem. But I indicate to the Senator from Nevada I not only would be \nwilling to accept this amendment and support it, but I look forward to \nworking with him--and I know of several other Senators who have \napproved--to see if there are ways we could also address these other \ncases where we may not be dealing with abduction, but still dealing \nwith the circumstance where parents are prevented from seeing their \nchildren.\n  So I thank the Senator from Nevada for his amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nbringing this matter to our attention once again. As we were saying a \nfew moments ago, this was accepted in the last debate on immigration \nreform in 1996. When it went to conference, there were a number of us \nwho were excluded. If we had been able to participate, we would have \nsupported this measure. But we were in a different regime at the time.\n  In so many areas of immigration policy there are the opportunities \nfor abuse by a few. But as the Senator has pointed out, thousands can \nstill be affected by the injustice. The Senator has identified one \ninstance in which a family was harmed. We would be glad to work with \nhim and with Senator Abraham to see what could be worked through in the \nconference. If somehow we are not persuasive in the conference, we will \njoin with him later in offering his amendment on appropriations bills \nor other bills. But I think the Senator has made a strong case, just as \nhe did the last time. I think he has identified a very important issue.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my request \nfor the yeas and nays be withdrawn subject to the manager of the bill \naccepting the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2414) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, be recognized for 7 minutes in order to \noffer an amendment, and immediately following the conclusion that I be \nrecognized for the same purpose of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object--I do not intend to--he \nwill go for 7 minutes and then we will have a chance to respond to his \namendment? Are we going to have time to dispose of his amendment before \nthe Senator from Arkansas?\n  Mr. REED. I think in that time we can dispose of the amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The amendment, I think, can be disposed of in 7 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2415\n\n (Purpose: To strike section 4, relating to education and training in \n                        science and technology)\n\n  Mr. REED. I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:.\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2415.\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 27, beginning with line 1, strike all through page \n     29, line 10.\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, my amendment would strike section 4 of\n\n[[Page S4980]]\n\nthe underlying legislation. This section proposes to amend the State \nStudent Incentive Grant Program, the SSIG Program.\n  I first want to recognize Senator Abraham's efforts on behalf of this \nlegislation and to underscore that I understand the issue the Senator \nis attempting to address is the lack of suitable training in our \ncountry to provide the types of scientists and engineers which this \nlegislation hopes to attract through immigration policies. But I would \nobject to the importation of the SSIG Program into this legislation; to \npull SSIG in is inappropriate.\n  We all recognize we do have to educate and train more Americans to \ntake up these high-tech jobs, but this immigration bill is not the \nright vehicle, and the SSIG Program is not the right approach to simply \ntarget high-tech training in the United States.\n  I would like to briefly set the record straight with respect to SSIG, \nits status, and I hope its future.\n  First, the State Student Incentive Grant Program is within the \njurisdiction of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. We have been \nconsidering its reformation and improvement over the last several \nmonths, and we have made progress in that regard. We are on the verge, \nafter deliberation in the committee, of bringing a bill to the floor \nwhich will make significant improvements to SSIG.\n  I would like to also point out that the State Student Incentive Grant \nProgram was initiated back in 1972 by Senator Jacob Javits of New York. \nIt was created not as a way to bootstrap high-tech learning in the \nUnited States, but to meet a critical deficiency--the need to provide \nresources to low-income students to enable them to go to college in a \nvast array of programs, letting them make the decision of where their \ntalent will carry them, but giving them the resources to go to college \nand stay in college.\n  In its more than 20-year history, it has been a remarkably effective \nprogram. It takes Federal dollars and offers a one-for-one dollar match \nwith the States to provide need-based grants to students. It has no \nfederal overhead. It delivers money in the form of grants to low-income \nstudents that need these resources to go on to college.\n  Now, if we are talking about providing more opportunities for \nAmericans to be scientists, to be engineers, to do all the things that \nwe want them to do and not have to rely upon foreign nationals coming \ninto our country, SSIG is the wrong place to start. We should be \nstarting in the elementary and secondary schools. We should be \nrecognizing that in many of our schools, particularly low-income urban \nschools with high minority enrollments, 50 percent of those students \nare likely to have a science or math teacher who never concentrated on \nscience or math in college. And that is one reason we are not \ndeveloping, here in the United States, those skills necessary for this \nhigh-tech age. So, if we are really interested in having Americans \nqualify to take these jobs, bringing SSIG into this bill, hijacking it, \nShanghaiing it into this bill is not going to do it. We have to start \nearly and consistently to reach young people.\n  I believe we have made progress in this regard. We have made \nprogress, both in terms of identifying the need to improve elementary \nand secondary education, and, as I mentioned before, we have made \nprogress working closely with my colleague, the Senator from Maine, \nSenator Collins, to improve SSIG. We have introduced, with 17 other \nSenators, a bipartisan proposal to reform SSIG. It is called the LEAP \nAct. This proposal will create a two-tiered proposal: Up to $35 \nmillion, there will continue to be a one-for-one match of Federal \ndollars to State dollars; but when we go beyond that amount, we will \nallow the States a great deal more flexibility, flexibility that they \nwill have to recognize by matching $2 for every one Federal dollar. But \nwithin that more flexible regime of options, we have actually built in, \nat the request of Senator Abraham, the ability of States to develop \nscholarship programs that are targeted to mathematics and computer \nscience and engineering. In effect, working very closely with the \nSenator, who is sincerely committed to improving the quality of \neducation throughout this country, we have done in the LEAP Act in the \nLabor Committee what is purported to be done here in this legislation.\n  Now, we are concerned--frankly, I am concerned--that if we act in \nthis immigration bill, we might upset the progress we have made to date \non the LEAP Act. We might, in fact, compromise its fundamental \ncommitment not to one specific sector of study but to a broader social \npurpose--of giving low-income students the chance to go on to college.\n  I hope we will not do that. I feel very strongly about SSIG. I felt \nvery strongly last year--again, working with Senator Collins from \nMaine. We came to the floor, we literally saved this program from \nextinction with an overwhelming vote of 84 to 4 to maintain \nappropriations for SSIG. Having, in a sense, given renewed life to this \nlegislation, I want the opportunity, with my colleagues, to ensure that \nwe continue this program as a need-based program and not at this \nmoment, for convenience, for an attempt to respond to a legitimate \nconcern about training high-tech personnel, to distort the purpose, the \ngoals, and the future of SSIG.\n  I think, working together with my colleagues, we can maintain the \nintegrity of SSIG and we can also, using the Higher Education Act, \nstrengthen it, reform it, and make it adaptable and make it accessible \nto a new generation of American students.\n  I have had the opportunity to work with Senator Abraham. We have, I \nthink, mutual appreciation of the need for SSIG. I hope, working with \nhim over the next several weeks as this measure goes forward, and given \nhis commitment to work together on this whole topic of the State \nStudent Incentive Grant Program--I am prepared at this moment to seek \nunanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 2115) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. REED. I yield to the Senator from Michigan, if he had a comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I briefly would like to do a couple of \nthings. First, I compliment the Senator from Rhode Island as well as \nthe Presiding Officer for their efforts on this issue. As I mentioned \nearlier in my opening statement about the legislation before us, our \noffice has been very grateful to you as well as to Senator Jeffords and \nothers on the Labor Committee for the efforts that have been engaged in \nto help us craft, in the higher education bill, language which was \nconsistent with our objectives in terms of trying to provide ways by \nwhich we can incentivize more young people in our country to fill these \njobs we know are going to be created in the future.\n  And under no circumstances, I think the Senator from Rhode Island \nknows, and I know the Senator from Maine knows as well, are any of us \ninvolved in the development of this legislation seeking to, in any \ncontext, reduce or undermine the SSIG program. To the contrary, I think \neverybody who is a cosponsor is a strong supporter. So we look forward \nto working with you. I have appreciated the efforts of the Senator from \nRhode Island to assist us in this and thank him for what he has already \ndone and what we look forward to doing together, to find a way to \naddress this issue in the context of other legislation that will be \nbefore us.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank the Senator, my friend from \nRhode Island. We have had the good opportunity to work with the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island and also the Senator from Maine on this particular \nissue. I know that the Senator from Rhode Island is someone who has \nbeen on the education committees, not only in the Senate but also in \nthe House of Representatives, and is someone with a number of years of \nexperience with this important issue. The Senator from Rhode Island has \nspent a lot of time in developing an understanding of this particular \nprogram and how it works in the States. He has also found how it can \nbest be targeted in ways that offer the best opportunity for needy \nstudents, giving focus in areas of important need--math and science and \nother skills. So, we will continue to work with him. We appreciate his \nleadership and the leadership of the Senator from Maine in this area.\n\n[[Page S4981]]\n\n  We have been trying to work to assure that Americans are going to \ndevelop the skills to be able to compete in these areas. This is really \na combination of both the education and training aspects that Senator \nDeWine, Senator Reed, and Senator Collins have been working on, as well \nas the Senator from Michigan. And that is a reflection of the good \nfaith of the Senator from Michigan on it.\n  So I appreciate his willingness of the Senator from Rhode Island, at \nthis time, to continue to work with us. We give the Senator the \nassurance we will continue to work very closely with him, and with the \nSenator from Maine, as we move on into the conference. But I appreciate \nhis cooperation and leadership on this issue.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2416\n\n          (Purpose: To repeal the Immigrant Investor Program)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized, under \nthe previous order.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2416.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of the bill add the following:\n\n     ``SEC. ----. REPEAL OF IMMIGRANT INVESTOR PROGRAM.\n\n       ``Section 203(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, \n     as amended, (8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5)) shall be repealed effective \n     on the date of enactment of this Act.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be advised that there are 90 \nminutes equally divided under the time agreement.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Chair for reminding me.\n  Madam President, this amendment repeals a provision in the \nimmigration laws that was a tragic mistake when it was enacted. My \namendment to strike that provision deals with economics, it deals with \npatriotism, it deals with immigration, and it deals with fraud. In \norder for my colleagues to understand precisely what we are talking \nabout, let me set the stage. I fought this battle in 1989 and, at the \nexpense of sounding a little self-serving, lost, but predicted what has \nhappened would happen.\n  The immigration bill considered by the Senate in 1989 included a \nprovision of the bill to increase investment because we were headed \ninto a recession. We decided we would take a page out of the play books \nof Canada and Australia. We thought, if they can sell citizenship for \n$200,000, citizenship in the United States ought to be worth at least \n$1 million. It is a very logical assumption. So, we said, in that bill \nin 1989, we will reserve 4,800 visas for foreigners who wants to come \ninto this Nation and bring $1 million and hire 10 people: We will give \nyou a green card at the end of 2 years, and, at the end of an \nadditional 3 years, we will make you a citizen of the United States.\n  Then in the conference committee we decided we could do even better \nthan that. We said: You don't have to bring $1 million dollars; bring \n$500,000. If you put a hamburger joint up that will hire 10 people in \nan area of high unemployment or in a rural area, we will do the same \nthing for you. We cut the price of citizenship from $1 million to \n$500,000 and the 4,800 slots that we reserved in the Senate bill \nincreased to 10,000 in the conference report.\n  Multiply $1 million by 10,000 visas and just think of all the \nmagnificent investment we would have in this country and how many jobs \nwe would create.\n  Madam President, that ``ain't'' all. We said not only will you not \nreally have to create 10 jobs with your $500,000 or your $1 million, \nyou only have to maintain 10 jobs. What does that mean? If old Joe's \nhamburger joint is about to go out of business and he has 10 employees \nand you are willing to buy his place and keep those 10 employees \nworking, you have maintained 10 jobs, so you qualify for American \ncitizenship.\n  Then in 1993 we decided we would liberalize it a little further. Not \nonly do you not have to create 10 jobs, not only do you not have to \nmaintain 10 jobs, all you have to do is indirectly provide 10 jobs if \nyou invest in businesses located in certain areas known as Regional \nCenters . What does that mean? You are making widgets. You employ five \npeople to make widgets. You have two people to distribute them and \nthree people to sell them. Those are indirectly created jobs. \nTherefore, you get your green card at the end of 2 years, and you get \nyour citizenship papers at the end of 5 years.\n  I can remember at that time how we thought Hong Kong was going to \nflood this Nation with people with $1 million in their pocket because \nthey were terrified of the Chinese taking over Hong Kong. I must say, \nthe program, such as it is, has been mostly of people from the Pacific \nrim--Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan.\n  Madam President, do you know the nice thing about this? If you have \n$500,000 to invest, bring the little wife and kids, too, you are all \nwelcome. They are also going to ultimately be entitled to citizenship.\n  What have been the results? Madam President, a cottage industry of \nconsultants and limited partnerships has grown up in this Nation. No \nplan the U.S. Congress has ever devised has been scam-proof, and God \nknows this one is no exception. What do these consultants do? Why, they \nadvertise in the newspapers in Hong Kong, in Oman, in Taiwan, and they \nsay, ``You don't even need $500,000, you don't need $1 million, you \nonly need $100,000.'' We have gone from $1 million to $500,000 to \n$100,000. We have gone from creating jobs to maintaining jobs to \nindirectly providing jobs. It is incredible what has happened to this \nprogram.\n  How do they get by with this? These consultants form limited \npartnerships. They get several of these people who have $100,000 and \nthey pool all those $100,000 contributions from various people.\n  What about the $500,000 requirement? How are you going to put up \n$100,000 and meet that? Easy. You give a promissory note for $400,000. \nYou give $100,000 in cash--incidentally, there is a little matter of a \n$35,000 to $50,000 fee that goes to the consultant. So if you come, you \nought to have $150,000 in your pocket, $50,000 for the consultant and \n$100,000 to show your good faith, and then be willing to sign a note \nfor $400,000. But not to worry. At the end of 2 years, your note is \nforgiven. Forget the $400,000 note. If you are in the $1 million class, \nforget the $900,000 note. And if, at the end of 2 years, the business \nhas not done well, shut it down. When you shut it down, you can go down \nto the courthouse and apply for your citizenship 3 years later. You do \nnot have to maintain the business for the ensuing 3 years to get your \ncitizenship. Shut that sucker down after 2 years; it has probably been \na loser anyway.\n  Madam President, Russell Burgoise was quoted in an April 13, 1998 New \nYork Times article. He is a spokesman for the Immigration Service. He \nsaid: ``These plans don't meet either the spirit or the letter of the \nlaw.''\n  Recently, when the INS sought to revoke up to 5,000 visas, the New \nYork Times in the same article said ``influential Members of Congress \nprotested the Government was changing rules in midstream,'' and the INS \nbacked off.\n  Late in 1997, the Times of Oman, not a widely read paper in \nWashington, contained an advertisement which said: ``U.S. green card \nfor anyone who can show U.S. $500,000.''\n  They ought to be prosecuted for misleading advertising. It doesn't \ntake $500,000, just $100,000 would do fine if you know the right \nconsultant in this country.\n  It is an interesting thing that it took these consultants and these \nlimited partnerships to figure out how to get the program going. Until \nthe latter part of 1996, the investor visa program had been an even \nworse disaster than its worst critics--namely me--had predicted. Nobody \nwas showing much interest.\n  In 1992, 280 people applied, 240 were approved. In 1993, 384; 1994, \n407; 1995, 291; 1996, 616; in 1997, 1,110. The consultants are getting \ngeared up now. It is still a far cry from the 10,000 slots available, \nbut in 1997, 1,110 petitions were approved. But over the last 7 years, \nonly 3,284 have been approved.\n  So, despite the fact that the program has been weakened unbelievably \nto\n\n[[Page S4982]]\n\nmake almost anybody eligible for it, nobody much has been applying. Out \nof 7 years, we only got 3,000-plus, and we are supposed to be doing \n10,000 each year.\n  AIS, one of the consulting organizations I mentioned a moment ago, \nspecializes, as I said, in pooling investors to bankroll larger \nproducts.\n  Now you should know that a lot of people invest their $100,000 not to \nbecome American citizens; they come here because they want to purchase \ncitizenship for their children and educate them here. Or they come here \nfor any host of other reasons. Maybe they are actually coming with \ntheir family. That would be a fairly laudable purpose. But they do not \ncome because they want citizenship. And a lot of people will freely \ntell you the reason they did not want to be citizens of the United \nStates is because they will have to pay taxes. They have to pay taxes \non all of their income all over the world wherever it may come from. \nThey are not about to do that. They only have to come here twice a year \nto keep their eligibility for the green card.\n  AIS has advertised ``Alternate residency: Less restrictive and \nexpensive than other plans in other countries.'' You are not becoming a \ncitizen of the United States. You do not have to love the flag. You do \nnot have to say the Pledge of Allegiance. You do not have to fight our \nwars. You do not have to be any particular age. You do not have to have \nany specialized education. You do not have to have any experience. You \ndo not have to know the language. All you need is ``green.'' You do not \nhave to know anything about the poor and huddled masses that Emma \nLazarus wrote about.\n  Madam President, this program is so rife with fraud. In some \ninstances, you can get your entire $500,000 back. If you invest \n$500,000 or $1 million, there are some plans under which you can get it \nall back and still get your citizenship.\n  Harold Ezell, a former INS regional immigration commissioner--now a \nlawyer in Newport Beach, CA--this is a former INS official's quote. \nWhat did he say about Congress, about this bill? ``They were smoking \nsomething when they wrote it.'' ``We've shot ourselves in the foot.'' \nAnother attorney said, ``You know, since we're blatantly soliciting the \nwealthy, we might ought to charge $2 million.''\n  Madam President, the investor visa program makes no economic sense \neither. The underlying bill we are debating today would raise the cap \non the number of workers who will come into this country who have \nskills, principally for the computer industry.\n  The Senator from Michigan, who is handling this bill on the floor, \nwants to raise the annual limit on people coming into this country from \n60,000 to 95,000. Now, you think about the incongruity of raising the \nlevel of people we invite into this country because they have a skill \nand because we have a labor shortage. We would not do it otherwise. We \nhave a labor shortage of so-called skilled workers. At least, that is \nthe proposition. I do not believe it, and I am not going to vote for \nthe bill. I will announce that right now.\n  This country, incidentally, as great as we are, to be depending on \nthe rest of the world to send us their skilled workers so we can stay \nafloat in the computer industry, or whatever, is the height of \nsomething or other. If we have a $50 billion surplus looming this year, \nfor Pete's sake, let us educate our youngsters so we do not have to \ndepend on anybody else for these skills. That should not be too \ndifficult.\n  But here we are saying we want to invite an additional 35,000 \nlaborers into this country because we have a labor shortage, and at the \nsame time saying, ``If you will give us $100,000 or $500,000''--\nwhichever the case may be--``and hire 10 people, we'll give you \ncitizenship.''\n  There is an outfit in West Virginia called InterBank, and they want \nto create a telemarketing business. While the deal has not been \napproved yet, the wages will be $6 an hour. I have not seen a \nMcDonald's in I don't know how long that didn't have a sign in the \nwindow saying, ``Help wanted. Pay up to $6 an hour.'' We are desperate \nfor workers at all levels in this country, and here we are asking \npeople to put up money and come into this country and hire workers. How \nsilly can we get? Even if it were not rife with fraud, even if it were \nnot shameless to be selling American citizenship, it makes no economic \nsense. It is an oxymoron to vote at the same time to bring 95,000 \nworkers in and ask somebody else to come in and hire more workers.\n  Every time Alan Greenspan appears on a television station, every time \nhe appears before the Banking Committee, every time he appears before \nthe Joint Economic Committee, Wall Street and all of America holds its \nbreath for fear he is going to announce an increase in interest rates. \nAnd why are they afraid he is going to raise interest rates? Because \nthey have a labor shortage. In Economic 101 at the University of \nArkansas, I was taught--and it is still a fundamental economic \nprinciple--that when you have a labor shortage, you have to pay more \nfor labor. You think McDonald's is paying $6 an hour because they want \nto see how far they can exceed the minimum wage? They are paying $6 an \nhour because they cannot find workers for any less than that. That is \nstill a pitiful wage, but be that as it may, I am not here to debate \nthat.\n  What I am saying is, everybody is scared to death that this labor \nshortage is going to kick wages up, that in turn is going to create \ninflation, and inflation is going to cause Alan Greenspan to raise \ninterest rates, and raising interest rates is going to bring the \nlongest sustained period of economic prosperity in the United States to \na grinding halt. These are not things that you have to be a rocket \nscientist to understand. Everybody knows precisely what I am talking \nabout.\n  Finally, Madam President--and I am reluctant to say this because I am \nnot one who has stood on the floor of the U.S. Senate and waved the \nflag and beat my chest and talked about what a great patriot I am. I \nput in 3 years in the Marine Corps in World War II, for a very simple \nreason--we were in a war where the absolute freedom of this Nation was \nat stake. Not even a second thought about it. And 25, 30 other million \nmen and women did the same thing.\n  I have voted against constitutional amendments on flag burning. \nNobody is more deeply offended than I am to see an American flag burn. \nThere are ways to deal with it. But you do not need to tinker with the \nBill of Rights for the first time in more than 200 years.\n  I still get goose bumps at a military parade when Old Glory goes by. \nAnd I am offended by a law which puts American citizenship up for bid \nby either the wealthy or those willing to participate in a fraud.\n  How crassly we demean this precious blessing we call citizenship. \nEmma Lazarus who wrote those magnificent words in the Statue of Liberty \nabout, ``Give us your poor, your tired, your huddled masses,'' Emma \nLazarus must be whirling in her grave to even hear such a debate as \nthis going on. The families of the people whose sons and daughters \nfought those wars for citizenship and freedom--and the families of \nthose who died, and they did it because they valued citizenship so \nhighly--must be weeping at the thought of citizenship being sold to the \nhighest bidder. It is vulgar. How we champion citizenship that we once \nprized so highly.\n\n  Madam President, these people are not the poor. They are not the \nhuddled masses who were our ancestors and who came here for freedom to \ncontribute their labor and their values to live, live free, and to \nraise their families and die here, even in battle, if need be.\n  These people who we welcome for $1 million are coming twice a year \nbecause that is the only way they can keep their green card. They don't \nwant citizenship because that would require them to pay taxes.\n  What in the name of God has happened to this place?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield the Senator from West Virginia such time as he \nmay need to speak in opposition to the amendment by the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I am grateful to my friend from the \nState of Michigan.\n  I start out by disputing any thought by the senior Senator from \nArkansas that the words ``patriotism'' and ``Bumpers'' don't go side by \nside--I know the Senator himself knows that\n\n[[Page S4983]]\n\nto be true--in his service in the Marine Corps, his service in this \nbody, the things he has been through over the years. He is a patriot. \nHe is a marvelous man.\n  He happens, however, to be marvelously wrong on the amendment that he \nputs forward, which in spite of the larger framework of the immigration \nbill, is a very specific and very targeted amendment which would do \nenormous damage to what we are trying to do in areas of my State that \nneed this program desperately, and which do enormous damage to some of \nthe things that I and others I work with--Governor Underwood and \nothers--are trying to do in the State of West Virginia. I refer to the \nattempt to eliminate the EB5, the immigrant Investor Program. I didn't \nsay that with an abundance of fluency, and there is a reason for that. \nIt is not one of the things that trips off your lips. I confess that it \nwas not until relatively recently, in the last several years, that I, \nindeed, learned what it was at all because we had not had experience.\n  Let me give a little context. I was Governor of the State of West \nVirginia for 8 years and I was always very frustrated, and I say to my \nfellow Governor from the State of Arkansas, of all of the money that \nwas discretionary to the Governor during the 8 years that this Senator \nwas Governor, I spent 75 percent of it on water and sewer, which of \ncourse is invisible and never seen. And I put more per capita in one of \nour poorest counties in southern West Virginia called McDowell County, \nwhich used to be referred to as the $1 billion coal field, and now is \nmostly worked out and people have left. Even when I came to West \nVirginia as a VISTA volunteer in 1964, I say to the Senator, there were \ntens of thousands of people in McDowell County, the Senator would \nremember. Now there are about a handful.\n  I felt that I had not come through properly in spite of efforts for \nMcDowell County, for Wyoming County, for Mercer County, for southern \nWest Virginia, for people who had broken their backs and given their \nlives, many of them, and who walk around, some of them carrying oxygen \ntanks. For some it is a 10-minute walk from one side of a room to \nanother side to adjust the television and back because of something \ncalled black lung or because of diseases they have accumulated by \nvirtue of being coal miners.\n  These are the areas I am talking about. There are other areas in West \nVirginia and the State of Arkansas and in the State of Massachusetts \nand in the State of Michigan and in the State of Maine, all of our \nStates, where people just don't have the opportunity to have jobs \nbecause they live in rural areas. It might be a worked-out coal mining \narea which is called rural, or it might be an area which is mostly \ntrees which would be called rural, but it is rural and jobs don't tend \nto go there. People don't tend to build the interstates over there.\n\n  I am old fashioned about it, but the reason that I stayed in West \nVirginia as a VISTA volunteer, more than anything I wanted to see \npeople go to work. I think my friend from Arkansas understands that. I \nthink he understands it very well. What I found was there were just \ncertain blocks, certain ways, certain impediments that nature put up \nwhich just didn't allow some of our good people to be able to go to \nwork by accident of their birth or by the fact they were so close to \ntheir families that they didn't leave and go to other places like so \nmany others had done from Appalachia. So they stayed and they can't \nwork and they want to work, and they want so badly to work but there is \nno work. So that is how I came to know what the EB5 Immigrant Investor \nProgram is.\n  ``Give us your poor,'' the Senator from Arkansas said. Well, our \nincome and our population is increasing, I am happy to say, in West \nVirginia at a very healthy rate. Things are being done right there. \nPeople have caught the flavor of it and there is a sense of optimism \nwhich I haven't seen there in 20 or 30 years.\n  But I learned about this program that the Senator wants to eliminate \nin this amendment. It is just a little thing down here. It says, \n``Repeal. . . Section 203(b)(5),'' et cetera--one sentence which nobody \ncan understand, but I know exactly what it does. It would eliminate \neverything that I am talking about, just eliminate it. It would be \ngone.\n  I learned about this program because of a company called InterBank. \nIt is a merchant banking company. They run a program which is called \nInvest in America. Nothing wrong that I can see in that, especially \nbecause in this program InterBank has pooled millions of dollars in \nforeign investments, millions of dollars to establish new operations in \nteleservicing--telemarketing some call it; I call it teleservices--in \nexactly the kind of areas in West Virginia I was talking about.\n  I was in Welch, WV, in McDowell County on a freezing-cold day when \nthey announced they were going to create 400 new jobs. The next day \nthey had 1,500 applicants from that county; the word traveled so fast. \nThis was considered the best news that had ever happened to that \ncounty. And now they are looking at others. They are looking, in fact, \nat putting, 10, 12, 15,000 jobs across the State of West Virginia in \nprecisely the kinds of places where nobody else will go to invest, and \nthey want to do it in telemarketing, or teleservicing as I prefer to \ncall it. West Virginia is important in that we are wired very well in \nterms of fiber optics, so it is a superb place for them to do that.\n  It is like with the telephone system. If you are in Washington, DC, \nand you call information, you are talking to somebody in West Virginia. \nWhere you live, where you reside doesn't make that much difference \nanymore. But it makes a tremendous difference in southern West Virginia \nand in other parts of West Virginia where people do not have work, \nwhere people remember having had work because of coal mining or \nremember when they had an opportunity for work, but they were rejected \nfor work. Now they realize that they could get into these programs and \nget trained because InterBank is going to put a lot of money into \ntraining people, West Virginia people, and I assume people in other \nparts of the country, other industries like them in other parts of the \ncountry.\n  We are talking about $7 or $8 an hour. I don't ridicule that. And I \ndon't ridicule it because it is a company that has benefits \nparticularly when it is a company that provides health benefits, which \nis something I care about as much as anybody on this planet, and they \nare included. My people will get them or my people will not get them, \ndepending, and it is true for all the rest of the people in this \ncountry who interact with this program as to whether this amendment \npasses or fails, which is why I hope so much that it fails.\n  Yes, it is true there has been some abuse, and the Senator, I \nbelieve, quoted the New York Times. I don't necessarily think because \nsomething is in the New York Times and it is printed, it defines what \nnational policy is to be, but I read it every day and I respect it very \nmuch, and there was an article saying there had been some abuse. There \nhave been 30 or 40 articles talking about the abuse in Medicare and I \ndon't hear anybody talking of getting rid of Medicare, because HCFA is \ntrying to crack down. There is, I am sure, abuse in the farmers \nassistance programs which help the Senator and the people he represents \nfrom Arkansas, which don't do our people any good at all in West \nVirginia.\n  All I am saying is that there is always abuse in Federal programs, \nbut it is usually a little bit. In the case of the INS, I have talked \nwith Doris Meissner about the problem of abuse and about these \nprograms. She has put our InterBank program on hold, in fact, even \nthough they have done nothing wrong, because they have the FBI and the \nINS who looks into this, and the State Department looks into it. They \nhave a total of five separate reviews that are involved in this. The \nINS is not only taking steps to correct whatever abuse that may exist, \nbut they are so adamant about it that they are taking those programs \nwhere there are no problems and making them wait until they have a \nchance to look at the entire thing. I pleaded with Doris Meissner to \napprove this program, which had no deficiencies, and she said, ``I \ncan't do it. We have to put it near the end of the line so we can \nreview all of these programs to make sure there is no fraud and abuse, \nand where there is, we can get rid of it.''\n  Now, is the idea that somebody would be able to bring some money into \nthe United States to put a West\n\n[[Page S4984]]\n\nVirginian, or a Washingtonian, or Oregonian, or somebody from Maine, \nVermont, or Wisconsin, to work, that they would bring in some money and \nthey would be given a period of a couple of years for review and, after \nthe review, which is a three-agency review, they be allowed to stay \nbecause they have brought money, which is then pooled, which puts \npeople to work in areas where nobody else will put them to work, is \nthere something wrong with that? I certainly don't see it.\n  If it is helping my people in southern West Virginia, or from the \nState of Maine, where there is so much of the population located in one \nsection--and I am sure some industry will not go into the interior \nsection because the infrastructure isn't there, but they might with \ninnovative thinking such as InterBank has put forward.\n  So I think eliminating a program, just wiping it out for the idea of \nsomehow being able to say I am against waste, fraud, and abuse and I am \ngoing to have none of it, when one knows there may be, as in Medicare--\nI repeat, there is waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare, and the Health \nCare Financing Administration which is going crazy trying to cure that \nabuse, most of which comes from the private sector. Here, INS is doing \nthe same thing. They admit it is a good program, but they admit they \ncannot have a program that has any abuse at all in it. So they are \nstopping everything until they have a chance to review it.\n  Yes, we need to take steps to prevent abuses in this or any other \nprogram--INS, Medicare, crop subsidies, or any other thing that \ninvolves the U.S. taxpayers' money--but to eliminate a program that \nholds out more for the people of my State in terms of areas where \npeople have had a hard time getting jobs, all of a sudden having a $7- \nor $8-per-hour job with health benefits, I can't imagine doing such a \nthing.\n  I passionately urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment of the \nSenator, my friend from Arkansas.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Before the Senator leaves, let me say how much I \nappreciate his very kind and complimentary remarks in his opening \nstatement, and to say that I value his friendship very highly. He and I \nhave been close friends for many years. We were both Governors and we \nrelate in that way. His uncle used to be Governor of my State. I must \nsay to the Senator from West Virginia that I wonder what has happened \nsince 1989 when he voted with me on precisely the same amendment, and \nhis vote now after the INS says we must have been smoking something \nwhen we passed the bill in the first place?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If I may answer, as the Senator well knows, the \namendment he referred to was in 1989, as my encyclopedic memory comes \nflashing before me like a billboard here in the Senate. As I told the \nSenator, on that particular bill, I felt I voted wrong and I have told \nhim since then that I should have voted against him. In reflection, I \nthink my vote at that time was based on too much of a knee-jerk theory \non the idea that somehow it was wrong, when, in fact, it was exactly, I \nthink, the right thing to do. The case didn't seem to be as strongly \nmade at that point. If the Senator would put that forward again, I \nwould vote against it in a flash.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Would the Senator answer one additional question? First \nof all, I come from a poor State, too. In Arkansas, our teachers' \nsalaries are 45th in the Nation. I don't know where we are \neconomically; it's in that vicinity. I relate to the poverty you have \ndescribed in southern West Virginia. Yet, I have to say I believe that \nif I could communicate the remarks I made a moment ago in offering this \namendment to the people of my State--and there are plenty of areas in \nthe Mississippi Delta where we are desperate for jobs, and this may be \na gross exaggeration--I believe 90 percent of the people of my State \nwould agree that it is wrong to be selling citizenship like this. They \nmight be willing to accept tax credits to attract foreign investment. \nThey might be willing to do all kinds of things that you and I did as \nGovernor to try to attract industry into our States. But I believe that \npeople in my State would take a very dim view if they knew, No. 1, the \namount of fraud that has now been uncovered in the program; and, No. 2, \nthe fact that we are selling citizenship in exchange for a few bucks \nfrom some of the wealthy people in other countries just to come here \nand get citizenship. Don't you think there is something a little crass \nabout that?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to the Senator from Arkansas, what strikes me \nas utterly crass is the thought that for the words the Senator used, \nthat I would then take away or deny the opportunity for the people that \nI love so much in my State, that you love so much in your State in the \ndelta area, or wherever it may be, from having jobs when they have \nnever been able to have jobs before.\n  Let me tell you something very plain and clear. Arkansas, \nMississippi, Louisiana, and West Virginia have statistically bound \nthemselves together on the bottom of the charts for a long time. I am \nabsolutely, flat-out sick of it. There are not many principles that \nwill get me over the fact that I am sick of seeing my people not being \nable to work when my people--if you are a West Virginian and you go \ndown to North Carolina and apply for a job, and they ask--and this is \ntrue--``Where do you come from?'' and you say, ``West Virginia,'' you \nare hired because of the work ethic, because these people have known \njobs. There has been a tradition in parts of our State where people \nhave known jobs. When they have had a chance to get those jobs, there \nis a 1-percent turnover, or less, and absenteeism is 1 percent or less \nper year. They work.\n  We had AT close down a plant employing 450 people in Charleston, \nWV, the capital of our State. After the workers got their pink slips, I \nsay to the Senator from Arkansas, saying they were fired, and it had \nbeen announced in the press, just against hope, I guess, they worked \nharder, their productivity went up after they got their pink slips. And \nthey kept the plant open.\n\n  I don't mean to filibuster the Senator's question because it was an \nhonorable question.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I had a question. I wanted the Senator to give me a full \nand complete answer according to his beliefs.\n  Let me make one other observation. The other day, the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on HUD-VA very graciously invited me over to question Dan \nGoldin, who is, as the Senator knows, the Administrator of NASA. And, \nas the Senator knows, I am opposed to the space station. I know the \nSenator is strongly in favor of the space station. But I asked Mr. \nGoldin about the $6.8 billion overrun that has just been announced. It \nhas not been built. It is not deployed and operating. It is a 43-\npercent cost overrun. I said, ``Mr. Goldin, is there any threshold \nbeyond which you would not be willing to go to build the space \nstation?'' He said he had not thought about it.\n  If somebody asked me desperately, ``We want jobs in Arkansas''--and \nas much as I want to do something about the delta area of my State, \nthere is a threshold beyond which I would not be willing to cross. That \nwould be to sell citizenship to a bunch of takers and not givers.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. This is not a matter of selling citizenship, I \nrepeat. I want to be able to explain that. It is not a matter of \nselling citizenship.\n  You come in, and then for $500,000, if you can produce 10 jobs for \nWest Virginia, for Americans, if you can do that, then after a period \nof 2 years of that activity, then by three different agencies with an \nanalysis from those agencies, which is extremely tough, if you then \npass muster, then you can become a citizen, but not before.\n  If you would ask if I would turn down somebody from England, or if I \nwould turn down somebody from somewhere else, and I worked for 10 years \nto get the Toyota Motor Company to come to West Virginia--10 years, and \nthey came, do I feel that somehow--I am just making a point--that \nbecause the person comes from Japan, or because they come from Taiwan, \nor because they come from some other place and they have some money and \nthey want to come to this country, which is what the Statue of Liberty \nis all about, and they are willing to put 10 Americans to work and \nthose 10 Americans turn out\n\n[[Page S4985]]\n\nto be 10 West Virginians in the case of InterBank, and other companies \nthat are interested in West Virginia in a like manner, I would say \nbring them on.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Here is a quote. It says, ``The immigrant investor \nprogram was created 8 years ago. It allowed foreigners to put up \n$500,000 to create 10 jobs.''\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator says ``foreigners,'' people who are not \nfrom this country.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am quoting a newspaper article.\n  I will answer the next question. This is an op-ed piece in a West \nVirginia newspaper.\n\n       Yesterday the United States was selling citizenship. The \n     program was supposed to spur job creation. The investors have \n     the money to spend, and the benefits are worth it to them. Is \n     it fair to open a door to citizenship but let only the rich \n     pass through? Of course not. But that is what is done. Now \n     there are new problems. Years after the program was \n     established companies began springing up to pool investments \n     and people seeking those visa. A Virginia firm called the \n     InterBank Group plans to use some of that capital to build \n     two telemarketing centers in southern West Virginia.''\n\n  That is what the Senator alluded to in his comments.\n  They say:\n\n       The InterBank ran into trouble in California where the \n     Department of Corporations in March indicated that the \n     company was luring investors who had no way of knowing that \n     their investment would qualify them for a visa. InterBank \n     says it was all a misunderstanding and is being worked out. \n     Meanwhile, INS is reexamining the foreign investment deal, \nincluding InterBank, and hoping to set up stricter rules. InterBank \nmaintains its deal should pass muster and is going ahead with the \ntelemarketing centers. But the money is tied up until INS makes a call. \nThat the visa program has run into trouble shouldn't be a shock to \nanyone. It is just too tempting with all of that money, and all of \nthose communities are grateful for any investment.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. May I answer the Senator?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Certainly.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Let me answer the Senator specifically, returning to \nwhat he has read. The reference to InterBank was not accurate.\n  Yes; a desist and refrain order was issued against the bank because \nit was thought that InterBank was selling securities to Americans in \nCalifornia.\n  I hope my colleagues are listening, because this is important, \nbecause the Senator is attempting to put me on the defensive, and \ntherefore his amendment, which I strongly oppose, seems to have more \nweight. But the Senator is wrong in his criticism, because he has read \nthe New York Times with too much faith.\n\n       The issue began from an ad in fact that InterBank ran in a \n     Japanese language magazine. This magazine was translated into \n     English and had some circulation in California\n\nwhich is understandable.\n\n       Although the InterBank program is only available to foreign \n     nationals California's Commissioner of Corporations was \n     unaware of the program and assumed that the ad was an offer \n     for the sale of securities in California to Americans. Since \n     that time the matter has been completely settled, and \n     InterBank is seeking to have the order lifted.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me just say to the Senator from West Virginia that \nthere isn't a Senator in the U.S. Senate for whom I have greater \nrespect and hopefully a warmer friendship and whose opinions I value \nhighly. I tell you, I have been in that position many, many times where \nI simply disagreed with somebody who couldn't understand why I \ndisagreed with them. And the Senator is a great champion for the people \nof West Virginia. The jobs situation in West Virginia is paramount to \nhim, more than almost anything else in that State; that is, trying to \nimprove the quality of life for people. I certainly would not ever \nsuggest anything to the contrary. It is just that I would be willing to \nprovide jobs for the people of West Virginia by attracting foreign \ninvestments with tax credits and anything under the shining sun, except \noffering them citizenship. There is just something crass about that \nthat really hits me right here. That is the only difference we have.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. No; the only difference we have is maybe broader \nthan that, because I take it philosophically. I grew up in a very lucky \nfashion, unlike the Senator from Arkansas. Sometimes in private we joke \nabout that, and we have a good laugh about it.\n  But my great-great-grandfather came from somewhere in Germany. Nobody \nreally knows what he was doing. And he came to this country because he \nwanted to be able to do something better, to have a better life. I find \nnothing wrong with that. I thought that, again, was what the Statue of \nLiberty was all about. My family has done well. Other families have \ndone well. People not only do well in this country, they do well in \nother countries. Often people who do well in other countries want to \ncome to the United States either for their own professional purposes or \nbecause they feel they can use the money which they have earned in \nother countries to better affect this country. That is one reason why \npeople are investing. Is it wrong for foreigners to buy in the stock \nmarket? No. They are. It is one of the reasons they are doing so well; \nwe are a good deal.\n  What I am saying is, positively the Senator was wrong in his previous \nquestion about California, that the commissioner of corporations was \ntotally unaware of this program. What I am saying is that allowing \npeople to pool money to put West Virginians, or Kansans, or others to \nwork is a principle which is no less evil than allowing 17 people from \nBoston or 13 people from Magnolia, AR, to pool funds and put people to \nwork in those two States.\n  Citizens of the world want to come to this country. That is why we \nare so much populated by people who came from other countries, \nincluding my own family, and including the Senator's, at some point. \nThat is what is great about this country. If in that process we create \njobs for people who in the 34 years that I have been in West Virginia \nhave never held a job before and it brings with it health benefits, \nthen don't expect me to stand in its way.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. We are all indebted to your great-great-grandfather who \nimmigrated to this country. We are indebted to him for coming because \nhe wanted to be free; he wanted to live and die here; he wanted to \nraise his family here.\n  These people do not even come to the United States. They live in Hong \nKong and they send their money.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do we have on the Bumpers amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 13 minutes 27 \nseconds. The Senator from Massachusetts has 22 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have listened to the debate on this issue. It has been \nan important and illuminating debate. We are really talking, as I \nunderstand it--and I am going to ask the Senator from West Virginia a \nquestion about this--we are talking about approximately 1,000, maybe \n1,500 visas or green cards a year. We issue about 900,000 green cards \nannually, and with the investor visa, we are talking about a very small \nprogram by comparison. There is a principle involved and I have heard \nthe Senator from Arkansas. But it actually is a very, very modest \nprogram. It was developed at a time when we had higher unemployment \nthan we do at the present time. It was a recognition that in many of \nthese areas of unemployment we were trying to devise as many different \nkinds of ways to bring jobs into those areas as possible.\n  But I ask the Senator from West Virginia if he would not agree with \nme that the immigration policy is a policy which is basically to \nbenefit the United States? That is overarching and a generalization, I \nknow. But our overall immigration policy includes a number of different \nfeatures.\n  We have the reunification of families. That has a very high priority.\n  We have provisions in our immigration laws for 140,000 skilled \nworkers. Most of our major hockey league players are players from other \ncountries. They come over here, play hockey, get citizenship, and make \na lot of money. We have artists who come in here and appear on our \nstages and they make a lot of money. They have money when they come in \nhere, and they make a lot of money, but we feel they add to the theater \nor to sports, so we let them in. We have artists who come over here\n\n[[Page S4986]]\n\nwho are wealthy and have particular talents and settle here, get green \ncards and become citizens. But we believe they add to the country, too, \nso we let them in.\n  We are, as I understand it, not a nation that just is taking in the \ndispossessed, although we have an important tradition for that. As I \nlook at immigration, the way that it actually works --a matter which we \nhave been debating here--I believe we ought to give Americans the first \ncrack at these jobs under the temporary worker program, which we can \ncertainly do. But if we are talking about Andrew Lloyd Webber coming \nover here, he gets in here. He has not waited 2 years, 3 years to get \nin. He comes on in as fast as the Concorde can bring him. You can say, \n``Well, that is unfair. That is unfair. Why are we going to take Lloyd \nWebber? Why is he jumping over all these other people who want to come \nhere?'' But we still believe he is exceptional and adds something to \nour nation.\n  These are all balances, though the Senator may not agree with me. \nWhat we did in creating the investor visa was very modest. No one quite \nunderstood it, because we had never done it before. But it was an \neffort to try to get some jobs in underserved areas. We had seen that \nthe idea of an investor visa had been utilized in other countries with \na modest amount of success--not great success but a modest amount. But \nwe said that in our law, immigrant investors must also create jobs \nbecause jobs are needed in West Virginia, needed in Roxbury, MA, needed \nin Lawrence, MA, and needed in southeastern Massachusetts.\n  Maybe this hasn't worked as well as many of us would like, but \nnonetheless in some areas, in my own State in some areas, there has \nbeen some positive development. Sure, it is 10 jobs per investor. Sure, \nI would like them to be better jobs than some of the investors have \ncreated, but there have been jobs that wouldn't have been there or that \nwould have disappeared without these investments.\n  But I would just say to the Senator, with all respect to my colleague \nfrom Arkansas, we have just let in, thank God, one of the best baseball \npitchers that we have on the Boston Red Sox. He did not wait like \nunskilled people do, coming from all over the world. He came right in, \nand he has been pitching. He started pitching 5 days after he was in \nthis country and he has been just superb.\n\n  I wanted to say to the Senator and ask him, does he not believe that \nwe have an immigration policy that includes a variety of these \nfeatures; the overwhelming aspect of it is the reunification of \nfamilies? That is its heart and soul, as I believe it should be. We \nhave debated what is a family--a nuclear family, whether it is just \nbrothers and sisters, older brothers and sisters, younger brothers and \nsisters, small children. We have had that debate. There are important \ndifferences in this body on that issue. But it has been families.\n  We have also cut back on low-skilled workers which we did not do 20 \nyears ago, and the reason why? Because we find that they are a \ndepression factor on wages for American workers in entry-level jobs. \nInteresting. That was not a factor years and years ago. But it is now. \nIt is now. That is why there has been some alteration and change.\n  So I just wondered whether the Senator from West Virginia agrees with \nme that we have in our immigration policy a variety of different \nfeatures. There are some features of it I disagree with and we have \ndebated some in the last bill which came through this body, which I \nopposed for various other reasons, not important here today.\n  In creating the investor visa, jobs were important. And that was the \nbalance that was made--to permit the visa if it created jobs. It has \nbeen a very modest program and all of us hope that it can be \nstrengthened.\n  But I would ask my colleague whether he does not agree in the total \nlexicon of consideration of the immigration policy we shouldn't at \nleast be able to consider the feature of national need.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to my friend from Massachusetts that I \ncertainly do agree with the variety of the application he describes. \nAnd I would also say to my friend from Massachusetts the final words of \nthe Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers, before sitting down were oh, \nno, these are all people who are living in Hong Kong, which is an odd \nstatement to make. But I want my colleagues to pay very, very close \nattention when I say that the majority of the people involved in this \nprogram are coming to this country, are bringing their families to this \ncountry, want to settle in this country, want to educate their children \nin this country. They are not doing this from long distance like it is \ntotally legal for them to do, for example, to invest in our stock \nmarket from long distance.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts has said, these are people who for \nthe most part plan to come into this country, bring their families, are \nin this country. That is one of the ways that you can come to this \ncountry. You want your children to go to good schools. You want them to \nhave a better life than they do from where they might come--just the \nwide open spaces, the wide open opportunities of America. So this is \none of the vehicles.\n  On the way, by the way, it helps create potentially tens of thousands \nof jobs in this country, and then 5,000 or 6,000 jobs in my State of \nWest Virginia from people who are for the most part deciding to come to \nlive in this country and to make their money available to put my people \nto work. I would not argue against that.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator be willing to answer this question. He \nsaid most of these people are coming into this country. What is the \nSenator's source for that information?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield for that, you have to come in \nin order to qualify for it.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I do not know where the bill says that. Could the \nSenator quote that for me in the bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is self-evident in the application of the green card. \nYou cannot get the green card unless you come here. That is the \nprovision. It is self-evident because that is what the Senator is \ncomplaining about--they are coming over here and getting the green \ncard.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That is right. They get the green card at the end of 2 \nyears.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is exactly correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. But they don't have to be here for that first 2 years to \nget it. And there is nothing in the law that requires them to be here.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The statute says primary residence.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Primary residence in Hong Kong or the Senator is saying \nthe United States is the primary residence?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In the United States, or they lose their immigration \nstatus. It says the U.S. must be the primary residence in the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If the Senator from Arkansas would yield for this \nstatement. The statement we got is from the official documents, in \nfact, sent from West Virginia by InterBank in which they declare that \nthe majority of their people are coming here to live, to bring their \nfamilies and to raise their families.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from \nArkansas have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 11 minutes 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. How much time do the opponents have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 14 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, some of this information is really \nstrange to me. It is things I never heard before. The Immigration and \nNaturalization Service is the one who said, first, that we must have \nbeen smoking something when we passed this law, and, second, that we \nshot ourselves in the foot. And now they say that this program cannot \nbe monitored.\n  The law does require the INS, incidentally, to study the background \nof these people. You think about that. And the INS says that is utterly \nimpossible. This can be drug money. Any guy who has run drugs in \nColombia or wherever can come to this country, put up $100,000, and \npretend that he is creating jobs and get himself a green card in 2 \nyears.\n  Hold a hearing in the Judiciary Committee and ask the INS how well \nthey are monitoring this program? They\n\n[[Page S4987]]\n\nwill tell you they don't even come close to having the personnel to \nmonitor this program, or the background of the people who are coming \nin, the background of those who are putting the money up. Of course \nthey can't. They can't stop the hoards crossing the border from Mexico \ninto the United States. They can't stop the hoards coming into our \nairports. How do you expect them to do background checks to determine \nwhether or not this money that they do put up, which is about 20 \npercent or 10 percent of the required amount, how do you expect them to \nbe able to determine whether that is drug money or not? Whether the guy \nis an escaped convict or not? Whether he is simply coming to educate \nhis children and comes here long enough to set the thing up and goes \nback to Korea or Hong Kong or Taiwan or wherever. Most all of these \npeople are coming from the Pacific rim.\n  When I say that, I say that advisedly. They are not coming at all. \nThey are coming to visit and then they are going home. They are buying \nwhat is advertised by AIS, the biggest limited partnership who deals in \nthese things; they are buying American citizenship and they are buying \nan alternate residence.\n  Mr. President, let me say one other thing in response to the \nstatement of the Senator from Massachusetts. Pedro Martinez gets a \npermit to come here for a certain number of days and then he has to go \nback to the Dominican Republic? Other players, such as Livan Hernandez, \nof Cuba, came here because he was a baseball pitcher and because he was \nwilling to get in a boat and risk his life, I suppose. Was he one of \nthose? Let me ask the Senator from Massachusetts, was Livan Hernandez \none of the boat people that they rescued?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. He was one of those. Although we have many others.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I would almost be willing to grant him carte blanche, if \nhe wants to come here bad enough to get into a little old boat and come \nfrom Cuba, that is fine. Give that guy a chance to become an American \ncitizen. That is the way our ancestors came. They took risks to get \nhere. They would do anything in the world--to fight and scratch and \nclaw to get here. And people still do.\n  So what are we doing? We are not rewarding them. We are taking up \nsome of the immigration slots in this country with this scam, one of \nthe biggest scams ever perpetrated by the U.S. Congress deliberately.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one yields time, it will be evenly \ndivided between the two sides.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just 1 more minute. On the issue of the \npresence of the applicant, the law itself says:\n\n       Continuing residence: The alien must establish that he has \n     continuously resided in the United States since the date the \n     alien was granted the temporary resident status.\n\n  So, according to the law, it says must ``continuously reside in the \nUnited States.''\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, if I may respond to that, that is exactly \nwhat the INS says. They cannot monitor this program. They don't have \nthe people to monitor it. They don't know whether they are staying or \nnot.\n  But if you talk to these people running these limited partnerships \nand consulting firms who are the people really making money out of \nthis--you have to pay them $50,000 up front to pull this scam off. And \nINS will tell you that they cannot monitor the very question, the very \npoint that the Senator from Massachusetts makes. They are not complying \nwith any of these laws. INS will tell you some of them are and some of \nthem aren't, but they cannot monitor it. The law is bad and the \nenforcement is impossible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article appearing in \nthe New York Times on April 12, 1998, and an article in the Washington \nPost, dated December 29, 1997, setting out virtually everything I just \npointed out in my remarks, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, April 13, 1998]\n\n         Abuses Are Cited in Trade of Money for U.S. Residence\n\n                           (By Eric Schmitt)\n\n       Washington, April 12.--A Federal program that grants \n     wealthy foreign investors permanent residency in the United \n     States is being manipulated, the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service says, with investors' money being \n     pooled so that most of them obtain residency visas without \n     making the required investment.\n       The program, established by Congress in 1990, envisioned \n     wealthy foreigners investing directly in American businesses. \n     But in recent years, a cottage industry of consultants has \n     sprung up to pool money in creative ways from the foreigners, \n     who under the program must invest at least $500,000 in an \n     American business that creates or saves jobs. In return, the \n     foreigners receive a permanent residency visa, or green card, \n     the coveted document that is the first step toward American \n     citizenship.\n       A six-month Government review concluded last month that \n     many of the consulting firms that link the immigrants to \n     business opportunities in the United States had improperly \n     exploited loopholes to guarantee rates of return and limit \n     investor risk. Under some consultants' plans, for example, \n     foreigners would only have to pay about one-third of the \n     required $500,000 investment, with a promissory note for the \n     rest that could eventually be forgiven by the consulting firm \n     or the American business.\n       ``These plans do not meet either the spirit or the letter \n     of the law established by Congress,'' said Russell Bergeron, \n     a spokesman for the immigration service.\n       But when immigration officials moved this year to revoke \n     more than 5,000 visas granted under the program, mostly to \n     immigrants from Taiwan, China, South Korea and Hong Kong, a \n     number of influential lawmakers from both parties, including \n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, \n     protested that the Government was changing the rules in \n     midstream.\n       The immigration service, the lawmakers said, knew all along \n     what the investors were doing and never raised an eyebrow \n     when the Government approved the visa petitions. The \n     lawmakers criticized a freeze the agency has imposed on most \n     new visas until it sorts out what kinds of investments are \n     allowed. They contend that the freeze has stymied growth in \n     economically depressed parts of the country that the program \n     was intended to help invigorate.\n       ``For months, American jobs, created by the investor visa \n     program, have been ensnared in bureaucratic red tape,'' said \n     Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who heads the \n     House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration. ``Job \n     opportunities have been stifled by a heavy-handed Government \n     agency.''\n       In response to the criticism, the immigration service \n     backtracked a bit late last month, allowing 1,500 investors \n     and their families, who had received conditional green cards \n     and completed a two-year waiting period, to stay in the \n     United States.\n       But hundreds of other applicants in the pipeline will have \n     to refile their visa petitions under new guidelines being \n     developed. Critics say the immigration service did not \n     publicize this decision, leaving immigrants and their lawyers \n     in limbo.\n       ``The immigration service is wreaking havoc on everyone's \n     lives, and it makes zero sense to me,'' said Denyse Sabagh, a \n     former president of the American Immigration Lawyers \n     Association, who now represents one of the consulting firms.\n       The issue has rekindled a fierce debate over the propriety \n     of using permanent residency visas to attract foreign capital \n     and create, or at least save, American jobs.\n       The uproar also underscores deficiencies in the immigration \n     service. Its loosely worded regulations are an easy target \n     for consulting firms looking for loopholes. And its \n     examiners, who are trained to ferret out most routine \n     immigration fraud, are ill-equipped to address increasingly \n     complicated financial plans.\n       ``The I.N.S., unlike the I.R.S., isn't typically an agency \n     that has to police against highly sophisticated investment \n     devices,'' said David A. Martin, the former general counsel \n     of the immigration service whose blistering 36-page \n     memorandum last December became the centerpiece of the \n     Government's review of the program.\n       For the immigration service, the visa program is the latest \n     in a string of contentious issues to catch the attention of \n     the Republican-led Congress, which over the past year has \n     criticized the agency for wrongly naturalizing tens of \n     thousands of immigrants and which has even suggested \n     abolishing the service.\n       The immigrant investor program, which offers 10,000 visas a \n     year, has never caught on the way its proponents had hoped. \n     Until two years ago, the immigration service never issued \n     more than 600 visas a year to investors and members of their \n     immediate families.\n       Congress created the program to compete with other \n     countries, including Canada and Australia, that offered \n     similar visas to attract foreign capital and create jobs. But \n     the American model required larger investments, the hiring of \n     at least 10 employees who were not related to the investor, \n     and an audit two years after the visa was issued to insure \n     the investment and employees were still in place.\n       In the past two years, immigration officials say consulting \n     firms have devised savvier business plans for immigrants to \n     use and stepped up their marketing, particularly in Asian \n     and Middle Eastern publications. The number of visas \n     issued to investors\n\n[[Page S4988]]\n\n     jumped to 1,110 in fiscal year 1997 from 295 visas in \n     fiscal year 1996.\n       At the same time, American consular officials in Tokyo, \n     Taipei, Guangzhou, Seoul and Hong Kong raised questions about \n     dozens of visa petitions. Consuls found that many plans \n     called for a down payment, typically $150,000 on a $500,000 \n     investment, and arranged a promissory note for the rest. \n     After two years, the investor would get a green card and \n     then, the plans suggested, the remaining $350,000 would be \n     forgiven.\n       Last month, the California Department of Corporations \n     ordered a Virginia-based firm, Interbank Immigration \n     Services, to stop offering investment programs to wealthy \n     immigrants.\n       The company, California officials said, promised qualified \n     immigrants a green card within eight weeks if they bought a \n     stake in a Delaware limited partnership. The stakes were in \n     turn sold to a Bahamian enterprise for an annuity that \n     matured in five years. But state officials said investors had \n     no guarantee that they would realize the promised benefits.\n       Reports like this prompted the immigration service to \n     conduct its review. ``Little by little, the program may have \n     gotten out of control,'' said a State Department official \n     familiar with the visa program.\n       But many consulting firms say that they have followed the \n     rules and that they are being penalized for the abuses of a \n     few or by lax oversight by immigration officials.\n       One such firm, American Export Partners of Charleston, \n     S.C., has pooled more than $8 million in cash and promissory \n     notes from investors, mostly from Asia, and, with the \n     Government's blessing, created a commercial financing company \n     to make loans to American exporters. Thirty-eight of the \n     firm's investors have received green cards, said Timothy D. \n     Scranton, a managing director.\n       One loan was a $750,000 line of credit to Pillow Perfect, a \n     bedding manufacturer in Woodstock, Ga. ``They're providing \n     financing for my company to grow and hire more people,'' said \n     Paul Ratner, president of Pillow Perfect, whose work force \n     has increased to 50 employees from 20 employees in the past \n     two years.\n       Mr. Ratner said that he had consulted several local banks \n     but that American Export was ``more competitive and easier to \n     deal with.''\n       Other middlemen are changing their marketing practices to \n     address the Government's complaints. One of the largest \n     consulting firms, AIS of Greenbelt, Md., said it sent a \n     revised business plan to the immigration service in February.\n       ``Things are continuing to evolve,'' said William P. Cook, \n     a lawyer for AIS who was the immigration service's general \n     counsel when the visa program was created.\n       The immigration service insists that it still supports the \n     program--but with several changes--and plans to ask the \n     Commerce Department and Small Business Administration for \n     technical help in reviewing future immigrant-investor \n     financial packages.\n       But immigration lawyers and their clients say the program \n     will stay stuck in neutral until the immigration service \n     drafts a clear set of rules for the industry and immigrants \n     to follow. ``What we need now is for the I.N.S. not to issue \n     more general counsel memos, but regulations,'' Mr. Cook said.\n\n             [From the Washington Post, December 29, 1997]\n\n U.S. Issuing More Visas to Investors; Critics Say 1990 Statute Opens \n               Path to Citizenship for Wealthy Foreigners\n\n                         (By William Branigin)\n\n       For those with a desire to emigrate and cash to spare, the \n     recent ad in the Times of Oman offered an enticing \n     proposition: ``U.S. Green Card for anyone who can show U.S. \n     $500,000.''\n       Green cards for sale? Those coveted credit card-size \n     documents, which confer legal U.S. resident status and \n     constitute the first step toward citizenship, on the block \n     for cold cash in a Persian Gulf sultanate?\n       What appeared on the face of it to be a dubious offer in \n     fact was based on a little-known--but quite legal--U.S. \n     government program to encourage immigration by wealthy \n     foreign investors. The investor visa program, passed by \n     Congress in 1990 as a way to compete for foreign capital and \n     create U.S. jobs, reserves up to 10,000 green cards a year \n     for investors and their immediate families.\n       To qualify, the principals must each create at least 10 \n     full-time U.S. jobs by investing $1 million--or $500,000 if \n     the jobs are in certain high-unemployment areas--in the \n     establishment of a new business, or the rescue or expansion \n     of an existing one. The workers must not be relatives of the \n     investors, but they do not necessarily have to be U.S. \n     citizens.\n       So far, the program has not really taken off. In recent \n     years, issuances have numbered only in the hundreds. In 1996, \n     the latest fiscal year for which figures are available, 936 \n     people received them, including spouses and children. More \n     than 80 percent of the visas went to Asians, mostly from \n     Taiwan, South Korea, China and Hong Kong.\n       In part because of promotions like the one by a private \n     consulting firm in Oman, however, the investor visa program \n     gradually is becoming better known around the world. Its \n     boosters expect the 1997 numbers to show a sharp increase, \n     perhaps double the 1996 total. And with Hong Kong now under \n     Beijing's control and Asian economies in turmoil, the \n     promoters hope to attract even greater numbers of wealthy \n     Asians.\n       The program has spurred an industry of consultants and \n     facilitators who link investors with business opportunities \n     in the United States, handle the visa applications and even \n     arrange financing for the required investment money. The \n     industry leader is a Greenbelt-based firm called AIS Inc. \n     (originally American Immigration Services) that specializes \n     in pooling investors together to bankroll larger projects. It \n     says it has obtained visa approvals for more than 1,000 \n     investors who have committed more than $500 million to U.S. \n     businesses since 1991.\n       The firm boasts a high-profile management team led by Diego \n     C. Asencio, a retired senior U.S. diplomat, as president. \n     Gene McNary, a former commissioner of the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service, is one of the company's top lawyers. \n     Its board of directors includes former ambassadors Stephen W. \n     Bosworth and Jack F. Matlock Jr., former assistant \n     secretaries of state William Clark and Richard W. Murphy, \n     retired Democratic congressman John Bryant of Texas and \n     Prescott S. Bush, the brother of former president George Bush \n     and chairman of the private USA-China Chamber of Commerce.\n       Among the projects to which AIS has channeled investments \n     are restaurants, hotels, apparel and equipment manufacturing \n     companies and a chain of retirement homes. The investors \n     include businessmen, bankers, doctors and other \n     professionals.\n       The visa program's advocates argue that it brings in \n     immigrants with needed capital, saves troubled companies and \n     creates or preserves jobs. By contrast, they point out, \n     growing numbers of immigrants who enter the United States \n     under the current system, which stresses family ties, are \n     poor, unskilled and uneducated, and thus often a burden to \n     society.\n       But critics of the scheme say there is something unsettling \n     about marketing immigrant visas like a commodity. Although \n     the green cards are ``conditional'' for two years under the \n     program, pending verification that the investment has been \n     made and the jobs created, the transaction is viewed by some \n     as only one step removed from selling U.S. citizenship.\n       ``If it's one step, it's a mile wide,'' said McNary, who \n     disputes that view. The program lately has met with some \n     recalcitrance within the INS and the State Department, just \n     as it did in 1990 when congressional opponents charged it \n     would allow well-off foreigners to ``buy green cards,'' he \n     said. But that notion is misguided, McNary insisted, because \n     the participants ``are investing in our economy and serving \n     the national interest. These are good people who blend into \n     American culture.''\n       In its literature, AIS describes the investor visa program \n     as offering ``the best of both worlds'': the security and \n     convenience of ``alternate residency'' in the United States, \n     with no real requirement to live here full time. An AIS \n     brochure touts the program as less restrictive and expensive \n     than similar plans in other countries such as Canada, which \n     requires investor immigrants to stay there at least 183 days \n     of the year. The U.S. program also sets no requirements on \n     age, prior business training or experience, education level \n     or language skill, the brochure points out.\n       ``The only requirement for the investor,'' it says, ``is \n     that he have the required net worth and initial capital,'' \n     which must come from a ``lawful source'' but may include \n     gifts, inheritances and bank loans.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nput in a quorum call and the time be equally charged to the proponents \nand opponents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I seek the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I have not spoken yet on this amendment \nby the Senator from Arkansas, but I think the points that have been \nmade in opposition are ones that our colleagues should observe closely. \nI think if they do, they would argue in favor of a ``no'' vote on the \namendment.\n  I would just say this, though, to the Senator from Arkansas. There \nobviously have been some concerns raised by the program. He has raised \nsome of those concerns today, and they have been the subject of various \narticles. But we have not in the Immigration Subcommittee up until this \npoint yet conducted any hearing or examination to determine the degree \nto which these concerns are appropriately warranted.\n  It is my understanding, though, that the Immigration and \nNaturalization\n\n[[Page S4989]]\n\nService is currently making some significant internal changes to the \nprogram that many believe have been previously undermining the goal of \nthe program. I want to look at what the INS is proposing. Based on what \nI have heard so far, I have some concerns about the approach they are \ntaking, but I want to get a better feel from that before I believe we \nshould move forward with a specific fix--whether it is the fix proposed \nhere, of eliminating the program, or some modified approach.\n  This amendment, if accepted, would simply eliminate the use of these \nvisas. I do believe there are a number of circumstances where we need \nto learn more before we would go forward. So, therefore, I don't think \nwe should at this point simply hack off an important part of the \nimmigration system without further deliberation and examination. I \nthink the intention of the Immigrant Investor Program is a good \nintention. We have heard from the Senator from West Virginia of some of \nthe benefits that have already taken place. The goal is of attracting \nand creating more jobs for Americans and so on. If refinements need to \nbe made, I think we need to examine the program a little more \nextensively than we have done. I think we need to go beyond the reports \nin the media. And I think we need to see exactly what the INS' final \nproposal would be.\n  I say to my colleague from Arkansas, certainly we intend to exercise \nsuch oversight in our subcommittee, regardless of what the outcome is \nhere today. But I think it would make sense for us to have that \noversight before we simply move to eliminate this program.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time. Let me ask, before I \ndo, what the status is with regard to time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan controls 10 minutes \n35 seconds. The Senator from Arkansas has 5 minutes 22 seconds.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just say to the distinguished \nfloor manager, Senator Harkin had a 5-minute statement. We are \nscheduled to vote at 5:45. I am not sure what other amendments are to \nbe voted on besides mine. I assume after that, final passage?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. The intent of the majority leader would be to have the \nvotes on the amendments to begin at 5:45. I believe we already have an \norder entered into to that effect. And then final passage to follow on \nvotes on the amendments for which votes were requested. I assume a vote \nwill be requested on the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas. The \nSenator from Massachusetts has two amendments.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Have the votes been ordered on the amendments of the \nSenator from Massachusetts?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, but we will.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. And we also need to dispose of the managers' amendment \nprior to the beginning of the voting. We are hoping to begin the \nvoting--the order calls for it to begin in 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me say to both floor managers, I was \nprepared to yield back my time, but Senator Harkin came over and waited \nquite awhile. He had a statement he wanted to make for 5 minutes on \nsomething completely unrelated. I reserve my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I had planned to put my two amendments in and make \ncomments for about 4 minutes or so on both of those amendments. I \nexpect Senator Abraham to do about the same, and then we will be almost \nat the time for the vote. I have about 4 or 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is this as good a time as any to ask for the yeas and \nnays on my amendment? I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, do I have 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has sufficient time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are at the time where, in just a few \nminutes, we will be making a decision\n\n[[Page S4990]]\n\nabout expanding a provision of the immigration law that provides for \ntemporary workers. This is a provision now that has been, by and large, \nused for workers 85 percent of whom make $75,000 or less.\n  There is a small group of highly skilled, highly talented individuals \nwho do a great deal better than that. They are really not an issue in \nthis particular amendment, as far as I am concerned, because they only \ntake a very small number of the green cards that will be issued.\n  There is a substantive question about how much of a problem there is. \nUnder the Abraham amendment, we will temporarily be opening up this \nquota in a very significant way. Tens of thousands of new immigrants \nwill be coming to the United States. In our particular proposal, that \nwas not so.\n  Let me read two letters that indicate what the challenge is. One is \nfrom Sally Barnett. She is from Plano, TX:\n\n       I just heard via the radio that several companies, \n     including Texas Instruments, Microsoft, etc., wish to bring \n     in immigrants to do high-tech engineering. I live in Dallas \n     and have for 3 years. I graduated with a degree in \n     mathematics and went back to school in the late 1980s and \n     received my degree in computer programming. I have two \n     positions in the field . . . I have applied all over Dallas \n     but never get an interview. I have my resume on the Internet. \n     I had a 4.0 average in my classes in the late 1980s . . . I \n     do not even demand a high salary but I can't even get an \n     interview for a job.\n\n  This is a computer technician who is unable to get a job. I had \nscores of letters that I read from earlier in this debate.\n  Jim Sizemore from Cupertino, CA, has a long letter:\n\n       Do not increase the immigration quota for high-tech \n     workers. This will force employers to act responsibly to get \n     more from their high-tech talent . . . to invest in domestic \n     training, to internally develop talent, and to take action to \n     retain the talent they have. Don't let employers off the hook \n     from taking such actions.\n       Importing more foreign labor is a cheap and easy answer for \n     companies who don't want to do what's right. Importing \n     foreign labor is wrong for current workers . . . .\n\n  Wrong for American workers.\n  That gets to the heart of my two amendments. There are three \ndifferent issues here. One is training, to make sure down the road that \nwe provide adequate training so that American workers will have the \nskills to get all of these jobs and hopefully be able to do that in the \nnext 3 or 4 years. We are working out that particular provision.\n  But the two amendments that I offer say something else. They say that \nwe will not permit Americans who have those jobs today to be laid off \nfrom those jobs and to substitute for those Americans foreign workers. \nThat is permitted today, and that is wrong. That is wrong, because we \nknow what has happened. Foreign workers come on in, and they are forced \nto work longer and harder and are in the position where they refuse to \ncomplain because they know if they do complain, they are going to have \ntheir green card pulled and will be sent back to their country of \norigin. We have the record; that happens, and that is wrong. That \namendment no. 1.\n  The second amendment says, before you go out and hire a foreign \nworker, you at least have to make a reasonable effort to try to hire an \nAmerican worker. We do it by just saying any employer has to follow the \nindustry standards for recruitment in that industry, and simply \nindicate on the application form that that is what they have done.\n  Basically, we are saying, what is wrong with American workers? \nClearly, they can be trained to take these jobs. We believe they should \nbe able to do so.\n  Secondly, we believe that there are tens of thousands of workers \nacross this country who ought to be able to maintain their jobs and not \nbe replaced by foreigners in this country. We also believe that \nAmericans ought to be given a chance for these jobs in the United \nStates before they go overseas.\n  Those are effectively the two amendments before us. We believe in \nAmerican workers. We believe they can be trained. We believe they ought \nto be given the first opportunity for hiring. And we believe that they \nought to be able to hold those jobs and not be displaced if they have \nthe needed skills. Mr. President, I hope that we will have a vote in \nfavor of my amendments.\n  I yield back what time I have, and I ask that it be in order to ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to requesting the yeas and \nnays? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. I will respond to the \namendments that have finally been offered, as well as to speak about \nthe bill in general.\n  With respect to these amendments, let me say this: Our whole intent \nin addressing this legislation from the beginning was to provide three \nthings:\n  A short-term solution to meet the current, very significant shortage \nin high-tech workers which our high-tech industry is confronting, a \nshortage which, if not met, will severely hurt the American economy \nand, in my judgment, dramatically reduce our economic growth.\n  The second goal of the legislation is to address the long-term needs \nwe will have for high-tech workers, skilled workers, information \ntechnology workers. We attempt to do that in this legislation. We do \nbelieve that American workers, American kids, have the skills and \ntalent it takes. The goal is to have the right job training and \neducational opportunities so that people can develop these skills, and \nwe are in the process, through this legislation, of setting in motion \nboth a scholarship component as well as a job training component to \nassist in what is obviously a much broader, macro effort that must be \nundertaken to effectively, in a long-term sense, meet the challenges of \nthe job market of the 21st century.\n  At the same time, we felt it was important in this legislation to \nprotect American workers so that these programs cannot be abused. Let \nme begin by saying I think these amendments are a solution in search of \na problem. For those Members watching and listening right now, in the \nentire history of this program there have only been eight willful \nviolations of hundreds of thousands of cases--only eight willful \nviolations in this program, and each has been punished.\n  Our legislation says even though that is a tremendous track record \nand a great expression of the fact that this is a program not being \nabused, we want to go further. We have dramatically toughened the \npenalties in such a way that if anybody willfully violates the \nprovisions of using H-1B employees and H-1B visa holders and lays off \nsomeone--Mr. President, that has only happened one time in the entire \nhistory of the program--if it happens, if somebody is displaced for an \nH-1B employee, then the company involved will be debarred and prevented \nfrom even using the H-1B program for 2 years. In addition, they would \npay a $25,000 penalty fine per violation.\n\n  In short, we have addressed each of the things that have been raised \nby Senator Kennedy. In my judgment, we have addressed them in an \neffective way, considering the fact that in the history of the program \nthere have been, in fact, so very few violations.\n  I also say this. The solution proposed by the Senator from \nMassachusetts would give the Department of Labor a dramatically \nincreased role in the supervision of the high-tech community and other \nbusinesses and entities using skilled workers. I do not personally \nbelieve either of these amendments could be implemented without the \nDepartment of Labor creating massive new bureaucratic regulations and \nmicromanaging these companies.\n  Indeed, I do not believe these companies would go forward and hire \nanyone on an H-1B program without getting some type of prior clearance \nfrom the Department of Labor.\n  We have an attestation process in place, a recruitment process in \nplace for permanent workers. It takes 2 years before the various hoops \nand regulations can be met. I am not saying that is wrong, but I am \nsaying it is unworkable in the context of temporary workers. We have \ndramatic needs today for these workers.\n  We have heard, as I said in my opening statement, about the year 2000 \nproblem. We cannot wait 2 years to bring in additional workers to cure \nthe\n\n[[Page S4991]]\n\nyear 2000 problem because we will already be in the year 2000. In a \nsimilar sense, we simply cannot take the existing program and undermine \nit with these complicated bureaucratic Department of Labor regulations.\n  I have heard from the various companies and entities that are seeking \nan increase in the cap on H-1B visas. They have said an increase in the \ncap would be meaningless and totally nullified if these kinds of labor \nprovisions are included. They go too far. They would undermine the \nwhole program. And indeed, if they were to be enacted or passed in the \nform of these amendments, I would be inclined to encourage the majority \nleader to pull the bill down because I think it would create ultimately \na greater problem than we already have today. We have a serious problem \nalready.\n  So, for those reasons, Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to \nsupport my motion which I intend to make to table those amendments, and \nI urge them to pass the legislation. It is vitally needed. It is \nimportant to our economy. It is important to our ability to meet the \nyear 2000 challenges, and it is important for us to bring the academics \nhere to train American students so that we will produce these \nadditional workers. That is why it has such broad-based support, \nbipartisan support in the Senate, academic support throughout the \nacademic community, business support throughout the business community, \nsupport among heritage groups, and others.\n  Mr. President, this is not a situation where we are dealing in a zero \nsum game. People coming in under the H-1B program are not taking jobs \naway from Americans. In virtually every case, they are contributing to \na business, a company, an organization that is growing; and they are \ncreating more opportunities. That is the evidence we had before us in \nthe committee. I think it is what will happen in the 5-year period for \nwhich we are seeking this increase, and that will give us time to solve \nthe problem in the long term.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters I have received \nfrom various business groups in opposition to the Kennedy amendments to \nS. 1723 be entered in the Record:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                                Manufacturers,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 1998.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     Senate Dirksen Office Building\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: On behalf of the 14,000 members of \n     the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), including \n     approximately 10,500 small manufacturers we want to thank you \n     for your continuing efforts to temporarily expand the number \n     of highly skilled, foreign-born professionals allowed into \n     the United States on a short-term basis. As you know, the cap \n     on H1-B visas was reached over a week ago--nearly five months \n     before the end of the fiscal year. If your bill, S. 1723, is \n     not enacted soon, the ability of U.S. companies to compete in \n     the global marketplace will suffer. With unemployment at a \n     record low, and thousands of vacancies in the high-technology \n     sector alone, we cannot emphasize enough the importance of \n     temporarily raising the number of H1-B visas available.\n       While there is no question that raising the cap is a \n     necessary short-term step so that U.S. companies can fill \n     vital vacancies, we do not believe that the cap should be \n     raised at all costs. Specifically, we strenuously oppose the \n     Kennedy-Feinstein attestation amendments that would impose \n     new mandates on all employers and fundamentally and \n     permanently change the HI-B program. Instead, we believe that \n     your bill, which would impose new and substantial penalties \n     on those who break the law without burdening law-abiding \n     employers, is the correct approach. If the Kennedy-Feinstein \n     attestation amendments are adopted in their current form, all \n     positive benefits from raising the cap would be negated and \n     we would regretfully have to oppose final passage.\n       We have repeatedly urged your colleagues to vote for S. \n     1723 without amendment, even identifying it as a Key \n     Manufacturing Vote in the NAM's Voting Record for the 105th \n     Congress. As always, we are prepared to assist you in \n     whatever manner possible to raise the H1-B cap in a way that \n     will protect American workers while allowing U.S. companies \n     to stay strong and keep their competitive edge.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Paul R. Huard,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Chamber of Commerce\n\n\n                                           1615 H Street, N.W.\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 1998.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: On behalf of the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, the world's largest business federation, \n     representing more than three million businesses and \n     organizations of every size, sector and region, I wish to \n     make clear our opposition to the amendments we understand \n     will be offered by Senator Kennedy to the American \n     Competitiveness Act of 1998 which will add complex \n     ``attestation'' procedures to the H-1B visa application \n     process.\n       These amendments would seriously undermine the H-1B \n     program. Their broad and ill-defined requirements would, as a \n     matter of reality, empower the Department of Labor to second \n     guess every hiring decision by an employer and to evaluate \n     the nature of every job in an employer's workforce. The \n     program would grind to a halt. Unfortunately, the employer \n     community's experience with the Department under the \n     permanent visa program has demonstrated that these fears are \n     well-founded.\n       If these amendments are adopted, the Chamber would be \n     forced to withdraw its support for the legislation.\n                                                        Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             American Business for\n\n\n                                             Legal Immigration\n\n                                                     May 18, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: We write to express our continuing support \n     for S. 1723, the American Competitiveness Act, and to oppose \n     amendments scheduled to be offered by Senator Ted Kennedy on \n     the floor of the Senate.\n       The Kennedy amendments on ``recruitment'' and ``non-\n     displacement'' needlessly impose regulatory burdens on vital \n     and competitive sectors of our economy. The attestation \n     provisions contained in these amendments would gut a program \n     that has helped our economy grow since 1990. The Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, on a bipartisan basis, explicitly \n     rejected this anti-business approach and instead embraced a \n     tough enforcement regime directed at the abusers, and not the \n     legitimate, law-abiding U.S. companies and universities that \n     employ H-1B workers.\n       If you support the businesses and institutions that benefit \n     from and utilize this program, you should not impose anti-\n     business provisions that have no place or role in this \n     legislation. Therefore, we strongly urge you to reject the \n     Kennedy amendments to S. 1723.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Council on International Personnel; American \n           Electronic Association; American Immigration Lawyers \n           Association; Business Software Alliance; Computing \n           Technology Industry Association; Electronic Industries \n           Alliance; Information Technology Association of \n           America; National Association of Manufacturers; \n           National Technical Services Association; Semiconductor \n           Equipment and Materials International (SEMI); \n           Semiconductor Industry Association; Software Publishers \n           Association; The Technology Network; U.S. Chamber of \n           Commerce.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                          ITAA\n\n                                                     May 18, 1998.\n     Senator Spencer Abraham,\n     Chairman Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs, \n         Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Abraham: Thank you for your continued \n     leadership on the need to bring highly skilled temporary \n     foreign workers to the United States. We are very pleased the \n     Senate is moving toward final action on this bill.\n       As you know, time is running out. the H-1B cap has been \n     reached. The United States Senate needs to act now and pass \n     S. 1723, the ``American Competitiveness Act of 1998.''\n       We want to express our very strong opposition to amendments \n     that will make the H-1B program useless by adding unnecessary \n     regulatory burdens. Providing more H-1B visas, as your bill \n     does, while at the same time adding unworkable provisions \n     relating to recruiting and layoffs, could harm critical \n     projects, such as solving the Year 2000 challenge. As has \n     been documented repeatedly, the IT workforce shortage is one \n     of the reasons companies are not moving quickly enough to \n     solve Year 2000 problems. One senior executive at a major \n     company told me last week he is 350 IT workers short for Year \n     2000 projects.\n       We urge you and your colleagues to reject these negative \n     amendments. Your bill, with a strong emphasis on enforcement \n     and sanctions against violators of the H-1B program, has the \n     appropriate tools for dealing with alleged H-1B violations.\n       We also hope your colleagues will note that delay on the H-\n     1B cap increase While the H-1B program is not the only \n     solution to the IT worker shortage, as I explained during \n     your Subcommittee hearing, it is an important element of \n     dealing with the shortage in the short-term.\n       It would be ironic of the Senate, just a short time after \n     establishing a Special Committee to deal with Year 2000, did \n     not take action to pass the H-1B, a direct element for \n     addressing the Year 2000 challenge.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on this important \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Harris N. Miller,\n                                                        President.\n\n[[Page S4992]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                       National Immigration Forum\n\n Pro-Immigrant Organizations Call on Political Leaders to Refrain from \n       Bashing Legal Immigrants in Coming Debate Over H-1B Visas\n\n       This week the full Senate and the House Judiciary Committee \n     will take up proposed legislation to address the shortage of \n     highly skilled workers in part by increasing the availability \n     of H-1B visas. This is a category of temporary legal \n     immigration in which high tech and other companies can \n     sponsor talented foreign-born employees. Many of these \n     skilled workers are top graduates of America's finest \n     universities.\n       As the discussion unfolds in the coming days and weeks, and \n     differences are debated, we call on our leaders to \n     underscore, rather than undermine, America's great tradition \n     as a nation of immigrants. For most of our history, the \n     American people have extended a generous welcome to those \n     willing to work hard and contribute their skills and talents \n     to this society. It would be unfortunate if leaders in the \n     heat of political battle did damage to this nation's spirit \n     of tolerance and respect for diversity.\n       Furthermore, we urge our nation's political leaders to \n     refrain from stereotyping and stigmatizing immigrants as \n     harmful to the nation. Foreign-born professionals who enter \n     the United States on H-1B visas come from a variety of ethnic \n     backgrounds and as such are easy targets for those looking to \n     ``blame foreigners.'' In recent weeks, for example, extreme \n     anti-immigrant groups have used the occasion of the H-1B \n     debate to aggressively pit immigrants against the native-\n     born. Their attacks come dangerously close to legitimizing a \n     climate of hostility directed at immigrants and refugees \n     generally.\n       Individuals who come here on H-1B visas are not a threat to \n     U.S. workers. Much like legal immigrants sponsored by \n     families or those admitted as refugees, they make important \n     contributions to our society and our economy. They fill \n     important positions at high tech companies, universities, and \n     in a variety of other fields. Rather than harming native-born \n     Americans, these immigrants, many of whom become permanent \n     immigrants to our country, strengthen America. We ask all of \n     our leaders to bear this in mind as we proceed with this \n     important debate.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield \nthe floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back the time in \nopposition to the Kennedy amendments?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes. I yield back the remainder of my time on the \namendments as well, except I believe you still have Senator Bumpers' \namendment.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent there be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided between each of the stacked votes \nwhich I am about to propose; and I further ask unanimous consent the \norder of the votes be as follows: a vote on or in relation to the \nKennedy amendment No. 2418, followed by a vote on or in relation to \nKennedy amendment No. 2417, followed by a vote on or in relation to the \nBumpers amendment 2416.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. 2416?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. No. 2416.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the first vote will \nbe on the Kennedy amendment No. 2418, followed by a vote on the Kennedy \namendment No. 2417. Is there objection--Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2419\n\n              (Purpose: To set forth manager amendments.)\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Kennedy, and Senator McCain in the form of a \nmanagers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham] for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy and Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 2419.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, let me indicate the managers' amendment \ncontains several components, one of which pertains to the issue of job \ntraining. We have worked very closely with Senator Lieberman, as I said \nearlier, with Senator DeWine, with a variety of other Members with \nrespect to this issue. This amendment modifies the job training and \nscholarships sections authorized by S. 1723 as reported out of \ncommittee.\n  In the job training end, the end product is the result, as I said, of \nwork with Senators Kennedy, Wellstone, Lieberman, Robb, DeWine, and the \nchairman of the Labor Committee, Senator Jeffords. And without giving \nall the details, it would allow the Secretary of Labor to provide \ndemonstration projects through part D of title IV of the JTPA Program \nfor private industry councils or their successors or regional \nconsortia, private industry councils or their successors.\n  It would also allow the Secretary to support innovative technical \nskills training programs provided at the local level to help prepare \nworkers with the skills necessary for the 21st century. In that sense, \nit conforms with the workforce development legislation we passed just \nlast week. With respect to scholarships, I think we have already \nexpressed during the discussion of Senator Reed's amendment the actions \nwe are taking there.\n  In addition, the managers' amendment, at the request of Senator Kyl \nand the National Science Foundation, also makes some changes in the way \nthe panel study in workforce issues is to be organized. It contains \nvarious technical fixes to address a pay-go issue raised by the \ntransfer of authority to process labor condition applications from the \nDepartment of Labor to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. It \nhandles other technical corrections as well.\n  Finally, it adds a prohibition. The Attorney General may not approve \na petition for an H-1B petition if he or she concludes that the \npetitioning employer is assisting in the development of India's nuclear \nenergy program or any other nation engaged in the development of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  Obviously, a number of us in the Senate are concerned about the \nrecent nuclear tests that have been conducted\n\n[[Page S4993]]\n\nand the concern about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \nand so we have given the Attorney General the power to intervene if she \nwere to conclude that someone attempting to use an H-1B visa would be \nsomehow connected to a program of that sort.\n  I also indicate I will be working with all interested Senators--and a \nnumber of them have talked to us--about this to make sure these \nprovisions are as effective as possible in preventing these visas from \nbeing used by anyone to assist in the development of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from Michigan, first, for his overall \nleadership in introducing the underlying bill, which I am pleased to be \na cosponsor of, and, secondly, for being very thoughtful and \naccommodating in including the language he has described in this \nmanagers' amendment which would authorize demonstration projects for \ntechnical skills training for workers, including incumbent workers \nthrough local and regional consortia of private sector groups.\n  Mr. President, this accomplishes two breakthroughs, I think. What it \nis aimed at, first, is to focus not only on folks who are out of work, \nbut people who are in work but need training to hold their jobs and to \nupgrade themselves. The second is to stimulate companies to work \ntogether to train workers in a given area in which there is a regional \nor local shortage. I thank Senator Abraham and the other cosponsors of \nthis amendment and the bill for the work they have done.\n\n  Mr. President, I am one of many Senators who have cosponsored this \nbill, but I wish to recognize the singular achievements of my \ncolleague, Senator Spencer Abraham, for introducing the bill and for \nadvancing it so thoughtfully, so energetically, and so cooperatively.\n  In one sense we are called upon to pass legislation to respond to a \ncrisis, as so often seems the case. Just last week the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service announced that the 65,000 person cap on H-1B \nvisas for fiscal year 1998 had been reached. Unless we act, for the \nremaining five months of the fiscal year, American employers will be \nunable to hire the temporary foreign workers who help fill gaps in our \nvery tight labor market for skilled professionals. With each successive \nyear, the backlog would only grow. Skilled foreign professionals, many \nof them graduates of our finest universities, would be driven to jobs \nwith our international economic competitors.\n  But this crisis is different from other crises, for it reflects the \ngood news that we are in the midst of a period of unprecedented \neconomic growth. The national unemployment rate last month was only \n4.3%. Even more remarkable, the unemployment rate for college graduates \nwas only 1.7%. The Bureau of Labor Statistics does not keep statistics \nfor the information technology sector, but most experts estimate that \nthe unemployment rate there has sunk to well below 1%. Various studies \nare reporting hundreds of thousands of unfilled positions in the high \ntech sector. Last month representatives of major American corporations \nlike IBM could be found on the beaches of Florida, recruiting college \nseniors on their Spring Break.\n  In short, Americans looking for work are finding jobs like never \nbefore. But in certain sectors of the economy, and in certain parts of \nthe country, there are not enough Americans able to fill all of the \navailable jobs. The H-1B program allows employers to hire skilled \nforeign workers for six-year periods, provided that the employers pay \nthem the same wages that other workers receive, and that the foreign \nworkers are not employed in connection with a strike or a lock-out. All \nsorts of employers benefit from the H-1B program, from corporations to \nuniversities to non-profits, but at the moment it is the rapidly \ngrowing hi-tech companies that are most in need of additional skilled \nworkers.\n  But it is not just those companies that benefit from the H-1B \nprogram: in some senses, all Americans do. That is because the growth \nof the high tech sector has been a crucial element of our recent \neconomic resurgence. It is vitally important that we keep the jobs \nassociated with this vibrant industry here in the United States and \nthat we keep this industry growing with the innovative ideas of the \nbrightest people we can find. Unfortunately, at the present time our \neducational system is not producing enough graduates in the relevant \nfields of math, science, computers and engineering to keep up with \ndemand. The long term solution to this problem is obviously to \nencourage more education and job training of American citizens in high-\ntech fields, and S. 1723 does speak to that need by providing $50 \nmillion in matching funds for educational scholarships as well as $10 \nmillion per year to train unemployed workers in new skills. But in the \nshort term, we must act quickly to ensure that American information \ntechnology companies are not forced to slow their domestic operations \nor, worse, move their operations overseas in search of the skilled \nforeign workers who would come to the U.S. if given the chance, The \nskilled foreign workers employed under the H-1B program will keep their \nemployers strong and growing so that they can hire even more American \nworkers.\n  Sentor Abraham made an important accommodation in Committee when he \nmodified his bill so that the increase in H-1B visas would sunset after \nfive years. During the first years of that period, the bill calls for a \nstudy by the National Academy of Sciences to examine the future \ntraining and education needs of American students to ensure that their \nskills are matched to the needs of the information technology sector. \nThe study would also assess the need by the high-tech sector for \nforeign workers with specific skills, and would examine the effects of \nincreasing globalization. By the time the increase in visas is set to \nexpire, Congress will have had an excellent opportunity to re-examine \nthe H-1B program in light of additional information and new economic \nconditions, and hopefully there will be many more skilled American \nworkers to fill these jobs.\n  A progressive new idea included in the bill is the authorization of \ndemonstration projects for technical skills training for workers, \nincluding incumbent workers, by local and regional consortia of private \nsector groups. This is a very important addition to the bill, and I \nwant to thank Senator Abraham for including it. Two ideas behind the \ndemonstration projects' authorization language in this bill can be \nparticularly important. First, training our workforce with the skills \nneeded for today's industry must include the training of incumbent \nworkers. Training is now a lifelong process and should not be withheld \nfrom people because they already have a job. The Workforce Investment \nPartnership Act addressed this issue by eliminating the income \nrequirement for some of the Labor Department's adult training programs. \nWe need to turn Labor Department programs into programs that industry \nwants to partner with, and a large part of that metamorphosis must \ninclude incumbent worker training.\n  The second important element of these demonstration projects is \nstimulating companies to work together. We need to change the \ninstitutional mind set of American companies so that they will \ncollaborate with each other on training skilled workers for their \nindustry. Many small and medium-sized companies cannot afford to run \ntraining programs by themselves. Some of the larger corporations have \nsubstantially cut their training programs because skilled workers move \nquickly from one job to another in today's labor market. Yet, all these \ncompanies may be competing in a region for the same pool of skilled \nlabor. It only makes sense for these employers to join together to \ntrain workers in these skills. It makes sense for the government to be \nthe coalescing force in bringing these groups together to fill the \nregional community's needs. We hope that these demonstration projects \nwill show industry how successful such regional skills alliances can \nbe.\n  I thank Senator Abraham and the other co-sponsors of the American \nCompetitiveness Act for the time they have put into this bill, and I \nthank my colleagues Senators Kennedy and Feinstein for their very \nconstructive efforts as well. All of us are interested in what is best \nfor the American economy, and what is best for American\n\n[[Page S4994]]\n\nworkers. I am supporting the American Competitiveness Act because I am \nconvinced that the bill will strengthen economic opportunities for all \nAmericans while we respond to the daunting but exciting challenges of \nthis new high-tech age.\n  Mr. President, I want to again compliment my colleague Senator \nAbraham for sponsoring S. 1723, the American Competitiveness Bill, \nwhich I joined as a cosponsor because I believe we need to address the \nissue of worker shortages in our high-tech industries. S. 1723 provides \na short-term solution for the worker shortage by raising the cap for \nH1-B visas, thereby keeping the jobs here in the United States instead \nof forcing U.S. companies to move the jobs overseas. It also provides \nfor the longer term solution of educating and training our workforce so \nthat American workers can fill the jobs generated by this very fast \ngrowing segment of our economy.\n  One provision in S. 1723, as adopted in the Manager's Amendment, \nspecifically allows for demonstration programs to provide technical \nskills training for workers, including incumbent workers, by consortia \nof private industry councils. As the lead sponsor of this provision in \nthe manager's Amendment I want in these remarks to particularly address \nthe intent and meaning of the provision.\n  These demonstration projects include two elements that I believe are \nessential to help us prepare our workforce with the skills they need \nfor today's fast-paced economy and help update our training programs \nfor the needs of the 21st Century. These are, first, including \nincumbent workers in training programs and, second, stimulating \ncollaboration between companies to train a pool of skilled workers.\n  Employees now need to update their skills continually to remain \ncompetitive. The realty is that we have a global economy and there is, \nmore and more, a global workforce. If companies cannot find skilled \nworkers in the United States, they will find them in another country. \nRealistically, we must include workers who have jobs now in training \nprograms to upgrade and update their skills so they can qualify for the \nchanging needs of industry, instead of waiting until they lose their \njob or become dislocated workers from a declining industry.\n  The demonstration projects described in the Manager's Amendment to S. \n1723 would allow the Secretary of Labor to award grants to consortia, \nmade up of a number of companies in the same region, educational \ninstitutions, labor organizations, state and local governments, and \nprivate industry councils established under section 102 of the Job \nTraining Partnership Act, or successor entities. These consortia would \ndevelop training programs for technical skills needed by a number of \ncompanies in that region. Only with industry leading the skills \ntraining can we be sure that workers are being trained for jobs that \nactually exist. That is why the provision in this bill as amended by \nthe Manager's Amendment creates an industry-driven training program.\n  Why does this new provision indicate the federal government needs to \nbe involved? Because industry does not normally cooperate in training \nworkers. Small companies, and 90% of firms in the United States are \nsmall businesses, don't have the resources to invest in lengthy \ntraining. Larger companies used to provide training programs, but in \nthe high-tech field, workers move quickly from one job to another \nchasing higher salaries. Many companies are reticent to invest in long-\nterm training for employees that may quickly move on. Cooperation \nwithin an industry provides a solution to this program. This program is \nintended to specifically allow participation by small and medium-sized \ncompanies. The new provision in the manager's Amendment to S. 1723 \nwould enable this approach.\n  The government's role under this new provision would be to provide \nthe catalyst to bring the companies together to cooperate on training. \nThe federal funds that would be available under this new provision \nshould be matched by funds from the consortium. The Secretary of Labor \nwould have the discretion to undertake this implementation approach. Of \ncourse, available federal funds are meant only to start the process--\nfederal funding would end over time after which the consortia would \ncontinue the cooperative training programs alone.\n  In the last few years, a small number of regional and industry-based \ntraining alliances in the United States have emerged, usually in \npartnership with state and local governments and technical colleges, \nthat exemplify the type of program on which this provision in the \nManager's Amendment is modeled. In Rhode Island, with help from the \nstate's Human Resource Investment Council, plastics firms developed a \nskills alliance. The Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership, metal-\nworking firms in conjunction with the AFL-CIO, set up a teaching \nfactory to train workers. Without some kind of support, such as created \nby the new provision in this bill, to create alliances, small- and \nmedium-sized firms just don't have the time or resources to collaborate \non training. In fact, almost all the existing regional skills alliances \nreport that they would not have been able to get off the ground without \nan independent, staff entity to operate the alliance. Widespread and \ntimely deployment of these kinds of partnerships is simply not likely \nto happen without the incentives established by a federal initiative, \nwhich would be created by this provision. This provision can help \ncreate successful models and templates that others can replicate across \nthe nation.\n  I am very appreciative that Senator Abraham has included the \ntechnical skills training provision in the manager's amendment to S. \n1723.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if I might have 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the Senator from \nMichigan. I believe the time for this bill and this change in the \nquotas has come and he has had the courage and the intelligence to see \nit and to bring us a bill that will truly enhance our productivity and \nour capacity to man the kind of high-tech programs that this country so \ndesperately needs to stay up front.\n  Already in many parts of the country there are not the skilled \nworkers necessary for many of these jobs. This bill won't take care of \nall of that, but it is a recognition that a small portion of it ought \nto take place as provided for in this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nnumbered 2419. The amendment (No. 2419) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to commend Senator Abraham \nfor the fine job he has done in guiding S. 1723 through the legislative \nprocess. The American Competitiveness Act is an important step forward \nin ensuring that America's high-technology companies have the skilled \npersonnel they need to compete both domestically and globally.\n  There is one area that I regret we were not able to work out: the \nissue of the exploitation of visas, including H-1B visas, by foreign \ncountries for training individuals in fields essential for the \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction. I attempted to negotiate \nlanguage with the gentleman from Michigan that would ensure that \ncountries like India, which recently detonated five nuclear weapons, \nwould not be able to send individuals to work in the United States in a \ncapacity that would enable them to return home with sensitive knowledge \non developing nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. Unfortunately, \nthose negotiations ended without a satisfactory resolution, and I \nremain very concerned about this very serious problem.\n  When those of us who are original cosponsors of the American \nCompetitiveness Act chose to support this bill, we did not envision the \nmost glaring and ominous violation of international norms to occur: the \ntesting of multiple nuclear weapons by the government of India. The \nrepercussions of that series of tests are serious indeed; India's \nrelations with Pakistan and China have long been confrontational, with \nfour wars occurring between it and its neighbors since it attained \nindependence from Britain. This ill-timed, ill-considered decision to \nconduct nuclear tests, emanating as it did from the most infantile and \ndangerous of motives--the desire to be respected as a nuclear power--\nfully warranted the immediate implementation of sanctions against \nIndia.\n\n[[Page S4995]]\n\n  If there is a consensus about any aspect of U.S. national security \npolicy since the end of the Cold War, it is the threat to international \nstability posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \nespecially nuclear weapons. By running on a platform of elevating its \n``bomb in the basement'' capability to one of overtly brandishing its \ncapability to inflict widespread destruction, India's new government \nhas undermined our ability to contain the arms race in one of the \nworld's most inherently volatile regions. It is now imperative that the \nUnited States adopt every measure to ensure we do not inadvertently \ncontribute to India's ability to further refine its nuclear weapons \ncapabilities. For this reason, I had hoped to have an amendment adopted \nthat would have addressed this concern.\n  As a cosponsor of the American Competitiveness Act, I understand the \nrequirements of U.S. industry for highly skilled workers. Raising the \ncap on H-1B visas will aid American companies in meeting that \nrequirement. To the extent that India's military-industrial complex can \nbenefit from sending technicians and scientists to the United States, \nhowever, the program can work against our own national security \ninterests. My amendment would have helped to prevent that situation \nfrom coming about by prohibiting Indian nationals associated with its \nnuclear weapons program from attaining H-1B visas.\n  I hope to work with the chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee on \nthe future to help the Congress attain a better understanding of any \npossible correlation between foreign technicians, engineers and \nscientists working in the United States and the problem of \nproliferation. In the meantime, I reiterate my strong support of S. \n1723 and again thank the gentleman from Michigan for his hard and \nproductive work on this legislation.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I support S. 1723, the American \nCompetitiveness Act. Business, professional associations, and various \ngovernmental entities have presented convincing evidence of the need to \nraise the current 65,000 annual cap on H1-B workers. It is also true \nthat there is significant conflicting evidence, which is why I believe \nthe requirement in the bill for a non-biased report on high-technology \nlabor needs is one of the most important provisions of the bill.\n  Over the past two years I have heard from numerous employers from \naround the state of Arizona, including such major employers as Intel \nCorporation, Motorola, the TRW, who have provided evidence and \nanecdotes about why more H1-B workers are needed. For example, TRW \ntells about a foreign student it hired from an American university \nbecause the foreign student was the only individual who could produce a \nformula to redesign a component of the ``air-bag'' to make it safer and \nbetter designed. If TRW had not been allowed to hire the foreign \nstudent, it believes it would still be searching for an engineer to \nperform the job.\n  This year and last, the 65,000 annual ceiling on H1-B workers has \nbeen reached. That means that for the next four months, until the end \nof the fiscal year, employers who cannot find American workers to \nperform certain specialty jobs, including computer programming, \nengineering, and other high-technology positions, will not have that \nwork performed until the 1999 fiscal year begins, this October 1. For \nanyone who has ever run a business and experienced worker shortages, \nthey know that not being allowed to hire necessary personnel can be \ndevastating.\n  I support an increase in the cap for this year. I also support a \nshort term increase, for five years, in the number of aliens granted \nH1-B visas. With the increasing number of high-technology jobs, \nincluding positions related to the Year 2000 problem, and, until this \nyear, a decreasing number of students studying in high-tech-oriented \nmajors, employers will be challenged in the near term to find enough \nqualified workers.\n  Having said this, however, I reiterate that there are conflicting \nissues surrounding the H1-B foreign worker debate that must be examined \nand addressed at the end of the five-year authorization. When the full \nJudiciary Committee considered S. 1723, the Judiciary Committee \naccepted my provision to limit the authorization to five years and \nrequire that various interests on both sides get together and issue a \nnon-biased report within two years of enactment of the bill about labor \nmarket needs over the next ten years for high-technology workers. This \nstudy and report, to be overseen by the National Science Foundation, \nwill include representatives with varying interests for academia, \nbusiness, and government, and, among other issues, will assess the \nfuture training and education needs of American students to ensure that \ntheir skills match the needs of the IT industry over the next 10 years. \nIt will also provide an analysis of progress made since 1998 by \neducators, employers, and government entities to improve the teaching \nand educational level of American students in the fields of math, \nscience, computer and engineering.\n  The report, and the requirement that the authorization be limited to \nfive years, is clearly necessary. My office has been inundated with \ninformation from government agencies, the high-technology industry, and \nprofessional associations that represent particular high-tech \nindustries. But the information has been inconsistent. For example, \ninformation we received from the Commerce Department indicates that the \nUnited States is currently experiencing a significant high-technology \nworker shortage and over the next 10 years, the U.S. will generate more \nthan 100,000 information-technology jobs annually. An interest group \nstudy, conducted by Virginia Tech, found that there is a current \nvacancy rate of 346,000 high-technology positions in the United States. \nThe Labor Department projects that our economy will produce more than \n130,000 information-technology jobs in each of the next ten years, for \na total of more than 1.3 million positions. The Hudson Institute \nestimates that the unaddressed shortage of skilled workers throughout \nthe U.S. will result in a five percent drop in the growth rate of GDP.\n  On the other hand, information provided for the General Accounting \nOffice about the Commerce Department's assessment of information-\ntechnology shortages indicates that the Commerce report contained \nserious methodological weaknesses. The GAO, however, also found that \nits assessment should ``not necessarily lead to a conclusion that there \nis no shortage. Instead, as the Commerce report states, additional \ninformation and data are needed to more accurately characterize the IT \nlabor market now and in the future.\n\n  The GAO report also provided Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates on \nprojected growth for high-technology jobs and found that, compared to \nthe expected 13 percent growth in other jobs by the year 2005, IT \noccupations are expected to grow 60 percent over the same period.\n  Increasing wages of IT workers and the unemployment rate of IT \nworkers also signal shortages in the IT field. But in these areas, \nthere is also conflicting information. For example, reports conducted \nby consulting and interest groups found that salaries for IT workers \nrose higher than for other specialty occupations in 1996 and 1997. But, \naccording to the GAO, the percentage changes for the IT industry over \nthe period between 1983 and 1997 were comparable to, or lower, than \nother speciality occupations. Such statistics may support the high-\ntechnology sector's anecdotal evidence that demand, relative to other \noccupations in a period of relatively low unemployment, has grown \nsubstantially over the past couple of years.\n  There are also anecdotal stories in leading newspapers about the \ndifficulty American college graduates are experiencing trying to enter \nthe high-technology job market. But, statistics about specific high-\ntech professions paint a different picture. For example, the \nunemployment rate among electrical engineers nationally is below one \npercent. Anecdotal evidence points toward one assessment but statistics \nseem to point toward high demand for these U.S. workers.\n  So, the required repot will serve as an important tool in the \nreauthorization of the H1-B program, but regardless of the outcome of \nthe report, it is very important for the private sector and for \ngovernment, all the way up to the Executive Branch, to encourage young \npeople to be fully prepared, first, for job markets where there is an \nabundance of jobs and, second, for the very\n\n[[Page S4996]]\n\njobs that will keep America strong and competitive on a global basis. \nTo that end, I am supportive of the bill's provision to authorize $50 \nmillion in scholarships for low-income students pursuing degrees in \nmath, engineering, and science. It is my hope that the provision, \ncoupled with related provisions in the Senate-passed job-training \nconsolidation bill and the National Science Foundation reauthorization, \nwill help young people go into high tech fields.\n  There are other aspects of this legislation that I want to highlight. \nAs foreign workers continue to be admitted into the American workforce, \nand as the five-year reauthorization progresses, I will work with the \nState Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service to \nscrutinize which workers really make up our population of H1-B workers. \nLet's make sure that the H1-B program only admits those workers who \nwill perform a ``specialty occupation'' as defined by the Immigration \nand Nationality Act, including the following; the individual possesses \nunique knowledge or skills; the individual can localize a product based \non native knowledge of language or culture of the foreign market; the \nindividual will contribute to a company's global presence; or, an \nemployer finds an inadequate number of highly qualified American \nworkers to fill the job.\n  In addition, it is important to understand the dynamics by which H1-B \nemployees come to stay in the United States permanently, instead of \nreturning home after the six years they are authorized to work in this \ncountry under the visa. While it is true that in 1990, immigration \nreforms made it possible for H1-B workers to, with ``dual intent,'' \nenter the United States on an H1-B visa and then remain in the United \nStates permanently, I believe it is important to know how many \nimmigrants are entering the United States on an H1-B visa and then \nstaying here permanently.\n  Finally, it is very important that the Labor Department respond to \nquestions posed in March by Immigration Subcommittee Chairman Spencer \nAbraham about abuses in the H1-B program. It is important to understand \nwhy the number of complaints about the H1-B process are so few. I \nsupport the provisions of the bill that increase penalties to $25,000 \nper violation and provide for a two-year debarment from the H1-B \nprogram for employers who willfully violate the law, but we need to \nknow more about whether or not a substantial number of employers do or \ndo not violate H1-B immigration law.\n  Mr. President, I will support passage of S. 1723. Companies in the \nUnited States must not be impeded from hiring needed employees. I look \nforward to a comprehensive assessment of high-technology employer needs \nfrom the report included in the bill and to critically applying that \nassessment when we look at and reauthorize the H1-B program in five \nyears.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2418\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

The question now is on agreeing to the \namendment of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I move to table the second Kennedy \namendment numbered 2417, and I also seek unanimous consent that the \nfollowing rollcall votes be 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators are advised that there are 2 \nminutes of debate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there was a unanimous consent request that \nthe next votes be reduced to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in my amendment we are basically saying \nlet the best and the brightest come into the United States on the basis \nof their extraordinary contributions in our research facilities or \nuniversities or other places.\n  But the fact of the matter is that most of jobs for which employers \nseek H-1B workers pay $75,000 or less, and 75 percent of them are \n$50,000 or less. Those are good jobs for Americans. We are saying: Make \nsure you are going to offer it to an American before you are going to \napply to hire a foreign worker.\n  We prescribe in our amendment that recruitment standard is whatever \nthe industry does normally when recruiting workers. If employers follow \nthat procedure, all they have to do is attest that they have followed \nthose procedures and they are protected.\n  These are good jobs. Americans are qualified for these jobs, and we \nought to put American workers first. That is what this amendment is \nabout.\n  Mr. President, before we vote, I would like to thank Senator Abraham \nfor his courtesies in this debate, and his staff, Lee Otis, Stuart \nAnderson and Cesar Conda. I would also like to thank my own staff, \nMichael Myers, my staff director, and Sandy Shipshock, who has worked \ndiligently for many months on my staff as a Pearson Fellow from the \nState Department. I am deeply grateful for their help.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, our legislation puts America's workers \nfirst, and it severely punishes anybody who tries to do otherwise.\n  But the provisions in the regulations that would be necessary to \nimplement this amendment would give the Department of Labor dramatic \nintrusive powers to intervene in hiring decisions of high-tech \ncompanies involving temporary workers. In the permanent worker \ncategory, these kinds of provisions typically delay a hiring decision \nby as much as 2 years. We oppose that in the temporary category. It \nwould have the effect, Mr. President, of setting back the entire \ntemporary worker program when we need it most--as we are trying to \naddress the year 2000 problem and other immediate emergencies before \nus. For that reason, I propose that we vote to table.\n\n[[Page S4997]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator making a motion to table the \namendment?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

The pending question is on agreeing to the \nBumpers amendment, No. 2416.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Could we have a little order, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, in 1989 this body adopted a provision \nthat said anybody who will invest $500,000 or $1 million in this \ncountry and create or maintain 10 jobs can get a green card for 2 years \nand, 3 years later, have American citizenship. The program never took \noff, and since that time a cottage industry has grown up of people who \nwere advertising in Taiwan and Oman and saying: ``$100,000 is all you \nneed. You give us a $400,000 promissory note, you still get your green \ncard.'' The INS says it is impossible to monitor. You don't know where \nthese people are coming from; you don't know where their money is \ncoming from.\n  Mr. President, what we are doing allowing this to continue --and the \nINS says it is a disaster--is cheapening American citizenship. You want \nforeign investment? Give them tax breaks. Do not--do not--cheapen \nAmerican citizenship. These are not the tired, these are not the poor, \nthese are not the huddled masses. These are people from Hong Kong, \nKorea, the Pacific rim, who don't even come here; they send $100,000. \nThey don't even want our citizenship, because they have to pay taxes.\n  It is a terrible, shameful thing. It is downright vulgar. I plead \nwith you, vote to strike that provision from the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, this program is a very small program. It \nis a maximum of 1,000 visas a year. It means people who come to this \ncountry to create jobs will be given a chance to do so. We have not \nexamined or studied some of the complaints that have been brought forth \nin both today's debate and in the news media in our subcommittee. Until \nwe do, I urge the Senate not to eliminate this program. I believe it is \ncreating jobs, not taking them away.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The distinguished Senator from Michigan said 1,000 \nslots.

SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES IN ACT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``American \n     Competitiveness Act''.\n       (b) References in Act.--Except as otherwise specifically \n     provided in this Act, whenever in this Act an amendment or \n     repeal is expressed as an amendment to or a repeal of a \n     provision, the reference shall be deemed to be made to the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) American companies today are engaged in fierce \n     competition in global markets.\n       (2) Companies across America are faced with severe high \n     skill labor shortages that threaten their competitiveness.\n       (3) The National Software Alliance, a consortium of \n     concerned government, industry, and academic leaders that \n     includes the United States Army, Navy, and Air Force, has \n     concluded that ``The supply of computer science graduates is \n     far short of the number needed by industry.''. The Alliance \n     concludes that the current severe understaffing could lead to \n     inflation and lower productivity.\n       (4) The Department of Labor projects that the United States \n     economy will produce more than 130,000 information technology \n     jobs in each of the next 10 years, for a total of more than \n     1,300,000.\n       (5) Between 1986 and 1995, the number of bachelor's degrees \n     awarded in computer science declined by 42 percent. \n     Therefore, any short-term increases in enrollment may only \n     return the United States to the 1986 level of graduates and \n     take several years to produce these additional graduates.\n       (6) A study conducted by Virginia Tech for the Information \n     Technology Association of America estimates that there are \n     more than 340,000 unfilled positions for highly skilled \n     information technology workers in American companies.\n       (7) The Hudson Institute estimates that the unaddressed \n     shortage of skilled workers throughout the United States \n     economy will result in a 5-percent drop in the growth rate of \n     GDP. That translates into approximately $200,000,000,000 in \n     lost output, nearly $1,000 for every American.\n       (8) It is necessary to deal with the current situation with \n     both short-term and long-term measures.\n       (9) In fiscal year 1997, United States companies and \n     universities reached the cap of 65,000 on H-1B temporary \n     visas a month before the end of the fiscal year. In fiscal \n     year 1998 the cap is expected to be reached as early as May \n     if Congress takes no action. And it will be hit earlier each \n     year until backlogs develop of such a magnitude as to prevent \n     United States companies and researchers from having any \n     timely access to skilled foreign-born professionals.\n       (10) It is vital that more American young people be \n     encouraged and equipped to enter technical fields, such as \n     mathematics, engineering, and computer science.\n       (11) If American companies cannot find home-grown talent, \n     and if they cannot bring talent to this country, a large \n     number are likely to move key operations overseas, sending \n     those and related American jobs with them.\n       (12) Inaction in these areas will carry significant \n     consequences for the future of American competitiveness \n     around the world and will seriously undermine efforts to \n     create and keep jobs in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I voted for S. 1723 because I am convinced \nthat some high technology companies are facing critical labor \nshortages, which is in turn hampering growth in this important economic \nsector of Oregon's economy. It is critically important, however, that \nthe final legislation contain additional protections for workers \nrights. Specifically, we should make certain that no qualified U.S. \nworker will be laid off simply to be replaced by a foreign worker. \nFurther, we should ensure that employers who want to use this program \nhave taken steps to find qualified American workers. I look forward to \ncontinued progress on this legislation as it proceeds to conference.\n  Mr. LOTT. First of all, I want to congratulate the Senator from \nMichigan\n\n[[Page S5001]]\n\nfor his efforts on this very important legislation. I also appreciate \nthe cooperation of Senators on the other side of the aisle that worked \nthrough the day, including Senator Kennedy, so that we could get to a \nconclusion on this important legislation. I think it is good for the \ncountry. It is the fourth of the high-tech bills that we worked on last \nweek. I thought the combination of those four bills were important and \nwill make a difference in our high-tech community and having the \nworkers and the opportunity for workers to be able to do these \nimportant jobs in the high-tech sector. I congratulate Senator Abraham \nfor his work, and Senator McCain, who came up with the suggestion that \nwe try to do several of these high-tech bills in a row.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S4976-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5001-S5012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL TOBACCO POLICY AND YOUTH SMOKING REDUCTION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to S. 1415, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1415) to reform and restructure the processes by \n     which tobacco products are manufactured, marketed, and \n     distributed, to prevent the use of tobacco products by \n     minors, to redress the adverse health effects of tobacco use, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill which had been reported \nfrom the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             MODIFICATIONS TO COMMERCE COMMITTEE SUBSTITUTE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on behalf of the chairman, the ranking \nmember and a majority of the members of the Commerce Committee, I wish \nto modify the Commerce Committee substitute.\n  Before the Chair declares the amendment is modified, I announce to \nthe Members that this is the text of the so-called managers' amendment \nthat the chairman and ranking member have been working on for the last \nfew days. The modification also incorporates the Finance Committee \nreported amendments as part of the new Commerce Committee substitute.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. May I make an inquiry of the majority leader?\n  Mr. LOTT. We have a series of things we need to do in a row, if I \ncould get through those.\n  The Chair needs to rule, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  Mr. LOTT. On behalf of the chairman and a majority of the members of \nthe Commerce Committee, I wish to further modify the Commerce Committee \nsubstitute. Again, before the Chair declares that the amendment is \nfurther modified, I announce to the membership this modification would \ndelete some of the Finance Committee amendments from the text of the \nCommerce Committee modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  Mr. LOTT. Finally, again on behalf of the chairman and a majority of \nthe members of the Commerce Committee, I further modify the committee \nsubstitute. Again, before the Chair announces the modification, this \nlast change would incorporate the Lugar Farmer's protection amendment \nas part of the Commerce Committee substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, as a result of this \naction, the pending Commerce Committee Substitute contains the \nfollowing: The so-called managers' amendment; all of the Finance \nCommittee reported amendments, except the $1.50 increase; Title 14, \nwith respect to declaring the price increase a tax increase; the three \ndeletions with respect to the LEAF Act; the lookback and the compliance \nfund and tobacco tax trust fund; and the Lugar-Farmer's protection \namendment.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the modified committee \nsubstitute be printed as a Senate amendment and the final version \nincorporating all of the modifications only be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. At this point, Mr. President, I ask the Senate if they \nwould allow me to go through this.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I do object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I wanted to give you a chance to inquire, but by objecting \nyou certainly can inquire.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I do object. Mr. President, this has been a long, hard \nroad, as you well know. Almost a year ago the White House, health \ncommunity and the States, and the States' attorneys general all met and \neveryone was provided for except the person who really depended on his \nliving--that is, the tobacco farmer. So I got together during the fall \nwith the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford, and he and \nI worked diligently over the fall period developing what we call the \nLEAF Act, which not only took care of the farmer but the farm \ncommunity; namely, the warehousemen, the bank that is financing, the \nequipment dealer, and everything else of that kind.\n\n  There is no question that if this so-called tobacco bill works, there \ncan't be any tobacco farmer unless they are tobacco companies. This is \ngoing to diminish the tobacco companies to a great extent and limit the \ntobacco farmers, as they go down or out of business. We have included \nthe LEAF Act as sort of a safety net. Now, we met in the Commerce \nCommittee on that basis. I know the distinguished chairman, Senator \nMcCain, came to me, and on the basis of him going along with the LEAF \nAct, we made it a bipartisan bill and voted it out 19-1.\n  The distinguished chairman also went to South Carolina before \nthousands of farmers and represented: Don't worry about the LEAF Act. \nMr. President, I have been in five conferences now--two actually in my \nown hideaway in the Capitol--with the White House, the majority \nleadership, Senator McCain, and others, on this pack of bills. It \nincluded Senators on both sides of the aisle, with staffs and \neverything else. In the five meetings, including the one at 4 o'clock \nthis afternoon, I was always counseled: Don't worry, the LEAF Act is \nintact.\n  Don't give me the double talk that it is still intact, not when you \nput in the Lugar bill by a majority vote. The Lugar bill, by a majority \nvote, puts that farmer out of business. That is the one thing that the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, and others, have worked and \ncounseled against, and everything else of that kind.\n  I question, respectfully, that the majority leader identified the \nmajority of the Commerce Committee members. That is all your \nRepublicans; is that what you say?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am dismayed. About a half-hour ago, I had a chance to \ntalk, of course, just a bit with the majority leader. Until now, \nnothing has been said, and this kind of conduct and course of conduct \nis just the worst I have seen in my 30-some years up here. There is \nnothing you can do if they want to change their votes. They all voted \nfor the bill, and I know how they felt because I talked to various \nMembers. I have been talking to them intermittently over the past \nseveral months, and over the past 1 month in conferences with the White \nHouse. And now, to come at the last minute and have the ground cut from \nunder you with this particular request on the premise that you want to \nbe fair and give everybody a fair vote, that isn't what I worked for. I \nworked to give this a particular priority that no one else has given \nit--and certainly not to tobacco companies. I think the tobacco \ncompanies have the pressure on at this point to go along with the Lugar \namendment and save them billions of dollars. That could be the case.\n  I yield to my distinguished friend from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I say this \nwith all respect to the majority leader and to my colleague. It is very \ndifficult to understand what has developed. I thought I understood the \nrules very well and worked diligently, along with the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina, and others, including Senator Frist, who \nworked hard to work out the FDA amendment that is in the bill; all of \nus worked hard to put this together.\n\n  I understand the 60-vote rule. I understand that very well, because \nthis amendment by Senator Lugar cannot raise the money. They talked \nabout a lump sum payment and had to change it today because it is 3 \nyears or more. There is no lump sum payment here. You are fooling the \nfarmers, misrepresenting things to the farmer, if the Lugar amendment \ngets in here. It is\n\n[[Page S5002]]\n\nthe farmer versus the manufacturer. The manufacturer, under the Lugar \namendment, will save a billion dollars a year, minimum--a billion \ndollars a year. You are going to see that check signed tomorrow. You \nare going to see the press conference tomorrow. You are going to see \nthe farmers come in here tomorrow, because they are opposed to Lugar. \nYou can have all the misgivings you want. There could be ghosts behind \nevery tombstone about the future, but you have to lay groundwork.\n  I say to the majority leader, with all respect, if this is done to \nus, I am going to make it as difficult as I can to see that the bill is \nnot passed this week, and probably not in June. I believe my \nresponsibility here is to the farmer, not to the manufacturer and not \nto misrepresent that 40 percent of all the money raised by the McCain \nbill will go to the farmers under 3 years.\n  Think about that 40 percent. What are you going to reduce? Research? \nWhat are you going to reduce? Advertising? What are you going to reduce \nin order to get that money? Sure, you have to raise it $1.50 to pay for \nLugar, and you may not be able to do it then. So here we are, saying to \nthose of us who have worked for months--and I have been on the front \nporches of grocery stores, in kitchens of farmers, I have been in six \nStates talking to farmers, and this is what the farmers wrote--the LEAF \nAct. They didn't write the Lugar amendment.\n  I am sorry that the chairman of the Agriculture Committee is not \ngoing to have a vote. I feel sorry for him, but this is the nature of \nthis institution. This is the nature, this is the rule, and this is the \nprecedent. You are following the rules, that is true. But when it comes \ndown to the farmer versus the manufacturer--and this Lugar amendment \nwill give billions to the manufacturer--then I think that the Senate \nwill have a question of whether they want to support the farmer or \nwhether they want to support the tobacco manufacturer.\n  I know there is nothing I can do, Mr. President. I can object to the \nunanimous consent, but eventually we will vote on it. Everybody is \nworking hard on the other side to get a bill out of here--just get it \nout of here. We don't want to touch it, we don't want to fool with it \nanymore, because what comes out of conference is going to be a \nminuscule bill. You will have a hard time getting that bill through \nthis body. So rather than starting to take the hide off of folks in the \nbeginning before you even bring the bill up, it seems to me it is a \nlittle bit disconcerting.\n  The chairman of the Commerce Committee has been as straight with me \nand with us as he could be. I find no fault with what he has attempted \nto do, because some things we can't agree on. But we were not \ndisagreeable. Everything has always been on top of the table with us, \nand his word has been as good as gold; his word has been his bond. And \nnow the majority leader takes over all this hard work he has done and \nsay to the chairman of the committee, and to us who worked to \ncooperate, that what you did and your cooperation is for naught.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest of the majority leader?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there is objection. Before I renew the \nrequest that I made, which was merely that this substitute be printed \nas a Senate amendment and the final version only be printed in the \nRecord, I want to note that all this means is that we would have to \nprint all three of these documents, which are all pretty substantial in \nsize. We can do that, but there is a cost involved and there is time \ninvolved. I hoped that there would not be objection to having this \ndocument printed. It would be available to the Members to review. But \nif there is objection to that, it won't stop anything. We will go \nforward.\n  Let me respond to a lot that has been said because I thought it was \nimportant that the former chairman of the Commerce Committee, the \nSenator from South Carolina who worked with Senator McCain, be heard, \nand I thought it was very important that the Senator from Kentucky make \nhis case. But let me also explain what is going on here.\n  Everybody knows this has not been easy to get through the committee \nprocess to get at this point on the floor of the Senate with a lot of \ngive and take and a lot of Senators who had to take positions that were \nhard for them, including the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain. And \nother Senators who are going to be involved in this have had to accept \nsome things they didn't go along with. I acknowledge that the Senator \nfrom South Carolina has worked very carefully with the Senator from \nArizona. But also it is my job as majority leader to try to find a \nresponsible way to move this forward to get it to the floor in the \nfairest possible way. There is no way to do that without some people \nfeeling like, ``Well it is not exactly the way I wanted it,'' or ``It \ndoesn't give me a fair position,'' or ``It doesn't give me more than a \nfair position. All I want is an advantage.''\n  Now the Senator from Indiana is chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee. It seems rational to me that you would understand that as \nmajority leader I would be interested and concerned in the position, or \nan amendment to be offered on this important piece of legislation by \nthe chairman of the Agriculture Committee, and, if we didn't do it this \nway, he would be disadvantaged in that he would have to have 60 votes, \nnot 51--not a majority, a supermajority of 60 votes. I understand that \nthe Senator from Kentucky wanted to require that, and he has used his \ninfluence to get it in the position where that could have occurred. He \nalso understands that what I am doing here is perfectly within the \nrules. I am trying to get everybody on a fair and equal footing. I \ndon't know how the votes are going to go.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could, because I didn't interrupt the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  I don't know how the voting is going to go. Senator Lugar might get \n51 votes. Senator Ford might win and prevail because 51 votes cannot be \nachieved for the Lugar amendment. There are a lot of people who don't \nthink either one of these are all that hot. Quite frankly, they would \nlike a whole different arrangement to be of assistance legitimately to \nthe tobacco farmers. These are not the only two solutions in the world. \nThere might be some other ones.\n  I do not want to disadvantage anybody. But this is an amendment that \nhas been around on this subject for quite some time. Senator Lugar has \nnever made it a secret of the fact that he would want this to be \noffered, or as an alternative available to him to be offered. There are \nothers who do not like this provision or that provision that is \nincluded or not included. But, in other instances, the Senators would \nhave to offer an amendment only to get 50 votes.\n  So I think this is a fair way to go. I am sorry the Senator doesn't \nagree with it. But I have been very meticulous to make sure that \neverybody was aware of what we were trying to do here. I have not been \nin all of these substantive negotiations. I have been strictly looking \nat how we can move this forward and what the process is to have it come \nup and considered in a fair way.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee is standing here now wanting to \nask some questions of the Chair about what this means for the Finance \nCommittee and what they did. They had a tough time. They came up with \nsome improvements. They came up with some things certainly I don't \nagree with, and I don't think the chairman does, either. But he is \nwilling to get a clarification of what it means for him, and to go \nforward. I think he has taken the right position.\n  So I just wanted to take this opportunity to say that I understand \nwhere everybody is coming from but that I think this is the fair way to \ndo it.\n  I don't think we ought to start over by saying, ``Well, if we don't \nget this, or don't get that, we are going to kill it.'' I don't think \nanybody wants that to happen on your side of the aisle. Let's go \nforward. Let's have some amendments. And let's see where the votes are. \nThat is the way to do this.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, continuing to reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe there is no reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An objection was heard, and the majority \nleader is recognized.\n\n[[Page S5003]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me do this, Mr. President, so that the Senator can \nrespond. I yield to the Senator from Kentucky so he can respond.\n  Mr. FORD. I say to the majority leader that I understand that Senator \nLugar is chairman of the Agriculture Committee. I understand that \nSenator Lugar has been around here more than a week or two. I \nunderstand that Senator Lugar should understand the rules. And I \nunderstand that he has been working diligently, along with others, to \nmake this work. I have been doing the same. And then when I get it to a \npoint where you have it where you think you are safe and that you are \nprotected, then in order to be fair about it, in order to be fair about \nit, you change everything we have done for the last 10 months, except \nthat I get a vote up and down. But I had the position--or we had it in \na position where it would take 60.\n\n  So I think that the fairness now in all of the work that you do that \nis not fair, and so, therefore, the work you do is out the window \nbecause it is not fair. I thought when you made it through here, and \nyou got it through the committee, and you got it on the floor, that was \npretty fair after 10 months. Now because another Senator doesn't have \nan opportunity to bring it up----\n  Mr. LOTT. The only time there would be a guarantee of that is when it \nhas gone through the Senate, the House, then a conference, and the \nPresident puts pen to paper.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand you are talking about fairness here and you \nare being unfair to those of us who worked so hard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I renew my request with respect to the \nsubcommittee substitute.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nunder the reservation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, nobody needs to speak for either the \nSenator from Kentucky or the Senator from South Carolina. They have \ndone it for many years here, and they are as capable as anybody. But I \nwould like to say that I understand the difficulties in which the \nmajority leader finds himself. He gets approached by people on both \nsides, from all sides, and it is difficult to bring this piece to the \nfloor. But there is a process by which we have been working and by \nwhich, I think, most of us understood that we were sort of teeing this \nlegislation up for the floor. I think it has been an exceptional \nprocess. I applaud the Senator from Arizona, the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, for the way in which he has tried to meld those \nforces over the course of the last months.\n  The truth is that the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, who is the ranking member and who could have stood in \nthe way, significantly along the way here, of progress, has moved along \nthe way to get us to where we are with an understanding of where he \nstood with respect to critical issues. Everybody here understands how \nyou approach any of these negotiations. There is a certain amount that \nyou are willing to give up with an understanding of what you are \ngetting and that you are where you are.\n  Through all of these meetings, through all of the interventions to \nthis point in time, neither the Senator from South Carolina nor I have \nbeen part of those meetings, nor any of my colleagues have had any \nknowledge whatsoever that this ``rule'' might be invoked. They have had \nno opportunity to think about an alternative process to work with their \ncolleagues, or otherwise.\n  I simply say that suddenly at 4 o'clock in the afternoon the entire \nground has shifted. That is within the rules. The Senator from Kentucky \nhas acknowledged that. I acknowledge that. That may be one of the very \ndifficult decisions that the majority leader has to make.\n  But if fairness is what we are really looking for here, it seems to \nme that maybe there is a way to find some alternative method of \nincluding the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from South Carolina \nand the chairman of the Agriculture Committee to find out how you might \nresolve this other than to do it in this sort of fairly unilateral \nfashion. I don't know if that is possible. But I would certainly say \nthat in the context of the way in which the negotiations have been \nconducted to reach this point that also strikes me as being fair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator from Massachusetts is speaking under \nreservation.\n  Let me assure him that I have looked at all of the alternatives. I \nhave looked at the best possible way to bring this up. I didn't know it \nwas going to wind up having to be done this way. We didn't know 2 weeks \nago that we would have the Finance Committee angles. I have said all \nalong that Senator Lugar, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, was \ngoing to have a fair shot, along with anybody else, to offer his \namendment and win or lose by majority vote. I am surprised that some \npeople are surprised by this. But I understand. But I just say that I \nhave been having people on this side of the aisle complain about this, \ntoo. There are a lot of people on my side of the aisle who do not want \nthis brought up under this concept, or any other.\n  But I will say this to Senators on both sides of the aisle: Anybody \nwho wants to stand in the way of this bill, if you don't want us to try \nto find a way to deal with children's porn, and drug abuse by children, \nif you don't want us to find a way to try to deal with the health \nproblems caused by tobacco--all I am trying to do is get a 51-vote \nmajority for an amendment--go right ahead. There are people on both \nsides of the aisle threatening to do just that.\n\n  Now, I know the Senator from Massachusetts is trying to contribute by \nsaying let's keep calm and can we find a way to work this out. I think \nthis is a fair way, and I admonish everybody to stay calm, too, and \nkeep our eye on what is the target here. It is bigger than the sum of \nits parts, and we ought to keep that in mind. We may not be able to do \nit this week. We may never be able to do it. The odds are very strong \nthat this thing is going to implode by the weight we are placing on it. \nEvery time we tested it, it has gotten bigger, fatter and more \ndifficult to get through. So it is OK with me however it works out. But \nI believe we have here a reasonable way to begin this process, and I \nurge my colleagues, hold your fire. Let's go ahead with the opening \nstatements by the Senators. Let's get some amendments going. Who knows \nfor sure how it is going to work out?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I would be happy to yield after I finish my comment.\n  I will not object, Mr. President. But I would simply say that I think \nthe Senator from Arizona would agree that in the judgment of most of us \nwe thought we made it smaller and slimmer and easier, but that will be \nproven over the course of the next days. I appreciate what the majority \nleader has said, and I think hopefully we can find some way to resolve \nthis as we go through the next days.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's--\n--\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has not had the \nfloor--\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And thereby does not have the authority to \nyield. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the majority leader yield to me for a brief comment? \nThe majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I had a request pending, but if I have the \ntime----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. This is a difficult situation and not the first that we \nhave been through in this process, nor regrettably, I feel, will it be \nthe last. I\n\n[[Page S5004]]\n\nhave great sympathy for my two dear friends--one from Kentucky, one \nfrom South Carolina--who fought very hard for the people they \nrepresent. I also understand, and I think we all should, the position \nof the majority leader, who, despite the predictions of many, has been \nsteadfast throughout as far as saying this bill would come to the floor \nand we would resolve it, if there was anything within his power to do \nit.\n  It was my understanding I would be managing this bill with the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina. I will make every effort to \nmake sure that fairness is the order of the day, which has been the way \nwe have conducted our relationship and our negotiations throughout this \nbill. I will do everything in my power.\n  I understand very well how concerned the Senators from South Carolina \nand Kentucky are. I also understand that the majority leader has the \nright to do these things. We saw them when the other side of the aisle \nwas in the majority. I saw it on several bills where modifications were \nput into bills which made it no longer a 60-vote proposition but 51-49. \nI didn't like that at the time. But it is perfectly correct in the \nparliamentary fashion.\n  I would, again, like to echo the words of the majority leader. We are \ngoing to hear attacks. There are people waiting right now to attack \nthis bill in the most vociferous and passionate fashion, and there are \npeople on the other side who will say: You guys aren't tough enough on \nthese tobacco companies; you have got to do more. The first amendment \nis going to smack them for a buck 50 instead of a buck ten. We will \nhear over here: This is the biggest tax increase in history; you are \ndoing way too much.\n  But I believe the great center will hold on this bill, and I believe \nthat a fair procedure will follow. And I want to commit to my \ncolleagues that will happen. I am sorry, I say to my friends from South \nCarolina and from Kentucky, this has been distressing to them, but I \nhope we can move forward in a fair and equitable fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's--\n--\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have not wanted to get into this until \nnow, but I must say I applaud what the distinguished chairman has said \nin a couple of aspects. First of all, I think that it is true; up until \nnow, there has been a good deal of effort on both sides to bring this \nbill to the floor. We wouldn't be here today were it not for the \nleadership of the Senator from Arizona and the tremendous work put \nforth by the Senator from South Carolina, as well as the Senator from \nKentucky. It is the only way we got to this point. We got here because \nthe ranking member and the chairman concluded that this bill needed to \nget to the floor, and we were under a timeframe within which to do \nthat.\n  That has now happened. It was only through that effort that we were \nable to get this far. And I think it is fair to say both sides have \nbeen working in good faith to bring us to this point.\n  So there is really two questions here. No. 1, is it within the right \nof the majority leader to amend his legislation as he has proposed to \ndo? And clearly he is within his rights to do that. The real question \nis, Is it in keeping with what we have established as the working order \nhere? Are we in the same kind of partnership that we thought we had all \nthe way through this process as we moved procedurally to the floor?\n  The answer clearly is no; this was a surprise. Senator Hollings has \nbeen in the meetings discussing what would go in the managers' \namendment until at least 4 o'clock this afternoon. Senator Hollings, \nthe administration and others have signed off on every single piece of \nwhat was to go into the managers' amendment.\n  I just left the floor to check with the administration to see if they \nknew that this was in the managers' amendment, and the answer was \nemphatically no. No one told them this was going to be included. No one \ngave them any indication.\n  So clearly we start this debate with a very serious misunderstanding \nand a very serious violation of good faith. It is within the right of \nthe majority to take steps of this kind, but, unfortunately, it comes \nat a price. That price is the cooperation needed to complete our work. \nThe price is coming to terms with all the other procedural questions we \nhave to face.\n  How is it possible to get unanimous consent under these \ncircumstances? How is it possible to get any understanding about the \ndegree to which we can agree on amendments with this problem?\n  So, Mr. President, we have compounded the problem this afternoon, \nunnecessarily it seems to me. The majority leader has a job to do. He \nhas to make choices, and I understand that. But I hope as those choices \nare made, we clearly demonstrate the appreciation for the kind of \ncommunication that is going to be absolutely essential if we get \nanything done at all. I hope we can work through this. I hope before \nthe night is out, or at the very latest tomorrow morning, we can \nresolve this matter, because if we are going to move forward \nadequately, successfully, it has to be resolved. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Is there objection?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. President, there is not any question about the majority leader's \nright to proceed as he does and make that request. But he only does \nthat with the majority vote of the Commerce Committee. That is the \ndismaying thing to this particular Senator, because when you meet as \nthe ranking member, you represent not only yourself but the committee \nmembers and other Senators interested, of course, in the tobacco \nfarmer. And you are not just wanting to assure yourself. You are \nwanting to assure others you represent because they are constantly \nasking these questions. So everyone, the White House, the health \ncommunity, everyone now has gotten in step as of 4 o'clock on the LEAF \nAct, and to come now with this procedure and say they have the \nmajority, which would include the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, is a shocking surprise to me. I can tell you that right now \nbecause I have been with him. I got with him only on this \nunderstanding. And to come now and put the LEAF Act in jeopardy with \nthis particular procedure, I just had to stand up here and register my \nobjection.\n  Now, I don't want to object in a silly fashion to the printing, so I \nwill withhold it, but the bipartisanship is ended.\n  Mr. ROTH. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the majority leader's \nrequest is agreed to.\n  (The committee substitute, as modified to incorporate the text of \namendment No. 2420, will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to make a parliamentary inquiry on \nbehalf of my distinguished ranking member, Senator Moynihan, and \nmyself, as chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  The Senate has before it a modification to the Commerce Committee \nsubstitute and Finance Committee amendment to S. 1415, the National \nTobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act. If the modification \nwere introduced as a bill, would it be referred to the Finance \nCommittee?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it will.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, further parliamentary inquiry----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it would.\n  Mr. ROTH. The modification contains settlement payments and health \nfees. Is it true that these provisions, no matter how they are \ndesignated, are revenue measures, and, thus, within the jurisdiction of \nthe Finance Committee?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, Senator Moynihan and myself would like to \nnote for the record that the modification of the Commerce Committee \nsubstitute violates Rule 15 of the Standing\n\n[[Page S5005]]\n\nRules of the Senate. Neither Senator Moynihan nor I will raise the \npoint of order because, even if we did raise the point of order, the \nleaders or managers could accomplish the same result by offering the \nidentical text as a floor amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record. This material is the technical explanation that \ndescribes the amendments made by the Committee on Finance to S. 1415, \nas reported by the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF FINANCE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT TO S. 1415 (AS \n                       APPROVED ON MAY 14, 1998)\n\n            I. Tobacco Excise Tax and Trust Fund Provisions\n\n\n              A. Present-Law Tax and Trust Fund Provisions\n\n       Excise taxes on tobacco products. Excise taxes imposed on \n     cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco and snuff, pipe tobacco, \n     and cigarette papers and tubes (Code sec. 5701). In addition, \n     tax will be extended to ``roll-your-own tobacco'' at the same \n     rates as pipe tobacco, effective on January 1, 2000. These \n     taxes are imposed upon removal of the taxable tobacco \n     products by the manufacturer, or on importation into the \n     United States.\\1\\ The current tax rates are shown in the \n     table below:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Footnotes appear at end of article.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Tobacco product                         Tax rate            \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCigarettes:                                                             \n  Small cigarettes\\2\\.................  $12.00 per thousand (24 cents   \n                                         per pack of 20 cigarettes).    \n  Large cigarettes....................  $25.20 per thousand.            \nCigars:                                                                 \n  Small cigars........................  $1.125 per thousand.            \n  Large cigars........................  12.75% of manufacturer's price, \n                                         up to $30 per thousand.        \nChewing tobacco.......................  $0.12 per pound.                \nSnuff.................................  $0.36 per pound.                \nPipe tobacco..........................  $0.675 per pound.               \nCigarette papers......................  $0.0075 per 50 papers.          \nCigarette tubes.......................  $0.15 per 50 tubes.             \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Effective on January 1, 2000, the tax rate on small \n     cigarettes is scheduled to increase by $5 per thousand (to 34 \n     cents per pack of 20 small cigarettes), and the tax rates on \n     other taxable tobacco products are scheduled to increase by \n     proportionate amounts. Effective on January 1, 2002, a \n     further increase of $2.50 per thousand (to 39 cents per pack \n     of 20 small cigarettes) is scheduled to become effective. \n     (Tax rates on other taxable tobacco products will increase \n     proportionately on that date as well.)\n       Generally, excise taxes on tobacco products that are \n     removed during any semimonthly period must be paid by the \n     14th day after the last day of such semimonthly \n     period. Late payment of tobacco excise taxes is subject to \n     interest charges and penalties in the same manner as the late \n     payment of other types of taxes. In addition, a failure to \n     pay penalty equal to 5 percent of the tax due, but unpaid, is \n     assessed under section 5761(b).\n       Revenues from the current tobacco products excise taxes are \n     deposited in the General Fund of the Treasury.\n       Tobacco occupational excise tax. An annual excise tax of \n     $1,000 per premise generally is imposed on manufacturers of \n     tobacco products, manufacturers of cigarette papers and \n     tubes, and export warehouse proprietors (Code sec. 5731). The \n     occupational tax is $500 per premise for taxpayers with \n     annual gross receipts less than $500,000. Revenues from the \n     occupational tax are deposited in the General Fund of the \n     Treasury.\n       Penaly excise taxes. In addition to excise taxes imposed \n     primarily to raise revenue, the Internal Revenue Code (the \n     ``Code'') includes several excise taxes imposed as \n     ``penalties'' for taking (or failing to take) certain \n     required actions. Examples of these excise taxes include \n     taxes on excess lobbying expenditures by charitable \n     organizations, certain ``self-dealing'' activities by \n     officers and others involved with private foundations, \n     failures by private foundations to distribute required \n     percentages of income, and numerous regulatory excise taxes \n     imposed with respect to specified activities of qualified \n     pension plans. Present law does not establish any underage \n     smoking reduction goals or impose any penalty excise tax with \n     respect to such goals.\n       Overview of Internal Revenue Code Trust Funds. Most Trust \n     Funds that are financed with dedicated excise tax revenues \n     are established in the Code (secs 9501 et. seq.). Examples of \n     these Trust Funds are the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, the \n     Highway Trust Fund, the Black Lung Trust Fund, the Aquatic \n     Resources Trust Fund, the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, the \n     Hazardous Substance Superfund, the Leaking Underground \n     Storage Tank Trust Fund and the Oil Spill Liability Trust \n     Fund. Each of these Trust Funds includes provisions \n     dedicating specified revenues to the Trust Fund and \n     provisions approving expenditure purposes of the Trust Fund \n     (generally as those purposes are in effect on the date of \n     enactment of specific authorizing legislation). The Code also \n     contains general provisions relating to the management of \n     these Trust Funds. In general, Trust Fund expenditures are \n     subject to the annual appropriations process. Under present \n     law, there is no Federal trust fund relating to tobacco taxes \n     and spending programs.\n\n\nb. description of finance committee amendment relating to tobacco taxes \n                             and trust fund\n\n       Increase in tobacco products excise tax rates. In lieu of \n     the payments (including the initial $10 billion payment) \n     required of tobacco manufacturers under S. 1415, as reported \n     by the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n     (the ``Commerce Committee''), the current Federal excise tax \n     rate on small cigarettes is increased by $1.50 per pack of 20 \n     small cigarettes. The tax rates on all other taxable tobacco \n     products are increased proportionately to the increases \n     specified for small cigarettes. In addition, the effective \n     date for imposition of tax on ``roll-your-own'' tobacco is \n     accelerated from January 1, 2000, to January 1, 1999. Each of \n     these rate increases will be phased-in ratably over a three-\n     year period (calender years 1999, 2000, and 2001). Thus, for \n     example, the tax rate on small cigarettes will increase by 50 \n     cents per pack of 20 cigarettes on January 1, 1999, by an \n     additional 50 cents per pack on January 1, 2000, and by an \n     additional 50 cents per pack on January 1, 2001. (These \n     increases are in addition to the rate increases currently \n     scheduled to take effect in 2001 and 2003.)\n       On each January 1 beginning in calendar year 2002, all \n     tobacco excise tax rates will be adjusted for inflation, as \n     measured by changes in the CPI occurring during the 12-month \n     period ending on the preceding August 31.\n       Floor stocks taxes comparable to those imposed when tobacco \n     excise tax rates previously have been increased will be \n     imposed on each tax increase date. Floor stocks taxes must be \n     paid no later than July 1 of the year of tax increase.\n       As stated above in the description of present law, the \n     current tobacco products excise taxes apply to tobacco \n     products manufactured in, or imported into, the United \n     States. Solely for purposes of these increased tax amounts, \n     the term United States includes U.S. possessions as well as \n     the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Accordingly, no \n     amount of the increase will be covered-over to U.S. \n     possessions under Code section 7652.\n       Further, the effective date of certain compliance \n     provisions relating to exported cigarettes is accelerated \n     from January 1, 2000, to January 1, 1999.\n       Impose penalty excise tax for failure to meet underage \n     smoking reducing goals. Both the National Tobacco Proposed \n     Resolution (the ``Proposed Resolution'') and S. 1415, as \n     reported by the Commerce Committee, would establish goals for \n     the reduction of underage smoking and would impose lookback \n     ``surcharges'' or ``assessments'' on tobacco manufacturers if \n     these goals are not met. In lieu of the lookback surcharges \n     or assessments, the Finance Committee amendment imposes a \n     non-deductible penalty excise tax on all manufacturers and \n     importers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.\n       All manufacturers and importers of cigarettes and smokeless \n     tobacco are subject to the penalty excise tax. Imposition of \n     this penalty excise tax is governed by the smoking reduction \n     goals and imposed at the rates specified in S. 1415, as \n     reported by the Commerce Committee. In addition, the Finance \n     Committee amendment provides that the determination of \n     whether underage smoking goals are met is determined under \n     rules prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury (in \n     consultation with the Public Health Service). Beginning in \n     that year, the Secretary of the Treasury is directed to \n     publish by February 15 of each calendar year the amount of \n     tax allocated to each cigarette and smokeless tobacco \n     manufacturer and importer based on their prior year's excise \n     tax liability.\n       The penalty excise tax is payable in full no later than \n     April 1 of each calendar year. Cigarette manufacturers and \n     importers are jointly and severally liable for payment of \n     this tax imposed with respect to cigarettes as provided in \n     the Proposed Resolution and S. 1415, as reported by the \n     Commerce Committee. Smokeless tobacco manufacturers and \n     importers similarly are jointly and severally liable for \n     payment of tax attributable to smokeless tobacco. Other Code \n     administrative and enforcement provisions applicable to \n     excise taxes generally apply to this tax.\n       Deletion of Federal requirements relating to ``pass \n     through'' of payments. The provisions in S. 1415, as reported \n     by the Commerce Committee, requiring that tobacco \n     manufacturers use their best efforts to pass through to \n     consumers the amount of any payments on a per unit basis are \n     deleted.\n       Deletion or modification of miscellaneous ``fees'' \n     contained in S. 1415. The provisions of S. 1415, as reported \n     by the Commerce Committee, that impose separate ``fees'' to \n     support the Tobacco Community Revitalization Trust Fund \n     programs, the ``fees'' and operative Trust Fund provisions \n     related to international tobacco control, the ``fees'' and \n     ``assessments'' on nonparticipating manufacturers, the \n     Tobacco Asbestos Trust Fund and related programmatic \n     provisions, the Compliance Bonus Fund, and the provision \n     relating to child care and early childhood development \n     spending are deleted from the bill.\n       The Finance Committee amendment provides that, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, all charges or \n     user fees imposed under the titles of the bill other than the \n     revenue title must be set in amounts that recover only costs \n     attributable to providing services to the party paying the \n     fees (i.e.,\n\n[[Page S5006]]\n\n     must be true, or cost-based, user fees rather than disguised \n     taxes).\n       Establishment of National Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund. In \n     lieu of the multiple separate Trust Funds provided for under \n     the Commerce Committee titles of S. 1415, as reported, a \n     National Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund (the ``Tobacco \n     Trust Fund'') is established in the Treasury Department \n     pursuant to provisions enacted into the Trust Fund \n     provisions of the Code. Amounts equal to the net revenues \n     \\4\\ from the changes made by the Finance Committee \n     amendment are to be deposited in the Tobacco Trust \n     Fund.\\5\\ The Tobacco Trust Fund further will receive \n     amounts equal to all penalties imposed under S. 1415.\n       Amounts in the Tobacco Trust Fund generally are available \n     for expenditure as provided in subsequently enacted \n     appropriations Acts.\\6\\\n       Amounts in the Tobacco Trust Fund are available for \n     expenditure for the programs provided in S. 1415, as those \n     programs are in effect on the date of the bill's enactment.\n       The Tobacco Trust Fund includes a separate account, the \n     State Tobacco Settlement Account (the ``State Account''), to \n     administer distribution of Trust Fund monies to States. The \n     State Account will receive revenues equal to 30 percent of \n     the net revenues produced by the increases in tobacco taxes \n     during the five calendar years, 1999 through 2003. In \n     calendar year 2004 and thereafter, this percentage will \n     increase to 45 percent. These revenues are not available to \n     finance any other Trust Fund expenditure purposes. States are \n     eligible for payments from the State Account and the Tobacco \n     Trust Fund generally only if they waive their rights to any \n     future payments under State settlements with the tobacco \n     manufacturers or importers.\n       Each State is eligible to receive the portion of the monies \n     in the State Account shown in the table entitled \n     ``Distribution of Funds to States'' below, except the States \n     of Mississippi, Florida, Texas, and Minnesota are guaranteed \n     that amounts those States receive will not be less than the \n     amounts they would have received under their previously \n     negotiated settlements with the tobacco companies, determined \n     on a year-by-year basis.\n       In general, there are no requirements or restrictions on \n     the use of funds appropriated to the States from the Tobacco \n     Trust Fund; however, the Finance Committee amendment \n     clarifies that the Medicaid cost recovery provisions apply to \n     States that use Tobacco Trust Fund payments in their Medicaid \n     programs. Cost recovery is waived for States that use the \n     Tobacco Trust Fund for other purposes.\n       Provisions further are included ensuring that no tax \n     revenues are deposited into the Tobacco Trust Fund if any \n     monies are spent other than as authorized under these \n     provisions.\n       General administrative provisions applicable to Code Trust \n     Funds apply to the Tobacco Trust Fund, except no interest \n     would accrue on unspent balances in the Tobacco Trust Fund. \n     As with other Code Trust Funds, the Tobacco Trust Fund is not \n     permitted to borrow from the General Fund.\n\n                     DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS TO STATES                    \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                           State                              Percentage\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama....................................................        1.237\nAlaska.....................................................        0.400\nArizona....................................................        1.709\nArkansas...................................................        0.954\nCalifornia.................................................        8.695\nColorado...................................................        0.990\nConnecticut................................................        1.548\nDelaware...................................................        0.400\nD.C........................................................        0.474\nFlorida....................................................        4.768\nGeorgia....................................................        2.735\nHawaii.....................................................        0.800\nIdaho......................................................        0.400\nIllinois...................................................        3.930\nIndiana....................................................        1.490\nIowa.......................................................        0.932\nKansas.....................................................        0.800\nKentucky...................................................        1.664\nLouisiana..................................................        1.723\nMaine......................................................        0.800\nMaryland...................................................        1.425\nMassachusetts..............................................        3.802\nMichigan...................................................        3.586\nMinnesota..................................................        1.246\nMississippi................................................        1.701\nMissouri...................................................        1.701\nMontana....................................................        0.400\nNebraska...................................................        0.400\nNevada.....................................................        0.400\nNew Hampshire..............................................        0.400\nNew Jersey.................................................        3.755\nNew Mexico.................................................        0.800\nNew York...................................................       12.812\nNorth Carolina.............................................        1.977\nNorth Dakota...............................................        0.400\nOhio.......................................................        4.205\nOklahoma...................................................        0.800\nOregon.....................................................        1.353\nPennsylvania...............................................        4.421\nRhode Island...............................................        0.800\nSouth Carolina.............................................        1.090\nSouth Dakota...............................................        0.400\nTennessee..................................................        2.851\nTexas......................................................        5.930\nUtah.......................................................        0.400\nVermont....................................................        0.400\nVirginia...................................................        1.348\nWashington.................................................        1.726\nWest Virginia..............................................        0.782\nWisconsin..................................................        1.841\nWyoming....................................................        0.400\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                          II. Trade Provisions\n\n       1. Section 1107--Ban on distribution of tobacco products \n     produced by child labor. The Finance Committee amendment to \n     Section 1107 clarifies that the amendment to Section 307 of \n     the Tariff Act of 1930 contained in S. 1415 applies to \n     imports of tobacco products produced by forced or indentured \n     child labor.\n       2. Section 1133--Limits on the authority to promote the \n     exportation of tobacco. The Finance Committee amendment \n     codifies current policy set out in the Departments of \n     Commerce, Justice and State, the Judiciary and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998, which prohibits any \n     officer, employee, department or agency of the United States \n     from promoting the sale or export of tobacco products, or \n     from seeking the removal of nondiscriminatory barriers to \n     trade in tobacco. The Finance Committee amendment clarifies \n     that ministerial or clerical functions, such as the \n     collection of export documents by Customs Service officials \n     upon export through a U.S. port, would not constitute \n     promotion of the sale or export of tobacco products within \n     the meaning of section 1133. The Finance Committee clarifies \n     further that United States Trade Representative (USTR) \n     retains the authority to seek redress from discriminatory \n     barriers to U.S. market access, with the proviso that USTR \n     must consult with the Department of Health and Human Services \n     prior to taking such action. Finally, in the Committee's \n     view, nothing in section 1133 should be construed to prohibit \n     the reduction of tariffs or other trade barriers through \n     comprehensive trade negotiations that incidentally include \n     tobacco products, provided that such reductions are not \n     primarily directed at reducing tariffs or trade restraints on \n     tobacco products.\n       3. Section 1134--Report on impact on U.S. international \n     obligations. The Finance Committee amendment strikes Section \n     1134 from the bill.\n       4. Section 1145--Anti-smuggling provisions/prohibition on \n     imports except under a permit. The Finance Committee \n     amendment ensures that the bill imposes identical permit \n     requirements on persons engaged in the production or \n     marketing of tobacco products, regardless of the country or \n     origin of the product and irrespective of their role in the \n     distribution chain, whether through the manufacture, import, \n     sale, distribution or warehousing of tobacco products. The \n     Finance Committee amendment clarifies that the legislation \n     does not create a separate import licensing regime for \n     imports. The legislation does not affect the administration \n     of tariff rate quotas the United States currently imposes on \n     imports of tobacco and manufactured tobacco.\n       5. Section 1147--Ships stores, duty-free shops, and foreign \n     trade zones. The Finance Committee amendment would permit the \n     continued use of duty-free stores and foreign trade zones for \n     the import, sale, manufacture, distribution, and export of \n     tobacco products, provided that such activities comply with \n     all applicable U.S. laws relating to the import, sale, \n     distribution and/or marking of tobacco products in the \n     customs territory of the United States, including \n     restrictions on sales to minors. The Finance Committee \n     amendment would also prohibit the importation of tobacco or \n     tobacco products previously sold for export and exempt from \n     excise tax as ships stores or in duty-free shops.\n\n    III. Elimination of Limitation on Medicaid Coverage of Smoking \n                            Cessation Agents\n\n       Under the committee amendment, states will not be allowed \n     to exclude from coverage or restrict agents when used to \n     promote smoking cessation. States will maintain the authority \n     to exclude from coverage or restrict nonprescription drugs \n     when used to promote smoking cessation.\n\n                  IV. Mastectomy Health Care Provision\n\n\n                             a. present law\n\n       Under present law, group health plans must meet certain \n     requirements with respect to limitations on exclusions of \n     preexisting conditions and must not discriminate against \n     individuals based on health status. An excise tax of $100 per \n     day during the period of noncompliance is imposed on the \n     employer sponsoring the plan if the plan fails to meet these \n     requirements. The maximum tax that can be imposed during \n     taxable year cannot exceed the lesser of 10 percent of the \n     employer's group health plan expenses for the prior year or \n     $500,000. No tax is imposed if the Secretary determines that \n     the employer did not know, and exercising reasonable \n     diligence would not have known, that the failure existed.\n\n\n             b. description of finance committee amendment\n\n       The Finance Committee amendment requires that certain group \n     health plans satisfy two additional requirements: (1) provide \n     for impatient coverage with respect to the treatment of \n     breast cancer, and (2) provide inpatient coverage for \n     reconstructive surgery following mastectomies. Failure to \n     comply with these requirements would result in the same \n     exercise tax applicable to failure to comply with the \n     limitations on exclusions of preexisting conditions and \n     discriminating against individuals based on health status.\n       The amendment requires a group health plan that provides \n     medical and surgical benefits to ensure that inpatient \n     coverage with respect to the treatment of breast cancer is \n     provided for a period of time as determined by the attending \n     physician to be medically appropriate following: (1) a \n     mastectomy; (2) a lumpectomy; or (3) a lymph node dissection \n     for the treatment of breast cancer.\n       The amendment requires a group health plan that provides \n     medical and surgical benefits with respect to a mastectomy to \n     ensure that, in a case in which a mastectomy patient elect \n     breast reconstruction, coverage is provided for: (1) all \n     stages of reconstruction\n\n[[Page S5007]]\n\n     of the breast on which the mastectomy has been performed; (2) \n     surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to produce a \n     symmetrical appearance; and (3) the costs of prostheses and \n     complications of mastectomy including lymphodemas, in the \n     manner determined by the attending physician and the patient \n     to be appropriate.\n       The amendment requires a group health plan to provide \n     notice to all participants and beneficiaries under the plan \n     of the inpatient coverage available with respect to the \n     treatment of breast cancer and reconstructive surgery \n     following mastectomies.\n       The amendment does not pre-empt any State law in effect on \n     the date of enactment with respect to health insurance \n     coverage that: (1) requires coverage for a minimum length of \n     hospital stay following a surgical treatment for breast \n     cancer; (2) requires coverage of at least the coverage of \n     reconstructive breast surgery required under the proposal; or \n     (3) requires coverage for breast cancer treatments (including \n     breast reconstruction) in accordance with scientific \n     evidence-based practices or guidelines recommended by \n     established medical associations.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ The term United States includes the 50 States and the \n     District of Columbia.\n     \\2\\ A significant majority of taxable cigarettes, and of \n     taxable tobacco products, is small cigarettes.\n     \\3\\ These rules may be, but are not required to be, based on \n     the University of Michigan's National High School Drug Use \n     Survey, ``Monitoring the Future'' (the specified source under \n     the Proposed Resolution and S. 1415, as reported by the \n     Commerce Committee.\n     \\4\\ The term ``net revenues'' means the gross payments \n     received less an income tax offset.\n     \\5\\ These amounts would be reduced by any refunds of tax \n     previously paid that were properly allocable to revenues \n     deposited into the Tobacco Trust Fund.\n     \\6\\ As reported by the Commerce Committee, S. 1415 provides \n     that spending for certain programs is to be direct spending. \n     This provision in the Finance Committee amendment supersedes \n     those direct spending provisions (except in the case of \n     amounts deposited into the State Account, described below, \n     and S. 1415's provisions for payments to tobacco farmers).\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I concur in the judgment of our \ndistinguished chairman on the important question of the jurisdiction of \nthe Committee on Finance and I thank him for insisting that it be made \nclear for the record, as indeed has been done thanks to the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, S. 1415, the tobacco legislation now before the \nSenate, was ordered referred to the Committee on Finance on May 13, \n1998. It was so referred because the Senate Parliamentarian determined \nthat the bill is in the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. That \naction preserved the jurisdiction over tax legislation for which the \nFinance Committee has been responsible for 181 years.\n  The Record should be clear that this is indeed a tax bill. The \nParliamentarian has so determined; the Joint Committee on Taxation has \nconcurred.\n  One may refer to certain provisions of this legislation as ``annual \npayments,'' ``lookback assessments,'' or ``fees,'' but they are taxes. \nAs Richard Cardinal Cushing said, ``When I see a bird that walks like a \nduck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a \nduck.'' Call it whatever you like, but this bill raises taxes on \ntobacco, and we're not fooling anybody to suggest otherwise.\n  And as I have said, taxes have been the jurisdiction of the Committee \non Finance for going on two centuries now. In the case of excise taxes, \nwhich figure prominently in this bill, the Finance Committee's \njurisdiction has been recognized since 1817, the year after the \nCommittee was established. That was the 14th Congress. George W. \nCampbell of Tennessee, was Chairman; Senator Rufus King, of New York, \nwas Ranking Member.\n  Likewise our jurisdiction over income taxes has been recognized since \nthe first income tax was enacted in 1861. And the Standing Rules of the \nSenate have explicitly provided for our jurisdiction over ``revenue \nmeasures generally''--tax bills--since 1946, the year that the \njurisdictions of all Senate Committees were first set forth in the \nRules. I might add that our jurisdiction over international trade \nmatters, which also arise in this bill, is equally clear and equally \nlongstanding.\n  Our revered Chairman, Senator Roth, last week insisted--with the full \nsupport of our Committee Members--that this legislation be considered \nby the Finance Committee before it went to the floor. It was referred \nto us on Wednesday, and we marked it up on Thursday. The vote to report \nfavorably the Finance Committee amendments was 13-6.\n  The Finance Committee made several important improvements to the \nbill. First, we converted the assorted ``payments'' and ``assessments'' \nto taxes. Second, we approved an increase of $1.50 per pack in the tax \non tobacco, to be phased in over three years. Third, we struck from the \nbill a tax on exports that was a clear violation of Article I, Section \n9 of the U.S. Constitution. And finally, we adopted an amendment by \nSenator D'Amato to require that health plans provide coverage for \nminimum hospital stays and reconstructive surgery associated with the \ntreatment of breast cancer.\n  Some of these changes have now been included in the pending Commerce \nCommittee substitute. Owning to the parliamentary situation, some of \nthe other Finance Committee amendments will require separate votes. But \nthanks to our Chairman, the essential point has been made; the \njurisdiction of the Committee on Finance has been preserved and \naffirmed.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that there be \na period for the transaction of routine morning business until 8 p.m., \nwith Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri is not \nrecognized for suggesting the absence of a quorum, is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona does not lose the \nfloor when he makes a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you. Mr. President, the Senate will now take up the \nNational Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act (S. 1415). Six \nweeks ago, the Senate Commerce Committee approved this measure by an \noverwhelming vote of 19-1.\n  I want to thank the Majority Leader and Senator Daschle, and all \nSenators for allowing this bill to come to the floor. Thanks to the \nwork of so many people including the medical community, especially Dr. \nKoop, Dr. Kessler; the attorneys general, and so many of our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle over many years, Congress has a rare and \nhistoric opportunity to put an end to what the American Medical \nAssociation calls a ``pediatric epidemic.''\n  Mr. President tobacco is a legal product that adults may acquire if \nthey choose to do so. Under this bill it will remain so. But the \nwidespread use of tobacco in this country presents a problem every \nresponsible adult would concede will not go away on its own.\n  Three thousand American children take up the smoking habit every day. \nFor one thousand of them the decision will prove to be fatal. Those \nchildren will be among the 460,000 Americans a year who die early--\nsubstantially early--from smoking related disease including cancer, \nemphysema, stroke and heart disease. Warnings about the lethal effect \nof tobacco have not discouraged juvenile smoking. Sadly, the Center for \nDisease Control reports that teen smoking is on the rise today.\n  In recent years, we have learned how callously indifferent tobacco \ncompanies are to the loss and suffering their product causes. We have \nlearned how tobacco companies will undermine any public good if it \nserves their commercial interests. We have learned that nothing, not \neven the health of children, is off limits to tobacco companies if it \nserves their bottom line. What profits the nation is a matter of no \nconsequence to tobacco companies if it does not profit them.\n  Mr. President, we have learned that the tobacco companies, well aware \nthat kids make up the vast majority of their ``replacement'' market \nhave, for years, intentionally and systematically targeted children in \ntheir marketing and advertising--kids as young as 13 years old, and \neven younger.\n  The disclosure of truckloads of internal industry documents have \nexposed once and for all the appallingly malicious lie that tobacco \nexecutives have for years sworn, often under oath, to be true--that \nthey do not market to children.\n  They not only have marketed to children, they have thrived on it. And \nI am\n\n[[Page S5008]]\n\nentirely confident that they will continue to do so unless we who are \nelected to protect the national interest, stand up, at long last, to \nthe tobacco interests. That is what this legislation is intended to do.\n  Studies show that children are particularly susceptible to the \nindustry's marketing pitches. So effective have these companies been at \nappealing to youth, many children can identify Joe Camel as readily as \nthey do Barney or cartoon characters.\n  We have come to learn that as part of their strategy to hook kids \nearly, at any cost, tobacco companies manipulated nicotine levels to \nenhance its addictive qualities; engaged in sham medical research; \nquashed information about the danger and addictiveness of tobacco; \nabused the nation's laws to cloak their activities and lied to Congress \nand the American people.\n  Tobacco companies have long hoped that money, in the form of campaign \ncontributions, would enable them to maintain the status quo, and \ninsulate them from the consequences of their actions. For too long, I \nfear, they have been right.\n  We are all too familiar with the influence of tobacco money. I appeal \nto my colleagues, now is the time to stop tobacco companies from buying \npolitical indulgence of their intentional sacrifice of our children to \nthe imperatives of preserving a market for their product.\n  It is illegal for children to purchase tobacco in every state in the \ncountry. And in every state in the country, tobacco companies have \ninvested enormous sums of money and time to encourage widespread law \nbreaking.\n  Now is the time to put an end to it. And, Mr. President, now is also \nthe time to stop the endless drain on taxpayers, which amounts to an \nannual tax of $50 billion imposed on taxpayers to underwrite tobacco \nrelated health care costs--an estimated $1.7 trillion over the life of \nthis bill.\n  Over the past 3 weeks, the tobacco companies have launched a massive \ncampaign of diversion. Once again, they hope to use their vast \nresources to divert the country from the truth, and to frustrate us in \nour task to defend against the threat they pose to our children. As \nthey have so often in the past, the tobacco companies are lying to all \nof us again, and using their wealth to frighten us all into submission.\n  I would like to quote Dr. C. Everett Koop who said about this \ncampaign.\n\n       When you see the advertising from the tobacco industry \n     consider the source. These people are experts at manipulation \n     and have been lying to the American people for decades.\n\n  Dr. Koop called on all Members of Congress to support tough tobacco \nlegislation. Mr. President, the bill we are presenting to the Senate is \nindeed tough medicine, for a tough problem. Every expert medical \nwitness who has testified before Congress, as well as every living \nSurgeon General has called on Congress to pass tough, comprehensive \ntobacco legislation. The measure we will now consider is exactly that--\ntough, comprehensive legislation.\n  The bill is based on the framework of the June 20th settlement \nbetween the industry and the state attorneys general and contains the \nsix major elements experts agree are essential if we are to stop kids \nfrom smoking.\n  These include restrictions on marketing aimed at youth; stronger \nyouth access prohibitions; deterrant price increases; regulatory \noversight of tobacco ingredients; and counteradvertising campaigns to \neducate youth.\n  I would like to address each of these in greater detail. First, like \nthe June 20th settlement, the bill imposes advertising restrictions to \neliminate marketing appeals to youth. The bill would implement the FDA \nrules banning tobacco billboard and outdoor advertising around schools, \nplaygrounds and other areas frequented by children.\n  It would restrict point-of-sale advertising to ensure that cigarette \npitches aren't directed at children and would require bold new warning \nlabels on cigarette packaging.\n  Second, as contemplated in the June 20th agreement, the bill will \nraise cigarette prices sufficient to deter youth consumption. Experts \nsay the most important step to deter youth consumption is a substantial \nhike in the price of tobacco products. I want to say that again, Mr. \nPresident. Experts say the most important step to deter youth \nconsumption is a substantial hike in the price of tobacco products.\n  The Centers for Disease Control reports that smoking less than 100 \ncigarettes can result in clinical addiction, and that higher pricing is \nessential to deter underage use. Accordingly, the bill would increase \nthe price per pack of cigarettes by a minimum of $1.10 over five years \nwith a commensurate rise in the price of smokeless tobacco. The \nadministration believes that this hike, included in the President's \nbudget request, would cut youth consumption in half.\n\n  Three, the bill establishes the same youth smoking reduction targets \nagreed to by the industry last summer. Four and one-half million \nunderage Americans use tobacco and the number is growing. The bill \ncalls for a 60 percent reduction in youth consumption within 10 years \nand levies heavy financial assessments on the industry if they are not \nachieved. Tobacco companies have skillfully determined how to induce \nkids to smoke. With ample motivation they can apply those skills to \nhelp reverse their handiwork.\n  Four, stronger enforcement of youth access rules. While smoking by \nminors is prohibited in every state, kids continue to buy tobacco. The \nbill would require retailers to be licensed by the state and card \ntobacco purchasers in the same manner as alcohol sales. And it requires \nthat tobacco products be stored in areas inaccessible to youth. In \naddition, the bill would ban cigarette sales from vending machines, a \nmajor conduit of tobacco products to kids. all of these restrictions \nwere part of last year's settlement.\n  Five, cigarette ingredient regulation. Cigarettes contain numerous \nactive ingredients harmful to health including nicotine, tar and \nammonia. Evidence suggests that the tobacco industry has manipulated \nthese ingredients to enhance their addictive qualities, and in some \ninstances added benign substances such as molasses to sweeten the taste \nfor introductory users, which is how the industry refers to children.\n  The bill would permit the FDA to oversee and regulate tobacco \nproducts to protect public health, and promote the development of safer \ncigarettes. In rulemaking two years ago, FDA asserted authority over \ntobacco under its existing ``drug device powers.'' This bill, thanks to \nthe Presiding Officer, Senator Frist--Dr. Frist establishes basically \nthe same authorities, but in a separate and distinct chapter of law \nthat addresses tobacco products only.\n  The legislation, however, imposes several important checks on the FDA \nauthority. Any ban on nicotine or class of tobacco product could not go \ninto effect for two years, enabling Congress market potential of any \nmodification to cigarettes that would push smokers to contraband.\n  Again, the attorneys general, in their agreement with the industry \ncalled for greater FDA oversight of tobacco.\n  Six, the bill provides funding for smoking prevention and cessation \nprograms; counter-advertising campaigns, and vital health research. \nThese initiatives are financed by annual payments made by the industry.\n  Smoking related health care costs exceed $50 billion per year. The \nbill would require the industry to pay $526 billion over the next 25 \nyears to reimburse taxpayers for costs to Medicare and state health \ncare programs. Last summer's agreement called on the industry to pay \n$368.5 billion. This would have raised the price per pack of cigarettes \nby $68 cents over 5 years, an amount public health authorities found \ninsufficient to effect youth usage. And the sums would not have been \nsufficient to pay for assistance to farmers, who were left out of last \nyear's agreement by the industry.\n  Finally, the bill would place a cap on the tobacco industry's yearly \nliability exposure without barring any individual or group's ability to \nsue or receive compensation. The tobacco industry has successfully \nfended off lawsuits for years. However, the trend is changing and as \nmassive new judgments are awarded against the tobacco industry, \nbankruptcy is always a possibility.\n  Experts agree that bankruptcy is an undesirable outcome for the \nnation economically, legally and medically. Involving bankruptcy would \npermit the industry to shield themselves from\n\n[[Page S5009]]\n\ntheir financial responsibilities including compensation to victims. \nWhen the asbestos companies went bankrupt and left a financial and \nlegal mess that is still with us, only the lawyers made out. Moreover, \nthe extinction of domestic manufacturers would simply push tobacco \nusers to foreign brands or unregulated contraband which would \nconstitute a public health crisis.\n  We have heard many opinions about whether the industry will submit to \nthis legislation. Legal challenges, of course, would delay reforms, so \nindustry cooperation would be advantageous. While, according to public \nhealth authorities, price hikes are essential, they, alone, won't do \nthe job. The proposed advertising restrictions and youth usage \npenalties, which industry is threatening to challenge, are also \nessential parts of the solution.\n  The National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act, however, \nwas never intended to be a ``deal'' with the tobacco industry. Our \nmission was to pass the best possible legislation to stop children from \nsmoking.\n  As I said, tobacco is a legal product and the decision to use it, \nthough risky, is a choice for adults to make. Nevertheless, the Nation \nrequires that the tobacco industry join us in the fight to protect our \nchildren. If they choose not to, the American people will respond \naccordingly, Congress will act, and the States will resume their \nlawsuits to extract in court what we might more efficiently achieve \nthrough cooperation.\n  Mr. President, we sent a modification to the bill to the desk in the \nform of a committee substitute. I would like to take a moment to \nexplain how it would modify the bill as passed by the committee.\n  First, the amendment addresses the concern expressed by some that the \nbill was too ``bureaucratic.'' Although the bulk of the panels and \nboards were temporary, advisory and entailed little or no additional \nfederal costs, and the majority were contemplated in the June 20th \nAgreement, the Committee substitute eliminates all but three: an unpaid \nScientific advisory board at FDA to help assess lower risk tobacco \nproducts; a part time board to help formulate counter-advertising \nstrategies; and a three judge panel to assess attorney client privilege \nclaims.\n  Second, all receipts and disbursements under the act are routed \nthrough a single, on-budget, trust fund operated by the Secretary of \nthe Treasury. The amendment eliminates, the role of special trustees; \nthe international trust fund, the farmers trust fund as well as the \nasbestos trust funds and associated trustees. All funding under the act \nwill come from the single Tobacco trust.\n  Third, the amendment toughens enforcement against contraband \nsmuggling by requiring that manufacturers and wholesalers be licensed; \nthat records be kept for large transactions. These and other anti-\nsmuggling measures were worked out with the administration.\n  Four, the amendment drops certain provisions with respect to \ninternational marketing that had constitutional problems, or were \nviolations of international law. Among the items dropped was the \nspecial licensing fee, the designated trust fund; prohibitions with \nrespect to duty free shops, extra-territorial criminal provisions.\n  Five, the amendment imposes tougher look-back assessments on the \nindustry. The Committee reported bill capped look-back assessments at \n$3.5 billion per year. The amendment raises the ceiling to $4 billion, \nand establishes a company-specific penalty of $1,000 per underage user \nof a particular tobacco brand beyond the target level.\n\n  Six, the amendment modifies the committee bill with respect to second \nhand smoke. Under the bill as reported, states were given the \nopportunity to opt out of the federal program. Under the amendment, \nnegotiated with the White House, state can only opt out if they \nimplement their own program that is as effective in protecting public \nhealth, based on the best available science.\n  Seven, the amendment eliminates the asbestos trust fund. In its place \nthe modification authorizes appropriations from the main fund to assist \nasbestos victims should Congress establish a program to do so.\n  Eight, the amendment ensures that with certain deminimus exceptions, \nall tobacco companies, whether it choses to settle its state cases or \nnot, are responsible for the annual payments to effect the $1.10 price \nincrease.\n  The requirement that non-participating manufacturers pay 150% of the \nannual payment has been dropped. Instead, manufacturers that wish to \nsettle their state cases must pay the upfront payment they agreed to \nlast year, and sign the state protocols binding them to the additional \nrequirements they agreed to with the state attorneys general, including \ntougher advertising and marketing restrictions. In return for agreeing \nto the broader restrictions, and not to challenge their obligations \nunder the protocols, participating companies would receive a yearly \nliability cap of $8 billion.\n  In addition, the committee modification drops several civil liability \nprovisions, including a requirement that civil actions be directed at \nthe tobacco manufacturer not its parent company.\n  Finally, the Committee modification sets out funding parameters for \nthe trust fund.\n  The Joint Committee on Tax anticipates receipts into the trust fund \nof nearly $65 billion over five years. Because the payments are volume \nadjusted, this number could rise or fall depending upon the volume of \ntobacco sales.\n  For this reason, the amendment expresses annual funding in terms of \npercentage of yearly receipts and, except for state funding, places a \ndollar ceiling should receipt exceed expectations. Any amount above the \nceiling would be transferred to the Medicare Trust funds.\n  Under the modifications, the States would receive 40 percent of the \nyearly receipts; health research--22 percent; public health programs--\n22 percent; and farmer assistance--16 percent.\n  The Office of Management and Budget estimates that under this \nprescription, States would receive a total of $26 billion over five \nyears. In a modification agreed to by the National Governors \nAssociation, 50 percent of the state funds--regarded as the federal \nshare of Medicaid recoupment--will be made available to the states for \na menu of purposes, including safe and drug free schools, Child Care \nand Development Block Grants, substance abuse grants and others. As I \nsaid, this menu was agreed to by the National Governors Association.\n  The other half of the State money would have no menu attached and \nwould be used at the sole discretion of the State.\n  Mr. President, I would like to briefly comment on the chief criticism \nof this bill launched by the industry--that it is all about tax and \nspend Government.\n  The industry agreed last summer to pay $368 billion and to submit \nitself to almost every aspect of the legislation we are debating. The \nagreed to increase the price per pack of cigarettes to reduce youth \nconsumption. They agreed to abide by advertising restrictions. They \nagreed to submit themselves to lookback assessments. They agreed to \nenhanced FDA authority over their products. They agreed to stiffer \nyouth access rules and they agreed to open up their documents to the \npublic. And they agreed to finance smoking prevention and cessation \nprograms and health research.\n  Are the measures tougher than they agreed to? Yes, without question.\n  Now because the industry fears that the bill may actually achieve \nwhat it purports to, the effort has been transmuted from enlightened \npublic policy to tax and spend Government.\n  Let us be clear, those who vote against this measure because they \nbelieve it is tax will merely kill the ability to settle State suits \ncollectively and efficiently so that we can move on to the job at \nhand--protecting the health of our kids.\n  If this bill is killed, the States will merely resume their suits, at \ngreat cost in terms of money and time, and the outcome will be the same \nas it has been in Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota. If we take \nthat unwise course, the ultimate prices in cigarettes will be little \ndifferent from what might result from this bill, but we will pay an \nawful price in terms of the 3,000 children a day who will become \nregular users of tobacco and consign themselves to the consequences \nbefore they are adult enough to make that life or death decision.\n  Mr. President, I asserted earlier that tobacco companies have long \nsought\n\n[[Page S5010]]\n\nrefuge in lies. They have lied about the effects of their product and \nabout the strategies they use to market them. They are lying about the \npurposes and effect of the bill we are now considering. They have \nspared no expense to cover their purposes with lies. They have lied, no \nmatter the cost to public health. They have sacrificed the truth and \nour children to their greed. They have lied, because lying has been \nprofitable, Mr. President, because lying worked. No more. No more. The \nlying stops today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman, the \nmanager, for his eloquent comments with respect to the debate that now \nbegins in the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Hollings has asked me to open on behalf of the committee, and \nI do so with great respect for his leadership and his involvement in \nhelping to bring the U.S. Senate to a point where we can engage in this \nconsideration. He continues to fight extraordinarily for what he \nbelieves in very deeply, and particularly, along with the Senator from \nKentucky, for the farmers who may be impacted by this legislation. And \nthat is a fight that we will continue to have over the course of the \ndays ahead.\n  This is not just the opportunity, Mr. President, for a historic \ndebate; it is an extraordinary opportunity for historic action by the \nU.S. Senate.\n  For years, many people across this country have worked hard for this \nmoment. For years, we have waited for the opportunity for the Senate to \nbe able to step up to bat and exercise its responsibility to protect \nthe children of the country. And literally we have the opportunity, \nwhether it is this week, which we hope it might be, or in the next \nweeks, when it might inevitably be, we have the opportunity to act on \nbehalf of the children of this country in a very direct way that expert \nafter expert, Surgeon General after Surgeon General, pediatrician after \npediatrician, cancer specialist after cancer specialist, all have said \nis necessary for the better health policy of our Nation.\n  It is a tribute to the outrage in this country that by now millions \nof Americans understand that 3,000 children will start smoking today \nand will get hooked--some 6,000 will try it, but 3,000 children will \nwind up smoking. And of those, 1,000 of them will die early because of \nthe habit they get that they could not kick. Every American has now \ncome to understand the way in which children have been manipulated, \naggressively marketed to, in order to suck them into this addiction \nwhich ultimately can cost their lives.\n  That is what we are voting on on the floor of the U.S. Senate. That \nis what this debate will be about over the course of the next few days. \nThere is a growing awareness now in America that we lose the lives of \nover 400,000 of our fellow citizens each year because of smoking-\nrelated illnesses--more people than we lost in all of World War II, \nmore people than we lost in all of Vietnam and all of Desert Storm \ncombined. And we lose this every year. And it costs us billions of \ndollars in the health care system of our Nation, in our insurance, in \nthe hospital wards where some people who have no insurance are paid for \nby the rest of their fellow Americans.\n  So this week in the Senate, we are moving beyond the point of simply \narticulating a threat to the children of our country. No one, I think, \nnow disputes the notion that there is harm associated with smoking. And \nnow the U.S. Senate and the Congress need to act with legislation that \ncarries the imprints of both parties, of Senators of both parties, of \nGovernors of both parties, of 44 very tenacious and courageous \nattorneys general. Now is the time to follow through on their efforts.\n  I urge all my colleagues--Democrat, Republican, liberal, \nconservative, no matter what particular passion politically brings them \nto the U.S. Senate--I urge them over the course of the next days to put \naside that partisanship and to try to set aside the inclination to make \nthe perfect the enemy of the very good and to focus today and \nthroughout this week on passing effective legislation that puts \nAmerica's children out of harm's way and secures for the Senate's \nlegacy one of cooperation and accomplishment, something that many \npeople have felt has been too absent in the workings of the Senate \nthese recent years.\n  There is a growing feeling that unless we act with a sense of \nbipartisan and a real dedication to doing what is in the national \ninterest on smoking, that somehow we might let this historic \nopportunity slip through our fingers. I do not dispute the possibility \nof that, but, on the other hand, I believe that the Senate clearly has \nshown its willingness on many occasions in the past to rise to this \nkind of occasion, to ignore those that Senator McCain just referred to \nwho will spend billions and billions of dollars, who have a long record \nof misleading America and the Congress with respect to this issue--that \nwe will ignore those special, narrow interests in favor of the larger \ncommon interests of our fellow citizens. That is precisely what most of \nus came here to see this Senate do. And now we can take pride in the \npossibility of being part of that.\n  I believe that when my colleagues read the managers' amendment, the \nbill that is before them, they will find that there is in this a \nmainstream concept, that there is in this a view that really does \nrepresent common sense. I think it is a rare occasion that, on a \nsubject as ripe for dissent as the subject of tobacco, any committee in \nthe Senate could conceivably send a bill to the floor of the Senate by \na vote of 19-1.\n  The Commerce Committee is, in point of fact, a microcosm of the whole \nSenate. There are the extremes that we have on both sides, the hard-\nline points of view on both sides; and there is, of course, every point \nof view in between that somehow finds a center. And I believe that in \nthe end, when all of the debate and all of the anguish over this bill \nhas been worked through, we will find that we will be somewhere \nrelatively close to what the managers' amendment proposes and to what \nthe Senate has advocated.\n  As I say that, I personally believe there are improvements that can \nbe made. There are things in this bill with which I don't agree. There \nare things that we have all reserved the right to try to change. What \nis important, Mr. President, that we permit the Senate, at this moment, \nto affect that change, that we permit it to work its will and to \nultimately vote on a bill.\n  Senator McCain, I might say, has approached this task by reaching out \nall across party lines, reaching out to every sector of interest group \nthat is represented in this debate. I know that he and others on the \ncommittee have tried to listen hard. It is my belief that when Senators \nexamine the bill, while they will undoubtedly find a particular point \nof view here or there with which they could find disagreement and make \nsuggestions for improvement, I believe the fact is that they will have \na renewed respect for the way in which Senator McCain and the Commerce \nCommittee and Senator Hollings reached out to demonstrate some tough \ndecisionmaking under difficult pressures.\n  I also believe that in the end the changes that have been made, most \nof those in the managers' amendment, clearly make this a stronger and \nbetter bill than it was when it did leave the Commerce Committee. I \nremind my colleagues that the Commerce Committee, at the time we sent \nit out of committee, reserved the right at that point, knowing there \nwere some issues that weren't quite completely vetted, to make changes \nin a managers' amendment as we brought it to the floor. The structure \nof the bill has now been changed so that the provisions that are most \ncritical--for reducing youth smoking, the annual payments, the look-\nback assessments, and the advertising restrictions--will be implemented \nwithout the tobacco industry's assent, if that is our only choice.\n  I think every member of the committee, I am sure every Member of the \nSenate, would prefer that the tobacco companies were part of the \nsolution and not a continued part of the problem. We would prefer that \nthey were, in fact, signing on to all, everything, that we may embrace \nhere in the Senate. I believe that the industry's participation in \nyouth smoking reduction efforts is obviously preferable, but I think we \nhave made a genuine effort to try to respond to most of their needs. As \nthe chairman pointed out and I will\n\n[[Page S5011]]\n\nunderscore, almost every concept in this bill was embraced by the \ntobacco companies in their settlements that they arrived at with the \nattorneys general. In fact, most of the concepts are arrived at in the \nsettlements they have still reached, most recently last week in \nMinnesota, with a few exceptions.\n  The fact is there are some aspects of this that are tougher--but \ntougher in fact, not tougher in total concept. They do reach farther in \namount of money. There are greater limitations on liability because \nmany people believe those liability provisions were too great. But the \nfundamental principle that there should be some restraints, that there \nshould be some kind of look back, that there should be advertising \nrestraints, that there should be an increase in the price, were all \naccepted by the companies themselves, and it is certainly subject to \ndebate and to discretion within the Senate to ultimately agree on what \nthose levels ought to be.\n  When first presented to the Commerce Committee, the tobacco \nsettlement would have provided the tobacco companies with what most \npeople believe was an unprecedented level of immunity from civil \naction--elimination of class actions, punitive damages. Aggregation of \nclaims would not have been allowed. Claims based on addiction would not \nhave been allowed. It would have allowed parent companies to shield \ntheir tobacco profits from liability. It would have risked the ability \nof injured persons to file State claims. It would have kept those State \nclaims in State courts.\n  Mr. President, those restraints on the ability of our citizens to be \nable to seek redress were plain and simply excessive. These liability \nrestrictions are especially dangerous to the public health because this \nkind of liability threat is, in the final analysis, the strongest and \nmost important insurance that the tobacco companies will take public \nhealth concerns seriously, finally, after so many years of ignoring \nthem.\n  Let me be clear: The bill before the Senate no longer contains \nspecial protections for the industry. That, I believe, was an important \nstep towards a workable piece of legislation.\n  We also must pass legislation that contains high compliance standards \nto ensure that retailers will stop selling cigarettes to minors. We \nbelieve we have strengthened this element of the bill. We penalize \nStates which do not achieve a 90-percent compliance rate after a 5-year \ngrace period. When 62 percent of 12-to 17-year-old children in this \nNation report they could succeed in buying their own cigarettes, that \nnearly half of them have never been asked to provide a positive \nidentification, it seems to me it is time for us, as a nation, to get \nserious about compliance. This bill does that.\n  In order to ensure that the tobacco companies actually have \nsufficient incentives to reduce youth smoking, they and their \nshareholders must now know that they will pay significantly if youth \nsmoking rates do not decrease dramatically, which means they must join \nin the efforts to help us reduce smoking among our youth. That is why \nthe look-back assessments are so important.\n\n  Under the managers' bill, the cap on industry-wide assessments has \nbeen raised to $4 billion, and there are new uncapped company-by-\ncompany payments of $1,000 per child who smokes. That is an incentive \nto be helpful. Not only have the assessments been significantly \nincreased but they are no longer tax deductible. That is, in fact, a \ngreater incentive for people to understand that this bill means \nbusiness.\n  In addition, and this is very important to many who have been part of \nthe process, the look-back assessments are now tied to the liability \nprovision so that companies which continue to entice minors will lose \nany liability protections whatever--that is to say the cap particularly \nor any other protections in the aggregation preemption.\n  I think it is nearly universally agreed that we cannot fundamentally \nregulate tobacco without a strong and effective FDA authority over \ntobacco products. The distinguished Presiding Officer has played a \ncritical role, along with Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler, the White House, \nand the Department of Health and Human Services, in helping to come \ntogether in a considerable effort of negotiation in order to come up \nwith FDA authority within this legislation.\n  The FDA will have specific and broad new authority to regulate \ntobacco products. Indeed, Dr. Koop has publicly praised the provision \nas a substantial improvement over the provision in the proposed \nsettlement. I am confident that Dr. Koop, Dr. Kessler, and others will \ncontinue to work with Congress on this matter to ensure that the FDA \nhas the authority it needs to protect kids and to promote public \nhealth.\n  What we have before the Senate is not perfect legislation. None of us \nhas ever known a perfect piece, I think, to come to the floor of the \nSenate. We will have a critical debate in the days ahead about whether \nor not we can find room for improvement. There are many ideas that \ndifferent Senators will offer. I look forward to that debate with \nrespect to children, with respect to farmers, with respect to \nliability, attorney's fees, and other issues.\n  Finally, we owe a great deal to the leadership and hard work of our \ncolleague, Senator Kent Conrad, who has spoken out on tobacco with a \ngreat deal of passion, but more importantly, who helped, through a long \nprocess of working with the task force, to shape and fold what is in \nfront of the Senate today. I appreciate how sensitive Senator Conrad \nhas been toward passing legislation in this Congress and how seriously \nhe has fought to make certain that Congress will find a middle ground \nplace where all of us can, hopefully, ultimately come to agreement.\n  In the managers' amendment there are several improvements that \nreflect Senator Conrad's priorities and the great work that he has \nperformed as leader of the Democratic task force on tobacco.\n  So now the full Senate has the opportunity to work its will, to pass \nthis bill with the managers' amendment, to send America into the next \ncentury with the knowledge that we are a Nation not just with a \nresponsible policy toward an addictive substance, not just with a \nresponsible policy toward our children, but that we know how to \ntranslate our conscience into public legislation, that we can reach \nbeyond partisanship in order to find the common ground.\n  To my colleagues, I say simply that history has finally put this \nlegislation on the floor of the Senate in a decade-long fight to \nprotect our children. We weren't fighting for party. No one in this \nfight ought to have an ideological ax to grind.\n  In the final analysis, the one priority that will bring us together \nis fundamental: This debate is about our children and it is about our \nresponsibility of raising a generation of healthy children who will \nlive up to their potential, free from the grasp of a dangerous drug. \nThat is our challenge, and I believe that the Senate can meet it.\n  I join with my colleague, the Senator from Arizona, in suggesting \nthat this is the moment for the Senate to break away from the \nmendacity, the deception and willful effort to try to undercut the \nhealth of our kids over such a long period of time. I hope we are going \nto do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the next several days, we will be \ndiscussing a comprehensive piece of legislation that many of us have \nparticipated in drafting over the last really 9, 10 months--a piece of \nlegislation, which I think is a superb start to accomplishing the goal \non which I hope we will continue to focus. I think we are going to see, \nover the next several days, a lot of debate and probably a number of \namendments. We will see a lot of arguing back and forth and a lot of \nturf wars will be expressed here on the floor.\n  I just make a plea to my colleagues that, throughout that period of \ntime, we keep coming back to what our true focus is, the reason for \nhaving this bill. It really goes back to some of the data and \nstatistics that have already been mentioned, which I am sure we will \nmention again and again. But we are here in order to reduce the number \nof kids smoking, teen smoking, under-age smoking.\n  We have heard over the last several months about the number of kids \nwho start smoking every day; 3,000 kids start smoking every day. And \n1,000, or\n\n[[Page S5012]]\n\n1 out of every 3 of those kids who start today, will die prematurely. \nThat means they will die earlier than they would if they had never \nstarted smoking. That means a thousand children today, over the last 24 \nhours, have started smoking and will die before their time because they \nstarted smoking today. Ninety percent of all adult smokers began \nsmoking at or before age 18. In fact, 50 percent of all adults smoking \ntoday started under the age of 14--maybe 8, 10, 12, or 13 years of age.\n  The problem we face today--and, of course, I speak as a Senator now, \nbut I also speak as a physician who has taken an oath to dedicate my \nlife to improving the quality of life of others--is that of premature \ndeath. It is as simple as that. However, the problem is not getting \nbetter, it is actually getting worse. In fact, the percentage of teens \nsmoking every day has increased by 40 percent--these are teenagers, \nchildren--from 17 percent of 12th graders smoking in 1992 to 24 percent \nin 1997. If you look at the teenagers smoking from the 8th grade to the \n12th grade, it climbed from 13 percent in 1992 to 18 percent in 1997. \nSo this problem right now is becoming worse.\n  Really, the statement I want to make and urge all my colleagues to \nkeep in mind is that our focus has to be on the health of the next \ngeneration and to keep in mind the challenges that youngsters face as \nthey travel from that very tricky path from childhood to adulthood, \nsurrounded by these temptations. Really, what we need to do is address \nover the next several days, using the template of this bill now on the \nfloor, and ask the question: What can we do to make it more likely that \nthese children will arrive at adulthood without crippling addictions?\n  Mr. President, I would like to briefly comment on one aspect of this \nbill, on which I have spent a great deal of time. I want to comment on \nit this evening, as this bill is introduced. It is a part of the bill \nthat is greatly misunderstood by many because they haven't yet read the \nbill or had it presented to them. It has to do with the Food and Drug \nAdministration authority in this bill. I am not going to walk through \nthe provisions, but I want to briefly explain what we set out to do and \nwhat is in the bill.\n  Right now, drugs and medical devices are regulated by the FDA in a \nsingle chapter. An attempt has been made by the current administration \nto regulate tobacco through this chapter, chapter 5 of FDA law, with \nthe authorities given the devices. How and why? It basically is a way, \nthrough existing regulation, existing statute or authority, to regulate \ntobacco as a drug delivery device; but to me it is like taking a round \npeg and trying to put it in a square hole or taking a square peg and \ntrying to put it in a round hole--it just doesn't fit. It just doesn t \nfit to try and say that tobacco should be regulated as a drug delivery \ndevice. The attempt has been made to regulate tobacco by using the \nrestrictive device authority in chapter V. I point this out because it \nis the reason we have created a whole new chapter for the regulation of \ntobacco. This new chapter reflects that tobacco is a unique product, \nvery different from drugs and very different from devices.\n\n  Chapter 5 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act is that chapter \nthat, heretofore, an attempt has been made to regulate tobacco through. \nIt is the drug and device chapter. Tobacco just does not fit there. \nHere is one brief example, so that people will understand why we \ncreated a new chapter. Chapter 5 calls on the Secretary to determine \nwhether the regulatory actions taken will ``provide reasonable \nassurance of the safety and effectiveness'' of the drug or the device.\n  Well, clearly, tobacco is not safe or effective; we know that. It is \ndangerous to one's health. That has clearly been demonstrated over the \nlast 20, 25 years. You can talk about the effectiveness of a pacemaker \nor a heart valve or an artificial heart; you can talk about those \ndevices as being safe and effective. You really cannot apply that to \ntobacco. Therefore, instead of taking tobacco and ramming it through \nthe drug and device provisions, we felt it was important to look at the \nunique nature of tobacco, write a separate chapter, and that is what is \nin the bill today. It is called chapter 9. This gave us the flexibility \nto create a new standard that was appropriate for tobacco products. The \nbill states that the Secretary may find that regulations and other \nrequirements imposed on tobacco products ``are appropriate for the \nprotection of public health.'' This is the standard we use instead of \nthe safety and effectiveness standard found in chapter 5.\n  There are a number of other provisions in the device section that are \nduplicative or not well-suited when you are attempting to regulate \ntobacco. Yes, they are appropriate for drugs and devices, but not for \ntobacco. This chapter 9, which is in the underlying bill, the managers' \namendment, contains certain new provisions that grant the secretary \nexplicit authority to undertake regulatory measures particularly \nrelevant to tobacco. It requires manufacturers to submit to the \nsecretary information about the ingredients, components and substances \nin their products. It requires reporting of the content delivery and \nform of nicotine in their products. It requires reporting of their \nresearch on the health, behavioral, and physiological effects of \ntobacco products. It requires reporting on the reductions in risks \nassociated with available technology, as well as research on the \nmarketing of tobacco products. Yes, this bill does create a new, \nseparate chapter for regulation of tobacco products. But the reason it \nis important is because it does not fit, it does not make sense to \nregulate tobacco as safe or effective.\n\n  With that, Mr. President, the only primary change made to the FDA \nprovisions in the underlying McCain bill is a revision which I support. \nIn the managers' amendment there is a prohibition of the FDA from \nbanning tobacco sales from a particular type of retail outlet such as \nconvenience stores. In the managers' amendment, we limit the FDA \nauthority to the removal of the license of individual operators for \nfailure to comply with a licensing agreement. This addresses the \nconcerns by many of the retailers who came forward concerned that the \nFDA could ban sales from good operators who are not selling to kids \nbecause of a few bad actors. I support that revision in the initial FDA \nprovisions of the bill.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I do have concerns with the McCain bill. I \nwill be open minded when considering amendments to it. I think it is a \nvery good starting point. But it is a starting point. We can and should \nwork on improving it over the next several days as long as we do not \nlose sight of our ultimate objective. And that is a comprehensive \napproach that looks at public health initiatives, that looks at youth \naccess issues, that looks at the advertising and marketing, because, I \nbelieve, that it is only by having a comprehensive approach that we \nwill achieve the objective of preventing teen smoking.\n  I will be employing one criterion as I look at each of the amendments \nas they come forward. And that is, Is this amendment likely to \ncomplement a comprehensive campaign to prevent youth smoking? In other \nwords, does it help restrict advertising, promote public health, and \naddress youth access to tobacco with the end result of a reduction in \nyouth smoking?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S5001-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I am proud to announce to the Senate \ntoday the names of the two young men who have been selected to receive \nthe 1998 American Automobile Association Lifesaving Medal. This award \nis the highest honor given to members of the school safety patrol.\n  There are roughly 500,000 members of the school safety patrol in this \ncountry, helping over 50,000 schools. Every day, these young people \nensure that their peers arrive safely at school in the morning, and \nback home in the afternoon.\n  Most of the time, they accomplish their jobs uneventfully. But on \noccasion, these volunteers must make split-\n\n[[Page S5013]]\n\nsecond decisions--placing themselves in harm's way to save the lives of \nothers. This year's honorees exemplify this selflessness, and richly \ndeserve recognition.\n  The first AAA Lifesaving Medal recipient comes from Kensington, \nMaryland.\n  On October 1, 1997, Rock View Elementary School Safety Patrol Joseph \nCoggeshall was preparing to end his shift at the busy intersection of \nConnecticut Avenue and Denfeld Road.\n  Getting ready to go home himself, Joseph noticed one last group of \nchildren heading home. He decided to stay at his post a little longer. \nAs they reached the intersection, two boys, ages 6 and 7, attempted to \ngo around Joseph's outstretched arms and into traffic. Reacting \nquickly, Joseph grabbed both children, pulling them back onto the curb \njust before they would have entered into rush-hour traffic on a six-\nlane highway. Joseph probably saved those boys' lives.\n  This year's second AAA Lifesaving Medal honoree comes from San Mateo, \nCalifornia.\n  On January 5, 1998, St. Timothy School Safety Patrol Christopher \nAquino stood his usual post at the north gate crosswalk.\n  Close by, a father led his two young daughters, ages 3 and 6, toward \nthe crosswalk. Spotting the family car parked across the street, the 3-\nyear-old broke free from her father's hand, sprinted into the road and \ninto the path of an oncoming truck. On instinct, and with no regard for \nhis own safety, Christopher ran after her, grabbed her by the hand and \nreturned her safely to her father.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the Senate, I wish to extend \ncongratulations and thanks to these two young men. They are an asset to \ntheir communities, and their families, and neighbors should be very \nproud of their courage and dedication.\n  I would also like to recognize the American Automobile Association \nfor providing the supplies and training necessary to keep the safety \npatrol on duty nationwide.\n  Since the 1920's, AAA clubs across the country have been sponsoring \nstudent safety patrols to guide and protect younger classmates against \ntraffic accidents. Easily recognizable by their fluorescent orange \nsafety belt and shoulder strap, safety patrol members represent the \nvery best of their schools and communities. Experts credit school \nsafety patrol programs with helping to lower the number of traffic \naccidents and fatalities involving young children.\n  We owe AAA our gratitude for their tireless efforts to ensure that \nour Nation's children arrive to and from school safe and sound.\n  And we owe our thanks to Joseph Coggeshall and Christopher Aquino for \ntheir selfless actions. The discipline and courage they displayed \ndeserves the praise and recognition of their schools and their \ncommunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S5012-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO KIMBERLY SCHUBERT, A GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD RECIPIENT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to salute an outstanding \nyoung woman who has been honored with the Girl Scout Gold Award by Girl \nScouts of the Black Hills Council in Rapid City, SD. Kimberly Schubert \nof Rapid City was honored yesterday for earning the highest achievement \naward in U.S. Girl Scouting.\n  The Girl Scout Award symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the \nareas of leadership, community service, career planning and personal \ndevelopment. The award can be earned by girls ages 14-17, or in grades \n9-12.\n  Girl Scouts of the USA, an organization serving over 3 million girls, \nhas awarded more than 20,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior Girl \nScouts since the inception of the program in 1980. To receive the \naward, a Girl Scout must earn 4 interest projects patches, the Career \nExploration pin, the Senior Girl Scout leadership award, and the Senior \nGirl Scout Challenge, as well as design and implement a Girl Scout Gold \nAward project. A plan for fulfilling these requirements is created by \nthe Senior Girl Scout and is carried out through close cooperation \nbetween the girl and an adult Girl Scout volunteer.\n  As a member of the Girl Scouts of the Black Hills Council, Kim \nSchubert began working toward the Gold Scout Award in 1996. She \ncompleted her project in the areas of sports and leadership, and she \nrichly deserves the public recognition for this significant service to \nher community and her country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S5013-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING THE FLOYDS ON THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. \nThe data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to \nthe society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today \nwill see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both \ninstructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment \nof ``till death us do part'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the \ntimeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics \nmake our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Margaret and Tom \nFloyd of Charleston, Illinois, who on June 12, 1998, will celebrate \ntheir 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to \nthe day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The Floyds' commitment to \nthe principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S5013-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  MR.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that \nthe emergency declared with respect to Burma is to continue in effect \nbeyond May 20, 1998.\n  As long as the Government of Burma continues its policies of \ncommitting large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in \nBurma, this situation continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary \nthreat to the national security and foreign policy of the United \nStates. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to \nmaintain in force these emergency authorities beyond May 20, 1998.\n                                                  William J.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii; to the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 43\n\n       Whereas, a strong and viable agricultural industry is vital \n     to Hawaii's economic base; and\n       Whereas, as many as twenty-four new alien species are \n     introduced into the State each year, placing a dire threat on \n     Hawaii's environment and agriculture industry; and\n       Whereas, the cost to the State to eradicate or mitigate the \n     harmful effects of these alien species would be monumental; \n     and\n       Whereas, vegetables and fruits can carry salmonella if they \n     are tainted by sewage water or unclean hands; and\n       Whereas, E. coli has been found on lettuce; and\n       Whereas, in 1996, Guatemalan raspberries that were \n     contaminated with the parasite Cyclospora cayetanensis \n     resulted in a rash of poisoning that sickened thousands of \n     people in twenty-nine states; and\n       Whereas, this outbreak occurred again in 1997; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Federal Drug Agency (FDA) has seven \n     hundred inspectors and lab personnel to monitor fifty-three \n     thousand food processing plants in the U.S. and all imported \n     fresh and processed produce; and\n       Whereas, plant inspections have decreased from one \n     inspection every three to five years in 1992, to one \n     inspection every ten years today; and\n       Whereas, of the nearly two-thirds of all winter produce \n     eaten in the U.S., about six hundred million servings comes \n     into the U.S. through the Nogales, Arizona, checkpoint each \n     day; and\n       Whereas, about seventy percent of the trucks go through the \n     Nogales entry gates without any inspection of the cargo; and\n       Whereas, although the FDA is the agency that is primarily \n     responsible for food safety, its purview is mostly limited to \n     testing for excessive pesticide residue and cursory random \n     examination of about thirty percent of the trucks coming \n     through Nogales, of which samples are taken from about three \n     percent of the trucks; and\n       Whereas, the FDA has no on-the-spot testing for pathogens \n     such as cyclospora, cryptosporidia, or E. coli, which are all \n     linked to food borne illnesses; and\n       Whereas, globalization of the food marketplace is exposing \n     some consumers to a host of strange microbes, and therefore, \n     legislation has been introduced in Congress to create a \n     billion-dollar-a-year Food Safety Administration; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Nineteenth \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 1998, \n     the Senate concurring, That Congress is urged to require that \n     the importation of all agricultural products into Hawaii have \n     a designation of country or origin and a certification of \n     inspection based on United States Department of Agriculture \n     standards to verify that each imported product has passed all \n     U.S. health and agricultural requirements; and be it\n       Further resolved, That Congress support the creation of a \n     federal Food Safety Administration; and be it\n       Further resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, Hawaii's Congressional Delegation, and the \n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-423. A resolution adopted by the Mayor and City Council \n     of the City of LaFollette, Tennessee relative to postal \n     services; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n       POM-424. A petition from the Demographer of the State of \n     Michigan relative to the year 2000 census; to the Committee \n     on Governmental Affairs.\n       POM-425. A resolution adopted by the Council of the City of \n     Oak Ridge, Tennessee relative to U.S. Department of Energy \n     missions in Oak Ridge; to the Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs.\n       POM-426. A resolution adopted by the Council of the City of \n     Cincinnati, Ohio relative to the U.S. Postal Service; to the \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n       POM-427. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Tennessee; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 106\n\n       Whereas, under the provisions of legislation recently \n     passed by the U.S. Senate, each of the fifty (50) states \n     would stand to lose twenty-one and one-half percent (21.5%) \n     of their annual highway funding if their respective \n     legislatures failed to enact federally prescribed laws on \n     three (3) public safety issues; and\n       Whereas, specifically, S. 1173 would compel state \n     legislatures to enact the following three (3) sanctions or \n     else lose a significant amount of their state's share of \n     federal highway dollars:\n       (1) the establishment of .08% as the legal blood alcohol \n     content level for the offense of driving while intoxicated;\n       (2) a prohibition on open containers of alcoholic beverages \n     in moving motor vehicles; and\n       (3) the enactment of mandatory sentences for drivers who \n     repeatedly operate a motor vehicle while intoxicated; and\n       Whereas, although these three (3) public safety objectives \n     are indeed worthy, past experience has proven that federal \n     mandates are not in the best interests of the people of \n     Tennessee and our system of government as enunciated by the \n     10th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which \n     limits the federal government's powers to those specifically \n     delineated in the U.S. Constitution, with the remaining \n     powers and duties falling under the province of the states' \n     legislatures; and\n       Whereas, these three (3) public safety objectives are \n     presently being carefully and exhaustively considered by \n     state legislatures, as they should be; and\n       Whereas, these public safety objectives are strictly state \n     issues, as they encompass precisely the type of powers \n     envisioned by our founding fathers to be reserved to the \n     states by the 10th Amendment; and\n       Whereas, State legislatures should act to accomplish these \n     public safety objectives only after pertinent data has been \n     accumulated and verifiable results have been demonstrated for \n     their respective state; no two (2) states are exactly alike \n     and different approaches to accomplish these goals may be \n     necessary in each state; and\n       Whereas, past experience has also conclusively demonstrated \n     that incentive grants are far more effective than federal \n     mandates; and\n       Whereas, the incentive grant approach permits state and \n     federal governments to collaborate in order to achieve shared \n     public safety objectives; and\n       Whereas, in addition to allowing the states and the federal \n     government to work respectfully together as equals, instead \n     of operating as opposing and divisive forces, the incentive \n     grant approach does not require any pre-emption of state \n     rights or prerogatives, does not impose any federal mandates \n     upon state governments, and does not threaten states with the \n     loss of transportation dollars (in a bill, ``BESTEA'', that \n     allegedly provides for increased funding from the highway and \n     other transportation funds and restoration of integrity to \n     those same funds); and\n       Whereas, this General Assembly is most fervently opposed to \n     federal mandates of any kind and requests the U.S. Congress \n     to respect the 10th Amendment, as well as their counterparts \n     at the state level; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the One-Hundredth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, That this General \n     Assembly hereby memorializes the United States Congress (and \n     specifically the Tennessee Congressional delegation) to \n     refrain from enacting into law the mandates and sanctions \n     imposed on the several states by S. 1173 (or H.R. 2400, if \n     amended to reflect the Senate Bill) of the One Hundred Fifth \n     U.S. Congress and to instead maintain the incentive grant \n     approach to accomplishing public safety objectives shared by \n     state and federal governments. Be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Senate is \n     directed to transmit enrolled copies of this resolution to \n     the Speaker and the Clerk of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives; the President and the Secretary of the U.S. \n     Senate; and to each member of Tennessee's Congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-428. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 173\n\n       Whereas, hunting and fishing are important activities for \n     millions of Americans. Hunting and fishing afford people an \n     opportunity to enjoy the beauty of the outdoors and to pursue \n     activities strongly associated with our pioneer heritage of \n     generations past. For some people the woods and waters are \n     much more than an occasional recreational diversion. For \n     these citizens, hunting and fishing represent a way of life; \n     and\n       Whereas, through intense study, hunting and fishing have \n     become key tools in managing our wildlife resources. \n     Regulations balance the population levels of game animals and \n     fish. This has enormous benefits for our environment; and\n       Whereas, in recent years, there are increasing numbers of \n     conflicts between those who hunt and fish and certain groups \n     that are committed to halting hunting and fishing. There have \n     been instances of individual and organized efforts to \n     obstruct hunting and fishing. In response to growing \n     concerns, Michigan enacted legislation in 1996 to make it a \n     crime to harass a person lawfully engaged in hunting or \n     fishing; and\n       Whereas, in 1996, the citizens of Michigan voted on \n     statewide ballot questions related to hunting. Michigan \n     voters strongly supported a proposal affirming scientific \n     management of hunting while rejecting a proposal that sought \n     to impose restrictions on certain hunting practices. In other \n     states, however, voters have approved significant \n     restrictions on hunting. In the public discussions on these \n     questions, it is clear that many aspects of hunting and \n     fishing are misunderstood by a growing number of people. \n     Changes in where people live, as urban and suburban acreage \n     engulfs more of our rural areas, likely contribute to \n     misinformation about hunting and fishing and\n       Whereas, responsible hunting and fishing practices, like \n     those exercised by the millions of people who enjoy \n     Michigan's outdoor\n\n[[Page S5016]]\n\n     bounty each year, enrich us all. Even those who may never \n     know the joys of these sports benefit in the efficient and \n     humane treatment of animals and fish that scientific \n     management offers. We must ensure that these time-honored and \n     productive pursuits are available for future generations; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to recognize \n     the right of all citizens to hunt and fish; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-429. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                            House Resolution\n\n       Whereas, many municipalities own antiquated sewerage \n     treatment facilities which face substantial and sometimes \n     complete reconstruction to meet Environmental Protection \n     Agency standards, the cost of which can place extreme \n     hardship on the municipality; and\n       Whereas, the Environmental Protection Agency has levied \n     significant fines on various muicipalities and their \n     authorities for failure to comply with sewerage treatment \n     standards in the operation of these outdated systems; and\n       Whereas, municipalities have limited funds from which to \n     draw for both the fines and penalties and the repair and \n     construction and thereby have been or will be forced to raise \n     local taxes on residents to pay these fines and penalties; \n     and\n       Whereas, the funds to pay for such fines and penalties were \n     raised at the local level, thereby seriously depleting \n     resources available for the municipalities and their \n     authorities to take full corrective action for the \n     noncomplying systems; and\n       Whereas, these fines have posed a great hardship on those \n     municipalities by forcing them to divert funds needed for the \n     actual repair and restoration of the noncomplying systems \n     toward paying for the fines and penalties; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize the Congress of the \n     United States to enact legislation directing the \n     Environmental Protection Agency to return no less than 80% of \n     all fines and penalties collected from any municipality, its \n     authorities or agencies to some for the rehabilitation of the \n     existing facilities to bring those facilities to required \n     environmental standards, which may include expenditures for \n     equipment and materials to correct operating deficiencies at \n     the facilities involved in the violation; and be it\n       Further resolved, That copies of this resolution be \n     transmitted to the presiding officers of each house of \n     Congress and to each member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-430. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Idaho; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                      House Joint Memorial No. 13\n\n       Whereas, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \n     act (ISTEA) of 1991, Public Law 102-240, expired on September \n     30, 1997, and federal surface transportation programs are now \n     being temporarily authorized under the Surface Transportation \n     Extension Act (STEA) of 1997, which expires on May 1, 1998; \n     and\n       Whereas, delay or disruption of federal surface \n     transportation funds to the states and local governments \n     would cause serious transportation and economic problems for \n     the states and their citizens; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress is currently \n     considering various bills and amendments concerning a \n     multiyear reauthorization of ISTEA; and\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the State of Idaho recognizes \n     the many positive aspects of ISTEA which should be retained \n     in any new federal surface transportation authorization act, \n     including: the need for development of intermodal \n     transportation systems; the development of partnerships \n     between federal, state, local and tribal governments for the \n     delivery of transportation systems and services; and an \n     increased level of responsibility and flexibility given to \n     state, local and tribal governments to address their unique \n     transportation needs and characteristics; and\n       Whereas, ISTEA does need revision in order to eliminate \n     programs that are no longer needed or are unproductive and to \n     remove or revise those provisions which are overly \n     restrictive on the states. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-fourth Idaho Legislature, the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, That the \n     Congress of the United States adopt, in as timely a manner as \n     possible, a multiyear federal surface transportation program \n     reauthorization legislation which:\n       1. Increases total federal funding for highways to the \n     maximum level sustainable by federal law, including spending \n     authority for funds derived from transfer of 4.3 cents in \n     motor fuel taxes from the General Fund to the Highway Trust \n     Fund;\n       2. Includes fair and equitable formulas for distribution of \n     federal highway funds, based on the extent and use of the \n     highway system, both rural and urban;\n       3. Recognizes the national interest in federal lands and \n     the economic impact on states with a large percentage of \n     federal lands;\n       4. Streamlines and simplifies ISTEA by reducing regulations \n     and mandates on the states;\n       5. Provides greater flexibility for state and local highway \n     programs to spend funds in accordance with their unique \n     transportation characteristics and priorities. Be it\n       Further resolved That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed \n     to forward a copy of this Memorial to President Bill Clinton, \n     Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater, the President of \n     the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of \n     Congress, and the congressional delegation of the State of \n     Idaho in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-431. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 76\n\n       Whereas, a safe and efficient highway system is essential \n     to the nation's international competitiveness, key to \n     domestic productivity, and vital to our quality of life; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii has critical highway investment needs that \n     cannot be addressed with current financial resources. The \n     Federal Highway Administration rates 313 miles of Hawaii's \n     most important roads in either poor or mediocre condition and \n     judges 51 per cent of our bridges to be deficient; and\n       Whereas, the current level of federal funding for the \n     nation's highway system is inadequate to meet rehabilitation \n     needs, to protect the safety of the traveling public, to \n     begin solving congestion and rural access problems, to \n     conduct adequate transportation research, and to keep the \n     United States competitive in a global economy; and\n       Whereas, the federal highway program is financed by \n     dedicated user fees collected from motorists to improve the \n     highway system and deposited into the federal Highway Trust \n     Fund. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 transferred all federal \n     motor fuel taxes into the Highway Trust Fund but provided no \n     mechanism to ensure the funds are spent; and\n       Whereas, the 1998 congressional budget would constrain \n     federal highway spending well below the level of highway tax \n     receipts, allowing the Highway Trust Fund's cash balance to \n     grow from just over $22 billion today to more than $70 \n     billion by 2003; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii and other states will be prohibited from \n     obligating any federal highway funds after April 30, 1998, \n     unless Congress and the President enact new highway \n     legislation by that date; and\n       Whereas, without federal highway funds, many states will be \n     forced to delay life-saving safety improvements, congestion \n     relief projects, and other road and bridge improvements; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Nineteenth Legislature of the \n     State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 1998, That the United \n     States Congress enact legislation reauthorizing the federal \n     highway program by May 1, 1998; and be it\n       Further resolved, That the reauthorization bill should fund \n     the federal highway program at the highest level that the \n     user-financed Highway Trust Fund will support; and be it\n       Further resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution \n     be transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     President of the United States Senate, and Hawaii's \n     congressional delegation.\n       POM-432.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain works, facilities, and titles of the Gila Project, and \ndesignated lands within or adjacent to the Gila Project, to the \nWellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               WELLTON-MOHAWK TITLE TRANSFER ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I introduced a bill to transfer \ntitle to the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District in Yuma, \nArizona from the Federal Government to the project beneficiaries. The \nrepayment obligation for construction costs was fully satisfied as of \nMay 30, 1987. This bill is the product of intensive negotiations \nbetween the project beneficiaries and the Bureau of Reclamation and \nwill be the subject of a hearing in the Water and Power Subcommittee on \nJune 9. At\n\n[[Page S5020]]\n\nthat time, I will hear from all interested parties about how to \nsuccessfully complete this project transfer.\n  As you may know, Mr. President, numerous project transfers have been \nproposed, both in this session of Congress and the 104th Session. Thus \nfar, none have been completed. With this bill, we in Arizona hope to \nreverse that trend. In March of this year, I met with Patty Beneke, \nAssistant Secretary of the Interior for Water and Science, and Bob \nJohnson, Regional Director for the Bureau of Reclamation, and they \nassured me that the Wellton-Mohawk project was a perfect example of the \nkind of project that should transfer under the administration's 1995 \nFramework for Transfer. I believe Bob Johnson referred to this project \nas ``low-hanging fruit.'' I assume by that, he meant that it could \ntransfer quickly and easily. I hope this is the case.\n  The Wellton-Mohawk project is located in Yuma County, Arizona and \nirrigates approximately 63,000 acres of prime agricultural lands. This \nirrigation district is a major contributor to the economy of Yuma \nCounty--the largest agriculturally developed county in Arizona--and \nposts approximately three-quarters of a billion dollars in annual \nagricultural sales. Transfer of title from the Federal Government will \naffect neither the productivity nor the efficiency of the irrigation \ndistrict. I believe that transfer would only enhance the District's \nproductivity.\n  Both sides stand to benefit from this title transfer. The District \nlooks forward to a reduction in Federal Government involvement; would \nbenefit from better land-management opportunities; and would have the \nopportunity to assure increased protection of the environmental values \nof the Gila River riparian habitat. The Federal Government benefits, \ntoo. A successful title transfer would advance the administration's \nstated goal of reduction in government as well as eliminate the \nresponsibility for managing the patchwork of lands that make up the \nDistrict. The Bureau of Reclamation would be relieved of the \nadministrative and financial burden of facilities oversight currently \nrequired due to Federal ownership.\n  In negotiations, the Bureau of Reclamation has raised several issues \nthat need to be addressed in order to effect a successful transfer. \nThese issues include environmental mitigation, administrative costs, \nidentification and valuation of lands, and agricultural return flows. \nOne of the benefits of my legislation is that it provides a Memorandum \nof Agreement, to be negotiated between the Bureau and the District, \nthat will address all of these concerns in an open and mutually \nbeneficial process.\n  I am pleased thus far by the cooperation of all stakeholders. I look \nforward to continuing the process at the Water and Power subcommittee \nhearing on June 9, 1998. I thank Senator McCain for his cosponsorship \nof this bill, and I look forward to his support, as well as that of the \nrest of my colleagues, on this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2087\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Wellton-Mohawk Title \n     Transfer Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Notwithstanding the transfer of title to \n     works, facilities, and lands, the Secretary and Western are \n     authorized and shall continue to provide Wellton-Mohawk with \n     project reserved power from the Parker Reclamation Power \n     Plant and Davis Reclamation Power Plant, in accordance with \n     the terms of the Consolidated Contract and the Power \n     Management Agreement (Reclamation's and Western's contract \n     Numbers 6-CU-30-P1136, 6-CU-30-P1137 and 6-CU-30-P1138) \n     including any renewals, amendments, supplements, or \n     extensions thereof.\n       (d) Liability.--Effective on the date of conveyance of the \n     project works, facilities and lands, the United States shall \n     not be held liable by any court for damages of any kind \n     arising out of any act, omission, or occurrence relating to \n     the conveyed works, facilities, and lands, except for damages \n     caused by acts of negligence committed by the United States \n     or by its employees, agents, or contractors as provided in \n     the Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq.).\n       (e) Agricultural Return Flows.--As a condition of transfer, \n     Wellton-Mohawk shall agree that: (1) the volume of \n     agricultural return flows from Wellton-Mohawk delivered to \n     Reclamation's Main Outlet Drain at Station 0+00 shall comply \n     with applicable law and contracts and shall not exceed \n     175,000 annual acre feet; and (2) Wellton-Mohawk and \n     Reclamation shall work cooperatively to attempt to limit \n     return flows to the design capacity of the Yuma \n     Desalinization Plant.\n       (f) Report.--The Secretary shall provide a report to the \n     Committee on Resources of the United States House of \n     Representatives and to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources of the United States Senate within eighteen months \n     from the date of enactment of this Act on the status of the \n     transfer, any obstacles to completion of the transfer as \n     provided in this Act, and the anticipated date for such \n     transfer.\n       (g) Authorization.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     such sums as necessary for the purposes of this Act.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation to \nauthorize the Secretary of the Interior to transfer certain works, \nfacilities, and titles of the Gila Project, and designated lands to the \nWellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District. This legislation will \nallow the Bureau of Reclamation to carry out a transfer under the terms \nand conditions of a cooperative agreement between the Bureau and the \nDistrict.\n  I am pleased that my colleague from Arizona, Senator Jon Kyl, has \ntaken the lead in crafting this important proposal. It will enable the \nBureau of Reclamation to divest its responsibility for the operation, \nmaintenance, management, and regulation of Wellton-Mohawk. The Wellton-\nMohawk project includes 375 miles of irrigation/drainage canals and \nlaterals, and three major pumping plants, all of which support 63,000 \nacres of prime agricultural lands. This transfer will eliminate Federal \ngovernment oversight of Wellton-Mohawk and will empower the District \nmanagement to take over the title.\n  Mr. President, the Wellton-Mohawk District is a major contributor to \nthe economy of Yuma County, which is the most agriculturally developed \ncounty in Arizona. The farms in the region provide an estimated \neconomic impact of three-quarters of a billion dollars every year. \nConveyance of the project to the local management would help to sustain \nthe economic viability of area agricultural interests.\n  The cooperation by the administration and the district over the last \nfew years, especially at the regional level, has spurred this \nprivatization initiative. This legislation anticipates an aggressive \ntime line for the Bureau of Reclamation and the District to lay out the \nterms and conditions of the conveyance under a Memorandum of\n\n[[Page S5021]]\n\nAgreement (MOA), During a hearing before the House Subcommittee on \nWater and Power Resources, the Commissioner of the Bureau of \nReclamation called the Wellton-Mohawk project a ``good candidate for \ntransfer'' and furthermore stated that the administration would endorse \nlegislation that allows the District and the Secretary to negotiate the \nterms of a transfer pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement.\n  Under the terms of the legislation, the parties will establish a \nprocess by which the fair market value of the transfer will be \nassessed. The Memorandum will also lay out a plan for an environmental \nimpact analysis in compliance with the National Environmental Policy \nAct (NEPA). The Secretary of the Inferior is expected to carry out the \ntransfer if the terms are decided upon in the Memorandum of Agreement \nby a set date, However, the conveyance may not go forward if the \nappraisal or the NEPA process have not been completed.\n  I want to make clear that this legislation is not a directed \ntransfer, but simply implements the MOA as decided upon between the \nAdministration and the District. If consensus cannot be reached in the \nform of an MOA, this legislation to privatize Wellton-Mohawk will have \nno effect and will not require the government to transfer total or \notherwise divest itself of any assets.\n  Mr. President, I laud the considerable efforts of the Wellton Mohawk \nDistrict in forgoing this agreement. I look forward to working with \nSenator Kyl to see this initiative through to smooth and expedient \ncompletion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2088. A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to grant an \neasement to Chugach Alaska Corporation, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        Chugach Alaska Corporation Settlement implementation act\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this morning I introduce \nlegislation to implement a settlement agreement between the Chugach \nAlaska Corporation (CAC) and the United States Forest Service.\n  Pursuant to section 1430 of the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act (ANILCA), the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary \nof Agriculture, the State of Alaska, and the Chugach Alaska \nCorporation, were directed to study land ownership in and around the \nChugach Region in Alaska. The purpose of this study was two-fold. \nFirst, was to provide for a fair and just settlement of the Chugach \npeople and realizing the intent, purpose, and promise of the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act by Chugach Alaska Corporation. Second, was \nto identify lands that, to the maximum extent possible, are of the \nlike, kind, and character of those traditionally used and occupied by \nthe Chugach people, and, to the maximum extent possible, are coastal \naccessible and economically viable.\n  On September 17, 1982, the parties entered into an agreement now \nknown as the 1982 Chugach Natives, Inc. Settlement Agreement in order \nto set forth a fair and just settlement for the Chugach people pursuant \nto the study directed by Congress. Among the many provisions of this \nagreement the United States was required to convey to Chugach Alaska \nCorporation not more than 73,308 acres of land in the vicinity of \nCarbon Mountain. The land eventually conveyed contained significant \namounts of natural resources; however, they were inaccessible by road. \nTherefore, a second major provision of the Settlement Agreement granted \nChugach Alaska Corporation rights-of-way across Chugach National Forest \nto their land and required the United States to also grant an easement \nfor the purpose of constructing and using roads and other facilities \nnecessary for development of that tract of land on terms and conditions \nto be determined in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. It is \nobvious that without such an easement the land conveyed to CAC could \nnot be utilized or developed in a manner consistent with the intent of \nCongress as expressed in ANILCA and ANCSA.\n  More than fifteen years after the Settlement Agreement was signed the \nmuch needed easement has still not been granted and the CAC remains \nunable to make economic use of their lands. It seems absurd to me that \nCongress passed a Settlement Act for the Benefit of Alaska Natives; \nthen the federal government entered into a Settlement Agreement to \nimplement that Act where the CAC was concerned; and today, we find \nourselves once again in a position of having to force the government to \ncomply with these agreements.\n  I have spoken directly to the Regional Forester about this issue and \nto the Chief of the Forest Service. While they assure me the issue is \nbeing addressed and, in fact, have signed an MOU to keep it moving \nforward, they cannot give me any assurance that it will conclude. \nTherefore, I find it necessary to once again have Congress rectify \ninaction on behalf of the Forest Service.\n  The legislation is simple and straightforward. It directs the \nSecretary of Agriculture to grant an easement to the CAC by December \n11, of this year. It does not prevent the current process from going \nforward, it simply assures that there will be an end to it.\n  It is my intent to hold a hearing on this issue in the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2089. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nemployers a credit against income tax for information technology \ntraining expenses paid or incurred by the employer, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   investment tax credit legislation\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today we are considering \nlegislation, S. 1723, to respond to the difficulties that many American \ncompanies are experiencing in recruiting skilled workers to fill key \npositions in the information technology (IT) field. I commend my \ndistinguished colleague from Michigan for focusing attention on this \ncritical IT worker shortage issue.\n  Last September, the Department of Commerce released an important \nstudy, ``America's New Deficit: The Shortage of Information Technology \nWorkers'', alerting us to the severe shortage of information technology \nworkers. Shortly after the Commerce report was released, the \nInformation Technology Association of America (ITAA) released a study \nby Virginia Tech--``Help Wanted 1998: A Call For Collaborative Action \nFor the New Millennium:--which estimated that there are more than \n340,000 highly skilled positions in the information technology field \nthat are not filled. Moreover, the Department of Labor projected that \nour economy will require more than 130,000 information technology jobs \nin three fields--computer scientists and engineers, systems analysts, \nand computer programmers--every year for the next ten years.\n  Mr. President, according to the Department of Commerce, information \ntechnologies are the most important enabling technologies in the \neconomy today. They affect every sector and industry in the United \nStates, in terms of digitally-based products, services, production and \nwork processes. Thus, severe shortages of information technology \nworkers could undermine U.S. innovation, productivity and \ncompetitiveness in world markets.\n  Concern over this IT worker shortage was expressed very clearly in \nrecent testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by Michael \nMurray, Vice President for Human Resources and Administration at \nMicrosoft. Mr. Murray commented, ``As a leader in the American IT \nindustry, we are deeply concerned that the current skills shortage will \nthreaten our competitiveness in global markets, thereby jeopardizing \nthe $1 trillion this industry contributes to the U.S. economy''. \nAccording to the Commerce Department, the problem is compounded by the \nfact that there is also a global shortage of skilled IT workers, in \npart the result of many developing countries like Malaysia pursuing IT-\nbased economic development growth plans.\n  Mr. President, today we are considering legislation to amend the \nImmigration and Nationality Act to help American firms remain \ncompetitive in the global information technology market. Specifically, \nwe are debating whether to increase the number of H1B visas that are \navailable for highly skilled\n\n[[Page S5022]]\n\nworkers to fill IT positions in the U.S. S. 1723 would increase the \ncurrent cap on H1B visas for skilled workers from 65,000 per year to \n95,000 for the remainder of the year, and to 115,000 by fiscal year \n2000.\n  From my discussions with information technology leaders, and on the \nbasis the reports from the Commerce Department and ITAA regarding the \nIT worker shortage, there are compelling reasons to raise the cap on \nH1B visas. In many instances, American IT companies need the experience \nand language abilities of foreign workers to effectively compete in \nlocal markets. Additionally, with the IT industry's heavy reliance on \nresearch and development, there are times when the unique skills of a \nforeign worker contribute significantly in the development of critical \ninformation technology.\n  Mr. President, while it may be necessary to increase the number of \nH1B visas that are available for skilled IT workers, there are \neducation and training initiatives that we must also encourage the IT \nindustry to undertake to make certain that opportunities are available \nfor U.S. workers who want to enter the information technology field. We \nmust especially focus on retraining unemployed and older displaced \nworkers, and encourage new partnerships between the IT industry and \neducation institutions--both at the secondary and higher education \nlevel--to meet this IT worker shortage challenge.\n  I have been impressed, Mr. President, with the many education and \ntraining initiatives that the IT industry has undertaken in response to \nthis shortage. I know that the IT industry is investing millions of \ndollars in education and training programs for American workers, \nespecially to inform young people about the opportunities in the IT \nfield. Several weeks ago, I had the privilege of visiting students in \nthe Red River High School in Grand Forks, ND, who are participating in \nan excellent computer network training program sponsored by the CISCO \nCorporation. Very shortly, these young people will be able to enter the \njob market with skills that will be invaluable.\n  I am also aware of several excellent partnerships that Microsoft has \ninitiated with Green Thumb for older workers, and the American \nAssociation of Community Colleges to train students at technical and \ncommunity colleges. There are, of course, many other excellent examples \nof ongoing partnerships in the IT industry.\n  Mr. President, while these efforts are Herculean in many respects, we \nneed to encourage more education initiatives to train American students \nand workers to fill IT jobs that will be so critical to maintain our \nleadership in the 21st century. For this reason, I introduced an \namendment to S. 1133 on March 17, 1998, to increase the number of \npartnerships between the IT industry, and education institutions and \njob training programs by providing a tax credit for employers who offer \ninformation technology training for individuals.\n  The credit would be an amount equal to 20 percent of information \ntechnology training program expenses, however, not to exceed $6,000 in \na taxable year. The value of the credit would increase by 5 percentage \npoints if the IT training program is operated in an empowerment zone or \nenterprise community, in a school district in which at least 50 percent \nof the students in the district participate in the school lunch \nprogram, or in an area designated as a disaster zone by the President \nor Secretary of Agriculture. I am very pleased that this initiative has \nbeen endorsed by the Information Technology Association of America.\n  Mr. President, although S. 1723 may not be the appropriate measure to \noffer IT training tax credit legislation, I believe it is important to \ncall attention to this legislation to emphasize the need for more \neducation and training opportunities for American workers in the IT \nfield. Therefore, I am today introducing my IT training tax credit \nlegislation, and I hope that my colleagues who are supporting an \nincrease in the H1B visa cap for foreign workers, will also support \nthis provision to train and educate American workers for IT positions. \nWe have an obligation to make certain that opportunities in this \nexciting field are available to American workers and students. I \nwelcome cosponsors of this legislation, and I ask unanimous consent Mr. \nPresident, that the text of this legislation be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2089\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 97\n\n       Whereas the legacy of the war in Afghanistan has had a \n     devastating impact on the civilian population, and a \n     particularly negative impact on the rights and security of \n     women and girls;\n       Whereas the current environment is one in which the rights \n     of women and girls are routinely violated, leading the \n     Department of State in its 1997 Country Report on Human \n     Rights, released January 30, 1998, to conclude that women are \n     beaten for violating increasingly restrictive Taliban dress \n     codes, which require women to be covered from head to toe, \n     women are strictly prohibited from working outside the home, \n     women and girls are denied the right to an education, women \n     are forbidden from appearing outside the home unless \n     accompanied by a male family member, and beatings and death \n     result from a failure to observe these restrictions;\n       Whereas the Secretary of State stated, in November 1997 at \n     the Nasir Bagh Refugee Camp in Pakistan, that if a society is \n     to move forward, women and girls must have access to schools \n     and health care, be able to participate in the economy, and \n     be protected from physical exploitation and abuse;\n       Whereas Afghanistan recognizes international human rights \n     conventions such as the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Covenant on the \n     Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All \n     Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the International \n     Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, which \n     espouses respect for basic human rights of all individuals \n     without regard to race, religion, ethnicity, or gender;\n       Whereas the use of rape as an instrument of war is \n     considered a grave breach of the Geneva Convention and a \n     crime against humanity;\n       Whereas people who commit grave breaches of the Geneva \n     Convention are to be apprehended and subject to trial;\n       Whereas there is significant credible evidence that warring \n     parties, factions, and powers in Afghanistan are responsible \n     for numerous human rights violations, including the \n     systematic rape of women and girls;\n       Whereas in recent years Afghan maternal mortality rates \n     have increased dramatically, and the level of women's health \n     care has declined significantly;\n       Whereas there has been a marked upswing in human rights \n     violations against women and girls since the Taliban \n     coalition seized Kabul in 1996, including Taliban edicts \n     denying women and girls the right to an education, \n     employment, access to adequate health care, and direct access \n     to humanitarian aid;

and\n       (B) deprivation of human rights of women;\n       (6) calls on all Afghan parties in particular to take \n     measures to ensure--\n       (A) the effective participation of women in civil, \n     economic, political, and social life throughout the country;\n       (B) respect for the right of women to work;\n       (C) the right of women and girls to an education without \n     discrimination, reopening schools to women and girls at all \n     levels of education;\n       (D) respect for the right of women to physical security;\n       (E) those responsible for physical attacks on women are \n     brought to justice;\n       (F) respect for freedom of movement of women and their \n     effective access to health care;

REPORT.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State \n     should submit a report to Congress not later than 6 months \n     after the date of the adoption of this resolution regarding \n     actions that have been taken to implement this resolution.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nexpressing concern over the continuing deterioration of the rights of \nwomen and girls in Afghanistan, and calling on the administration to \nincrease its efforts to provide humanitarian assistance and to protect \nthe human rights of Afghan women.\n  I am joined in this resolution by Senators Brownback, Dodd, and \nLandrieu.\n  Mr. President, every day the women of Afghanistan are excluded from \nthe international community's prevailing vision of human rights, and \ncontinue to lack basic legal rights, access to education, and access to \neconomic opportunity. Indeed, perhaps nowhere in the world today is \nthere a clearer test of our commitment to the cause of women's rights \nthan Afghanistan.\n  In March of this year I convened a meeting with leading Non-\nGovernmental organizations, the Administration, and Afghan women \nthemselves to discuss the situation in Afghanistan and what options are \navailable to the international community to make the lives of \nAfghanistan's women better.\n  Among those participating were representatives of the Department of \nState, the International Commission of the Red Cross, Save the \nChildren, the Women's Commission on Refugee Women and Children, Women \nin Refugee Development, and the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human \nRights in Afghanistan, among others.\n  We discussed the legacy of close to twenty years of war and bloodshed \nwhich has torn apart Afghanistan: More than 1 million people have died, \nand much of the capital of Kabul lies in ruins.\n  There are more than 50,000 war widows in Kabul alone, many dependent \non international humanitarian assistance for their very survival. The \nICRC, for example, distributes food to some 15,000 widows in Kabul.\n  According to Theresa Loar, the State Department's Senior Coordinator \nfor Women's Issues, in the 1980s a growing number of Afghan women \nworked outside the home. There were female lawyers, judges, doctors, \nand teachers.\n\n[[Page S5025]]\n\n This trend was reversed in 1992 and now, under the Taliban, ``women \nand girls became, and remain today, virtually invisible.''\n  Education is a major concern, where edicts prevent girls from \nattending school and receiving an education. A small, low-profile, \n``home school'' movement has started, with an estimated 6,500 girls and \nboys attending classes in Kabul. These home schools, however, are no \nsubstitute for access to a real education.\n  On September 6, 1997 the Taliban government issued a statement \ndemanding that admission of female patients to hospitals cease \nimmediately, and that all female medical staff stop working. After \nnegotiations with the ICRC the Taliban government reconsidered, but \nwomen still face great difficulties in getting access to medical care.\n  Many Non-Governmental Organizations are doing work which I can \ndescribe as nothing short of heroic to provide medical and humanitarian \nassistance under the most adverse of circumstances. But they are faced \nwith numerous constraints, from difficulties in collecting data and \nverifying beneficiary cards, to laws and practices which prevent the \ndistribution of assistance or services directly to the women in need.\n  The U.S. State Department's 1997 human rights report states: ``Women \nwere beaten for violating increasingly restrictive Taliban dress codes, \nwhich require women to be covered from head to toe. Women were strictly \nprohibited from working outside the home, and women and girls were \ndenied the right to an education. Women were forbidden from appearing \noutside the home unless accompanied by a male family member. Beatings \nand death resulted from a failure to observe these restrictions.''\n\n  The women of Afghanistan, who have seen their families destroyed by \nwar, are now having their economic life and their fundamental human \nrights stripped away, and an already war-torn and war-weary Afghanistan \nhas been pushed to the brink of disaster.\n  Fully half of Afghanistan's population cannot work for a living or be \neducated. Fully half the population of Afghanistan are being \nsystematically denied their basic human rights. We must act to stop \nthese injustices and to bring peace to Afghanistan.\n  Ambassador Richardson's recent initiative, which led to the \nunprecedented peace talks between representatives of the Taliban and \nthe Northern Alliance in Islamabad last month and an agreement to set \nup a 40-member Ulema commission to find a solution for the civil \nconflict, represents perhaps the best opportunity for a comprehensive \npeace in Afghanistan in over a generation.\n  The ultimate outcome of these discussions are still in doubt, \nhowever, and, movement at the peace talks has been accompanied by \nreports of new fighting in the fields, with both sides reportedly \nacquiring new weapons.\n  I believe we must give our full support to these peace talks. But I \nalso believe that we must be prepared for continued violence in \nAfghanistan, and for the situation faced by Afghanistan's women to get \nworse before it gets better. As we await the outcome of these peace \ntalks--and there is no quick or apparent solution in sight--we must \ncontinue to work to alleviate the plight of Afghanistan's women.\n  The resolution I submit today calls on the administration to create \nan Afghan Women's Initiative, along the lines of the successful Bosnian \nand Rwandan Women's Initiatives which the administration has created in \nthe past two years. Those initiatives have assisted the victims of \nthose wars by promoting the reintegration of women into the economy \nwith an emphasis on capacity-building, training programs, legal \nassistance, and support for microenterprise projects, as well as \nrefugee reintegration and protection.\n  I believe that the successes of those two programs can serve as a \nmodel for a similar initiative for the women of Afghanistan, as well as \nthe numerous Afghan women in refugee camps in Pakistan. The women of \nAfghanistan could greatly benefit from such a women's initiative, and I \nlook forward to working with the administration to design and implement \nsuch a program.\n  Second, this resolution calls for the international community to \ninvestigate charges of rape and abuse as instruments of the now almost \ndecade-long civil war which has torn Afghanistan apart, and, if \ncredible evidence exists, to convene a war crimes tribunal to prosecute \nthe perpetrators.\n  Credible charges have been made about the systematic use of rape by \nseveral of the factions and parties involved in this struggle, and I \nbelieve that these charges must be investigated and, if true, must lead \nto indictments and trials.\n  Finally, I believe that the United States must be clear in stating \nthat we will not recognize any government in Afghanistan unless it is \nbroad-based, respective of all Afghans, and respects international \nnorms of behavior in human rights, including the rights of women and \ngirls. As we continue to work for peace in Afghanistan, this resolution \ncalls for an unequivocal statement of administration policy on this \npoint.\n  The United States, with our history of commitment to women's rights \nand equality, must redouble its efforts to place respect for women's \nrights at the top of the international community's agenda in \nAfghanistan, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  This resolution, essentially, asks the President and the Secretary of \nState to work with the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees to \nguarantee the safety of and provide development assistance for Afghan \nwomen in Pakistan, as well as Afghanistan, and to increase support for \nvarious refugee programs, to explore options for resettlement, and to \nestablish in Afghanistan a women's initiative which is based on the \nsuccessful model of the Bosnian women's initiative and the Rwandan \nwomen's initiative that are targeted toward Afghani women's groups.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S5023-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 231--MAKING A TECHNICAL AMENDMENT TO SENATE \n                             RESOLUTION 208\n\n  Mr. BENNETT submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

As Miss Winnipesaukee, Heidi prevailed over a competitive field \nof thirteen New Hampshire women. Her triumph earns Heidi the right to \nrepresent New Hampshire in the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City \nthis September.\n  One has to admire Heidi for her persistence and dedication. She had \nappeared in the pageant five times in the last seven years. Heidi's \nrunner-up finish last year and her victory this year attest to her \ndrive to improve and triumph.\n  Heidi is deeply committed to helping children. She studies criminal \njustice at Franklin Pierce College in order to eventually work as an \nadvocate for children and to campaign for juvenile law reform. She has \nbeen a volunteer for the Youth Services Court Diversion Program in \nBelknap County for the past six years, and she models in United Way \nbridal shows to benefit charity. Heidi's platform issue as Miss New \nHampshire is the ``Let's Get Motivated'' scholarship program that she \nfounded three years ago.\n  At only 23 years old, Heidi is the owner of two dance studios, The \nBroadway North School of Performing Arts\n\n[[Page S5028]]\n\nand Broadway North Andover. She is a renowned dancer herself, winning \nthe talent portion of the Miss New Hampshire pageant twice. She was \nchosen to tour the United States with Dance Caravan and was the Grand \nNational Female Tap Soloist for Hoctor's ``Stars of Tomorrow'' dance \ncompetition in 1992.\n  I am proud to represent Heidi Marie Noyes in the United States \nSenate, and wish her much success as Miss New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S5027-4", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN MEMORY OF RABBI MOSHE SHERER\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to share with the Senate \nthe sorrowful news that Rabbi Moshe Sherer, one of American Jewry's \nleading communal leaders, passed away yesterday afternoon at the age of \n76. Rabbi Sherer was the President of Agudath Israel of America for \nover 30 years and has served as a reasoned, wise voice whose counsel \nwas widely respected in the Yeshivot of his beloved Brooklyn and the \nhalls of government in lower Manhattan, Albany, Washington, and \nJerusalem.\n  I first met Rabbi Sherer in the early days of the Kennedy \nAdministration when he came to Washington on behalf of Aguduth Israel. \nI quickly learned to admire his sagacity and rely on his insightful \ncounsel and abiding integrity. For over thirty-five years he was a \ntreasured mentor and a trusted friend.\n  World Jewry has lost one of its wisest statesmen. American Orthodoxy \nhas lost a primary architect of its remarkable postwar resurgence. All \nNew Yorkers have lost a man of rare spiritual gifts and exceptional \ncreative vision.\n  While the Senate convenes today, tens of thousands of Jews are \ngathering in Brooklyn, New York to bid a reverential farewell to this \nexceptional teacher and rare leader. New York's Governor George Pataki, \nNew York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and New York City Council Speaker \nPeter Vallone are among the distinguished public officials \nparticipating in the funeral.\n  Rabbi Sherer passed away only hours before the President of the \nSenate, Vice President Al Gore, addressed Agudath Israel's 76th \nanniversary dinner in New York. He spoke for the Senate and for all \nAmericans when he eulogized the Rabbi as ``a remarkable force for the \nunderstanding and respect and growth of Orthodox Jewry over the past \nfifty years'', whose ``contributions to spreading religious freedom and \nunderstanding have been truly indispensable in defending and expanding \nthose same rights for all Americans in all faiths.''\n  I know I speak for the entire Senate when I express my condolences to \nhis widow Deborah, his loving children Mrs. Rachel Langer, Mrs. Elky \nGoldschmidt and Rabbi Shimshon Sherer, his bereaved colleagues at \nAgudath Israel, and all who mourn the loss of this unusual man of \nconscience and conviction.\n  I ask that a brief obituary of Rabbi Sherer, as prepared by Agudath \nIsrael, be printed in the Record.\n  The obituary follows:\n\n       Rabbi Moshe Sherer, 76, widely acknowledged as the elder \n     statesman of the American Orthodox Jewish community, was a \n     leader of Agudath Israel of America, a major national Jewish \n     Orthodox organization, for over half a century, including \n     more than thirty years as the organization's president. He \n     also was appointed in 1980 as chairman of the Agudath Israel \n     World Organization, an international confederation of Agudath \n     Israel organizations in a host of countries around the globe.\n       A prime catalyst of the American Orthodox Jewish \n     community's remarkable growth in size and strength since the \n     Holocaust, the American-born Rabbi Sherer empowered the \n     evolution of an organization that one member of the Jewish \n     establishment in 1941 called ``a sickly weed'' into a major \n     and effective force on the American political and communal \n     scene. He took Agudath Israel from a small group of activists \n     to a formidable movement--with tens of thousands of members \n     and supporters; branches across the country; and a Washington \n     office that advocates for a host of issues of concern to the \n     American Orthodox Jewish community, from religious rights to \n     moral matters, from nonpublic education to the welfare of \n     Jews in lands of oppression. He also helped establish Agudath \n     Israel's celebrated Jewish youth groups and summer camps, and \n     pioneered the organization's current role as a leading force \n     in the provision of social and educational services in the \n     New York area.\n       Rabbi Sherer's earliest work on behalf of the Jewish \n     community--the efforts that first evoked the larger non-\n     Orthodox Jewish establishment's opprobrium--was the \n     grassroots, and largely illegal, organization and transport \n     of food shipments to starving Jews in Nazi-occupied Eastern \n     Europe in 1941. His efforts also produced affidavits for \n     European Jewish refugees that helped them immigrate to the \n     United States.\n       After the end of World War II, he and Agudath Israel \n     continued to assist European Jews--survivors interned in \n     Displaced Person camps--with foodstuffs and religious items, \n     and helped facilitate the immigration and resettlement of \n     Jewish refugees on these shores. In ensuing decades, Rabbi \n     Sherer spearheaded Agudath Israel's efforts on behalf of \n     endangered Jews behind the Iron Curtain and in places like \n     Syria and Iran. In 1991, years of clandestine activity on \n     behalf of Soviet Jews culminated in his establishment of an \n     office in Moscow to coordinate Agudath Israel's activities in \n     Russia. Under his leadership, Agudath Israel also played an \n     important role in providing social welfare and educational \n     assistance to Israeli Jews, and in advocating for Israel's \n     security needs.\n       Ignoring the pessimistic predictions about Orthodox Jewry \n     made by sociologists and demographic experts in the 40s and \n     50s, Rabbi Sherer went on to help engineer a remarkable \n     change in the scope, image and influence of the American \n     Orthodox Jewish world. A staunch advocate of Jewish religious \n     education as early as the 1960s, he helped establish the \n     principle in numerous federal laws--like the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965--and state laws that, to the \n     full extent constitutionally permissible, children in non-\n     public schools were entitled to governmental benefits and \n     services on an equitable basis with their public school \n     counterparts. He thereby allied himself with Catholic school \n     advocates and again rankled the larger American Jewish \n     establishment. In 1972, his efforts on behalf of education \n     led to his being named national chairman of a multi-faith \n     coalition of leaders representing the 5 million non-public \n     school children in the United States.\n       Under his leadership, Agudath Israel helped foster the \n     phenomenal growth of Jewish adult education as well. This \n     past September, the Agudath Israel-sponsored celebration of \n     the most recent completion of the ``Daf Yomi'' page-a-day \n     Talmud study program drew over 70,000 Jews to central \n     locations nationwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S5028-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNITION OF EARTH ANGELS\n\n Mr. BOND.

They were \namong twenty-eight winners from more than 1,600 applicants who \nexemplify Earth Day.\n  Earth Angels is a branch of the Guardian Angel Settlement Association \nin St. Louis, Missouri. The group is made up of more than 150 inner \ncity children and led by Neil Andre, Director of Earth Angels. Their \nprojects range from recycling to planting trees in their Forest of Life \nto collecting money for other environmental groups. The group is \nsupported by selling ``Earth Angel stock.'' People who buy into the \ngroup get a quarterly newsletter with their latest project updates. \nEarth Angels gives ``at risk'' children a chance to be part of an \nimportant cause and organization.\n  Commending Neil Andre and the Earth Angels for their Award for \nEnvironmental Sustainability, I wish them continued success in the \nfuture. It is extremely gratifying to learn of a group of children \ndoing so much to help our environment.

Mr. President, I wish today to acknowledge the \nlife and passing of a special man. Nat Bingham was many things: a \nfisherman, a conservationist, an advocate, an innovator, a husband, a \nfather and a friend to anyone who cares about California's magnificent \ncoastal environment and the lives it supports and sustains. By all \naccounts he was a person of great decency and conviction. He cared \ndeeply for his profession and all those who heed its honorable call. He \nwill be missed.\n  Nat and his wife Kathy made their home in Mendocino County on \nCalifornia's rugged North Coast. Tragically, Kathy died just two weeks \nbefore Nat. They are survived by their two children, Jolene and Eli. My \nheart goes out to them both.\n  Nat first became involved with fisheries management issues through \nhis local Salmon Trollers Marketing Association. He served in a number \nof capacities with the Association before becoming its representative \nto the Pacific Coast Federation of Fisherman's\n\n[[Page S5029]]\n\nAssociations (PCFFA). On the PCFFA's board, and eventually as its \npresident, he worked tirelessly on issues of habitat and species \nprotection, preservation and restoration.\n  After stepping down from the PCFFA's board, Nat eventually sold his \nboat and went to work full-time on salmon restoration and fish habitat \nissues.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that Nat Bingham was involved with \nalmost every major fisheries issue in California over the last 20 \nyears. Over the course of his career, Nat achieved a near universal \nreputation for fairness, independence and results. Is he is not a \nlegend already, it is certain he will become one.\n  I had great personal respect for Nat Bingham. Just before his death, \nI offered my strong support for his re-appointment to the federal \ngovernment's Pacific Fishery Management Council. Nat was ideally suited \nfor this important position. For his sake and the country's sake, I \nregret very much that he was denied the opportunity to continue his \nvaluable service.\n  The people who knew him best describe Nat as a gentle, good and moral \nman. He was passionate about what he believed in, but regardless of the \nissues at stake he never failed to treat others with a genuine dignity \nand respect. In my opinion this is one of the true tests of a leader, \nand it is one of the principal reasons why he will be so dearly missed. \nThough his life's work should continue on in the efforts of his \nfellows, Nat Bingham's spirit and dedication can never be \nreplaced.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S5028-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SEMITOOL RECEIVES SBA AWARD\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am proud to announce that \nSemitool, Inc., of Kalispell, Montana, has been awarded the Small \nBusiness Administration's (SBA) 1998 Entrepreneurial Success Award.\n  The state of Montana has rapidly entered the high-tech field in \nrecent years, and Semitool illustrates the best of what can be done in \nour state. I nominated Semitool, which designs and manufactures \nequipment used in the production of semiconductors and other electronic \ndevices, for the award last December because of their great success in \nthe high-tech industry.\n  As you may know, Mr. President, the SBA grants the Entrepreneurial \nSuccess Award to companies launched as ``small\" businesses that \nreceived SBA assistance and have since grown. The criteria include \ngrowth in the number of employees, increase in sales, comparisons \nbetween current and past financial reports, innovativeness of product \nor service offered, and evidence of contributions to the local \ncommunity.\n  With good ideas, hard work, and an initial boost by the SBA, Semitool \nhas become a major source for employment in Kalispell, employing \nroughly 1,100 people. It's this kind of entrepreneurial spirit that \nwill keep Montana, and our nation, strong.\n  Again, I congratulate Semitool on their success, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/18/senate-section/article/S5029-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TECHNICAL AMENDMENT TO SENATE RESOULTION 208\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on May 18, 1998, by the President of \nthe United States:\n  ILO Convention (No. 111) Concerning Discrimination (Employment and \nOccupation) (Treaty Document No. 105-45.)\n  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's messages be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith a certified copy of the Convention \n(No. 111) Concerning Discrimination (Employment and Occupation), \nadopted by the International Labor Conference at its 42nd Session in \nGeneva on June 25, 1958. Also transmitted is the report of the \nDepartment of State, with a letter dated January 6, 1997, from then \nSecretary of Labor Robert Reich, concerning the Convention.\n  This Convention obligates ratifying countries to declare and pursue a \nnational policy aimed at eliminating discrimination with respect to \nemployment and occupation. As explained more fully in the letter from \nSecretary Reich, U.S. law and practice fully comport with its \nprovisions.\n  In the interest of clarifying the domestic application of the \nConvention, my Administration proposes that two understandings \naccompany U.S. ratification.\n  The proposed understandings are as follows:\n\n       The United States understands the meaning and scope of \n     Convention No. 111 in light of the relevant conclusions and \n     practice of the Committee of Experts on the Application of \n     Conventions and Recommendations which have been adopted prior \n     to the date of U.S. ratification. The Committee's conclusions \n     and practice are, in any event, not legally binding on the \n     United States and have no force and effect on courts in the \n     United States.\n       The United States understands that the federal \n     nondiscrimination policy of equal pay for substantially equal \n     work meets the requirements of Convention 111. The United \n     States further understands that Convention 111 does not \n     require or establish the doctrine of comparable worth with \n     respect to compensation as that term is understood under \n     United States law and practice.\n\n  These understandings would have no effect on our international \nobligations under Convention No. 111.\n  Ratification of this Convention would be consistent with our policy \nof seeking to adhere to additional international labor instruments as a \nmeans both of ensuring that our domestic labor standards meet \ninternational requirements, and of enhancing our ability to call other \ngovernments to account for failing to fulfill their obligations under \nInternational Labor Organization (ILO) conventions. I recommend that \nthe Senate give its advice and consent to the ratification of ILO \nConvention No. 111.\n                                                  William J.
