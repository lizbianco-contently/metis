SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bulletproof Vest Partnership \n     Grant Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the number of law enforcement officers who are killed \n     in the line of duty would significantly decrease if every law \n     enforcement officer in the United States had the protection \n     of an armor vest;\n       (2) according to studies, between 1985 and 1994, 709 law \n     enforcement officers in the United States were feloniously \n     killed in the line of duty;\n       (3) the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that the \n     risk of fatality to law enforcement officers while not \n     wearing an armor vest is 14 times higher than for officers \n     wearing an armor vest;\n       (4) the Department of Justice estimates that approximately \n     150,000 State, local, and tribal law enforcement officers, \n     nearly 25 percent, are not issued body armor;\n       (5) according to studies, between 1985 and 1994, bullet-\n     resistant materials helped save the lives of more than 2,000 \n     law enforcement officers in the United States; and\n       (6) the Executive Committee for Indian Country Law \n     Enforcement Improvements reports that violent crime in Indian \n     country has risen sharply, despite a decrease in the national \n     crime rate, and has concluded that there is a ``public safety \n     crisis in Indian country''.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to save lives of \n     law enforcement officers by helping State, local, and tribal \n     law enforcement agencies provide officers with armor vests.\n\n[[Page S4928]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, on March 11, 1998, the Senate passed S. \n1605, the Bulletproof Vest and Partnership Grant Act of 1998 which I \nintroduced along with my colleagues Senators Leahy and Hatch. On May \n12, 1998, with strong bipartisan support, the House passed this bill \nand with mutually agreed upon modifications. Today, the Senate is about \nto pass this legislation by a unanimous vote and send it to the \nPresident for signature and enactment into law. I wish to thank the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator \nHatch, and the Committee's ranking member Senator Leahy, for their help \nand support with this important legislation.\n  Two nights ago, on Wednesday, May 13, 1998, in observance of National \nPolice Week, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund held \nthe Tenth Annual Memorial Candlelight Vigil and Reception honoring the \nfallen men and women in the line of duty. My heart goes out to the \nfamilies and friends of these men and women and I am proud to be a part \nof a potential solution to this tragedy that faces police officers in \nthe line of duty.\n  This legislation is endorsed by 38 Attorneys General, the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, the International \nUnion of Police Associations, the Police Executive Research Forum, the \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Officers, and the National \nAssociations of Police Organizations. They know this legislation will \nbenefit police and sheriffs' departments around the country.\n  There are far too many law enforcement officers who patrol our \nstreets and neighborhoods without the proper protective gear against \nviolent criminals.\n  As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the risks which law \nenforcement officers face everyday on the front lines protecting our \ncommunities.\n  Today, more than ever, violent criminals have bulletproof vests and \ndeadly weapons at their disposal. In fact, figures from the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice indicate that approximately 150,000 law \nenforcement officers--or 25 percent of the nation's 600,000 state and \nlocal officers--do not have access to bulletproof vests. Unfortunately, \nmany police departments just do not have the resources to purchase \nvests on their own.\n  The evidence is clear that a bulletproof vest is one of the most \nimportant pieces of equipment that any law enforcement officer can \nhave. Since the introduction of modern bulletproof material, the lives \nof more than 1,500 officers have been saved by bulletproof vests. In \nfact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has concluded that officers \nwho do not wear bulletproof vests are\n\n[[Page S4929]]\n\n14 times more likely to be killed by a firearm than those officers who \ndo wear vests. Simply put, bulletproof vests save lives.\n  This Friday afternoon, at the 17th annual National Peace Officers' \nMemorial Service, the families, friends and colleagues of police \nofficers who have lost their lives in the line of duty this past year \nwill gather on the West Front of the Capitol to remember the courage \nand sacrifice of their fallen loved ones.\n  This heartfelt ceremony marks the climax of National Police Week here \nin Washington, DC. A perfect way to show tribute to these fallen men \nand women is through passage of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \nAct of 1998 by both houses of Congress.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 will form a \npartnership with state and local law enforcement agencies in order to \nmake sure that police officers who need bulletproof vests get one. It \nwill do so by authorizing up to $25 million per year for a new grant \nprogram within the U.S. Department of Justice. The program will provide \n50-50 matching grants to state and local law enforcement agencies and \nIndian tribes to assist in purchasing bulletproof vests and body armor. \nTo ensure that the funding goes first to those police departments which \nneed it most, the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance is given \ndiscretion to give preferential consideration to smaller departments \nwhose budgets are scarce.\n  Additionally, those jurisdictions which do not receive any funding \nunder the local law enforcement block grant program will be given \npreference. Furthermore, at least half of the funds available under \nthis program will be awarded to jurisdictions with less than 100,000 \nresidents.\n  While we know that there is no way to end the risks inherent to a \ncareer in law enforcement, we must do everything possible to ensure \nthat officers who put their lives on the line every day also put on a \nvest. Body armor often means the difference between life and death.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we complete the last step to enact \nthe Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 that I introduced \nwith Senator Hatch and Senator Campbell last January. Our bipartisan \nlegislation is intended to save the lives of law enforcement officers \nacross the country by helping state and local law enforcement agencies \nprovide their officers with body armor. When we began Senate \nconsideration I urged action by this week, National Police Week. It is \nappropriate on the day of the Seventeenth Peace Officers' Memorial \nService that along with honoring those who made the ultimate sacrifice \nin the interest of preserving the public safety, we in Congress do all \nthat we can to protect our law enforcement officers.\n  Far too many police officers are needlessly killed each year while \nserving to protect our citizens. Just yesterday, the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation announced that 64 law enforcement officers were slain \nfeloniously in the line of duty in 1997, up from 56 in 1996. And some \nof these deaths might have been prevented if officers were wearing body \narmor.\n  According to the FBI, more than 30 percent of the 1,182 officers \nkilled by a firearm in the line of duty since 1980 could have been \nsaved if they had been wearing body armor. Indeed, the FBI estimates \nthat the risk of fatality to officers while not wearing body armor is \n14 times higher than for officers wearing it.\n  Unfortunately, far too many state and local law enforcement agencies \ncannot afford to provide every officer in their jurisdictions with the \nprotection of body armor. In fact, the Department of Justice estimates \nthat approximately 150,000 State and local law enforcement officers, \nnearly 25 percent, are not issued body armor.\n  A recent incident along the Vermont and New Hampshire border \nunderscores the need for the quick passage of this legislation to \nprovide maximum protection to those who protect us. On August 19, 1997, \nFederal, State and local law enforcement authorities in Vermont and New \nHampshire had cornered Carl Drega, after hours of hot pursuit. This \nmadman had just shot to death two New Hampshire state troopers and two \nother victims earlier in the day. In a massive exchange of gunfire with \nthe authorities, Drega lost his life.\n  During that shootout, all federal law enforcement officers wore \nbulletproof vests, while some state and local officers did not. For \nexample, Federal Border Patrol Officer John Pfeifer, a Vermonter, who \nwas seriously wounded in the incident. If it was not for his \nbulletproof vest, I would have been attending Officer Pfeifer's wake \ninstead of visiting him, and meeting his wife and young daughter in the \nhospital a few days later.\n  The two New Hampshire state troopers who were killed by Carl Drega \nwere not so lucky. They were not wearing bulletproof vests. Protective \nvests might not have been able to save the lives of those courageous \nofficers because of the high-powered assault weapons used by this \nmadman. But the tragedy underscores the point that all of our law \nenforcement officers, whether federal, state or local, deserve the \nprotection of a bulletproof vest.\n  I am relieved that Officer John Pfeifer is doing well and is back on \nduty. We all grieve for the two New Hampshire officers who were killed. \nWith that and lesser-known incidents as constant reminders, I will \ncontinue to do all I can to help prevent loss of life among our law \nenforcement officers.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 will create a new \npartnership between the federal government and State and local law \nenforcement agencies to help save the lives of police officers by \nproviding the resources for each and every law enforcement officer to \nhave a bulletproof vest. Our bipartisan bill would create a $25 million \nmatching grant program within the Department of Justice dedicated to \nhelping State and local law enforcement agencies purchase body armor.\n  Action today would not have been possible without the extraordinary \nefforts of Congressman Visclosky, Congressman LoBiondo, and the more \nthan 300 bipartisan cosponsors they assembled for their companion \nlegislation in the House of Representatives. The endorsement and \nsupport of many law enforcement organizations including the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, the National Sheriff's Association, the International \nUnion of Police Associations, the Police Executive Research Forum, the \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Officers, and the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations have all been critical to focusing \nattention on this important initiative. In my home State of Vermont, \nthe bill enjoys the strong support of Attorney General William Sorrell, \nthe Vermont State Police, the Vermont Police Chiefs Association and \nmany Vermont sheriffs, troopers, game wardens and other local and state \nlaw enforcement officials.\n  Since my time as a State prosecutor, I have always taken a keen \ninterest in law enforcement in Vermont and around the country. Vermont \nhas the reputation of being one of the safest states in which to live, \nwork and visit, and rightly so. In no small part, this is due to the \nhard work of those who have sworn to serve and protect us. And we \nshould do what we can to protect them, when a need like this one comes \nto our attention.\n  Our nation's law enforcement officers put their lives at risk in the \nline of duty everyday. No one knows when danger will appear. \nUnfortunately, in today's violent world, even a traffic stop may not \nnecessarily be ``routine.'' Each and every law enforcement officer \nacross the nation deserves the protection of a bulletproof vest.\n  I am glad that the bill we enact today returns to the Senate bill \nfrom the version hastily substituted in a House committee. We include \nrather than exclude corrections officers. We include rather than \nexclude Indian tribes. We include a small State minimum to ensure that \nVermont and other small States not lose out to their larger neighbors \nbut are enabled to participate to at least a minimum extend in the \nprogram. We have been able to achieve quick passage because we have \ncompromised to achieve consensus. Earlier this week, the House of \nRepresentatives passed our bill by a vote of 412-4.\n  I am also glad that we have been able to proceed this week to enact \nthe Care for Police Survivors Act, which I cosponsored with Senators \nHatch, Biden, DeWine and Sessions as S.1985. This measure will change a \nceiling into a\n\n[[Page S4930]]\n\nfloor for the Public Safety Officers Benefits program. Counseling \nservices will not longer be capped at $150,000 a year.\n  The unfortunate reality of contemporary life is that we may still \nlose upwards of 100 law enforcement officers a year nationwide. I wish \nthere were none and I will keep working to improve the assistance and \nsupport we provide our law enforcement officers. For those families \nthat sacrifice a loved one in the line of duty I support the additional \ncounseling services that could be made available by the Care for Police \nSurvivors Act.\n  I hope the House of Representatives will also proceed this week to \nprovide the college education assistance that would be made possible \nfor the families of State and local law enforcement officers killed or \ndisabled in the line of duty by the Public Safety Officers Educational \nBenefits Assistance Act, S. 1525. I am proud to have cosponsored the \nFederal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act of 1996 and the \npending bill that would extend the educational benefits that we \npreviously provided to the children of federal law enforcement to the \nfamilies of State and local public safety officials who die or are \ndisabled in the line of duty. Those families make the ultimate \nsacrifice for our public safety and deserve our support and assistance. \nI commend Senator Specter and Senator Biden for their leadership on \nthis effort.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee reported this bill to the Senate last \nThursday. I said then that I hoped it could be included in a package of \nlegislation passed this week. A fitting tribute to those who gave their \nlives in preserving our public safety would be for Congress to enact \nduring National Police Week and in anticipation of the annual memorial \nactivities for law enforcement officers the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Act of 1998, S.1605; the Care for Police Survivors Act of \n1998, S.1985 (or H.R. 3565 its House counterpart); and the Public \nSafety Officers Educational Benefits Assistance Act, S.1525. Together \nthese make a significant package of legislation to benefit the families \nof those who serve in law enforcement.\n  I am encouraged that we have been able to achieve enactment of two of \nthese three measures and look forward to enactment of the third, that \nto provide educational opportunities to the families of State and local \nlaw enforcement officers, as soon as the House is prepared to proceed.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, despite the respect that I have for \nMembers who are co-sponsors of this legislation, I must oppose S. 1605.\n  I do not oppose this legislation because I believe that encouraging \nlocal law enforcement officers to be provided body armor is a poor \nidea. Rather, it is not an appropriate activity of the federal \ngovernment.\n  If this new grant program passes, we will once again encourage people \nin communities all across the country to drive on past city hall, drive \non past the state capitol, drive to the airport, fly to Washington and \nask the Congress to help them solve a local problem. I believe that \nlocal problems can and should be solved by local people. There is \nhardly any more local issue than the equipment of local law enforcement \nofficers.\n  Some localities are enlightened and have provided money for body \narmor. This bill penalizes them. Under this bill, residents of those \ncommunities, who have already paid taxed for body armor for their own \nlaw enforcement agents, would be taxed to pay for 50 percent of the \ncost of body armor of law enforcement in communities that have not \ntaxed their citizens to pay for it. Well, as George Bernard Shaw said, \n``Any government that robs Peter to pay Paul can always count on the \nsupport of Paul.''\n  The only purpose for which this money can be used by local government \nis to provide body armor. Communities that have not provided body armor \nand communities that have not managed to reduce their crime rates \nreceive first preference for the award of the money. That certainly \ncreates an unfortunate incentive. And it means that in the future, \nlocalities may forego important law enforcement efforts on the hope \nthat if they wait a bit, taxpayers in other parts of the country will \npay 50 percent of the cost.\n  Under this bill, taxpayer money will be returned to the people who \npaid it, less the carrying charges and with strings attached. What if \nthe locality or state would like to spend the money on some other \npurpose than body armor? They are prohibited from doing so. Even if a \ncommunity that has not provided body armor has a more pressing law \nenforcement need, they cannot spend the money on anything but body \narmor. This is an unwarranted intrusion on federalism. Maybe we would \nhelp more if we left more tax money to remain in localities in the \nfirst place.\n  This is exactly why the federal government should stay out of this. \nThe era of big government is over I keep hearing, but here is a \nproposal to make it bigger. And somebody will have to pay for it with \nmoney that could have stayed right in the community where it was \nraised.\n  If this bill passes, there will be lots of opportunity to pass the \nbuck. Municipalities that do not provide body armor can pass the buck \nto Washington, saying that the federal government now has the \nresponsibility of doing so. The federal government will point out that \nmost of the funds will have to come from the states and localities. \nFingers will point everywhere and accountability will rest nowhere. \nThis is undesirable in a democracy.\n  Therefore, I record my opposition to this legislation.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate agree to the \namendments of the House.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/15/senate-section/article/S4927-7", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4930-S4931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CARE FOR POLICE SURVIVORS ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed the \nHouse companion legislation--H.R. 3565--to S. 1985 the ``Care for \nPolice Survivors Act of 1998'', which I introduced along with Senators \nHatch, Leahy, DeWine and Sessions.\n  This week we celebrate National Police Week. As we honor those who \nprotect us, it is important that we remember those who have fallen in \nthe line of duty. However, more than mere remembrance is necessary. We \nmust work to ensure that the loved ones these officers leave behind are \ncomforted and assisted in every way. The Care for Police Survivors Act \ndoes just that.\n  This legislation modifies the Public Safety Officers Death Benefit \nprogram, which--as my colleagues know--establishes national programs \nthat counsel and assist the families of slain police officers. The \npurpose of the Care for Police Survivors Act, which the House of \nRepresentatives passed overwhelmingly (403-8), is to enhance these \nnational programs. It does so by directing more funds to these programs \nthat counsel and support these families in the aftermath of tragedy. \nUnder current law, these counseling programs have a ceiling of \n$150,000, this bill changes this to a floor of $150,000.\n  Mr. President, I have long been concerned about the plight of \nfamilies of public safety officers killed in the line of duty--last \nyear, Senator Specter and I introduced the Public Safety Officers \nEducational Assistance Act which provides for the education of the \nspouse and dependent children of law enforcement officers who die or \nare totally disabled in the line of duty. In that vein, this \nlegislation offers assurance to those in the public safety profession--\nand even to those considering\n\n[[Page S4931]]\n\nservice as public safety officers--that there is a well established \nsupport system in place to comfort and assist their families and loved \nones in the event that they die in the line of duty.\n  Mr. President, it is critical that we not only remember, but offer \nreal help to the families of those police officers who have made the \nultimate sacrifice to keep our streets and homes safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/15/senate-section/article/S4930-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION TO \n                   DEPENDENTS OF PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS KILLED OR \n                   PERMANENTLY AND TOTALLY DISABLED IN THE LINE OF \n                   DUTY.\n\n       Part L of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of \n     1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) in the heading for subpart 2, by striking ``Civilian \n     Federal Law Enforcement'' and inserting ``Public Safety'';\n       (2) in section 1211(1), by striking ``civilian Federal law \n     enforcement'' and inserting ``public safety'';\n       (3) in section 1212(a)(1)(A), by striking ``Federal law \n     enforcement'' and inserting ``public safety'';\n       (4) in section 1216(a), by inserting ``and each dependent \n     of a public safety officer killed in the line of duty on or \n     after October 1, 1997,'' after ``1992,''; and\n       (5) in section 1217--\n       (A) by striking paragraph (2); and\n       (B) by redesignating paragraphs (3) and (6) as paragraphs \n     (2) and (3), respectively.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed S. \n1525, the ``Public Safety Officers Educational Assistance Act of \n1998.''\n  Last congress, the Senate passed the ``Federal Law Enforcement \nDependents Assistance Act''--led by Senators Specter and Kohl and co-\nsponsored by myself and nearly every member of the Judiciary Committee. \nThis law provides for the education of the spouse and dependent \nchildren of federal law enforcement officers who die or are totally \ndisabled in the line of duty.\n  The purpose of the legislation was to remove a significant financial \nburden from the families of these deceased officers and to allow them \nto continue on the educational path they would have followed had their \nparent or spouse not been killed in the line of duty.\n  Last fall, about 30 young men and women were able to go to college \nunder this program. Unfortunately, this program is only available to \nthe children of federal law enforcement officers.\n  The Public Safety Officers Educational Assistance Act, which Senator \nSpecter and I introduced last year, extends these same educational \nbenefits to the dependents of all public safety officers--in other \nwords, not just federal--but also state, county and local law \nenforcement officers, and fire and rescue personnel--who have given \ntheir lives in the line of duty.\n  Under this bill, the Attorney General will administer a program which \nwill provide up to $4,485 per child, per year to attend a 4-year \ncollege. This is the same amount of educational assistance the federal \ngovernment provides to veterans.\n  The Justice Department estimates the total cost for this year to be \nabout $300,000. What is more, the Justice Department already has the \nfunds to pay for this $300,000 within their current budget--so we will \nnot need any additional appropriations.\n  It is critical that we remember the families of those officers who \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our streets and homes safe. \nThis bill is intended to allow the dependents of public safety officers \nto continue with their education as they would have been able to do had \ntheir parent not been killed or totally disabled in the line of duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/15/senate-section/article/S4931-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4931-S4932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PASSAGE OF S. 1605, H.R. 3565, AND S. 1525\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this week we have been commemorating Peace \nOfficer's Memorial Week, in honor of those law enforcement and public \nsafety officers who have died in the line of duty. As we remember those \nwho have fallen in defense of the public safety, it is highly fitting \nthat the Senate consider legislation to help save police officers' \nlives, and also to do all we can to comfort and assist the families and \nloved ones they have left behind. Thus, I am gratified by the Senate's \naction today in passing three bills to accomplish these goals.\n  The first of these bills is S. 1605, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nGrant Act. This bill establishes a matching program to help States, \nunits of local government, and Indian tribes to purchase armor vests \nfor use by law enforcement officers. The lives of our law enforcement \nofficers will be secured by ensuring that every police officer who \nneeds a bulletproof vest receives one, providing an increased measure \nof protection to those who protect the public.\n  The FBI estimates that nearly one third of the 1,182 law enforcement \nofficers killed by a firearm in the line of duty since 1980 would be \nalive if they had worn a bulletproof vest. The FBI also approximates \nthat the risk of fatality to law enforcement officers while not wearing \nan armor vest is 14 times higher than for officers wearing an armor \nvest. In addition, the Department of Justice estimates that nearly \n150,000 State, local, and tribal law enforcement officers, roughly 25 \npercent, are not currently issued body armor. This piece of legislation \nwill save officers' lives by helping get vests to those who need them.\n  The second of these bills is the Care for Police Survivors Act of \n1998, H.R. 3565. I was proud to introduce the Senate companion to this \nbill, S. 1985. This bill will strengthen programs available to the \nfamilies of our slain police officers. For example, groups such as \nConcerns for Police Officers, more commonly referred to as COPS, will \nnow be allowed to increase and improve their services to these \nfamilies. Authority will be given to the Director of the Bureau of \nJustice Assistance to spend no less than $150,000 out of the Public \nSafety Officers' Benefits program to support and enrich national peer \nsupport and counseling programs for families of police officers lost in \nthe line of duty.\n  This act will also expedite the process of handling cases pending \nbefore the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Office by allowing the \nexpenditure of PSOB program funds on outside hearing officers. \nCurrently, survivors of fallen police officers have to wait entirely \ntoo long to obtain an appeal hearing for denial of benefits. By \nenacting this bill, we will make the process of helping these families \nless burdensome.\n  Finally, S. 1525, the Public Safety Officers Educational Assistance \nAct of 1998, will provide aid to the families of those federal law \nenforcement officers who are killed or totally disabled in the line of \nduty. By amending the Federal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance \nAct, also known as the Degan Law, approximately $4,500 per year in \ncollege assistance will be awarded to participants--the children and \nspouses of these great officers. Under S. 1525, the current program \nwill be expanded to cover state and local public safety officers as \nwell. I am a proud supporter of this program that will both promote and \nfund education for the small number of families of those who have given \ntheir lives or health while protecting our communities.\n\n[[Page S4932]]\n\n  The Department of Justice estimates that approximately 55 persons \nwould take advantage of this amendment at an additional cost of \n$330,000 per year. Neither the existing scholarship program nor the \nexpansion are an entitlement, and the cost of the scholarships can be \ncovered under the appropriation for the existing Public Safety Officers \nbenefit program. What an incredible service this will provide.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has chosen Police \nOfficers Memorial Day to pass these three bills. I believe that by \npassing this legislation, we can acknowledge a small measure of our \ntremendous gratitude and support for these heroes and their families. I \nthank my colleagues for their support of these bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/15/senate-section/article/S4931-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, this coming Monday, the Senate will begin \nhistoric debate on tobacco legislation. This debate represents a once-\nin-a-lifetime opportunity to reduce teenage smoking, a once-in-a-\nlifetime opportunity to save lives.\n  The window of opportunity opened by last year's tobacco settlement is \nclosing fast, and that means we simply have to keep this process \nmoving. We have to pass a comprehensive bill and we have to pass it \nnow.\n  A comprehensive bill, Mr. President. That means we have to raise the \nprice of tobacco. But it means much more than that alone. It means a \npublic education campaign. It means limits on tobacco advertising. It \nmeans punishing tobacco companies if, in the future, we do not meet the \ngoals we set for reducing teen smoking. Finally, it means enhanced \nenforcement so a black market does not develop.\n  There will be a great temptation as we go through this lengthy debate \nfor us to get sidetracked over the coming weeks into debates on \ncountless side issues. It is important that we not give in to that \ntemptation. We need to keep our eyes firmly on a much larger goal, and \nthat goal is saving the lives of America's children from tobacco and \nfrom illegal drugs. Frankly, the only way we can achieve this goal is \nto pass a comprehensive bill, a comprehensive bill that is focused on \nour one goal, reducing tobacco and drug use among our young people. For \nthe reasons that I will outline in a moment, a piecemeal approach \nsimply will not work. A piecemeal approach will fail.\n  I commend the majority leader, Senator Lott, for his leadership in \nbringing this matter to the Senate floor. Now it is up to all of us to \nmake the most of that opportunity. That is what I want to talk about \ntoday.\n  When a problem generates this much attention, we have to be all the \nmore vigilant to make sure we pay attention to the light rather than to \nthe heat; the facts, not the rhetoric.\n  Fact: 3,000 children start to smoke every day.\n  Fact: 1,000 of them are going to die early as a result of that.\n  Fact: We now have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to save these \nlives, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do this through \ncomprehensive legislation to reduce teenage smoking.\n  Fact: The number of legislative days we have left in this session in \nwhich to do this is rapidly shrinking.\n  Fact: If we do not do this now, it may never happen. The opportunity \nmay never come again.\n  Fact: 1,000 early deaths caused every day by smoking. We need to act \nand we need to act now.\n  These are the facts. We cannot allow tobacco companies to lie about \nthese facts or to obscure the fact that tobacco and illegal drugs \ntogether pose America's greatest public health challenge to our \nchildren. This is a huge challenge to our future. And we need a truly \ncomprehensive approach to meet this challenge of tobacco and of illegal \ndrugs.\n\n  What I would like to do over the next few minutes is examine some of \nthe elements of the proposed tobacco legislation in a serious, and \nmaybe even clinical, manner in an effort to try to determine which \napproaches work best in reducing smoking among our young people.\n  What works, Mr. President? What works to reduce teenage smoking? That \nis the key question. In fact, it is the only question that we should \nfocus on as we debate tobacco legislation.\n  Let me begin by discussing the most controversial element of the \nvarious proposed tobacco bills--a tax on cigarettes.\n  Mr. President, the question of whether tobacco taxes will work in \nreducing teen smoking comes down to the question of how sensitive teen \nsmokers are to changes in price. The way the economists phrase this \nquestion is: How elastic is the demand? How responsive is it? Does it \ngo down when prices go up?\n  Mr. President, writing tobacco legislation would be a very easy task \nif the demand were very sensitive and responsive to prices. Then all we \nwould need to do is increase the cost of a pack of cigarettes, and kids \nwould stop smoking and their lives would be saved, and that would be \nit.\n  Regrettably, it is not that simple. Reputable individuals and \norganizations in the field of public health have studied this very \nquestion and are certainly far from a consensus.\n  In 1991, a study published in the Journal of Health Economics \nconcluded that there is no statistically significant correlation \nbetween cigarette prices and youth smoking. However, a National Cancer \nInstitute expert panel stated in 1993 that ``a substantial increase in \ntobacco excise taxes may be the single most effective measure for \ndecreasing tobacco consumption,'' and that ``an excise tax reduces \nconsumption by children and teenagers at least as much as it reduces \nconsumption by adults.''\n  Mr. President, the confusion continues. The Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention have data indicating that in five of the six \nStates that raised cigarette taxes between 1993 and 1995 that teen \nsmoking actually increased.\n  Yet, two reports published by the Surgeon General in 1994 and 1998 \nreached the opposite conclusion--that young people are at least as \nsensitive to price increases as adults.\n  Take all of these different findings together and they raise very \nserious questions about a tobacco-fighting strategy that is anchored \nsolely by tax increases, or by an increase in the cost of cigarettes.\n  Here is what I think, Mr. President, based on my experience in \nworking over the years against illegal drugs, based on my experience in \nworking against driving under the influence of alcohol, that crusade, \nthat effort: There is no one single remedy. There is no one single \nsolution. I believe that raising tobacco costs will have an impact, but \nwill only have an impact if that is included as part of the \ncomprehensive approach, if the increase in tobacco prices is \naccompanied by advertising, by counteradvertising, by pulling down the \npro-tobacco advertising on TV, by strict law enforcement. All of these \nthings, I believe, have to come together. You cannot succeed in this \neffort without that kind of comprehensive approach. Raising the cost of \ntobacco will help, but it is simply not enough. To meet this kind of \nchallenge, we need a comprehensive approach, one that will harness many \ndifferent elements in the common purpose of saving children's lives.\n\n  In addition to raising the price of cigarettes, what else must we \ninclude in that comprehensive package? I outlined that a moment ago, \nbut I would like to talk now in a little more detail about some of the \nother things that I think are necessary to do in addition to increasing \nthe price of cigarettes.\n  Public education. Let's start with public education. My own \nexperience with public education on health issues, Mr. President, would \nindicate to me that it does, in fact, work. Let me give you and my \nother colleagues an example.\n  Over the last several decades, we in this country have made \ntremendous progress in making our streets safer from alcohol-impaired \ndrivers. Back when I was in the Ohio State Senate, I wrote legislation \ntoughening our State's law on driving under the influence. But even \nmore important than\n\n[[Page S4933]]\n\nthe laws we passed was the fact that we were able--all of us, \ncollectively, working together--to begin to change public attitudes. \nThis has been done by tough laws, but it has also been done by very \neffective advertising by groups such as the Mothers Against Drunk \nDriving.\n  It was a national campaign, and it made a difference. Talk to kids \ntoday and you will not find many who believe that driving while under \nthe influence of alcohol is ``cool'' or a great thing to do. The people \nwho do it today are treated with scorn, as they should be. See how \noften ``designated drivers'' are talked about today--a concept that 20 \nyears ago nobody had ever heard about. Attitudes have been changed \nbecause of advertising. They have been changed because of what public \nofficials--not just politicians, but people in the public sector--have \nbeen able to do and talk about. We have all, collectively, been able to \nchange the culture. That is what we have done in regard to drinking and \ndriving. That is what we have to do now in regard to teenage smoking.\n  I think we have to implement a similar strategy in regard to tobacco. \nWe have to make a massive national investment in educating our young \npeople and in changing attitudes. We should flood the airwaves with the \ntruth--a positive advertising and education campaign to leave no doubt \nwhere America stands on this issue, to leave no doubt what the facts \nare. Tobacco and the use of it may be legal, but it still kills people. \nOur message must simply be: stay away from it.\n  Mr. President, we can do this. We have done it in other areas, and \neverything in our life and common sense indicates to us that it works. \nThose of us who are Members of the U.S. Senate, every single one of us, \nuse a significant amount of TV advertising to get elected. Why did we \ndo it? We did it because it works. Why do all the major products use \nadvertising? Because it works. Why do all the national efforts in \nregard to drunken driving use this very creative type of advertising? \nBecause it works. That is what we have to have in regard to this \ntobacco situation.\n  Let me talk further now about another element, a third element, in \nregard to this comprehensive package that I think has to be part of the \nbill that we finally approve. That has to do with limiting the type of \ntobacco advertising. The third proposal to reduce teenage smoking is to \nregulate the broadcast media in an effort to block the pro-tobacco \nmessage. We begin to run into some constitutional problems here, which \nI would like to discuss. The more constitutional lawyers look into this \nsuggestion, the more problematic it becomes. Basically, it is going to \nbe hard to achieve this objective without the agreement of the tobacco \ncompanies. I think we have to understand that.\n  In recent years, the Supreme Court has struck down as many as a dozen \nlaws attempting to regulate commercial speech. In effect, the Court is \nreminding those of us in the legislative branch that the first \namendment's guarantee of freedom of speech is an important \nconstitutional value. As we look for national solutions to the tobacco-\nspawned health crisis, we would do well to remember that Congress \ncannot unilaterally restrict speech.\n  Specifically, the Court would most likely apply to any of the \nproposed limits on tobacco advertising the four-pronged test \nestablished by the 1980 case of Central Hudson Gas & Electric \ncorporation versus Public Service Commission.\n  And it is more than likely, Mr. President, that the proposed limits \nwould fail the tests laid out in that case--unless we had the agreement \nof those whose speech we seek to limit.\n  Those are the facts.\n  Under Central Hudson Gas, the first test to determine whether \ncommercial speech is Constitutionally protected is: Is the speech \nfalse, misleading, or unlawful?\n  Mr. President, the days are long gone when tobacco could run ads \nsaying that smoking is good for your health. Those old advertising \ncampaigns may have failed this test. I think today's campaigns are \nclever enough--and empty enough--not to make any false claims, at least \nunder that court decision.\n  The second test is: Does the limit on speech serve a substantial \ngovernment interest? This is closely related to the third test: Does \nthe limit on speech directly advance that substantial interest?\n  And on these tests, Mr. President, the weight of Constitutional \nopinion is against unilateral limits on tobacco advertising. Two of \nAmerica's foremost Constitutional scholars have testified in Senate \nhearings on this issue.\n  Floyd Abrams--America's leading expert on First Amendment law--told \nthe Commerce Committee, and I quote:\n\n       Any legislation of Congress which would purport to do by \n     law what the proposed settlement would do by agreement in \n     terms of restricting constitutionally protected commercial \n     speech is, in my estimation, destined to be held \n     unconstitutional. * * * It is a basic tenet of First \n     Amendment law that * * * the interest in protecting children \n     from harmful materials ``does not justify an unnecessarily \n     broad suppression of speech directed at adults.'' * * * The \n     sweep of the proposed settlement's restrictions on speech are \n     simply not tailored to its supposed aim of protecting \n     children.\n\n  And Harvard's Laurence Tribe--author of one of America's most \ninfluential Constitutional law textbooks--testified before the \nJudiciary Committee that, quote, ``the proposed restrictions on tobacco \nadvertising would raise very serious First Amendment questions if they \nwere to be enacted into law by Congress.''\n  The fourth and final test under this case asks: Is the limit on \nspeech no more extensive than necessary to achieve the goal? On this \ntoo, the critics will note that if the same goal of reducing smoking \ncan be achieved without recourse to speech limits, then the \nConstitutional claims of the speech regulators would fall.\n  Let me stress, Mr. President, that I am not talking about my own \nopinion of the Constitutionality of these measures. That would be a \nsubject for another speech, another day. What I am talking about is the \nimmense practical problem posed for us, by the likely opinion of the \nU.S. Supreme Court based on those previous decisions.\n  It's likely that the Supreme Court would find these unilateral \nmeasures unconstitutional.\n  The tobacco companies would love that. They would love to change the \nsubject. We must not allow them to do that.\n  Remember the goal: We are trying to save children's lives. We are \ndriving toward the end zone in the fight against these tobacco \ncompanies. We must not--must not--let ourselves get trapped into \nincurring useless penalties on the way.\n  This fight is too important--we cannot let it be reduced to passing \nlegislation that will never be enforced. Our goal is to pass effective \nlegislation--not legislation that will tie up our anti-smoking measures \nin court for years and years.\n  It's about results. It's about saving lives. We have to remember \nthat.\n  Let me now turn to a fourth and final element in proposed tobacco \nlegislation--the lookback provision. In my view, Mr. President, the \nlookback provision is a key component of any solid and effective \nantitobacco bill. It's a way to hold the tobacco companies liable for \nthe bottom line on this effort to reduce teen smoking.\n  Put simply, Mr. President, the lookback provision says to the tobacco \ncompanies: If we fail to achieve our goal of substantial reductions in \nteen smoking, you--the tobacco companies--will pay. You will pay. You \nwill pay a lot. We think that will serve as a deterrent. We think, Mr. \nPresident, that will affect the future conduct of tobacco companies.\n\n  Now, on this one too, Mr. President, the constitutional lawyers are \nraining on our parade. They point out that the kind of lookback \nprovision we need may well run afoul of Constitutional guarantees of \nsubstantive due process. They could hold the tobacco industry liable \nfor actions and results not strictly under the industry's control--and \nthus be Constitutionally inadmissible.\n  But I think the solution to this problem--and indeed to that of the \nFirst Amendment problem with ad limits--is relatively clear. The \ngovernment may not be able to do these things by itself. But it can do \nthem, if the industry agrees to them voluntarily.\n  This, Mr. President, gives us--public officials who are concerned \nwith public health--an incentive to insist on a comprehensive solution, \nand not a piecemeal approach.\n  Acting unilaterally, we can punish the tobacco industry. And let me \nmake\n\n[[Page S4934]]\n\nclear--there's a great deal to be said for that. Their product has \ndestroyed lives.\n  But if we act not unilaterally, but instead approve a comprehensive \nsolution, then we can harness all our efforts in the interest of the \npublic good. And we can hold the tobacco companies accountable \nfor helping reduce teen smoking.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, America's attention is engaged by a children's health \ncrisis caused by tobacco and illegal drugs. This is a rare and unique \nopportunity for us here in the Congress to create some positive \nchange--change that will save lives. We owe it to the American people \nto write tobacco legislation that represents the best thinking on what \nwill really work to get kids to turn away from tobacco and illegal \ndrugs, and toward a more promising future. I will continue to work \nthroughout our legislative process to make sure the bill we pass lives \nup to what the American people deserve.\n  I hope the President of the United States will become more involved \nin this struggle. This, frankly, is an issue of great national \nimportance--one that cries out for Presidential leadership.\n  Mr. President, even after we pass a bill in the Senate, there will \nstill be a lot of work left to be done on this legislation--and frankly \nand candidly, it won't get done until everybody sits at the table and \ngets ready for some heavy lifting.\n  This includes the leadership of the Senate and the House, of course, \nand also the President of the United States. The President can make a \nhuge difference in this process once he becomes fully engaged.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I remain optimistic that we can pass a strong \nand comprehensive bill, not just to reduce teen smoking but also teen \ndrug use. Last year's settlement through the States' attorneys general \nand tobacco companies has given us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n  As this legislation moves through Congress, I believe we have to stay \nfocused. We have to stay focused on the issue of saving children's \nlives. Let's vow to put together comprehensive legislation that really \nworks. Let's do it now. And let's get it done. Mr. President, it will \nnot be easy.\n  I again congratulate the majority leader for his leadership and for \nhis courage in bringing this bill to the floor.\n  I congratulate all who have worked on this bill and other bills--\nSenator McCain, who has worked on this bill and brings this bill to the \nfloor; Senator Hatch and others who have worked on other bills and \nother approaches. We are all going to have the opportunity next week to \nhave our shot. We are all going to have our opportunity to work to try \nto fashion a good bill.\n  The main thing, however, is that we keep the process moving, that we \nkeep it moving in the Senate, that we pass a bill that is \ncomprehensive, that is practical, that we send it on to the House of \nRepresentatives, and ultimately then get it into a conference committee \nand to the President of the United States.\n  Frankly, it is only going to be at that time that tough, tough \ndecisions are ultimately going to be made and that the package will \nfinally be put together. But if we do not do our work in the Senate, if \nwe do not keep the process moving, then we will have missed this \nhistoric opportunity. So the ball is in our court beginning next week. \nI fully expect the Senate to take up the bill, and I expect us to do \nwhat is in the best interests of our children and in the best interests \nof the future of this country.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, at this point I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, might I inquire as to the nature of the \nproceedings of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is conducting morning business. \nSenators are recognized for 5 minutes each.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/15/senate-section/article/S4932-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4934-S4936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TOBACCO\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to have the opportunity of \ncommenting on a matter which is a matter of great discussion in \nWashington and around the country. It is the so-called tobacco \nsettlement. I say ``so-called'' because I think this is more about \ntaxes than it is about tobacco. It is more about big government than it \nis about teen smoking. This is a measure of the magnitude of which \nobscures most of the things we have considered for a long time, at \nleast those things considered in my time in the U.S. Senate.\n  Now, Washington may be entering a new era of surplus politics, but \nits inhabitants have yet to reject the sentiment that was expressed by \nKing Henry IV nearly 600 years ago. He put it this way: You have gold \nand I want gold. Where is it? Well, that may be something that really \ndescribes America right now because this measure which is flying under \nthe flag of the tobacco settlement is really a massive tax increase on \nthe people of this great country.\n  This tax increase would total about $860-some billion--that is the \noriginal bill before it went to the Finance Committee. I don't know \nwhether the increase from $1.10 to $1.50 a pack added in the Finance \nCommittee is even reflected in those figures. We are talking about an \n$800 billion increase in taxes and it will be focused on people who \nmake less than $30,000 a year. These are hard-working families, \ngenerally families with small children, at the beginning of their \nearning potential in life. To focus $860 billion in new taxes on those \nindividuals is a very serious question.\n  As a matter of fact, that kind of serious question of $860 billion in \nnew taxes and then about 17 new boards, agencies, commissions, et \ncetera, in government to spend the money is so obvious a question that \nI objected to moving to this bill very expeditiously, very rapidly. It \nlooked to me like there was going to be a rush to try and get into this \nbill, and we would somehow be asked to have consideration of this bill \nwhich was not thorough and did not have the kind of complete debate and \ndialog which I think the Senate of the United States ought to have, and \nwhich I think we were created to have.\n  The founders of this great country said that the Senate of the United \nStates was like the saucer; the cup was the House, and it was supposed \nto be a place where there were hot passions and emotions, but you spill \nthings over into the saucer. It is a place where things cool. You \nshould have the time to look at things carefully in the U.S. Senate. \nYou should have the capacity to thoroughly discuss things. There should \nbe open discussion. We have had a policy and a heritage in this great \nbody of making sure that all the anticipatable consequences and results \nand affects of a particular proposed policy could be understood and \ndebated and discussed here.\n  If I have the assurance that that is the strategy which we will \npursue, that it will be a Senate strategy of complete discussion, that \nwe will not unduly or inappropriately limit the kinds of amendments \nwhich are offered, that we are going to have an open discussion, that \nwe are not going to rush in and impose cloture to stampede the Senate \nto a conclusion in what is a pretty highly charged and emotional area, \nthen I have no objection to proceeding. I wouldn't object to proceeding \nto this bill unless I thought it was going to be something that was a \nmust-do project and that the definition of ``discussion'' would be \nsomeone's time objective rather than a quality objective. The ultimate \nobjective that we should have when we are discussing things in the U.S. \nSenate should be the quality of our output, not whether or not we want \nto get home for a vacation or take a break.\n\n  My own view is that I really do not want to stand in the way of this \nparticular measure being considered, but I don't want anything to stand \nin the way of this measure being considered thoroughly, and that there \nbe a full opportunity to provide debate, and that\n\n[[Page S4935]]\n\nthere be the potential for amendment which is thorough, which would \nprovide the opportunity for alternatives so if we want to reach our \nreal objective of somehow curtailing the adverse impacts of cigarettes \non the young people of America, we wouldn't be locked in to some narrow \nset of agreements or agencies or taxes, but that we would think \ncarefully about how it is done.\n  I simply want to say and make clear my position that while I did \noppose a unanimous consent to move to this bill, I am not locked into a \nposition of saying we should not consider tobacco. If I believed that \nwe have an opportunity to consider the so-called tobacco settlement \nfully and thoroughly and fairly in the great tradition of the Senate, \nthen I am more than willing to proceed to consideration of this matter.\n  As a matter of fact, I would like to begin the discussion of the \nmatter today talking about some of the things that I think are most \ndifficult about this bill, and perhaps I think ought best be \ncharacterized as unwise. The Federal budget surplus is likely to exceed \n$45 billion this year, and you wonder why Congress would be considering \nmassive new taxes if we are finally in a place of surplus. You would \nthink we should be debating how to give money back to the American \npeople instead of taking more money from the American people.\n  When our decision is to take money from the American people, our \ndecision is basically that they can't spend it as wisely on their \nfamilies as we can spend it on their families. After all, the families \nof America are what we are spending our resources on one way or the \nother. If we believe we are so much smarter than they are for meeting \nthe needs of their family, we should take the money from them and spend \nit. But if we have a good awareness that American families know what \nthey need and how to spend their money better than we can spend it on \nthem, we ought to let American families have their resources to spend \non themselves.\n  There are some things that have to be done collectively. We know \nabout those things--certain law enforcement functions, national \ndefense, certain government programs--but the never-\nending explosion of taking the resources from families, suggesting that \nwe have better things to do with that money than families do, is a \npresumption in which I will not imagine and I certainly will not \npersist.\n  I intend to fight to kill any tobacco bill that contains a tax \nincrease of the magnitude being considered.\n  When you are talking about over $800 billion for smokers, for \nexample, the tax that will be imposed against them and on them as a \nresult of this bill will be 50 times greater--50 times greater--than \nthe tax relief we gave them last year. I am not a person who has chosen \nto smoke, and I am not a person who is associated with the tobacco \nindustry. I don't know of a single smoker in my family. It hasn't been \nin my family. It wasn't in my father's family. We were taught that \ntobacco was evil from day one. Speaking of old-time English kings, King \nJames warned citizens of England hundreds of years ago that tobacco was \nbad for their health. I think people have known it. I don't think it is \nsneaking up on anybody. I think most Americans know that tobacco is not \ngood for you. If you are close to someone who is smoking and you start \nchoking, I think you understand that this stuff is not good for you. We \nknow the pollutants contained in the byproducts of combustion, smoke, \nare bad even if you are just walking down a city street and get too \nmany diesel fumes from a bus. So it is not a matter of not knowing.\n  The question is, Are we going to have a tobacco bill that taxes the \nAmerican people at an incredibly high level--$860 billion-plus in new \ntaxes--and that says to a fellow who chooses to smoke, in spite of what \nhe knows, that, well, the kind of tax that you are going to pay is 50 \ntimes greater than any relief we have given you previously? This is a \nmassive tax increase that will be inflicted on those who are least able \nto pay. Some estimates suggest that this tobacco bill would increase \ntaxes by over $860 billion. This development of 17 new responsibilities \nin Government--for boards, commissions, or agencies, or, I suppose--and \nI hear there is a proposal now to take the formal boards, commissions, \nagencies out and allow them to be created not in the statute but by \ndepartment heads on their own later on, so we would sort of fly the \ncommissions, boards, and agencies below the radar screen of the \nAmerican people.\n  The truth is, if you are going to spend $860 billion, you are going \nto have bureaucrats do it. Over 5 years, the hike would increase taxes \n$109 billion, more than erasing the entire effect of the measure of the \ntax relief we provided last year. Of course, I will mention that 60 \npercent of those who would be paying these taxes earn less than $30,000 \na year. That really means these are, in many cases, young couples, \ncouples with children. They are going to be bearing the burden of this \ntax increase. The Finance Committee came up with the idea that these \ntaxes be increased by $1.50 a pack for cigarettes. Now, if you have a \nyoung family with a mother who smokes one pack a day and the father \nsmokes two, that is $4.50 a day that the Government would be taking \nfrom that family. Over the course of a month, I think that is $140 a \nmonth, and 12 times 14, if my math serves me correctly, would be close \nto $1,600 a year. Now, that is serious. That is very serious. In my \njudgment, we have to think carefully about that kind of tax increase.\n  Mr. President, maybe you will do the math for me. I was doing that \nmath in my head, so it may not be $1,600; it may be more than $1,600. I \nthink it would be.\n  But the point is, this is a massive tax increase on people. What \nabout the children in those families? The whole presumption of this \nidea that we can collect the $868 billion is that people are so \naddicted, they can't stop, so we will tax them. In spite of the fact \nthat taxes are going up, there is going to be persistent use. On one \nhand, they say these taxes are going to keep people from smoking. On \nthe other hand, they put a lot of money in the budget saying people \nwon't be able to stop smoking and therefore we will get the money. It \nseems to me there is a little tension between these two arguments. It \nis a massive tax increase. It seems to me the only thing more addictive \nthan nicotine is taxing and spending in the Congress.\n  People are going to say this is about teenage smoking, but this bill \ndoesn't even make teenage smoking illegal in Washington, DC. This \ndoesn't make teenage smoking illegal or unlawful in the Capitol or in \nthe Senate office buildings. We are talking about what kind of messages \nwe want to send to our teenagers. This Congress, the U.S. Senate, has \nnever cared enough about the role modeling it does to forbid smoking in \nthe in the U.S. Capitol or in the Senate office buildings. We are up \nhere saying we are going to try and stop teenagers from smoking, and we \nstand around--I don't--and we don't stop smoking, we don't curtail \nsmoking. We provide incentives. We make sure there are plenty of \nashtrays. If you want to use the stairs in our buildings, that is where \nthey put the ashtrays. If you need to draw a deep breath after four or \nfive flights of stairs, you can be sure that because of our policy we \nwill have a role model there smoking for you.\n\n  If we are really serious about teen smoking, there are other things \nto do other than raising taxes by $868 billion. If Washington gets its \nway, excise taxes will increase by $1.50 a pack. Now, my view is that \nthis is not the kind of tax increase I was sent here to be involved \nin--an $868 billion increase on the taxes of the working people in this \ncountry. This is not what Republicans were sent here to do.\n  Lots of Republicans are fond of talking about Ronald Reagan. Well, \npeople who make less than $30,000 a year frequently--some of them are \nRepublicans, but some are what we call Reagan Democrats. Ronald Reagan \nwas understood by those people to care for them, and he was understood \nby those people to be sensitive to their plight. They were called \nReagan Democrats because of it. This is a tax increase that is aimed \nright at Reagan Democrats. It will take the money and resources right \nout of their pockets, send it to Washington, keep them from being able \nto spend it on their own families.\n  Taxes are at an all-time high. Never before in the history of this \ncountry have taxes been so high. Just last week, on May 10, was tax \nfreedom day\n\n[[Page S4936]]\n\nthis year. That means the average citizen had to work until May 10 in \norder to pay their taxes. The rest of the year, he or she can work for \nhis or her family. What a deal. And we are going to add $868 billion to \nthat burden? Pretty soon, we will be working more for the Government \nthan for our families. If we think Government ought to be a bigger \ninfluence in this culture than families, I think we are sadly mistaken. \nWhether we succeed or fail in the next century is dependent on good, \nstrong families. If moms and dads and families do their job, governing \nAmerica will be easy. But if moms and dads and families can't do their \njob, governing America will be impossible. We cannot make it impossible \nfor families to do the job that families ought to do in this country.\n  Total taxes as a share of total income have reached an all-time high \nin the United States of America. When I was born, in 1942, taxes as a \nshare of the total income amounted to 21.1 percent. That was during the \nwar--the big war, WW-II. Yet, that was 21.1 percent as a total share of \nincome. We are approaching twice that much now. We are over 35 percent \nas a total share of income. It is time for us to come to the conclusion \nthat if families are important in this country, leaving them with some \nof the money they earn is important, and an $860 billion-plus tax \nincrease would be inappropriate.\n  Today, the median two-income family can expect to pay 37.5 percent of \nits income in Federal, State, and local taxes--37.5 percent. Three-\neighths--3 out of every 8 days are devoted to paying the Government. It \nis getting worse. Taxpayers are working longer, harder than ever before \nto pay their taxes. It is time for us to think carefully about \nproviding relief, rather than a massive increase in taxes.\n  The proposed tobacco bill is nothing more than an excuse for \nWashington to raise taxes and spend more money on new Federal programs. \nI will fight to kill any tobacco tax bill that contains a tax increase \nof the magnitude being considered. I didn't come here, and I don't \nthink we were sent here, to have a massive raid on the families of \nAmerica and their ability to provide for the needs of their families. \nWhat we are talking about is a cut in pay for Americans. We cut their \npay by taking it when they earn it. I just do not think a pay cut for \nAmerican families is what is needed at this moment. I think this \ncountry knows that if there is a cut anywhere, it should be a cut in \nGovernment, not a cut in families. I think we have to understand that \nis what we are talking about. So I urge my colleagues to oppose this \nlegislation, which is a massive tax increase. It is a tax burden \nfocused on those making less than $30,000 a year. The vast majority of \nthe taxpayers who will pay the $860-plus billion will be people making \nless than $30,000 a year. I think of the kids of those moms and dads, \nwho are both working and blue-collar folks, that they want to be able \nto do well by and do well for. We plan to tax them with the most, the \nlion's share of the burden of an $868 billion tax increase.\n\n  I reiterate again my position. I rose to object to moving to this \nbill when I thought we might be moving to it in haste; and that our \nconsideration of the bill might be limited and compressed and \ninappropriately telescoped. It might be drawn together in such a way \nthat we wouldn't have a thorough opportunity to debate this. It could \nbe that I am wrong. With proper assurance that we would have the kind \nof full range of Senate debate, with the complete opportunity for \namendment and that we will not be clotured so as to preclude the kind \nof debate that is necessary and appropriate in this respect, I don't \nmind moving forward to this issue. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't \nobject to moving forward to the issue. We must, however, consider this \nissue based on its merits and not based on a schedule or convenience. \nThis is too important an issue and too substantial a set of stakes for \nus to ignore the kind of full debate that the Senate rightfully should \nprovide.\n  It is with that in mind that I rise to oppose this measure and to \nindicate my position on considering the measure. I hope when we have \nthe opportunity to debate this measure fully, we will be able to see \nthat a tax increase of that magnitude is not in the best interest of \nthe American people. It is not in the best interest of the future of \nAmerica. It is not a measure that really augurs well for the children \nof America. It is really a big government extension of the heavy hand \nof government in the pocketbooks of American families.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want to be recognized for a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Before I do that, let me commend the junior Senator from Missouri. He \nis right on target. I would like to share with him that in the last 2 \nweeks I had over 20 town hall meetings in the State of Oklahoma. In not \none meeting did anyone bring up this thing and initiate the discussion. \nI think this is really a beltway issue. When I brought it up and told \nthem about the massive tax increase--the largest single tax increase, \nwith the stroke of one pen that this results in--they were all very, \nvery much against it. I think some people will try to use this as \nsomehow a way to stop children from smoking when, in fact, it would not \nstop children from smoking.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Oregon that \nI be recognized for as much time as I may consume as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nNational Peace Officers Memorial Day, a day to commemorate and \nacknowledge the dedication and sacrifice made by the men and women who \nhave lost their lives while serving as law enforcement officers.\n  The men and women who serve this Nation as our guardians of law and \norder do so at great personal risk. There are very few communities in \nthe United States that have not been touched by the senseless death of \na police officer.\n  In Oregon we have seen our share of loss. In January in a standoff \nbetween the Portland police and a man with a high-powered SKS military \nrifle, Colleen Waibel, a 17-year veteran of the Portland Police Bureau, \nwas shot and killed. Two other officers, Kim Keist and Sgt. James \nHudson, were wounded in that same standoff. In July of last year, \nThomas Jeffries, a Portland police officer, was shot and killed. In \n1984, a Washington County sheriff's deputy, Robert Talburt, also died \nin the line of duty.\n  Mr. President, because of the dedication and sacrifice of our \nNation's police officers, our communities are safer and our children \nhave a better chance of receiving their education in a crime-free \nenvironment.\n  Today, more than 15,000 peace officers are expected to gather in our \nNation's Capital, together with the families of their recently fallen \ncomrades. The National Peace Officers Memorial Day provides our country \nan opportunity to show these public servants that their efforts on our \nbehalf and those of their fallen comrades are greatly appreciated.\n  To the surviving families of those officers who have paid the \nultimate price, this day will show that their sacrifice will always be \nremembered.\n  Mr. President, I am a proud cosponsor of Senate Resolution 201 \ndesignating May 15, 1998, as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. I \nurge my colleagues to join Senator Kempthorne, myself, and others, in \nrecognizing this important day.\n  I thank the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I would like to say to the Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S4937]]\n\nOregon that I applaud him for this, and I would ask that my name be \nincluded as one of his original cosponsors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/15/senate-section/article/S4936-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4937-S4939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       PROHIBITING CONVEYANCE OF LAND AT LONG BEACH NAVAL STATION\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to share with you and with my \ncolleagues something I think is quite significant that is taking place, \nand also to correct some of the things that I have said that I found to \nbe untrue.\n  I was on the floor yesterday introducing an amendment to the 1999 \nSenate defense authorization bill. In this authorization bill, I have \nan amendment that would stop the transfer of land in California at Long \nBeach to the COSCO, which is the Chinese Ocean Shipping Company. I \nwould like to share why this is an important amendment.\n  I don't criticize any of my fellow Senators. But when I started \ntalking about this yesterday, and I moved to set aside the Feinstein \namendment in order to consider my amendment to stop the transfer of \nland to COSCO out in California, there was objection to that unanimous \nconsent request. In a way, I think that is good because it gives me an \nopportunity to go into a lot more detail and to talk on some talk radio \nshows to alert America as to the seriousness of something that is \nhappening out there.\n  I would like to start off by saying, however, that when I talked on \nthe floor about the fact that President Clinton signed a waiver back in \n1996, and then another waiver in 1998 that allowed the transfer of \ntechnology to the Chinese, this was something that I thought was done \nin secret. I found out just this morning that it was not done in \nsecret. He signed a waiver. He apparently did not disobey any law or \nviolate any law in so doing. However, since I am a member of both the \nIntelligence Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I \nwas not aware that he signed the waiver in 1996 or 1998, and not one of \nmy colleagues who I have talked to was aware of it, I reasonably \nassumed that it was done in secret.\n  To kind of give you the sequence in which this happened, I will tell \nyou, Mr. President, that in June of 1989 we all saw what happened on \nthe Tiananmen Square. At that time, as a result of the Tiananmen Square \nmassacre, our country imposed some sanctions banning U.S. trade in \ndual-use technology. The President retains the power to grant waivers \non a case-by-case basis. It seems to me that this President has an \nobsession in granting waivers and preferential treatment to China. In a \nminute I am going to read an article from this morning's New York Times \nthat might shed a little light as to why the President was doing this. \nLet me finish with this sequence of events.\n\n  From 1990 to 1995, there were some waivers given for certain \ntechnologies. In 1995, President Clinton offered a waiver for \ncommercial satellites, allowing U.S. satellites to be launched on \nChinese rockets. The Loral Corporation--maybe it was a coincidence--\nwhich was the single largest contributor to the Democratic National \nCommittee in two Presidential elections, in 1992 and 1996, took \nadvantage of this waiver. So we had our commercial satellites placed on \nrockets that were designed and manufactured by the Chinese government. \nAnyway, one of these rockets went off, and there was an explosion in \n1996, and they went in to investigate as to why the explosion took \nplace. In 1998, just 2 months ago, in February of this year, the \nPresident granted another waiver allowing the transfer of information \nto China which gave them more reliability and accuracy in their \nmissiles.\n  Now, I would like to put this in a context that is easier to \nunderstand for a lot of people who are not involved in these issues. I \nam from the State of Oklahoma. It is a known fact--there is nothing \nclassified about it--that both China and Russia have missiles that can \nreach the United States from anyplace in China or Russia. Specifically, \nin the case of China, they have their CS-4 missile that has a range of \n8,000 kilometers, and by going the polar route, it will reach anyplace \nin the continental United States or any part of the United States. So \nthis missile will do it.\n  However, with the technology the Chinese had before the President \nallowed our technology to go over there and give them more accuracy, \ntheir missile could hit my State of Oklahoma but it could not pinpoint \nany particular city like Oklahoma City or Tulsa or Fort Sill or any of \nour military establishments. With this technology, it gives them the \naccuracy to do that. So that is what the President did. I am very \nconcerned about this obsession that the President has to share \neverything that we have with the Chinese.\n  Let's keep in mind we are talking about the China Ocean Shipping \nCompany. It is not just owned by the Chinese. It is owned and run by \nthe Communist Chinese military. It was only a week ago Monday that the \nWashington Times came out and disclosed the content of a CIA report. \nThis report stated that there were some 18 CS-4 missiles that China had \nthat were targeted at various places around the world, and 13 of those \nmissiles are targeted at cities, major cities in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Now, when you get a little bit concerned about the President giving \npreferential treatment to China with all these waivers, allowing them \nto have our technology so they can pinpoint their targets, and then we \nfind out, as I think most of us knew anyway, that there are rockets in \nChina, ICBMs aimed at major cities in the United States of America, it \nis very, very distressing.\n  This morning in the New York Times this article on the front page \nright here says, ``Democrat Fund-Raiser Said to Name China Tie.'' This \nis a major breakthrough, and it may shed some light as to why the \nPresident has been granting these waivers and giving this Presidential \ntreatment, and in my opinion changing his policy to the Far East from \nwhat it was when he ran for President in 1992. I recall that he made \nstatements in opposition to MFN status for China. Now he is the leading \nadvocate for MFN status for China. He was one who was opposed at one \ntime to the normalization of our relations with Vietnam, and, of \ncourse, now, as we all know, he has headed up an effort that has \nsuccessfully normalized those relations. He is right now spending much \nof his time trying to convince Congress to let the IMF bail out some \nFar Eastern banking concerns to the extent of $18 billion.\n\n  Let me just read, Mr. President, the first four paragraphs from this \narticle in the New York Times, ``Democrat Fund-Raiser Said to Name \nChina Tie.''\n\n       A Democratic fund-raiser has told Federal investigators he \n     funneled tens of thousands of dollars from a Chinese military \n     officer to the Democrats during President Clinton's 1996 re-\n     election campaign, according to lawyers and officials with \n     knowledge of the Justice Department's campaign finance \n     inquiry.\n       The fund-raiser, Johnny Chung--\n\n  We all remember Johnny Chung, this friend of President Clinton's of \nlongstanding--\n\n     told investigators that a large part of the nearly $100,000 \n     he gave to Democratic causes in the summer of 1996--including \n     $80,000 to the Democratic National Committee--came from \n     China's People's Liberation Army through a Chinese lieutenant \n     colonel and aerospace executive whose father was Gen. Liu \n     Huaqing, the officials and lawyers said.\n       General Liu was then not only China's top military \n     commander but also a member of the [top] leadership of the \n     Communist Party.\n\n  It goes on to talk about this. It says.\n\n       . . . investigators regard the identification of Ms. Liu--\n\n  This is his daughter--\n\n       as a breakthrough in their long search for conformation of \n     a ``China Plan.'' The hunt was prompted after American \n     intelligence intercepted telephone conversations suggesting \n     that Beijing considered covertly influencing the American \n     elections.\n\n  I am quoting all this out of an article that is in today's New York \nTimes.\n  Now, Mr. President, I do want to go back and address my amendment \nbecause my amendment is going to be before this body this coming \nTuesday, and when it is, I want to make sure that all of my colleagues \nwho are watching right now, or listening, hopefully, have full \nknowledge of exactly what this amendment is all about.\n  First of all, I think it is important to look at what is COSCO. \nCOSCO--that stands for the China Ocean Shipping Company--is owned by \nnot just the Chinese Government, but it is run by China's military. \nCOSCO reports to the Chinese Ministry of Communication which falls \nunder the State Council\n\n[[Page S4938]]\n\nwhich in turn is led by Communist Party politburo member and Premier Li \nPeng.\n  Now, I noticed the other day--I am quite sure it was in the \nWashington Times--that Sven Kramer, who has long served the National \nSecurity Council under both Democratic and Republican administrations--\nI think everyone in this body is familiar with Sven Kramer--said he is \ndisgusted with the cavalier actions of an administration that critics \nsay put a dial-for-dollars campaign ahead of national security. Kramer \nasserts he finds it difficult to believe that the United States would \nsurrender key ports in Long Beach and at either end of the Panama Canal \nto the PLA--that is the People's Liberation Army--led shipping company \ncalled COSCO. He cites the ``foolishness of the intelligence \ncommunity'' for not blowing the whistle on these operations.\n  So we have COSCO as a government-owned shipping company that is \nplanning to take over the land in the Long Beach area which requires \nthe President of the United States to sign a waiver.\n  Now, does anyone doubt that the President will sign this waiver? I \nhave no doubt at all. I can stand on this Senate floor, and say that \nthe President is planning to do that, because any President who signs a \nwaiver allowing, in 1996 and in 1998, the Chinese to have technology \nthat will give their missiles more accuracy to hit targets in the \nUnited States when we already know there are some 13 missiles that are \ntargeted to the United States, would certainly not hesitate to sign \nthis waiver. And so we have areas of concern about this company COSCO.\n  One of these areas of concern is that in March of 1996, in Oakland, \nCA, the COSCO ship Express Phoenix--that is the name of the ship--\ntransported 2,000 illegal Chinese weapons, AK-47s--these are the \nmachine guns, not the AK-47s that will fire one round at a time; those \nare replicas; these are the real things--transported 2,000 illegal \nChinese machine guns to be used on and sold to California street gangs, \nto be used by street gangs. Fortunately, we found out about it and the \nguns were confiscated by the FBI.\n  This is also the same shipping company that has been stopped by the \nU.S. Coast Guard some six times because of various violations. This is \nthe one that, in December of 1996, created a lot of damage to a \nboardwalk in New Orleans in their harbor. It also is the same shipping \ncompany that is in the process of gaining control of both the entrance \nand exit--it depends on which way you are going--of the Panama Canal, \non the Atlantic and on the Pacific sides.\n  So we do have great concern over what COSCO has been doing. Last \nyear, in the 1998 Senate authorization bill, the Senate defense \nauthorization bill, I had an amendment that I wanted to put on. We were \nunsuccessful in getting it on. Congressman Duncan Hunter over in the \nHouse of Representatives was unable to get his amendment on also. So he \nand I have been trying to do it this year. It is an amendment that \nwould stop COSCO from being able to benefit from the transfer of this \nproperty.\n  On April 29, 1998, an appeals court decided that the Port of Long \nBeach followed State law in its environmental review process to plan to \nlease the land of the former Long Beach Naval Station to COSCO. So you \ncan see, we are much closer than we were last year at this time when we \ntried to put these amendments on.\n  Anyway, I applaud Congressman Duncan Hunter, who was able to offer \nand successfully pass an amendment in the House National Security \nCommittee by a margin of 45 to 4. I am introducing an amendment that \ndoes exactly the same thing.\n  For people who are not aware of the process that is used around here, \nwhen you pass the defense authorization bills, they are passed by both \nthe House and the Senate. Those items that are different from the House \nand Senate bills go into a conference committee. That conference \ncommittee is manned by both Members of the House and Members of the \nSenate. I will be a conferee on that conference committee.\n  By passing this amendment this coming Tuesday, we will be able to use \nthe same language as Congressman Duncan Hunter used successfully in \nputting it on the House version of the authorization bill and it will \nnot be what we call a conferenceable item; in other words, it will be \nin there and it will be a done deal. So that is how significant this \nis, that we are able to get this passed.\n  I am hoping, if there is anyone out there who is really concerned \nabout what is going on in our relationship with China, about the China \nmissiles that are targeting sites in the United States, and are \nconcerned about the preferential treatment we have been giving China \nwhen China--and you stop and think about this. Now the administration \nadmits that there are some 25 nations that have weapons of mass \ndestruction, either biological, chemical, or nuclear. And some of these \nnations are run by people who murder their own grandchildren, so they \nwould not have any reluctance about sending a missile in our direction.\n  You might remember Saddam Hussein, who made the statement during the \nPersian Gulf war that if he had just waited a little bit longer to take \nhis action in Kuwait, he might have had a missile that he could have \nused to stop us from interfering with what he was doing in Kuwait. That \nis pretty much a direct threat. You might remember also, it wasn't very \nlong ago, a little over a year ago, when Taiwan was wanting to hold its \nelections and China was trying to intimidate Taiwan, that they were \nfiring missiles in the Taiwan Straits. The second highest Chinese \nmilitary official said: No, we are not concerned about the United \nStates getting in here and getting involved, because they would rather \ndefend Los Angeles than defend Taipei.\n  So, I say there is a threat out there. Those individuals, most of \nthem liberals, most of them who want to continue the demise of our \nmilitary defense system in this country where right now we are \napproximately one-half the force strength we were back in 1991--those \nindividuals like to perpetuate this notion that somehow the cold was is \nover and there is no longer a threat out there, let's take that money \nand put it in social policy. And that is what we have been doing since \nthis President was elected in 1992.\n  With that, while this doesn't resolve all the problems that we have, \nwe still do not have any way of defending ourselves. I hope that \neveryone who is concerned with this issue, who is concerned with the \ntransfer of our technology to China to allow them to pinpoint areas in \nthe United States of America, will be aware of the fact that we do not \nhave a national missile defense in America. How many people in America \nare aware that, if they fire a missile from Beijing and it comes over \ntoward the United States of America, and it is headed for Washington, \nDC, it takes 35 minutes to get over here? If you ask the average \nperson, what would Government do if that should happen--because \ncertainly we have the satellite technology to know when they are \nlaunching these missiles--they say, well, I assume that Government \nwould do something and knock down this missile during that 35 minutes \nit is coming over.\n  Here is the problem. We don't have the capability to do that. \nSomebody very smart, back in 1983, decided they were going to put \ntogether a program to deploy a national missile defense system by \nfiscal year 1998. That is now, fiscal year 1998. They were pretty smart \nback then, because now is when we need it. Now is when the threat is \nout there. Now is when we pick up the newspaper and we see things that \nare happening and that there are countries out there with weapons of \nmass destruction and now with the missile capability of hitting the \nUnited States. We need to do something.\n  The reason we cannot knock down a missile is not that we don't have \nmissiles that will knock down missiles, it is just that in trying to \nadhere to these silly treaties like the ABM Treaty and some of the \nSTART treaties, disarmament treaties, we have agreed with parties in \nthe former Soviet Union not to defend ourselves, or have a system that \nwill adequately defend ourselves against a missile that is coming over \nfrom a foreign country. This is insane that we are doing this, but we \nare.\n  So, while we do have missiles, we can't knock down a missile that is \ncoming over to the United States until it reenters the atmosphere. By \nthat time, you have only 1 or 2 minutes to\n\n[[Page S4939]]\n\nhit it, and it is going at such a velocity, our technology doesn't have \nanything that goes fast enough to knock it down. So we are naked right \nnow to any kind of an attack that comes by way of missile from any of \nthese countries that are out there that have access to missiles.\n\n  Don't think that just because China and Russia are the only countries \nthat have these missiles, and they love us so dearly, supposedly, that \nno other countries can have missiles to deliver these weapons of mass \ndestruction, because we know that both China and Russia are dealing, \nselling their technology to countries like Iran and other countries. So \nthey are going to be able to have these missiles.\n  About a week ago, I was reminded again about how we are being lulled \ninto, I suppose, a euphoric feeling of complacency, that there is not \nany threat out there. In a recent letter to a member of the Senate, \nGen. Henry Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said we \nare going to have 3 years' notice before there is any real threat of \nany missile coming over.\n  He said he thought we would have 3 years' notice because our \nintelligence tells us we are going to have 3 years' notice. It was only \ndays later after he made that statement that we found out about the \nnuclear tests in India. And India--we find out in only this morning's \npaper it is understandable why they are doing this, because with the \npreferential treatment that we have given China, they are trying to \nbuild some type of system that will give them the capability of \ndeterring aggression from the adjoining countries, both China and \nPakistan.\n  So the threat is out there. I suggest, if our intelligence is good \nenough to rely on that we are going to have 3 years' notice before any \nICBM comes over, that is the same intelligence that told us there \nwasn't anything going on in India.\n  On Tuesday, we will be offering this amendment. I am hoping all of my \ncolleagues will be very sensitive to the fact that the No. 1 purpose \nfor Government is to defend Americans against attack. We will have an \nopportunity to go a long way in accomplishing that this coming Tuesday, \nby passing my amendment to the defense authorization bill that will \nstop the transfer of this land from the United States to the China \nOcean Shipping Company.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/15/senate-section/article/S4937-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a section in the \nDigital Millennium Copyright Act that I am particularly proud of, and \nthat is the law enforcement exception in the bill. At the Judiciary \nCommittee markup, Senator Grassley and I, along with the assistance of \nChairman Hatch and Senator Ashcroft worked to strengthen the law \nenforcement exception in the bill. We received input on the language \nfrom the copyright community and the administration: the National \nSecurity Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the \nDepartments of Commerce and Justice, and the Office of Management and \nBudget (OMB).\n  The law enforcement exception ensures that the government continues \nto have access to current and future technologies to assist in their \ninvestigative, protective, or intelligence activities. I am concerned \nthat the tools and resources of our intelligence and law enforcement \ncommunities are preserved--and more importantly, not limited, by \npassage of S. 2037. Under that bill, a company who contracts with the \ngovernment can continue to develop encryption/decryption devices under \nthat contract, without having to worry about criminal penalties.\n  Because much of our leading technologies come from the private \nsector, the government needs to have access to this vital resource for \nintelligence and law enforcement purposes.\n  The law enforcement exception recognizes that oftentimes governmental \nagencies work with non-governmental entities--companies, in order to \nhave access to and develop cutting edge technologies and devices. Such \nconduct should not be prohibited or impeded by this copyright \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/15/senate-section/article/S4939-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/15/senate-section/article/S4939-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Robb):\n       S. 2086.

A bill to revise the boundaries of the George Washington \nBirthplace National Monument; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n       george washington birthplace national monument legislation\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich would preserve a tract of land of legendary historic \nsignificance. Many of my colleagues have heard me speak on the \nimportance of preserving the legacy of George Washington, and have \njoined me as cosponsors of Senate Resolution 83, to commemorate the \nbicentennial of the death of our Founding Father. We have the \nopportunity to protect the scene of George Washington's early life, the \nsite at which young Washington undertook lessons that taught him the \nprinciples which guided his life. By extending the boundaries of the \nGeorge Washington Birthplace National Monument to include the 85 acre \narea in Stafford County, Virginia, known as Ferry Farm, we may \ncelebrate that expanse of land where Washington developed his \nextraordinary character.\n  Ferry Farm was the childhood home of our first President. Lying \nacross the Rappahannock River from historic Fredericksburg, Virginia, \nit is the site of the legendary cherry tree, chopped down by a boy who \ncould not tell a lie. Here, a fable recounts, young Washington threw a \nstone across the Rappahannock, one of the last unspoiled scenic rivers \nin the country. And it was here that Washington developed those \nqualities of honesty, integrity, loyalty, perseverance, and devotion to \npublic good which make him the indomitable role model for our country \nand the world at large. By preserving this site, we will sustain the \nenvironment in which our Founding Father grew into his role as a leader \nin military strategy as well as democratic principles. The exploration, \nresearch, and interpretation of this site\n\n[[Page S4940]]\n\nwill inspire and challenge all who visit to study the life of \nWashington, and his impact on our Nation.\n  Yet this site, the tangled brush, the serene river vista, belies the \nintertwining of history which occurred here. Along the banks of the \nRappahannock, site of the formative years of our distinguished First \nPresident, also became the site of carnage, as our country was torn \nasunder by the ravages of the Civil War. In late April of 1962, the \nUnion Army established Ferry Farm as its strategic crossing point in \norder to advance against Confederate forces west of Fredericksburg. The \nsoldiers stationed at Ferry Farm were not unaware of the irony of their \nposition. As one soldier wrote from his post,\n\n       Could George Washington have beheld * * * with prophetic \n     eye, the havoc that was to be wrought by those mighty hosts \n     of his countrymen in fratricidal strife on the very ground * \n     * * which must have been familiar to him in his youthful days \n     * * * his patriotic soul would have been overwhelmed with \n     grief.\n\n  It is our duty to recognize the history of this site--a reliquary for \nthe memories of a man of great character and courage, as well as a \nmelancholy field upon which our country struggled to preserve \ndemocracy. In saving this parcel of land, we venerate a leader whose \nprincipled life remains as model for us all, while consecrating land \nupon which our Union, for which Washington battled so courageously, \nfought for existence.\n  We cannot forfeit such a landmark to the forces of development. Ferry \nFarm is where Washington learned the values that made him the Father of \nOur Country--values as important to our nation today as they were to \nits establishment more than two hundred and fifty years ago. I look \nforward to the swift passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2086\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, for the last three years, this \nCongress struggled with many of the difficult issues in the Amtrak \nreauthorization bill. We finally reached an agreement late last year \nand sent legislation to the President for his signature, which he \nsigned on December 2, 1997.\n  In the process, my state, and its neighbors, lost a valuable service \non the route of the Pioneer. I fought hard to keep that service running \nbut citizens of eastern Oregon continue to feel frustrated over the \nloss of this service.\n  I want Amtrak to succeed and I want to make sure that the legislation \nwe enacted last year is properly implemented. The Administration is \nlate in submitting its nominations for the Amtrak Reform Board which \nwas created in last year's bill. Although I hear that the \nAdministration has begun the process of picking candidates for the \nseven positions that are required by law, I am concerned that the names \nunder consideration will not represent the various regions of the \ncountry that make up the Amtrak system. If the restoration of the \nPioneer is to receive fair consideration, it must be by a Board of \nDirectors that reflects the regional needs of all sections of the \ncountry. My friend, the Majority Leader, who also sits on the Commerce \nCommittee has made clear on more than one occasion that if Amtrak is \nonly a series of regional corridors and not a national system, it will \nnot continue to receive the support of Congress.\n  While I believe the new Amtrak Board should meet the qualifications \nspelled out in the Act, they should also have a sense of geographical \nbalance. I fear the loss of support for a national system if we wind up \nwith a Board that represents only one region of the country. In \nparticular, the west and mid-western states again appear to be left out \nof consideration as sources of Amtrak director candidates.\n  As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I will be looking for \nregional balance when these nominations are submitted and encourage my \ncolleagues to do so as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/15/senate-section/article/S4941-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I regret that I have to take a few \nmoments and keep the distinguished Senator here, but I don't know \nwhether I will get a chance to talk about the India nuclear blast if I \ndon't do it today. I will be as brief as I can.\n  Yesterday, two committees of the Senate held hearings on India's \nrecent underground nuclear tests. It is my understanding that those \ncommittees, particularly the Select Committee on Intelligence, which \nheard testimony from CIA Director Tenet, are most interested in why the \nUnited States had no advance warning of India's plan. I think the \nSenate needs to be very careful as it reviews the India situation not \nto kill the messenger.\n  The simple fact is that covert nuclear operations are extremely \ndifficult and sometimes impossible to detect. Even before its tests, we \nknew a great deal about India's nuclear weapons program. We were \ncognizant of the readiness of their weapons, that because their test \nsite had been prepared for tests in 1995, they could test on very short \nnotice, and that the newly elected party had campaigned on a platform \nthat included the development of nuclear weapons--all signs that should \nhave made this week's tests less surprising. Yet, we were caught off \nguard. But I do not think that it is entirely the responsibility of our \nintelligence agencies.\n  Since the fall of the Soviet Union, U.S. policymakers have been \nsubject to two sets of pressures, both of which have led us to consider \nreducing our nuclear stockpile to the lowest possible levels and have \nreduced our vigilance.\n  One of those pressures comes from an anti-nuclear movement which \nfeels a moral imperative to abolish nuclear weapons. Everyone knows \nthat we would like to abolish nuclear weapons, but what is going on in \nthe world indicates that that will not occur just because the United \nStates decides to do so.\n  The second pressure comes from our military, and it is felt largely \nin the authorization and appropriations process in the Congress.\n  Today, the emphasis in the Pentagon is on readiness, warfighting \ncapability and nuclear weapons, and the strategic command which is \nresponsible for their use has taken a second-class status to those \nbranches of the service interested in tanks, planes, ships and troop \nreadiness. As a result, we are seeing a diminution of the strategic \ncommand within the Pentagon and across policymakers in the Congress, as \nwell as the administration, and a failure to recognize how attractive \nand important nuclear weapons are.\n  It takes the actions of an India to remind us that for a nation that \nperceives itself as threatened, wants to threaten, demonstrate its \ntechnical prowess or simply wants to join the elite nuclear club, \nnuclear weapons are extremely attractive. That is a deplorable \nsituation, but it is a fact.\n  Unfortunately, in taking the actions it has of the last 2 days, India \nhas destabilized an already precariously balanced region of the world. \nAlthough Pakistan and China were previously aware of India's nuclear \ncapability, India's demonstrated willingness to further develop and \ndemonstrate those capabilities is, by its nature, threatening to \nPakistan and China. In turn, China and Pakistan, but Pakistan in \nparticular, may also take steps to demonstrate their nuclear \nwillingness.\n  The United States is correct to impose sanctions on India and to \nprepare to do so on Pakistan if they test. I hope that Pakistan will \nrecognize by evaluating the situation in Russia that superpower status \nbuilt on economic prowess is significantly more desirable than \nsuperpower status achieved through nuclear weapons at the expense of \neconomic prowess.\n  Regardless of the achievements of the high-level U.S. delegation \ndispatched to Pakistan yesterday, it is obvious that there could be \nunder consideration by both Pakistan and China the effect of nuclear \nweapons in the hands of India, which might force both countries to \nproceed with nuclear weapons.\n  We learned about India's tests first through a press announcement and \nthen through our seismic monitors. India could just as well have tested \ntheir devices thousands of miles offshore on ships or drone planes. We \nwould certainly have registered the tests, but we might never have \nknown who tested. That was the situation in 1978 when a device exploded \nin the Indian Ocean and it took us many years to determine whose it \nwas.\n  Incidentally, although today our satellites can detect atmospheric \nnuclear explosions, there has been some consideration of not replacing \nthat capability when our current systems reach the end of their true \nlifetimes. This is just one symptom of our lax policy and declining \nattention to the threat of nuclear weapons.\n  Until they are disproved, and by that I mean something more than \nreassurances from the Indian Government which has already demonstrated \na willingness to be misleading about these issues, we need to consider \nthe possibility that India cooperated with other countries in \nconducting these tests.\n  We currently assume that all the devices that were detonated were \nIndian, that all the technicians on the site were Indian, and that the \ndata has not been shared with other nations, but we cannot base our \nfinal analysis on assumptions.\n  India's tests cast a long shadow over the ratification of the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. To date, Chairman Helms, chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Foreign Relations which has jurisdiction over all \ntreaties, has indicated he is not in a hurry to report the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I know some in arms control may have \nbeen frustrated by his position. Today, I think they are fortunate that \nthe treaty will not be considered in the near future.\n\n[[Page S4942]]\n\n  In light of the event which occurred in India, we need some time and, \nobviously, we need to think through the application of resources to the \ninformation necessary to make sure the test ban treaty can be carried \nout. India's willingness to test reminds us that global nuclear \ncapabilities will not remain static if the United States agrees to lock \nin its nuclear capabilities pursuant to a test ban.\n  In the coming decades, other countries, whether they are signatories \nto the treaty or not, may develop nuclear capabilities and, given time, \nmay even develop significant threatening nuclear capabilities, which is \nnot the case at this point.\n  The United States nuclear posture is not established in response to \nthe threat posed by a single country, but also considers threats that \nmay be posed by strategic alliances. We need to recognize that the \nnuclear buildup we now expect to occur on the Pakistan-India border and \nthat may spread to China could one day not be directed against one \nanother, but there could be alliances which put America's future in \njeopardy.\n  More so, we need to recognize that the nuclear arsenal of the United \nStates, one that we maintain today and will maintain into the \nindefinite future, has to be able to respond to all potential scenarios \nthat might unfold in an uncertain and changing world.\n  That means at a minimum, our weapons must be safe and reliable, not \njust theoretically so. We must have confidence in them as our tools of \nforeign policy and military policy. That requires our potential \nadversaries, whether they are our current adversaries or our current \nallies, be aware of our formidable scientific skills and our \nwillingness to direct them toward the maintenance of our stockpile.\n  While there is some uncertainty, and my skepticism can be expected to \ncontinue to demand improvements, I am reasonably confident that the \nUnited States has the scientific ability to maintain our stockpile if \nwe make that a priority. That requires that we make it a priority \ntoday, even though current focus is more on conventional warfighting \ncapabilities, and we make it a priority into the future.\n  Everyone should understand that the United States has made a \ncommitment that we will not test nuclear weapons. So we are not going \nto have any underground tests or any other kinds of tests. That means \nour scientists have to be capable of telling us that our stockpile is \nsecure, safe and trustworthy.\n  That requires that we pay attention to what is needed to do that. The \nreason for the explosions in India is to make sure they can say, ``We \nnow know how to build a bona fide weapon, and that it will work.'' If \nthey did not do the testing, they would be acting theoretically, they \nwould be basing it on science, on modeling, on previous data about \nother weapons and weapons they might try to duplicate. But the only way \nto be sure and to have it right is to do tests.\n  We have done those. We are not doing them anymore. But everybody in \nthis body and in the House and in the White House have to be concerned \nthat if we have them, they have to be trustworthy. And to do that, we \nmay have to spend a little bit of money on science and technology to \nmake sure that without testing that they are valid.\n  We are not building any new nuclear weapons. We have committed to \nthat. We have not for some time; and for the foreseeable future we will \nnot.\n  Our nuclear posture cannot be based exclusively on our dedication to \nmaintaining our own stockpile so it can respond to any potential \nthreat; we must also work to understand and then reduce that threat. \nIndia's ability to conduct five tests without our previous knowledge, \neven though we should have been on alert for them, demonstrates how \neasy it is for a nation to develop such a capability.\n  So while I began my remarks by saying that the focus of our \nfrustration should not be on our intelligence agencies alone, that they \nwere unable to provide us advanced warning of India's plans, I also \nbelieve that in the future we must improve by an order of magnitude our \nability to understand the nuclear threats we face.\n  We are considering entering into discussions on a new round of arms \ncontrol agreements that would, for the first time, limit the number of \nnuclear warheads in the United States and Russia. We need to approach \nthe notion of counting warheads and of entering into limits with a \nsingle country with great skepticism. Our inability to monitor India's \nnuclear activities should make it clear that we are far from having the \nability to monitor a warhead limitation treaty now and for some time to \ncome.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/15/senate-section/article/S4941-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4942-S4943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE INDONESIAN CRISIS\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I take the floor today to discuss the \nsorry state of affairs that we find in Indonesia. The latest reports \nare that nearly 400 people have died in the past week of rioting and \nlooting.\n  Despite the crumbling of this nation, there is a stony silence from \nthe Clinton administration. We have heard nothing. The administration \napparently has no policy in place to deal with the instability in \nIndonesia. Yet, in my opinion, administrative policies were largely \nresponsible for many of today's problems in Indonesia. We created the \nproblem, and we are not doing anything about it.\n\n  First, during this administration, investments in Indonesia have \nsoared. Lending to Indonesia during the last 4 years by U.S. banks was \nlarger than to other major nations in Europe. It was too much money \nchasing too few worthwhile investments. So the money began to chase \ninvestments that were not worthwhile. The administration encouraged it \nand promoted it and had close ties to Indonesian conglomerates, the \nLippo Group being a leading candidate.\n  Of course, this gold rush could not sustain itself. Vast amounts of \nmoney and weak investments always come home to you. And the bottom \ndropped out in Indonesia.\n  Rather than take responsibility for these problems and take a \nleadership role in handling the financial crisis in Asia, the answer of \nthis administration has been to delegate the problems to the \nInternational Monetary Fund.\n  The IMF has bungled, from day one, the handling of the Indonesian \ncrisis. From the closing of the banks on, from the day it went in, it \nhas created a greater crisis.\n  We never should have turned over international economic and foreign \npolicy to a group of 2,000 silk-suited bureaucrats that have little if \nany success to show for the billions and billions of American \ntaxpayers' dollars that they have wasted throughout the world.\n  The panic began when IMF imposed their austerity measures. They have \ndriven the Indonesian currency down to record low levels. Is it any \nwonder that riots have begun to break out in the streets and that 400 \npeople have been killed when the currency is worth 300 percent less \nthan it was a year ago?\n  In fact, the riots began to take hold when the government raised the \ncost of fuel and electricity, as mandated by the IMF.\n  Now, I repeat, the riots began to take hold when the government \nraised the cost of fuel and electricity as mandated by the IMF, the \npeople we sent to bring calm and common sense to Indonesia. Another \nbrilliant recommendation from the IMF, for a country finding itself \nplunged into poverty, was to raise the price of fuel and electricity.\n  This is, again, another reason why the IMF is the last institution we \nneed to provide funding to in order to solve the world's economic \nproblems. Their record of solving world economic problems could not be \nworse. In fact, I would like for someone to point out a world economic \nproblem that they solved. The numbers they have made worse are far \ngreater than those they have helped.\n  The only upturn in the Indonesian currency came when a currency board \nwas suggested to stabilize monetary policy and there was a slight \nuptick in the value of the currency. But this idea was immediately \nsmothered with pressure from the United States, this administration, \nand the IMF, that they could not have a currency board. Now we have a \nfull-blown crisis in Indonesia. And the President is in Europe this \nweek, and his aides are saying very little to nothing.\n  I think it is incumbent on this country to take a leadership role and \nsolve\n\n[[Page S4943]]\n\nthis problem that we had a large hand in creating. It can only get \nworse. There can only be more bloodshed, and we have no idea what kind \nof leadership will arise from the streets of Jakarta. We have no idea. \nIt is time for the administration to stop sitting on the sidelines and \nget engaged in either easing the economic problem or making plans for a \ntransition from the Soeharto regime. The IMF has done enough damage. \nNow the United States has to take a leadership role in the financial \nand political affairs of this country.\n  It cannot--and I repeat, it cannot--be left up to the IMF anymore. It \nhas proven its inability to function.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
