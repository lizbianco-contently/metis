Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 717, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 717) to amend the Individuals With Disabilities \n     Education Act, to reauthorize and make improvements to that \n     Act, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n       Pending:\n       Gregg amendment No. 241, to modify the provision relating \n     to the authorization of appropriations for special education \n     and related services to authorize specific amounts or \n     appropriations.\n       Gorton amendment No. 243, to permit State and local \n     educational agencies to establish uniform disciplinary \n     policies.\n       Smith amendment No. 245, to require a court in making an \n     award under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act \n     to take into consideration the impact the granting of the \n     award would have on the education of all children of State \n     educational agencies and local educational agencies.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 241, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the yeas \nand nays and withdraw my amendment which is No. 241.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 241) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, just to clarify the record on this, this \namendment was addressing the issue of funding relative to special \neducation which is, I believe, a critical element of the whole issue \nobviously of special education, especially the fact that the Federal \nGovernment has failed to live up to its obligation to fund 40 percent \nof the cost of special education. It is only funding approximately 7 to \n8 percent of the cost.\n  After discussions with the majority leader, and with members of the \nAppropriations Committee on which I serve, I think there is a \nreasonable opportunity that we will receive the type of funding and \nsupport we need in order to start on the path toward reaching the 40 \npercent.\n  This path was outlined in S. 1, Senate bill 1, which is the Senate \nRepublican position and which commits to having us fund 40 percent over \na 7-year period. This year I am hopeful we can increase funding for \nspecial ed so we can get up above the $4 billion mark in this account, \nwhich would allow us to--under the new bill, if it is passed, as I \npresume it will be--allow us to kick in the ability of the local \ncommunities to use some of this special ed funding which the Federal \nGovernment was supposed to be paying for, which presently is being paid \nfor by local taxpayers, to use those local taxpayer dollars for other \nareas of education and to relieve some of the pressure on the \ncommunities and the local taxpayers.\n  So with that understanding, which is not formal--I appreciate that--\nbut which I believe was made in good faith, I am withdrawing this \namendment. I\n\n[[Page S4402]]\n\nrecognize a lot of work has gone into this bill, that there is a great \ndesire to pass this bill without amendments so it will be able to be \nmoved quickly and because it involves an intricate and delicate, \ndelicate compromise. And it is a step forward in the attempt to address \nthe IDEA question and issue of caring for children with disabilities.\n  This amendment I believe would have had a good chance of passing, but \nI believe it also would have undermined the desire of those who want to \nreach an accommodation to make sure to move the process forward and \nimprove the basic special ed bill, and we can do so with this bill, and \nit would undermine the capacity to do that.\n  I still believe we can still get to the role of the funding issue \nwhich runs on a parallel course without necessarily having to attach \nthis specific language to this bill.\n  I would note that the law continues to retain in it the 40 percent \nlanguage. It remains the commitment of the Federal Government and it is \na commitment which I and I know the majority, the chairman of the \ncommittee, ranking member on the subcommittee, and the majority leader \nare committed to try to reach.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I want to thank you for what you have just done. You \nhave provided a way for clear passage of this bill today. But most of \nall, I want to commend you for your continuous efforts to try to fully \nfund the 40 percent that we promised the people when this bill was \npassed some 22 years ago.\n  I also want to remind Members that your amendment--I think it was on \nthe goals 2000 bill--passed 93 to 0, where we said we would do what \nJudd Gregg wants. So I am hopeful that will be kept in mind as the \npeople go forward with the budget. I certainly am going to do all I can \nto make sure that we live up to the obligations of our own party's \npromise, which is in S. 1, to do what the Senator from New Hampshire \nbelieves we should do.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Vermont. I thank him for his \ncourtesy and enjoy working with him.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 243\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 20 \nminutes of debate equally divided between the Senator from Washington \n[Mr. Gorton], and the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], on the \npending question, amendment No. 243 by the Senator from Washington [Mr. \nGorton].\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the amendment which we are about to vote \non is extremely simple, plain, easy to understand and totally logical.\n  It reads in its entirety:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, each State \n     educational agency or local educational agency may establish \n     and implement uniform policies with respect to discipline and \n     order applicable to all children within its jurisdiction to \n     ensure the safety and appropriate educational atmosphere in \n     its schools.\n\n  Mr. President, I have spoken about the fact that this bill imposes a \nhuge unfunded mandate, $35 billion a year, on the schools of this \ncountry with no more than 10 percent of that money paid for by the \nFederal Government.\n  I have spoken of the huge complexity--327 pages in this bill--\nimposing identical rules on every school district in the country no \nmatter how large or how small. But the single aspect of this bill that \nis most questionable and most unjust is the double standard it sets \nwith respect to discipline, response to violence, disorder in the \nclassroom. Each and every school district retains its full and complete \nauthority over all of these questions as they apply to students who are \nnot disabled. They lose almost all of that authority under the present \nIDEA statute and regain only a modest amount of it under this revision.\n  This double standard makes it difficult to provide an appropriate \neducation to tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of our \nstudents around the country. They make it difficult to impose rational \ndisciplinary measures on those students who are denominated disabled. \nThey create a tremendous incentive to seek some ``expert'' who will \nprovide for a given student the title ``disabled.'' We find the \ndecisions that the very disorder, the very violence in classrooms that \nis to be the subject of discipline is found to be evidence of \ndisability so that the discipline cannot be imposed.\n  For the educational attainment of all of our students, for the proper \nprotection of all of our students, we should allow each school, each \nschool district, each State to set rules with respect to disorder, to \ndiscipline, to violence that are the same for all of the students. \nNothing could be simpler.\n  This amendment will not in any way undercut the right created by this \nbill for a free and complete education for every student, disabled or \nnot. That remains. What is restored to each school district is the \nright on its own to make those decisions while looking at the \neducational atmosphere in which all of its students must learn. The \nvice of this bill is that it pretends that there are no nondisabled \nstudents, only the disabled students count, only their rights count. \nThe rights of all other students and their parents are ignored.\n  So we ask very simply that this bill be amended to allow each \neducational agency to establish and implement uniform policies with \nrespect to discipline and order applicable to all children within its \njurisdiction in order that they may be safe and have an appropriate \neducational atmosphere--nothing more, nothing less.\n  This bill says that the U.S. Senators know more about how to educate \nstudents than do their teachers, their administrators, their school \nboard members, people who have spent their lives and careers at this \njob. We do not know more. They know more. We should permit them to do \ntheir jobs.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I wish to speak in strong opposition to the amendment. \nI understand the emotionalism that has gone on in our States throughout \nthis Nation over the years, and even up to the point that we speak, \nabout the problems that were created, and which the Senator from \nWashington is attempting to address.\n  I point out, first of all, that the bill tries its best to preserve \nthe order in the classroom through uniform policies for all school \ndistricts, and to ensure that every child with a disability is treated \nfairly, but also balances the needs of those in the classroom to have a \nsafe and peaceful, shall we say, learning environment. That is done. \nThe House voted yesterday with only three dissenting votes on this \nbill, recognizing that those kinds of balances had been reached after \nan incredible effort on the part of so many to give us a bill that \neveryone who is deeply involved in this issue can agree with.\n  I know this body respects the order that is necessary in the \nclassroom and also the ability of local schools to be able to try and \naccommodate the interests of all, but I believe this bill, by doing \nthis, what it says is, ``notwithstanding any other provision of this \nact, each State, educational agency or local educational agency may \nestablish and implement uniform policies with respect to discipline and \norder.''\n  Now, what does that mean? I do not know. But if it means what it \nsays, it wipes out everything. It would be contrary to what they want \nto do. That means we could have thousands or hundreds of different \nideas on how to bring order to the classroom. It would set back the \nsystem.\n  I know the Senator from Washington speaks sincerely, and I know that \nWashington had a terrible problem, initially, in the early parts of \nthis decade. Almost half the cases, I believe, went to due process \nhearings and ended up in court. However, this past year, 96 percent of \nthose cases that were heard in mediation were solved and did not go to \ncourt. So his own State, I think, has solved the problems he is trying \nto deal with.\n  I hope Members would not vote for this amendment. At the appropriate \ntime I will move to table it. This would create havoc in the whole \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong opposition, as \nwell, to this amendment before the Senate, put forth by the Senator \nfrom Washington,\n\n[[Page S4403]]\n\nan amendment which would instruct local education agencies to set out \ntheir own policy, a potentially very different policy, in disciplining \nstudents with disabilities. In short, under his amendment, each school \ndistrict potentially would have its own distinct policy in disciplining \ndisabled children, and with 16,000 school districts, the potential for \nconflicting policies is very real, and I am afraid this would be a \nturnback to the pre-1975 era before IDEA.\n  Is this a double standard? I say ``no.'' Clearly, we have outlined a \nprocess whereby students, if there is a manifestation of a disability, \nwould go down one process, and if a discipline problem was not a \nmanifestation of a disability, that student would be treated just like \neveryone else.\n  I think this is fair. This is equitable. Remember, if behavior is not \na result of that disability, all students are treated the same in this \nbill. If behavior is secondary to a disability, there is a very clear \nprocess, which is outlined in detail. Yes, it does take several pages \nto outline that, but it sets up a balance between the school, between \nschool boards, between parents, and between children.\n  Senator Gorton claims this amendment is about local control, and I \nfeel that it will be used, I am afraid, to turn back the hands of the \nclock to the pre-1975 conditions where we know that children with \ndisabilities were excluded from the opportunity to receive a free and \nappropriate public education.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, not just \nbecause, as has been pointed out, it will kill our overall bipartisan \neffort that we brought forward, but that it would, in fact, turn back \nthe clock and lead, potentially, to discrimination that children with \ndisabilities faced before IDEA was enacted 22 years ago.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Could I inquire to the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 4\\1/2\\ minutes \nand the other side has 3 minutes, 45 seconds.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank Senator Jeffords for his leadership and I thank \nSenator Frist for his eloquent comments.\n  I rise in strong opposition to the amendment proposed by my colleague \nSenator Gorton.\n  The amendment drives a stake through the heart of the bipartisan, \nbicameral, fair, and balanced provisions in the bill relating to \ndisciplining children with disabilities.\n  The amendment states plain and simple that local school districts can \ntotally ignore every word of the bill if they so choose. In other \nwords, the amendment effectively repeals every protection in the law \nfor disabled children.\n  Last night, this extreme position was rejected by 420 of my \ncolleagues in the House in favor of the commonsense approach included \nin the bill.\n  The bill specifies procedures for the immediate removal to an \nalternative setting of disabled children who bring weapons to school or \nwho knowingly use, possess, or sell illegal drugs.\n  The bill also authorizes: The removal to an alternative setting of \ntruly dangerous children; proper referrals to police and appropriate \nauthorities when disabled children commit crimes, so long as the \nreferrals, do not circumvent the school's responsibilities under IDEA.\n  And, the transfer of student disciplinary records.\n  Under the amendment, local school districts could cease educational \nservices for any disabled child regardless of whether or not the \nchild's behavior was related to his or her disability. Cessation of \nservices is not only opposed by all disability organizations, but is \nopposed by the major groups representing general education and the \npolice and prosecutors. That is why the bipartisan bill rejects \ncessation.\n  My colleague raised a number of other points in the course of the \ndebate which I would like to respond to at this point.\n  My colleague constantly refers to IDEA as an unfunded Federal \nmandate.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the American Law \nDivision of the Congressional Research Service, and the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, IDEA is not an unfunded mandate.\n  IDEA is a civil rights statute that implements the equal protection \nclause of the U.S. Constitution. IDEA helps States and local school \ndistricts pay for the costs of implementing their constitutional \nobligation to disabled children.\n  My colleague also talks about the high costs of educating disabled \nchildren but fails to talk about the savings to society, not to mention \nthe enhanced quality of life for disabled children and their families.\n  Prior to the enactment of IDEA, 70,655 children were in institutions. \nBecause of IDEA, that number is down to 4,001. The average cost of \nserving a child in a State institution is $82,256 per person. With \n66,654 fewer children institutionalized, the savings to States is $5.46 \nbillion per year.\n  Danny Piper from Ankey IA, was born with Down's syndrome. He has an \nIQ of 39. At birth, his parents were told to institutionalize him \nbecause he would be a burden and would not benefit from education. The \ncost to the taxpayers of Iowa over the course of his life would have \nbeen $5 million. His parents said no and instead placed him in early \nintervention and then in an intergrated program at Ankeny High School \nwhere he was a manager of the wrestling team.\n  The cost of special education over his 18 years was $63,000. Was it a \ngood investment? You decide. Today, Danny works, he pays taxes, and he \nhas his own apartment.\n  My colleague also quotes a parent of a nondisabled child who was told \nby a lawyer that she has no rights when her child's class is disrupted \nby a disabled child. I say to that parent she better get a new lawyer.\n  They have a right to a class environment that is safe and conducive \nto learning.\n  That parent has a right to insist that the schools develop positive \nbehavioral approaches and train teachers and provide them with the \nnecessary supports.\n  What they don't have is the right to kick that disabled kid out of \nthe class just as school systems cannot kick out African-American \nchildren when a white child or his parents are uncomfortable around \nAfrican-Americans.\n  Can we have school environments that are safe and conducive to \nlearning without kicking disabled kids out? Yes we can. Just ask Dr. \nMike McTaggart of West Middle School in Sioux City, IA. In just 1 year, \nthe number of suspensions of nondisabled children went from 692 to 156 \nof which 7 were out-of-school suspensions. The number of suspensions of \ndisabled children went from 220 to zero. Attendance has gone from 72 \npercent to 98.5 percent. Juvenile court referrals went from 267 to 3.\n  His philosophy of discipline for all students is to use discipline as \na tool to teach rather than to punish.\n  In closing, let's reject the Gorton amendment and send a message that \nwe can ensure school environments that are safe and conducive to \nlearning without gutting the rights and protections of disabled \nchildren.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in a recent article in the National \nReview, the author, Chester Finn, Jr., made the following comments \nabout the present statute equally applicable to this bill.\n\n       . . . prescriptive federal mandates that create heavy costs \n     and regulatory burdens for local communities; extra benefits \n     for government-protected populations and their exemption from \n     rules that others must obey; ample opportunities for \n     activists and lawyers to hustle taxpayer-financed largesse \n     for their clients; barriers to needed reforms of school \n     quality and discipline; . . . [and above all] the smug \n     assumption that Washington knows best how the nation's \n     schools should be run.\n\n  While various professional organizations have more or less been \nrequired to endorse this bill because, as I have already said, it is an \nimprovement over present law, just last month, USA Today published the \nresults of a poll of 6,000 principals, 80 percent of whom said Federal \nlaw interfered with their ability to create safe schools.\n  My two friends on this side of the aisle used the word ``balance.'' \nThere is no balance in this bill. There is no balance at all. There is \nno consideration--no consideration, none--of the rights of nondisabled \nstudents. Yes, there are 16,000 school districts in this country. That \nis the genius of our country, that\n\n[[Page S4404]]\n\nwe solve our problems locally, and yet as far as these are concerned, \nwe should have one school district, one Department of Education that \nshould set one set of rules applicable to everyone under all \ncircumstances and at all times. That is wrong. Let our teachers and our \nprincipals and our school boards make the decisions as to how their \nschools should be operated.\n  If all time has been taken on the other side, I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, very quickly, the balance has been \nreached in this bill. The most critical question is, what can you do \nwith the dangerous child? It is very simple: If it is not a matter \ninvolved with the disability, that child could be disciplined like any \nother child. If it is related to the disability, as determined by a \nhearing officer, then there can be up to 45 days removal in an \nappropriate educational setting. If the problem still exists and the \nschool can demonstrate that the child may be substantialy likely to \ncause harm to himself or others, the child will remain in an interim \nalternative educational setting for an additional 45 days, et cetera--\ntremendous balance, tremendous help to the present situation.\n  Mr. President, I urge the defeat of the Gorton amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do both sides yield back their time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I move to table the Gorton amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Please \ntake your discussions to the Cloakroom or the hallway.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 245\n\n  The question now recurs on amendment No. 245 offered by the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire [Mr. Smith]. There will be 4 minutes of debate \nequally divided in the usual form. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, could I have order, \nplease. The Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Please clear the well. Staff please take their \nseats.\n  The Senator deserves to be heard. There are 4 minutes of debate \nequally divided.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Like the previous amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Washington, Senator Gorton, this is a very reasonable \namendment. It simply requires the courts, when they make an award under \nIDEA, to take into consideration what impact that award will have on \nall of the students in the district or in the particular classrooms. \nFor example, we have cases where a $1,000 IDEA program or plan, \neducational plan costs $13,000 or $14,000 in legal fees. There are \nmillions of dollars in legal fees spent in all 50 States, all over \nAmerica, that are taken out of the classroom. These are dollars that \nyou cannot use for teachers, you cannot use for computers, you cannot \nuse for textbooks or, frankly, for infrastructure or schools or \nbuildings.\n  The issue here is whether or not you want to have these dollars go to \nthe students or go to the lawyers. That is the simple issue. This is a \nvery reasonable amendment. There is nothing unreasonable about it.\n  I think the process here where we say we cannot amend a bill to \nstrengthen it, to make a better bill is a bad process and one for which \nI wish we had not set the precedent. I urge my colleagues to think \nabout it because at some point in the not too distant future you are \ngoing to have another piece of legislation coming through here, and you \nare going to be on the other side. You are going to want to offer an \namendment and you are going to have to say to yourself, well, when I \nhad the opportunity before, I opposed that opportunity for another \ncolleague. Sure, I can offer the amendment but the deal by the \nleadership is to oppose the amendment because we have a deal. The \nanswer is very simple. You can vote for my amendment and take dollars \nout of the pockets of lawyers and put them into the classroom for the \nstudents or you can oppose my amendment and favor the lawyers.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this amendment would require a court before \nawarding attorney fees to prevailing parents to do an analysis of the \nimpact of the award on the local school district. The point is that the \ncourt already has the discretion to assess the impact of an award on a \nschool district. Thus, this is unnecessary. Awarding fees today is at \nthe court's discretion. This amendment would actually require a formal \ncost analysis, an additional bureaucratic burden on a school district. \nIt is unnecessary. It is covered in the underlying bill. I urge \nopposition to the amendment.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Smith \namendment which adds limitations on the awarding of attorneys fees to \nparents of disabled children that are unprecedented in any other fees \nprovision.\n  The provisions in current law relating to attorneys fees were added \nby our colleague Senator Orrin Hatch. He modeled the IDEA fees \nprovisions on provisions in other civil rights laws. On final passage \nof these provisions he explained that they reflected a carefully \ncrafted compromise that provides for reasonable attorneys fees to a \nprevailing parent while at the same time protecting against excessive \nreimbursement.\n  Let's not upset that carefully crafted compromise. Let's retain the \nparity between the fees provisions in the IDEA\n\n[[Page S4405]]\n\nwith the fees provisions in other civil rights statutes. It is \ninappropriate to establish a double standard for parents with disabled \nchildren.\n  Listening to Senator Smith, one might get the impression that there \nis a proliferation of litigation under IDEA. The data does not bear out \nsuch an assertion. The number of court cases under IDEA is actually \ndeclining from 199 in 1992 to 120 last year. This is out of 5.3 million \ndisabled children. The number of due process hearings in New Hampshire \nlast year was 10. In my State of Iowa, the number was four. In the \nentire State of California, with almost 600,000 disabled children in \nthe IDEA program, the number of due process hearings was 57--1,289 \nrequests for hearings but the overwhelming majority were resolved in \nmediation.\n  Let's reject the Smith amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Let me speak to my colleagues very sincerely.\n  Last year we came almost to the point where we passed a bill similar \nto this for the disabled community and for the schools. It broke down \nat the last minute because there was dissension over one issue. You \nhave had your opportunity this time to show your concern about how the \nbill goes, but if we have one amendment, then it has to go back and \nthere are those out there now who want to disrupt it. Senator Lott and \nDave Hoppe spent hundreds of hours to bring these communities together \nto agree on this bill which is a tremendous step forward. If you vote \nno on the motion to table, you could kill this bill and we could start \nover again.\n  Mr. President, I move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a sufficient second. The yeas and \nnays are ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. 245 \noffered by the Senator from New Hampshire. The clerk will now call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. \nRockefeller] is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments this \nmorning and talk about this Congress' commitment to education, and \nspecial education in particular.\n  S. 717, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Amendments Act of \n1997, is the first piece of major legislation to come out of the Senate \nLabor Committee since the start of the 105th Congress that directly \naffects the important issue of education. This piece of legislation \nbefore the Senate today is an integral part of providing educational \nservices to over 5 million children across this country. This \nlegislation reminds us of the fundamental importance of the need for \nstrong educational funding at a time when all eyes are focused on \nbudget-balancing.\n  Mr. President, special education is of critical importance to my home \nState of New Mexico, in which over 50,000 children receive specialized \neducational services. In New Mexico over 14 percent of the eligible \nschool age population receive needed educational services from this \nlaw. Currently, New Mexico receives over $26 million in Federal funding \nto assist the educational needs of special education students. This \nfunding is very important to States like New Mexico that have rural and \nisolated communities and are working to provide specialized educational \nservices at great distances.\n  Over the past 2 years especially, and throughout my tenure in the \nSenate, I have heard numerous stories from New Mexico's students, \nparents, educators, and administrators about the need for added \nresources and effective programs for special education students.\n  I have also heard their concerns about the current Federal law, which \ninclude: financial incentives to over-identify students as disabled; \nlack of standards and performance assessments; the difficulty teachers \nand administrators face in maintaining classroom discipline; and the \nconcerns of parents who are struggling to find the best possible \nplacement for their child and to ensure that educational services are \nprovided.\n  However, I believe that the legislation before the Senate begins to \naddress these concerns. This bill:\n  First, includes language that will increase educational \naccountability and standards for disabled students,\n  Second, creates new measures to allow parents and Federal agencies to \nmonitor and assure the adequacy of special education programs,\n  Third, includes language that aims to increase flexibility for State \nand local school districts and reduces paperwork for school districts,\n  Fourth, strengthens teachers' and administrators' abilities to \ncontrol their classrooms, without ceasing educational services to \nstudents,\n\n  Fifth, includes language that will ensure access to assistive \ntechnology for our special education students and provisions to allow \nblind and visually handicapped students learn Braille,\n  Sixth, removes past incentives to encourage the overidentification of \nchildren with disabilities.\n  I am especially happy to see statutory language that requires the \ninclusion of almost all special education students in testing and \naccountability programs.\n  Just recently I heard a story from a special education administrator \nin New Mexico that expressed the importance of integrating standards in \nspecial education and how they promote accountability and improved \nservices.\n  In Kentucky, for many years, some neighborhood schools were sending \ntheir special education students to other schools to receive \nspecialized services. However, when Kentucky started to require \nassessments for special education students and included these scores in \nschool report cards, some of these neighborhood schools started to \neducate their special education students within their own schools so as \nto improve the student's academic levels.\n  Mr. President, the requirement for inclusion of special education \nstudents in academic assessments is a key aspect to ensuring that this \nlegislation will be effectively implemented in schools throughout New \nMexico and across the United States.\n  Mr. President, I plan to support this legislation because I believe \nit strikes a balance between the different views and needs of many of \nthe stakeholders within the special education community. This \nlegislation begins to address many of my concerns and the concerns that \nI have heard from my constituents in New Mexico. I am especially \npleased to see language included in this legislation that allows states \nand local districts flexibility in the implementation of IDEA.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the President and congressional leaders reached a \nbudget agreement that included increased funding for education. It is \nimperative that Congress remains committed to providing quality \neducation to our Nation's youth.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to\n\n[[Page S4406]]\n\ntake the bipartisan and bicameral commitment to education that has been \nexemplified in the reauthorization of IDEA and to focus on increased \nfunding and the development of standards that provide educational \nopportunities to all students. Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of \nmy colleagues both here in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives to reauthorize IDEA and I applaud their commitment to \neducation. This is not the time in our Nation's history to waver on our \ncommitment to educate America's students.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, first I want to commend the Senators and \nstaff who have committed so much time to the reauthorization of the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act. It is a good bill that \nincorporates the insights and experiences of the hundreds of groups who \nhave been involved in the development process. I planned to offer my \nstrong support, however, for the amendment that was to have been \noffered by Senator Gregg because I believe the underlying bill would be \nbetter if it contained a strong commitment on Federal funding--for a \nnumber of reasons.\n  I am familiar with education spending at the State level because I \ncome to this process as a former State Legislator. I served the State \nof Wyoming for 10 years--5 years in the State House and 5 years in the \nState Senate. During that time, in my tenure as chairman of the Senate \nRevenue Committee, I felt all of the constraints in the State budget. \nThe most difficult one, however--the one that was always fraught with \nprotestation and controversy--was how we spent money on education, \nwhere it came from and where it went. Elementary and secondary \neducation is my State's largest single expenditure.\n  In the 1995-96 school year, the Wyoming State Government expended \n$237 million, or 44 percent, of the total amount of money spent on K-12 \neducation in Wyoming. Fifty percent of the funding, or $280 million, \ncame from local sources. I am proud of that commitment. The people in \nmy State invest over $5,800 per student, per year, and that is the \nsecond highest amount in the country as a percentage of State income. \nBut let me focus for a minute on the other 6 percent--the Federal \ncontribution.\n  Federal support for elementary and secondary education is a sensitive \nissue in Wyoming. Federal dollars always come with Washington strings \nattached and that is a problem for me and for a great number of my \nconstituents. I believe we should leave more of our tax revenue in the \nStates and let the people who live there make the decisions about \neducation.\n  Special education is different, however, because the strings are \nalready in place. The distinction is that they don't come with much \nmoney. Wyoming's State and local taxpayers spent $58 million for \nspecial education last year. That was matched by only $5 million in \nFederal funds--about 8 percent.\n  Mr. President, IDEA is a good law. It protects disabled kids from \ndiscrimination in public education. It is an issue that needs national \nattention, coordination, and support. We should recognize why this law \nexists, why these services are mandated, and understand why there \nshould be an assurance of strong Federal funding. The Gregg amendment \nwould have made that commitment. It would say that we, as a body, \nbelieve the Federal Government should pay more for special education.\n  Why is this amendment so important? Because Congress has failed to \nsupport its share of the cost for 20 years. Without this amendment, the \nStates really have no reason to expect that the situation is going to \nchange. To add insult to injury, the bill places a new maintenance of \neffort requirement on State education agencies. That is a difficult \npill to swallow when the Federal maintenance of effort has been so \nclearly lacking.\n  I would have objected to the new State maintenance of effort because \nmy State currently pays 85 percent of special education costs. The \nlocal relief provided in this bill will do little to offset the State's \nheavy burden. The bill does, however, allow for a waiver if the State \ncan show it is providing all kids with a free appropriate public \neducation. That is an important consideration and I think it adds \nenough flexibility to the law to make it acceptable. But it does not \nsolve all the problems.\n  This legislation will also require States to provide some new \nservices. Without a guarantee of additional Federal funding, the States \nare going to have to bear that cost. One expense will be the mandate to \nprovide alternative education for kids who are expelled due to \ndisciplinary problems. There is also a requirement to provide State \nmediation as an alternative to due process. I support these changes. I \nhope they will actually reduce costs in the long run. But if we cannot \neven pay the Federal share for current mandates, then we should not be \nadding new ones. Congress needs to ante up the Federal share. If we are \nunable to do that, then this bill loses some of its luster.\n  The Gregg amendment would have made that commitment. I understand the \nproblems a conference might present on this bill. I sympathize with \nMembers who have spent so many hours working to reach consensus, but I \nbelieve the Gregg amendment is important enough to deserve conference \nconsideration.\n  Mr. President, I do support the bill. It makes some sorely-needed \nimprovements to the law--particularly in the areas of discipline, State \ncoordination, and legal fees. We have before us a compromise that will \nimprove current law, but it still lacks a strong funding resolution. \nThat would have been an important part of this legislation that I think \nmembers of both parties would have supported.\n  If we are going to help States live up to their responsibility in \nproviding a free appropriate public education to all kids, then we need \nto do it. And that means more than just piling on regulations.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, all children should have access to a \nquality education, regardless of whether they have disabilities. The \nimportance of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act [IDEA] is \nthat it enables parents to acquire special educational assistance for \ntheir children who may be fully capable of becoming productive members \nof society, but may need some extra help along the way. I am pleased \nthat Members of Congress on a bipartisan, bicameral basis have worked \nout a compromise that allows us to reauthorize this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  While I generally support the compromise on the IDEA bill that is \nbefore us today, I want to touch briefly on an issue that some school \nnurses have raised with regard to this legislation.\n  I have heard from many Oregon school nurses about the importance of \nincluding nurses in the individual education program [IEP] development \nprocess. Under current IDEA regulations, school nurses are considered \nqualified health professionals and are considered fully capable of \nassessing a student's disabilities during the IEP process. The school \nnurses had asked to be mentioned specifically in the statute as \n``related service providers'' in a disabled child's multidisciplinary \nteam. While this could not be worked out, I understand that the \ncommittee report addresses this issue, and I want to convey my support \nfor the inclusion of school nurses as part of the IEP process.\n  In this country we frequently underestimate the excellent quality of \ncare provided by this Nation's nurses. School nurses have the training \nand provide the supervision to safely deliver specialized health \nservices. For children with chronic or special health care needs, the \nschool nurse is often a crucial member of the multidisciplinary team \nthat enables children with disabilities to participate fully in their \neducational program. As long as they are fully qualified to make an \nassessment of a child's disability, there should be no reason that \nlocalities should discriminate against nurses.\n  Again, I complement my colleagues for breaking through the logjam on \nthis important reauthorization, and I want to reemphasize my support \nfor the school nurses who play such an important role in the care of \nchildren with disabilities.\n\n\n                          personnel standards\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there is a new policy with respect to \npersonnel standards in section 612(a)(15)(c) of the bill that sets \nforth parameters by which a State may deal with a documented shortage \nof qualified personnel. In that subparagraph, I want to clarify that \nthe reference ``consistent with\n\n[[Page S4407]]\n\nstate law,'' is intended to be applicable to those State laws governing \nthe profession or discipline. I offer this statement to provide \nguidance at the U.S. Department of Education to help them in \nimplementing the reauthorization.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I agree with that interpretation and thank the Senator \nfor this clarification.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 717. I \nsupport this bill because it has become clear to me that the status quo \nin special education is not acceptable.\n  Even though Iowans have done a good job under existing law, it is \ntime to make changes. These changes are necessary in order to keep pace \nwith the challenges facing educators today. Students with a variety of \nspecial needs are now in the schools. They have needs we couldn't even \nimagine when the first special education law was passed.\n  At this time I will address only two aspects of S. 717 that are \nsufficient reasons for supporting it. First of all, this bill would \ngive schools and parents additional tools to improve education for all \nchildren.\n  In response to school complaints, clearer guidance is given for \nactions to assure the safety of all students in the classroom. I \nbelieve all of us here today recognize the need to do this.\n  For parents, the right to participate in decisions about their \nchild's education is given more support. This is done through \nattendance at evaluation and assessment meetings and at any meeting at \nwhich the placement of their child might be decided.\n  And for students, in this bill we send a clear message that we have \nhigh expectations for all students--including students in special \neducation. More accountability for progress on IEP's would be required. \nParticipation in statewide and districtwide measures of school \nperformance would be required. Stronger linkages to the regular \neducation curriculum would be required for these students. We expect \nsuccess from special education programs under this bill, and we expect \nthat success to be measurable.\n  The second aspect of S. 717 I want to address is this. This bill \nclarifies that schools are not the only agencies that should pay for \nthe services special education students need. This proposal does \nnot retreat from the principle that all children have the right to an \neducation, no matter what their needs are. What this bill does is \nrequire that Governors work to assure that all sources of funding for \nservices are used to support these students.\n\n  This will be of particular importance to schools and families in \nIowa.\n  Last week, I had a visit from a school superintendent in Iowa. His \ndistrict has about 15,000 students; 2,000 of those students are in \nspecial education. Of those students there are about six or seven kids \na year who require substantial medical support in order to attend \nschool.\n  The school district hires nurses and other professionals in order to \nassure that these students can get an education. But this \nsuperintendent has been unable to get other agencies and programs to \ncontribute to the costs of providing health services to these students. \nAnd this school year approximately $2 million will be spent by this \nschool system on health services for these few students, some of whom \nare eligible for Medicaid.\n  Clearly these costs are beyond what we should be asking schools to \npay. And that is one reason why S. 717 is important. It provides clear \ndirection that these costs are not the primary responsibility of \neducators. They are instead the responsibility of other programs that \nhave been created to support students and families. I am happy to \nprovide such support to that school superintendent in his efforts to \nsecure all the services his students need.\n  That superintendent represents a strong tradition in Iowa.\n  Education for students with disabilities in Iowa was mandated 6 years \nbefore the predecessor to IDEA was passed by Congress in the 1970's. At \nthat time, when I chaired the Education Committee in the Iowa House, a \nState mandate for special education was passed. Following that, we \ndeveloped a system of area education agencies that still serves Iowans \ntoday. It took us 2 years to get the area agency legislation passed; we \nwere successful in 1974. That system is still the basis for delivering \nspecial education services to students all over Iowa, particularly in \nrural areas.\n  Regarding this bill, S. 717, my colleagues have enumerated positive \naspects of this compromise proposal other than those I have mentioned. \nI have followed the progress of the work group closely and now provide \nmy support for this landmark legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, since 1966, the Federal Government has \nsupported special education services for America's disabled children. \nToday, school districts depend on the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act [IDEA] for assistance in assuring that children with \nspecial needs receive a comprehensive education in a supportive \nenvironment. In Kentucky alone, over 85,000 children benefitted from \nIDEA during the 1996-97 school year.\n  Today, the U.S. Senate takes a historic step forward in its \nconsideration of S. 717, a bicameral, bipartisan bill to reauthorize \nIDEA. Over the last two decades, changes in educational resources and \nthe needs of students have impaired the ability of schools to meet \nIDEA's goal of a free, appropriate education for disabled students. \nThis measure seeks to ensure that the Federal statute effectively \naddresses the special education issues of today's classrooms and is \nprepared for the future needs of educators, parents, and students \ninvolved in special education.\n  This bipartisan, bicameral legislation achieves these objectives by \nbuilding upon three primary goals: To focus on the successful education \nof children with disabilities, instead of rote completion of paperwork; \nto assure increased parental participation; and to give teachers the \ntools they need in order to teach all children.\n  S. 717 helps schools improve the delivery of special education \nservices by eliminating unnecessary paperwork, streamlining data \ncollection, and enhancing program flexibility and service integration. \nSchools also assume greater accountability for the educational progress \nof special education students through their inclusion in States and \ndistrict-wide assessments.\n  S. 717 reduces the financial strain on school districts and parents \nby including mediation as an option for resolving disputes. The revised \nfunding formula delivers more IDEA dollars directly to local education \nagencies, and the bill also requires interagency agreements so other \nresponsible agencies pay their fair share of the service delivery costs \nfor disabled students. As a cosponsor of S. 1, I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in fulfilling its promise of an additional \n$10 billion for IDEA over the next 7 years.\n  Further, S. 717 expands the ability of parents to participate in the \nplanning of special education services for their child. The bill seeks \nto provide parents with the information they need to effectively work \nwith their local school system by improving the preparation and \ndissemination of school notices and requiring student progress reports.\n  Teacher preparation for the successful delivery of special education \nservices is also a priority in this legislation. Educators also receive \ngreater freedom to coordinate instruction between special and regular \neducation students. Finally, S. 717 offers a sound compromise solution \nfor managing the disciplinary concerns of educators, parents, and \nstudents with disabilities.\n  I am also pleased that the bicameral, bipartisan working group \nresponded to my request and the request of other committee members that \nthis reauthorization include reforms specifically focused on the \nbraille literacy needs of blind and visually impaired children. Since \n1968, the percentage of blind students who lack reading or writing \nskills grew from 9 to 40 percent. This measure takes a two-pronged \napproach to this serious educational need by focusing on the importance \nof including appropriate braille instruction in a qualified student's \nindividual education plan and emphasizing the need to enhance teacher \npreparation in the use and instruction of braille. I want to thank the \nMembers of the working group for their leadership in addressing this \nkey educational issue for our Nation's blind and visually impaired \nchildren.\n  IDEA's guarantee of a free, appropriate public education for children \nwith disabilities remains one of our Nation's greatest accomplishments \nin civil rights. After 2\\1/2\\ years of work,\n\n[[Page S4408]]\n\nthis final legislative proposal demonstrates the firm commitment of \nAmerica's educators, parents, disability advocates, and this Congress \nto provide every child with an opportunity for educational success. Mr. \nPresident, I am proud to join as an original cosponsor of S. 717, and I \nencourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this worthwhile education \nmeasure.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the reauthorization \nof the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act [IDEA]. For over 20 \nyears, IDEA has been assisting children with disabilities overcome \nobstacles and become successful students who go on to become productive \ncitizens.\n  I commend the efforts of Chairman Jeffords, Senator Harkin, and \nSenator Frist. The Labor and Human Resources Committee has crafted a \nbill which is the product of hours and hours of consultation and \ndiscussion on both a bipartisan and bicameral basis. I also understand \nthat Majority Leader Lott has taken a special interest in this bill as \nwell, and I appreciate his leadership in the effort to enact this \nlegislation.\n  I have personally been assisted throughout this process by my Utah \nAdvisory Committee on Disability Policy, and specifically by Dr. Steve \nKukic, director of the Utah State Office of Education's Services for \nStudents At Risk. Early on in this process, Dr. Kukic presented \ntestimony to the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and \nidentified what I believe is a key factor in this ultimately successful \nreauthorization which is a balanced system of accountability. Crucial \nto the success of IDEA is a framework where parents, advocates, school \nadministrators and educators all work together to ensure that children \nare appropriately served.\n  I appreciate that parents, advocates, school administrators, and \neducators may have different and strongly held opinions about how to \naccomplish the goal of delivering educational services to all children, \nparticularly with regard to disciplinary actions and attorneys fees. I \nbelieve that central to the intention of this reauthorization was the \nattainment of balance between the objective of these interested \nparties. I also believe that this reauthorization, by and large, \nachieves this balance.\n  I concur with several of the points raised by Senator Gregg, \nparticularly the notion that if the Federal Government fulfilled its \ncommitment to funding IDEA at an appropriate amount, then resources \nwould be available on the state level to fund projects deemed necessary \nby the State.\n  However, as has often been stated in the Senate, we should not allow \nthe perfect to become the enemy of the good. It is vital that we move \nahead with the reauthorization of IDEA. This program makes a tremendous \ndifference in the lives of children with disabilities.\n  I again want to commend all senators who participated in bringing \nthis legislation to the floor. And, I would also like to single out a \ncouple of staff members for their dedication to this goal. Pat \nMorrissey with Senator Jeffords and Robert Silverstein with Senator \nHarkin deserve special kudos for hanging in there for the duration.\n  I am pleased that both the Senate and House of Representatives have \nensured that the services provided under IDEA will continue, and I am \npleased to vote in support of final passage. I urge the President to \nsign it promptly.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Individuals \nWith Disabilities Education Act Amendments.\n  The bill before us today serves as a shining example of what Congress \nand the administration can do when working together in a bipartisan \nbasis to address the concerns of diverse interests. In this case, these \ninterests include parents, teachers, disability advocates, and school \nadministrators. Too often these groups have been pitted against one \nanother and have risked losing sight of a goal they all share--\nproviding the best education for children with disabilities. This bill \nhelps clear away problems that have obstructed that goal and reaffirms \na child's right to a free appropriate education.\n  Since the inception of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act \nin 1975, later changed to the Individuals With Disabilities Education \nAct [IDEA], our education system has undergone significant changes. \nPrior to this monumental legislation, children with disabilities were \noften shunned from traditional schools and relegated to State \ninstitutions. Today, special needs children are learning in the \nclassroom side by side with their peers. This would not have been \npossible without IDEA.\n  Advances in technology, teaching methods, and understanding of \nchildhood development have changed the way we approach education in \ngeneral, and special education in particular. But this progress has not \nbeen painless. School districts face enormous challenges in meeting the \nneeds of all children. Given the intense resources often required to \nhelp keep special needs children in the classroom, schools and states \nhave struggled with rising costs. Along with the financial burden, \nschools have been faced with growing societal pressures.\n  I have been troubled by reports from parents, teachers, and \nadministrators in Wisconsin about violence in the classroom. Some of \nthese cases have involved students with disabilities. Although often a \nreflection of inadequate resources directed to the special needs of the \ndisabled student, disruptions affect the entire classroom. No student \nshould have to learn in a classroom of fear and no teacher should be \nforced to chose between educating a special needs student and the rest \nof the class. And Mr. President, no student should be denied an \nappropriate education.\n  I am also troubled that despite IDEA, some disabled students are not \nbe getting the education they deserve. Procedures and resources may \nvary tremendously from State to State and even between school districts \nwithin States. Clarification is needed to help schools and States \nconform with the goals of IDEA. This bill provides that clarification.\n  The bill makes numerous improvements to the current provisions of \nIDEA, while maintaining key principles. To address concerns with \nlitigation, the bill encourages use of mediation and parent training \ncenters, which are effective resources that provide low-cost dispute \nresolution between parents and schools. Paperwork burdens faced by \nschools and States are also addressed. Although documentation is a \nnecessity, educators should concentrate on teaching, not paperwork. \nImportant, parents rights are maintained and each child is still \nguaranteed an appropriate education.\n\n  I am particularly pleased that this legislation will intensify the \nfocus on early intervention services for infants and toddlers with \ndisabilities. As we know from the growing body of scientific evidence \non brain development, the most important time to influence a child's \nlearning capacity is in the zero to 3 age range. This section of IDEA \nrecognizes the need for early intervention and represents one of the \nvery few areas of Federal investment in this critical age group.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this bill helps resolve two very contentious \nissues involving special education--discipline and due process. This \ncompromise will ensure that disabled children retain access to special \neducation services while giving school districts greater ability to \nmaintain order and safety in the classroom. If students pose a threat \nto themselves or others, there is new authority to allow removing the \nchild from the class to an alternative educational setting. But the \nstudent cannot be shut out of school doors because of behavioral \nproblems relating to the child's disability. In addition, parents will \nmaintain a key role in their child's education and retain legal rights \nif a child's education is neglected.\n  Although these changes may not please everyone, I believe they \nrepresent a fair compromise to a very delicate area of law. Overall, \nthis bill is a balanced attempt to enable infants, toddlers, and \nchildren with disabilities to receive a high-quality education and \nhelps schools provide that education.\n  Mr. President, this compromise was a long time coming and will have \nan impact for a long time to come. I urge my colleagues to support this \nconsensus legislation.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nS. 717, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act reauthorization \n[IDEA].\n  Over the last 2\\1/2\\ years or so, this body has worked diligently to \nreauthorize IDEA. I commend Senators Jeffords, Harkin, Lott, Coats, \nFrist, and Kennedy, and all of the others who\n\n[[Page S4409]]\n\nhave contributed to the development of this legislation and to the \ndebate here on the Senate floor this week. The education of our \nchildren, including those with disabilities, is an important issue, and \nnot one which may be taken lightly. The efforts of the Senators I just \nmentioned demonstrate the high level of concern which exists on this \nmatter.\n  I would like to begin by addressing a matter which I have heard \ndiscussed several times over the last couple of days. That matter is \nunfunded mandates. As the author of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, I \nam well aware of this issue. In fact, I have worked on the question of \nwhether or not IDEA, or similar legislation, should fall under the \ndefinition of an unfunded mandate since well before my legislation \nbecame law.\n  Early in my work on unfunded mandates legislation, I included \nspecific limitations on the application of such a law. Among those \nlimitations were exceptions for a Federal statute or regulation which \nestablishes or enforces any statutory rights that prohibit \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, national origin, \nhandicapped, or disability status. Let me again say, an exception is \nincluded to protect the statutory rights of numerous groups, including \nthe handicapped and disabled. Clearly, IDEA is designed to protect the \nrights of disabled students. Given these two very specific facts, I \nbelieve it is inescapably obvious that IDEA is not an unfunded mandate \nas defined by the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, Public Law 104-4.\n  One aspect of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act which did impact IDEA \nwas the provision which called for the Advisory Commission on \nIntergovernmental Relations [ACIR] to explore any law which placed an \nenforceable duty on State or local governments. Among the laws which \nthe ACIR reviewed was IDEA. At the time, many groups contacted me in \nfirm opposition to any consideration of IDEA in ACIR's report. I \nmaintained that we should have no sacred cows, that reviewing IDEA in \nthe report could play an important role in reauthorizing this \nlegislation. While many people expressed numerous concerns about the \nfinal ACIR report, I think one aspect of that report was particularly \nnotable. That part mentioned that the Federal Government needed to \nfinally start picking up its fair share of the costs of IDEA, that we \nshould contribute the 40-percent of the costs that were originally \npromised. I am sure my colleagues would not be surprised to find out \nthat no one expressed any opposition to that specific recommendation.\n\n  And I am pleased to note that the ACIR recommendation on funding has \nnot been ignored. From the very beginning of the 105th Congress \nadditional attention has been focused on the need for increased federal \nfunding for IDEA. S. 1, the Safe and Affordable Schools Act of 1997, \ncontained increased authorizations for IDEA to finally reach the 40-\npercent federal share for which we have aimed. In addition, earlier \nthis year, Senator Gregg took the lead in circulating a letter to \nPresident Clinton, later signed by myself and 20 of our colleagues, \nrequesting his cooperation in fully funding special education. Now that \nthe issue of IDEA funding has been raised, I believe the increased \nconsciousness about this issue will result in Congress soon achieving \nfull funding for this important program.\n  Mr. President, while we may have many different approaches on this \nissue, I believe we share exactly the same goal--providing our \nchildren, regardless of their level of disability, with the best \npossible education. Does S. 717 reach this goal? Quite honestly, the \nanswer is no. This legislation is not perfect. No bill ever is. But S. \n717 gets us closer to our goal. Through untold hours of hard work on \nthe part of Members of Congress and various groups affected by IDEA, a \ncompromise was reached. Because of this effort, we now have before us \nlegislation which will make IDEA better.\n  I believe S. 717 improves the implementation of IDEA for all affected \nparties--students, parents, teachers, and school administrators. The \nbill takes significant steps to reduce the paperwork associated with \nthe current law and to increase the flexibility available to teachers \nand school administrators, allowing schools to focus on what should be \ntheir first priority--edu- cating young people. It improves the ability \nof schools to discipline disabled students in appropriate \ncircumstances, most notably in any situation involving the possession \nof a weapon or controlled substance. It requires mediation as an option \nto taking disputes between parents and schools to the courts. It also \nenhances the ability of parents to participate in educational decisions \nwhich affect their child. All of these things together will help us \nprovide better educational opportunities to students, both the disabled \nand non-disabled, and will ease some of the burden on schools which \nexist in the current law.\n  Mr. President, as I stated before, the bill before us today is the \nresult of a great deal of lengthy and painstaking negotiations. While \nit is likely that no one would say this is the bill they would choose \nif the decision was entirely up to them, it is the bill on which often \nopposing sides were finally able to come to an agreement. After all the \nwork which went in to creating this delicate balance, I believe \naltering the bill would be detrimental to the fragile agreement which \nwas finally built. With this in mind, I will oppose the amendments \nwhich have been offered on this legislation. While I understand the \nconcerns expressed by these amendments, and commend the amendments' \nsponsors for their concern about the needs of school districts, I \ncannot support any amendment which could unravel the current consensus \nwhich has been forged.\n  Mr. President, the legislation we have before us today will increase \nflexibility for schools, improve educational opportunities for \nstudents, and encourage parents, teachers and school administrators to \nwork more closely together to address concerns about the education of \nthe disabled. I am pleased to support this bill and urge its passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the House companion bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5) to amend the Individuals With Disabilities \n     Education Act, to reauthorize and make improvements to that \n     Act, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided between the two managers prior to the vote on passage of the \nbill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleagues. I \nunderstand the difficulties when we are asked to do things that common \nsense tells us otherwise. I know how hard it is to vote against \namendments that are common sense and also express ourselves on how we \nfeel about some of the problems we have had with the special education \nlegislation.\n  I deeply appreciate the vote on the last amendment to move this bill \nforward. As my colleagues know, we are now on the House bill which \npassed with only three dissenting votes yesterday. I hope the Senate \nwill do likewise.\n  I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this bill is a clear improvement over \npresent law. Nevertheless, it remains a $35 billion per year almost \ntotally unfunded mandate on the school districts of our country. It \ntakes away control over quality of education that they can provide and, \nregrettably, in spite of the fact that it is a slight improvement, I am \nconstrained to vote against it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield to Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in paying special tribute to \nSenator Frist. As a new Member, he took over the responsibilities in \nthis area and has made an enormous contribution to bringing us where we \nare; also, Senator Coats, and, in particular, the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Jeffords, who has exercised leadership.\n\n[[Page S4410]]\n\n  I also thank Tom Harkin. This act was passed 22 years ago. I remember \nwhen 5\\1/2\\ million children were pushed aside and lacked any kind of \nhope and opportunity. Senator Harkin has been a giant in the Senate for \nall those who have been disabled in our country. Today is a victory for \nchildren, it is a victory for the parents of these children, and it is \na victory for our country. I think, quite frankly, it is the finest \nmoment we have had in this session. I commend those who made it \npossible to make a difference for disabled children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for his kind \nremarks, for his leadership in this area. I thank Senator Jeffords and \nespecially Senator Frist, who had the first hearing on this 2 years \nago, May 9, 1995. It has been a long process. We have worked with all \ngroups.\n  We worked with all groups, and we have a very balanced, fair, and \nforward looking bill.\n  To sum it up, Mr. President, what this bill says is that prior to \n1974, almost 1 million kids were totally excluded from not receiving \neducation only because they were disabled. Now they are in school, they \nare learning, they are becoming productive citizens, they are working. \nThey are taxpayers, not tax consumers. They are not in institutions any \nlonger.\n  Are there problems out there? Yes, but we are meeting those problems, \nand we are a better and stronger country because of what we did 22 \nyears ago. This bill moves us into the 21st century by saying that we \nare going to strengthen this law and we are going to provide that this \ncountry meets its obligations to all of our children, including \nchildren with disabilities.\n  Again, this is a bill that reaches out and lifts up everyone in this \ncountry. I urge its passage.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are now going to vote on the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997. The Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act, referred to as IDEA, has been on the \nbooks for 22 years.\n  The obligation to provide children with disabilities a free and \nappropriate education is grounded in the 14th amendment to the \nConstitution, title V of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, and by the laws of every State. IDEA is one \nadditional civil rights tool that guarantees children with disabilities \nthe right to receive a quality education. IDEA is the only Federal \ncivil rights statute that provides funds to assist States in meeting \nthe obligation to educate all children. This bill is about the \neducational future of 5.4 million children.\n  From my perspective, IDEA is a voluntary grant-in-aid program. It \nprovides funds to States to assist them in making available a free \nappropriate public education to 5.4 million children with disabilities \nfrom 3 through 21. If a State elects to take its allotment of funds \nappropriated for IDEA in any year, it must provide a free appropriate \npublic education to these children as prescribed by the law. Today, \nevery State is participating in the IDEA grant-in-aid program, and 49 \nStates have elected to participate in and comply with IDEA since 1975.\n  The history of these IDEA amendments precedes the 105th Congress. In \nthe last Congress our colleagues on the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee attempted to move a bipartisan reauthorization of IDEA \nthrough the Senate. Their bill, S. 1578, did not make it to the floor \nbefore that Congress ended. Those of us involved in the last minutes of \nthe 104th Congress, especially the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee, Dr. Frist, and Mr. Harkin from Iowa, the authors of S. 1578, \nSenator Jeffords and myself, pledged to make the reauthorization of \nIDEA one of our top legislative priorities in this Congress. We are \nhere again with a bipartisan approach. And, actions speak louder than \nwords.\n  Since January of this year, Senate and House staff, as well as \nrepresentatives from the administration have been meeting daily to \ncraft our bipartisan bill and to bring this legislation to the floor as \nquickly as possible. Those involved in crafting this legislation \nincluded not only Senators and Labor and Human Resources Committee \nstaff, but also our House counterparts, especially Chairman Goodling, \nMr. Riggs, Mr. Gray, and Mr. Martinez. Officials from the U.S. \nDepartment of Education, particularly Judith Heumann, Assistant \nSecretary for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, and White \nHouse representative, Lucia Wyman, also participated in the process. \nThe range of expertise and knowledge brought to bear in developing this \nbill as well as the spirit of bipartisan, bicameral cooperation \ndemonstrated in writing it is unprecedented. I have seen nothing like \nthis in my 24 years in Congress. In fact, the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee and the House Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce, unanimously reported out identical legislation, S. 717 and \nH.R. 5 respectfully, on the same day, May 7, 1997. Moreover, the \ncommittees collaborated with each other in developing their respective \nreports.\n\n  The frequency, scope, and type of input we sought and received in \nputting together this final product was extraordinary. Almost every \nweek for 3 months we held public meetings using a town hall format. \nThis permitted those interested in our progress in drafting the IDEA \nbill to offer feedback and input. Students, educators, advocates, and \nparents traveled from all over the country to provide comments on our \nproposals. Often, more than 100 people would speak at an individual \nmeeting. No effort was made to limit the amount of people that \ntestified or limit the time they could speak. Many told personal \nstories that were oftentimes both heart warming and heart wrenching. \nTheir recommendations came from the real education front lines. Our \ninclusive process, although unorthodox, has paid off. As of today, we \nhave heard from over 30 groups that support our moving this legislation \nwithout amendment. They view our 5-month effort as worthy of their \nunequivocal support.\n  Many of you in this Chamber and your constituents, who are involved \nin this issue, appreciate the delicate balance this bill represents. It \nis built on principles, it is built on consensus, and it is built on \ncompromise.\n  I acknowledge that States need additional Federal funding to fully \nimplement IDEA the way it is intended. We have said in S. 1, the Safe \nand Affordable Schools Act of 1997, that we will increase funding, from \nthe current $3.2 billion to $13.2 billion in 7 years. More Federal \ndollars for IDEA is an appropriations issue that we will turn to after \nwe pass this important legislation. I am confident that dollars spent \ntoday for the education of children with disabilities is money well \nspent. When all children are provided a quality education, they stand a \nbetter chance of becoming productive and contributing adults in our \nsociety. IDEA is an important investment in the future of children with \ndisabilities.\n\n  Another benefit that IDEA provides is that it offers everyone one set \nof rules on how to go about providing an education to children with \ndisabilities. Prior to 1975, 35 States, through Federal courts, State \ncourts, and State legislatures, were grappling with how to define the \nprovision of an education to children with disabilities. Individual \nStates and the country as a whole did not need, did not want 35 \ninterpretations of what constituted an education for children with \ndisabilities. Everyone wanted one rule book. That is why IDEA \noriginally passed. That is why today, with States educating 5.4 million \nchildren with disabilities, less than one-half of 1 percent of \ndisagreements between parents and school districts, over a disabled \nchild's education, end up in court. Do we want to step backward? Do we \nwant to reset the clock and create a legal free-for-all? I don't \nbelieve we do.\n  I would like to make another observation. I, as much as anyone else \nin this Chamber, want Federal IDEA dollars to be spent on educating \nchildren with disabilities, not on attorneys' fees. I am convinced that \nthis bill makes that happen. Could we have put more limitations on when \nattorneys could be used or when parents, who prevail against a school \ndistrict in a legal dispute, could be reimbursed? You bet. Could we \nhave gotten here today having done so? No. Most of the limitations on \nattorneys' fees were put in the statute by our colleague from Utah, \nSenator Hatch in 1986. They are in this bill.\n  The Individuals With Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997 \nis,\n\n[[Page S4411]]\n\nin my view, an important legislative accomplishment. The process we \nimplemented to develop this legislation provides us with a new standard \nfor how we can work together. This bill sends a message to the country \nthat we care about education, that we care about children, that we care \nabout families, and that we care about the future. This is a powerful \nand positive message. Please join me and the rest of my colleagues who \nhave worked long and hard to get here, in supporting this bill. The \nPresident is waiting. He is ready to sign the IDEA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \ntolerance. This is an incredibly important piece of legislation that \nwill do so much to straighten out the problems that we have with \nrespect to special education in our schools. It allows much more \nflexibility in discipline in the schools. It takes care of the numerous \nproblems that we have had.\n  I will point out that Senator Lott and Dave Hoppe spent an infinite \nnumber of hours bringing these groups together. Senator Frist did so \nmuch last year to prepare us, but it fell apart at the last minute. \nSenator Coats also worked very hard on this.\n  I commend all colleagues for their support. I point out that this \npassed the House yesterday 420 to 3. I hope we can do even better on \nthis side. I thank all the staff who have helped us.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the bill is \nconsidered read three times.\n  The question is, Shall the bill, H.R. 5, pass? The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for the \ntremendous vote and support for the legislation. This has been an \nincredible endeavor: So much effort, so much time. The vote that we \nhave is certainly, percentagewise, perhaps at least identical to the \nHouse, and certainly with only one dissenting vote is a tremendous \ntribute to all those who worked to put this bill together.\n  In particular, I wish to thank Senator Frist, who brought it almost \nto this point last year, and it fell apart at the last minute. His \nefforts were so paramount in bringing this bill to us this year.\n  I thank the majority leader and Dave Hoppe for their help in getting \nall the groups together, and thank as well the work of both sides of \nthe aisle, Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, all on my side, certainly \nSenator Coats and, as I mentioned, Senator Frist and Senator Lott, and \nall who have worked so hard--Senator Gregg in particular on the \nfunding--this past year. We have had a real joint effort. And I am \nblessed and thank Pat Morrissey and Jim Downing of my staff who also \ndid tremendous work, and also the staff on the majority side and the \nminority side.\n  I yield to Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to take a couple minutes to thank a \nlot of people because this has been indeed a long journey and a tough \njourney.\n  It started, as I said, 2 years ago, on May 9, 1995, when Senator \nFrist had the first hearing on the reauthorization of the bill. And it \nhas taken us 2 long years of working literally, if not every day, every \nweek on this, and lately every day on it for the last several months.\n  So I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to the people who have \nmade it possible to reach this passage of S. 717. There are many people \nwith a deep commitment to improving educational results for disabled \nchildren who stayed the course throughout this very long, tough \njourney. And today we can now point with satisfaction to a well-\nbalanced, bipartisan bill that makes the kinds of improvements we are \nseeking in reauthorizing IDEA.\n  Twenty-two years ago, as we have all said, with the enactment of \nPublic Law 94-142, Congress took steps to ensure children with \ndisabilities would no longer be excluded from school and would be \nguaranteed access to a free appropriate public education.\n  Today, we have taken another major step by ensuring that the disabled \nchildren will now have the opportunity to enjoy the same expectations \nin the general curriculum as enjoyed by their nondisabled peers. And \nthat success will be judged by the same high standards applicable to \nothers.\n  So first I would like to thank Judy Heumann, the Assistant Secretary \nfor the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services. Ms. \nHeumann, who has polio and herself was excluded from school, has \nsuccessfully overcome diversity and discrimination. She sued the New \nYork City Board of Education for the right to teach from her wheelchair \nin that city. She won. And she taught. And she has devoted her adult \nlife to advocating for the rights of disabled persons.\n  I think it is especially significant to point out in 1975, Judy \nworked for Senator Harrison Williams, who was one of the sponsors of \nPublic Law 94-142. In her role with the Department of Education, she \nand Dr. Tom Hehir, Director of the Office of Special Education \nPrograms, together with Secretary Riley, and their respective staffs \ncrafted a reauthorization bill that has served as the framework and \nfoundation for what we have just passed.\n  So I express my appreciation to Secretary Riley, Ms. Heumann, and Tom \nHehir. I want to give special thanks to their respective staffs who \ncontinuously provided crucial technical assistance and leadership \nthroughout this entire reauthorization process.\n  I would especially, Mr. President, like to commend our majority \nleader, Senator Lott, for his deep commitment to ensuring passage of \nthe IDEA reauthorization bill as soon as possible in this legislative \nsession. The majority leader demonstrated the extent of his commitment \nby arranging for his own chief of staff, David Hoppe, to facilitate the \nbipartisan, bicameral working group that has worked so hard over the \nlast 10 weeks to develop this final bill.\n  I simply cannot say enough to express my appreciation to Senator \nLott's chief of staff, David Hoppe, for his enormous contribution to \nthis reauthorization process. We would not have had a bill today \nwithout his involvement. Mr. Hoppe brought to this process a strong \nsense of integrity, superb negotiating skills, a sense of humor, and a \nstick-to-itiveness. It was a continuous exercise of all of these \nattributes in facilitating the working group that resulted in the bill \nwe passed today.\n\n[[Page S4412]]\n\n  As I said, Mr. President, it was 2 years ago this week that Senator \nFrist, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Disability Policy brought to \norder the 20th anniversary joint House-Senate informational hearing on \nIDEA. And following that hearing, Senator Frist worked diligently to \nsecure passage of the bill before the end of the 104th Congress. Well, \nalthough it was not possible to fully meet that goal, the groundwork \nlaid by Senator Frist, and his unending devotion to making sure we \npassed it, was of significant help to the working group this year in \ncrafting again the bill we just passed.\n  It was a pleasure and a privilege for me to work as the ranking \nminority member on the Disability Policy Subcommittee with Senator \nFrist in this effort. I want to thank Senator Frist for his tireless \nleadership and contribution to this bill.\n  Let me pay tribute to a friend of longstanding from House days, and \nnow in the Senate, who now stands across the aisle from me as the \nchairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, Senator \nJeffords of Vermont, for his commitment over a lifetime, for developing \nquality education for all of our children--for all of our children. \nSenator Jeffords has always been in the forefront of the fight. I thank \nhim especially for his leadership in supporting passage of this bill.\n  Senator Jeffords' long commitment, not only to education of all \nkinds, but especially for kids with disabilities, also played a key \nrole in the enactment of 94-142 in 1975. And I thank him publicly for \nthat lifetime of work and dedication.\n  I also especially want to thank Senator Kennedy for the tremendous \ncontribution he made to this. Throughout his tenure with this body, \nSenator Kennedy has continually provided the leadership we have needed \nin championing all civil rights issues. He has consistently worked with \nme to support various laws ensuring the rights of individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  Through Senator Kennedy's diligence, he ensured that stronger \nenforcement requirements would be added to S. 717 to help ensure that \nStates and local school districts would be in full compliance with \nIDEA.\n  Let me pay tribute also to Senator Coats and Senator Dodd for their \ncontribution to the successful passage of this bill, and all of my \ncolleagues in the House who worked with us in a very unique \narrangement.\n  I say to my friend from Vermont, it was so successful. We had to spin \nthis off from other bills. We pulled together not only bipartisanship \nhere in the Senate, but it was bicameral. And we worked together with \nthe House Republicans and Democrats, jointly, day after day in \ndeveloping this bill.\n  And I would just mention--hopefully without excluding too many \npeople--Representatives Goodling, of course, and Martinez, \nRepresentatives Riggs and Miller, Castle and Scott. So this bill has \ntruly been a bipartisan, bicameral effort. And I am proud to have been \na part of that effort.\n  But now let me also thank all of the staff members of the working \ngroup. As I said, they were here every day, all week, weekends, late \nFridays, Saturdays. I would get phone calls on Saturday night and \nSunday afternoons, and they were still working. I hate to admit it, I \nwas home. They were working.\n  But I have to first thank Bobby Silverstein for his leadership on \nthis bill, and going back for many, many years, first when he worked \nfor Congressman Williams in the House and then saw the light and came \nover to the Senate to work on my staff on the Disability Policy \nSubcommittee in the mid-1980's. And it was through Bobby Silverstein's \nlifetime, long and deep commitment to ensuring the rights of people \nwith disabilities that we got through the Americans With Disabilities \nAct in 1990. And it was through his efforts that we were able to \nfinally pull together all of the working people on this bill and the \nreauthorization of Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. So to \nBobby Silverstein, I thank him for many years of service on this \ncommittee and for his service for making this country more fair and \njust for all people. I thank Tom Irvin of my own staff, on detail from \nthe Department of Education. I thank Pat Morrissey, who took over the \nleadership on the staff in the subcommittee 2 years ago with Senator \nFrist. Again, Pat has been a stalwart, always there, always working, no \nmatter what hour, no matter what day. I want to thank Pat again for all \nof her work in ensuring the passage of this bill. Also, Jim Downing, \nSenator Jeffords' staff, again, Jim, I thank you again for everything \nyou have done. You have always been there. Thank you to Townsend Lang \nof Senator Coats' staff, Dave Larsen of Senator Frist's staff, and Kate \nPowers, Connie Garner, and Danica Petroshius of Senator Kennedy's \nstaff. I also commend the hard work of the House staff, including Sally \nLovejoy and Todd Jones of the House committee majority staff, Alex Nock \nof the House subcommittee minority staff, Theresa Thompson of \nRepresentative Scott's staff and Charlie Barone of Representative \nMiller's staff.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, most importantly--most importantly --I want \nto thank all of the members of the disability community and the general \neducation community who stuck with this process through 2 long years. \nIt was up and it was down, up and down, all the time. We thought we had \nagreements, then it would fall back. We kept bringing them together, \nbringing them together. It was a deep commitment by those who \nunderstand the need for a balance.\n  I am sympathetic, as I said many times, with teachers who find \nthemselves in a classroom and perhaps they have children there that \nthey do not know how to handle. They are at their wits' end, and \nprincipals maybe get to their wits' end. I have a lot of sympathy for \nthem. That is why we have to meet more of our obligations in providing \nmore funds to the States for teacher training and supportive services \nfor those teachers so they can do what is right and proper and meet \ntheir obligations.\n  Well, what those who wanted a bill in the education community did and \nthe disability community did over the last couple of years, they said, \n``We will forget all the anecdotes. Everyone has a horror story.'' You \ncan always find a horror story someplace no matter which side you are \non. If you are on the disability side, you can find horror stories \nabout teachers or principals who did bad things to kids with \ndisabilities. If you are on the education side, you can find horrible \nthings--maybe somebody claimed they had a disability and they did not. \nBut we cannot legislate by anecdote. We cannot legislate by one, two, \nor three horror stories. We have to do what is right for the entire \nNation. We have to cut through the fog and the haze and the one or two \nstories that keep cropping up. We have to cut through the \nmisconceptions.\n  I do not know how many times I keep hearing this is an unfunded \nmandate when we all know it is not an unfunded mandate. So we have to \nkeep cutting through, cutting through, all the time. That is what some \nof the leaders in the general education community and the disability \ncommunity did for the last couple of years.\n  I thank them, not those who wanted to throw a hand grenade in \nperiodically because they had a horror story, but those who understood \nthat we had to reach a consensus, we had to strike a balance. That is \nwhat this bill is.\n  In closing, I hope and believe the bill we passed today, the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997, will \nclearly enhance equal educational opportunities for all children with \ndisabilities as we enter the 21st century. We promised that in 1975. We \nhave met a lot of those promises--not all of them. We have a lot of \npromises to keep.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I will take a moment and thank the Senator from Iowa \nfor his most eloquent statement. I think for those of us who were \ninvolved in the original writing of it back in 1975, I think only we, \nperhaps, had the legal understanding of what has happened over the last \n20-odd years now as to improving the lives of individuals with \ndisabilities and to improve the confidence of our educational system in \ngiving an appropriate education to all our students.\n  I yield to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise very briefly to say that this bill \nis about\n\n[[Page S4413]]\n\neducation. This bill is about children. Today we have seen a real \nvictory for the over 40 million individuals with disabilities in this \ncountry, but especially the 5 million children, individuals with \ndisabilities, who will benefit--who will benefit--from this modernized, \nupdated Individuals With Disabilities Education Act.\n  The bipartisan vote of 98-1 shows the Republicans and Democrats are \nworking together, have worked together, and will continue to work \ntogether to ensure that individuals with disabilities have the same \nopportunities that every other American has to achieve the utmost \npotential for themselves. It was a bicameral bill. I am delighted the \nHouse passed it, the exact same bill, just 2 days ago.\n  I want to thank people from my staff, including Sue Swenson, Dave \nEgnor, Robert Stodden, Dave Larson, Pat Morrissey, Bob Silverstein, and \nTom Irvin from the minority staff who helped me so much over the last 2 \nyears, and once again, I thank Dave Hoppe, Senator Jeffords, and \nSenator Harkin for their leadership, for their experience, and their \nwisdom in passing this bill today. It is a victory for education, a \nvictory for children, a victory for all Americans.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Thank you, Senator.\n  Mr. President, last evening the House adopted H.R. 5 by a recorded \nvote of 420 to 3. Today we have voted 98-1. In the last week Congress \nhas demonstrated once again, its willingness to invest in human \ncapital--the children of today and the taxpayers of tomorrow, children \nwith disabilities and children, who, if not helped, might develop \ndisabilities. We have said in H.R. 5: children with disabilities will \ncontinue to receive a free appropriate public education, we do expect \nthem to succeed in the general education curriculum, and we will be \naccountable for their progress. That is a clear, simple message, a \nmessage of power, potential, and promise.\n  We invested in human capital in another way in H.R. 5. We recognized \nthe range of decisions and obligations that fall to local school \ndistricts on a daily basis. We gave them flexible, practical guidelines \non how and when they may discipline children with known disabilities. \nWe gave them greater access to Federal dollars and greater discretion \nin how those dollars may be used. We directed more resources to \npersonnel preparation and to technical assistance. We reshaped \nprocedural requirements so school personnel may concentrate on children \nand teaching them.\n  We invested in human capital through incentives for partnership \nbetween State educational agencies and local education agencies, and \nbetween parents and professionals. These partnerships will not only \nfoster cooperative planning and problem solving, but innovation and \nexpanded opportunities for children, with and without disabilities, to \nbenefit from school.\n  The process by which we arrived here today, for this vote, may be \nunprecedented and never be repeated, but it allowed us to achieve a \nconsensus on a fundamental point. All children are entitled to a good \neducation, we reaffirm that, and make it more likely for children with \ndisabilities in H.R. 5.\n  Although others may characterize our efforts differently, I would say \nthat we were guided by the premise that special education is not a \nplace but an attitude. It is an attitude that says children need not \nfail in order to be helped; that communication and partnership with \nparents is a commitment, not an accident; and that solutions to \nproblems do not come from mandates, but from reaching common ground.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues for their support in the passage of \nthis historic legislation.\n\n\n                          idea reauthorization\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to express my gratitude to all the \nfolks who made possible the passage of the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act reauthorization bill. It's been a real \nstruggle over the last 2 years, but a concerted effort led by David \nHoppe of Majority Leader Lott's staff has resulted in a compromise bill \nthat received near unanimous support in both the House and the Senate. \nI was among those voting for this bill.\n  Mr. President, Montana's schools are breathing a sigh of relief that \nthey will have more flexibility in dealing with disruptive students who \npose a threat to teachers and other students. At the same time, the \nbill preserves the right of disabled students to a free appropriate \npublic education.\n  However, as with all compromises, there is something in this bill for \neveryone to dislike. I don't think the bill goes far enough in giving \nlocal educational agencies the ability to remove and expel dangerous \nstudents. I supported Senator Gorton's amendment to allow local \nagencies to develop their own policies on disciplining students. This \namendment was defeated.\n  I also have serious concerns about the costs of implementing this \nbill, costs which fall directly on the States and the school districts. \nMake no mistake: at current Federal funding levels, this bill is an \nunfunded mandate on the States. The Federal Government funds less than \n10 percent of the bill's costs, though it has promised to pay 40 \npercent. This bill does not set funding levels--it is not an \nappropriations bill. We will have a separate debate on funding later in \nthe year. But I want to point out that we are mandating that our local \nschools take specific actions which are very expensive and getting even \nmore so every year. We must take more responsibility for our actions, \nand I hope we will do that when we debate funding later this year.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent S. 717 be \nreturned to the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/14/senate-section/article/S4401-5", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when I came to the Senate, I brought with \nme a little sign I used to keep on my desk as a lawyer. It was the \nfour-way test of the Rotary Clubs of America. It says, ``Of the things \nwe think, say, or do, is it the truth? Is it fair to all concerned? \nWill it build good will and better friendships? Will it be beneficial \nto all concerned?''\n  A little over 10 years ago, I stood on this floor and I had in my \nhand a flier that had been issued by the Wilderness Society. It had a \npicture of Mount McKinley National Park and Wonder Lake--that is in the \npark--on the front of it, with the word ``sold'' stamped on it. That \nindicates somehow or other that logging was going on in Mount McKinley \nNational Park near Wonder Lake.\n  There is another picture that talked about logging 800-year-old \nhemlock trees in a rain forest. As a matter of fact, those photographs \nwere of redwood logs on trucks in California, on a California highway, \nand we identified the highway. To his great credit, the former Senator \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Gaylord Nelson, withdrew that pamphlet and \ncalled me and told me he was doing that.\n  Last week, after the debate on the supplemental appropriations bill, \nI came to the office in the morning and I found on my desk an AP story \nwritten by Jim Abrams, Associated Press writer. It started with this \nline: ``Legislation making it easier to build roads through Federal \nparks and wilderness area survived a Senate challenge Wednesday and \nheaded toward a possible showdown with the White House. The measure, \npushed by Alaska and Utah Senators, inserted in a crucial bill to \nprovide billions to victims of natural disasters, would give the \nFederal Government less say in what constitutes a valid right-of-way \nunder a 130-year-old law.''\n  Another AP story came to my attention later that day by Mr. H. Josef \nHebert of the Associated Press. It goes further in asserting that we \nhave presented to the Senate a bill that would intrude upon national \nparks and wildlife refugees. Interestingly enough, issued out of the AP \noffice in Salt Lake City, was this article: ``White House move \nopponents claimed could block access to rural byways in Utah and Alaska \nhas been narrowly defeated by the Senate.''\n  It goes on to state the issue from the point of view of someone who \nknows what he is talking about.\n\n[[Page S4414]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent these three articles be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. We found later that the information in those articles \nwas based on a statement issued by the National Parks and Conservation \nAssociation, which in my day when I was with the Interior Department of \nthe Eisenhower administration was a truthful organization, not just a \nbunch of flacks for the extreme environmental movement.\n  It is very interesting to read this because this is the source of the \nclaims made here on the floor that assert that there would be hundreds \nof thousands of miles across wildlife refuges, national parks, and \nother areas in Alaska--as a matter of fact, the figure of over 900,000 \nmiles was used several times.\n  Now, Mr. President, nothing is farther from the truth. I am here to \nask the people in the Senate and the people who are addressing this \nissue to come back and face the four-way test. It is not true. The \nnewspapers began repeating over and over again that the provision I \nauthored in this bill that passed the Senate would create new roads and \nmake Swiss cheese of our national parks and other protected areas. \nThose are false reports that are based on I do not know what kind of \nresearch. I am here today to set the record straight.\n\n  Mr. President, it is a very simple proposition. Here is a map of \nAlaska with hypothetical section lines on it. Our State is one-fifth \nthe size of the United States, 586,000 square miles. We became a State, \nMr. President, in 1959. In 1969, the whole State was withdrawn from the \ncreation of any rights--no State rights, no native rights, no private \nrights could be created on Federal lands. At that time, the Federal \nGovernment owned almost 90 percent of Alaska land. These hypothetical \nlines represent section lines, as I said. If the lands were ever \nsurveyed under Revised Statute 2477 as interpreted by my State, it \nwould be possible--possible--for the State to claim the right to build \na highway.\n  The falsity of the statements that were made concerning my amendment \nare depicted on this map. We, in 1976, as a Congress, with the \nPresident's approval, repealed the old Revised Statute 2477. What that \ndid is give the areas in the West where rights-of-way had been created \nby use or by surveys, the right to use those rights-of-way across \nFederal lands and they, in fact, ripened into the highway system of the \nUnited States. However, those rights had to be created in most of the \nUnited States by 1976. We protected only valid existing rights that \nwere created prior to the repeal of the old Revised Statute 2477. At \nthe time Revised Statute 2477 was enacted, there were a little over \n10,000 miles of section line in our State, according to the Bureau of \nLand Management. They were primarily, Mr. President, represented by the \nsurveys that had been made in the metropolitan areas of our State and \nthe cities, Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, what not. They were not out \nin the rural areas, unless the Government on some unknown occasion \nsurveyed the area nearby a mining claim.\n  The reason we protected valid existing rights was that so these rural \nareas of Alaska would have the right to develop access to airports, to \nrivers, and to one another. That is the reason we are still battling to \nprotect the rights that were created under Revised Statute 2477. But, \nMr. President, there are no surveys of the national parks or the \nwildlife refuges in Alaska. There were none in 1976, except possibly \nfor the area right near a mining claim. To assert that there are \n900,000 miles of section line highway potentials in Alaska across \nnational parks is absolutely a lie. It is time that the people who \ncontinue to assert that admit it. I hope that the National Parks \nAssociation will have the courtesy and the courage that the Wilderness \nSociety did when it withdrew its false statement about our land.\n  Section lines are created only by surveys. Surveys of section lines \ncould lead to highways if the State claimed the right when they go \nacross Federal lands. But the basic concept is there are no surveys. \nThere will be no surveys of the lands that remain in Federal ownership. \nThe surveys that are taking place in Alaska are the surveys to take out \nof Federal ownership the lands that were granted to the State, or to \nthe Native people of Alaska by acts of Congress.\n  That is what this chart shows. It shows the land ownership of Alaska \nin 1992. The blue land is patented to the State. The orange land is \nland that is awaiting patents that have been selected by the State. The \ngreen land is all Federal conservation areas set aside by an act of \nCongress. They will not be surveyed. They are, in fact, the national \nparks and wildlife refuges. The pink land that is shown is the land \nthat Congress has returned to our Native people based upon the land \nclaims settlement of 1971. But for anyone to assert that it is possible \nto create 900,000 miles of roads across parks and withdrawn areas on \nsection lines is just absolutely false.\n  Mr. President, we have, as I said, about 10,000 miles of surveyed \nsection lines in Alaska--in an area one-fifth the size of the United \nStates--in 1976. But, again, for Alaska, the rights that are preserved \nunder Federal law are mostly those that occurred when they were created \nprior to 1969 when the Secretary of the Interior withdrew the whole \nState. That was done by the Secretary of Interior, Mr. Udall. And it \nwas, in effect, in order to protect the rights of the Alaska Native \npeople until we passed the Land Claims Settlement Act.\n  But there is no question about it. None of the lands that these \npeople are talking about--the parks, the wildlife refuges, and the \nwilderness areas--are surveyed and, therefore, there will be no 900,000 \nmiles of section line rights-of-way.\n  It is an interesting thing to see. There are assertions coming even \nnow from the Department of the Interior, based upon these claims, I \ntake it, of the National Parks Association, that there are 160,000 \nmiles of section lines and national parks. There are none, Mr. \nPresident if they were never surveyed. You can't have a section line \nuntil it is surveyed. You can draw hypothetical lines on a map like \nthey did here. This map was issued by the Department of Natural \nResources of our State. It is what we call a protraction. But a \nprotraction doesn't create section lines, and section lines are \nabsolutely required to have a section line right-of-way claimed by the \nState.\n  Mr. President, we did a little research. This might interest the \nSenate to know that of all the Federal aid highways in the whole United \nStates there are about 900,000 miles today.\n  These people in their press releases and in their reports to the \nAmerican people through the Associated Press claim that this Senator \nwas trying to create in one State in national parks and wildlife \nrefuges and other withdrawn areas the same amount of roads that exist \nfor the whole United States that had Federal aid. By definition, Mr. \nPresident, all roads in Alaska are built with Federal aid. They cost a \nlot of money to build. The roads in Alaska are very expensive. It costs \n$6 million a mile to build roads in Alaska, and we only build them when \nwe come within the scope of the Federal aid highway system.\n\n  We have less than 700,000 people in Alaska. No one I have ever known \nhas ever come to me and said we want almost a million miles in this \nState; that we want to get more miles of Federal aid roads built in \nthis State on section lines than exist in all the rest of the United \nStates. That is absolutely such a wild claim that I can't find, really, \nthe words to answer it, except that it does disturb me a great deal, as \nmay be obvious and was obvious the other day, I am sure.\n  We will not have section lines across Federal lands. By definition, \nFederal lands had to be unreserved at the time of the establishment of \nthe R.S. 2477 claim. As I indicated, in 1969 all of these lands in our \nState that were Federal lands were withdrawn. No claim could be made \nagainst them. The basic law under which claims could be made was \nrepealed in 1976. But because of the withdrawal of our land, none of \nthe claims we can assert--and there can be private rights-of-way, not \nsection lines right-of-way, but rights of way established by public use \nasserted by interested private citizens--across Federal lands where \nthey were perfected before there was a withdrawal.\n\n[[Page S4415]]\n\n  Mr. President, the great problem that we have in Alaska is this \ncheckerboard land ownership. I urge the Senate to consider this. In our \nState, we have State lands, Federal lands, Native lands, and private \nlands in such a checkerboard pattern that literally in order for some \nof the State lands to be accessed, it is absolutely necessary to go \nacross Federal lands. But we are not trying to access that land by \nsections lines to go through withdrawn areas that were withdrawn for \nnational parks. There may be some private citizens asserting R.S. 2466 \nrights there by use. I think that the Department of the Interior is \ncataloging those now. I know our State is. And we are going to have \nsome disputes over what extent we can have that access.\n  But I would ask anyone, look at that map. That is the total road \nsystem of Alaska today. There is no access by road to any of those 270 \nvillages. They can only be accessed by air. It is true that in some of \nthese areas we are trying to establish roads between the villages so we \ncan have one airport serving four villages instead of one airport per \nvillage. But we are not talking about going through the national parks \nwith section lines. We are not talking about going through areas that \nwere already reserved on section lines, because according to Bureau of \nLand Management, there are no section lines.\n  Mr. President, I don't know how to deal with issues like this and \nrepresent my State without coming here and once again urging that the \npeople involved do some basic research. We have now a Federal judge, \nJudge Sedwick, who years ago wrote an article about the issue of \nrights-of-way. I want to put it in the Record today, and will read his \nconclusions.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue that is going to perplex our State. \nAgain, Mr. President, we have only been a State since 1959. We were a \nState only 10 years before the whole thing was withdrawn, and no rights \ncould be created until Congress acted. Congress acted in 1971 in the \nAlaska Native Claim Settlement Act, and then in 1980 on the Alaska \nNational Interest Conservation Lands Act. After that, the rights of the \nState and Natives could be perfected. We had to wait until 1980 to \nproceed to get the lands that were awarded to us by Congress in 1958 \nand awarded the Native people of our State in 1971. The reason we did \nwas because the withdrawal, as I said, was made by Secretary Udall. All \nFederal lands were withdrawn. As a consequence, the whole subject of \nwhere we can build roads to improve the quality of life of our rural \npeople is a very, very intriguing one, but a difficult one for us.\n  We want to have the roads that will help us get better health care, \nthat will get better education for people who live in rural areas, that \nwill get better communications, particularly to try to see if we can't \nfind a way to deal with the delivery of mail and other packages by some \nsort of road connection.\n  This is an unpublished manuscript, but I want to put it in the \nRecord.\n  This is Mr. Sedwick. He was then an attorney. John Sedwick was an \nattorney practicing law, and he was chairman of the Alaska Bar \nAssociation's environmental law section. He is a recognized \nenvironmental lawyer, a very good lawyer, and a very good judge. This \nis his summary. I want to read it into the Record:\n\n       The following summary represents the current state of \n     section line easement law in Alaska in 1983, after the 1976 \n     repeal of RS 2477. As the preceding sections of this paper \n     has shown, there are some areas of uncertainty and some \n     differences of opinion which have not yet been resolved. With \n     that warning in mind, the summary is as follows:\n       A section line easement is an easement for the construction \n     of a public highway, or other facility such as a power line, \n     water line, or sewer line. The maximum width of a section \n     line easement will be 100 feet on State-owned land, or land \n     acquired from the State, and 66 feet on Federal land, or land \n     acquired from the Federal Government. One making use of the \n     section line easement is not, however, automatically entitled \n     to use its maximum width. The user may only take advantage of \n     so much of the section line easement as is reasonably \n     necessary for the construction and maintenance of the \n     facility. Section line easements cannot exist prior to \n     approval of the official survey which creates the section \n     line.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       Section line easements cannot exist prior to the approval \n     of the official survey which creates the section line.\n       The section line easement exists on all land in Alaska for \n     which an official survey was approved prior to October 21, \n     1976, except for the following: Land which went into private \n     ownership prior to April 6, 1923; land which went into \n     private ownership prior to approval of the official survey; \n     lands whose official survey was approved on or after January \n     18, 1949, which, if territorial lands, went into private \n     ownership before March 26, 1951, and which, if Federal lands, \n     went into private ownership before March 21, 1953; Federal \n     land which was reserved for public use prior to April 6, \n     1923, which remain reserved at least until October 21, 1976; \n     Federal lands reserved for public use prior to approval of \n     the official survey which remain reserved at least until \n     October 21, 1976; Federal lands whose official survey was \n     approved on or after January 18, 1949, which were reserved \n     for public use prior to March 21, 1953, and which remain \n     reserved until at least October 21, 1976.\n\n  And the last category is all university lands.\n  Mr. President, those few exceptions give us some hope for small \nconnections of roads in rural Alaska.\n  By what is being done now there are some people who want apparently \nto destroy those rights which exist. They are very few in number, as \nJudge Sedwick pointed out, very few. They had to be created before 1969 \nand in many instances before 1923. But the main purpose of it is to \ndetermine how we can do the things which must be done to improve the \nquality of life in rural Alaska.\n  I call the Chair's attention to this one green line here that goes \nfrom Nome to Teller. That is the only improved road that I know of that \ntype. It goes from the city of Nome, which was the gold rush \nheadquarters at the turn of the century, to Teller, which is a small \ncity up on the coastline. That is one connection that was made years \nago, and it was made using an old trail that existed. We have not been \nable to get approval to move forward with the others, and we want to do \nso.\n  My State, as I stated on the floor last week, has gone through a \nwhole series of studies trying to find a way to demonstrate to the \nDepartment of Interior that the claims that are asserted based on use \nnow--we are not talking about section lines; section lines \nautomatically can be claimed by the State under State law once they are \nsurveyed. But again the key is those people who assert we are going to \nhave 900,000 miles of section line roads know better. They know they \nare telling a lie because the conservation system units themselves have \nnot been surveyed.\n  Now, I hope, Mr. President, that when we get back to this issue again \npeople will not come out on the floor and assert that this Senator is \ntrying to build roads across wilderness areas either. We are not trying \nto determine any kind of rights-of-way across wilderness areas. There \nare some areas that are candidates for becoming wilderness areas in \nwhich there are private rights and public rights that exist now on \nthese Federal lands. That is the issue we are trying to resolve.\n  I am indebted to my good friend from Arizona, Senator McCain, who \nsuggested that we have some approach to this to get the issue resolved. \nIt is a very vital issue for rural Alaska. It is not an issue that \ninvolves putting 900,000 miles of roads across national parks, \nwilderness areas, wildlife refuges, wild and scenic rivers, whatever.\n  It might interest the Senate to know we have over 80 percent of those \ncategories. Most of the park land of the whole United States is in our \nState. But the lands are exterior, have lines that give us their \nexterior. The parks and other protected areas were never surveyed as \nsuch. They are just lines on a map. The surveys will not be made. It \ncosts too much money to survey those lands. They are reserved \npermanently for national parks. There will be no development that is \nnot authorized by the park service. They do not need any right to build \nroads within parks. They have that right. There are not going to be any \nsurveys.\n  I do say for the Chair, only Congress can create a wilderness area. \nEvery time a wilderness area has come before the Senate we have looked \nat it to see whether or not there are private rights that need \nprotection, and we have had provisions that said valid existing rights \nare preserved.\n  Now, that is all we are trying to say, is in 1976 when Congress \nrepealed R.S. 2477, this was done subject to valid existing rights. I \nhad that chart out here. Three times in that act I insisted that \nCongess say that validated existing rights were preserved, that \neverything\n\n[[Page S4416]]\n\nthe Secretary of Interior did in that law was subject to existing \nrights, and now we have the situation where the Department continues to \nbelieve that it has the right to ignore that law.\n  Mr. President, last year in the Interior Department appropriations \nbill we asked for a section to be put in there which said that nothing \ncan be done to change the rights-of-way which exist that are valid \nexisting rights on Federal lands by rule or regulation, and they cannot \nbe changed except by authorization from Congress. The Department of \nInterior now seeks to change the status of some of these existing \nrights by a new fiat. They call it a policy statement which changes the \nbasis, historical basis that has been developed through a series of \ncourt cases for over 100 years. These precedents have been established \nby law and interpreted by solicitors, and as I said I was one of those \nsolicitors at one time and I know that we have a series of cases that \nhave been decided both by the Interior Department's land section and by \nthe courts which tell States under what conditions they can assert the \nright to use the R.S. 2477 rights-of-way for improvements for public \naccess which we now call public highways.\n\n  If the Congress looks at this map or this other map, it can only come \nto the conclusion that the problem we have is the problem of \ndetermining whether the Federal Government speaks with a forked tongue. \nThe Federal Government when we became a State gave Alaska the right to \n103.5 million acres of Federal land. It was our dowry in order to have \nland that could be developed to sustain our economy. It then in 1971 \npassed the Alaska Native Land Claims Settlement Act which transferred \nto Alaska, or gave the right of transfer to approximately 45 million \nacres of Alaska land to the Native people. Both of those rights were \nheld up until Congress decided the location of the lands it wanted to \nwithdraw, the National Lands Conservation Act of 1980 perfected those \nwithdrawals and enlarged the whole concept. And if anyone will look at \nthe map you will see it is almost impossible to get to the coastline \nfrom the Native lands except up in Nome. Access is denied entirely to \nour lands that were given to us by an act of Congress unless we can \nperfect the access routes which were in place prior to their conveyance \nto Alaska and the Native people, prior to the repeal of Revised Statute \n2477 unless we can prove in effect they are valid existing rights.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that the people who really run the \nNational Parks Conservation Association will do some basic research and \ndeal with facts. Particularly what brought me here was the assertion of \nthe 900,000 miles of section line roads that we were going to build \nacross Federal parks and wilderness area. We do not propose to build \nthem. They would not be valid under any interpretation of Federal laws. \nThe lands are withdrawn for national parks. They cannot be subject to \nrights-of-way under the section line concept until those lands would be \nsurveyed, and even then the survey would take place after the \nreservation, and, with the possible exception of some unknown, ancient \ngovernment survey of the area near a mining claim, there are no rights \nfrom section lines in areas that have already been reserved.\n  So I do believe it is time for us to return to the concept that I \nmentioned in the beginning, and that is the four-way test. As I have \nsaid, since I have been a Senator, I have tried to be guided by this \ntest and I would like to see the Senate as a whole guided by it.\n  There were assertions made right here on this floor about this \nSenator wanting to build roads across national parks on section lines. \nI know that those Senators who made those statements were misinformed \nby such people as the National Parks Conservation Association that \nissued their statement. But above all, I think it is incumbent upon \nMembers of the Senate to look at the facts before they really accuse a \nfellow Senator of something of that magnitude. Building 900,000 miles \nof section line roads through national parks was mentioned right here \non this floor, and it was not true. I plead with the Senate to be \nguided by the truth and be guided by the concept of fairness and \nwhether or not what they say will build good will and friendship among \nMembers of the Senate. This Senator finds it very hard to maintain \nfriendship for people who accuse him of some of the things we were \naccused of last week, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     Western Senators Win First Round in Road Right-of-Way Disputes\n\n                            (By Jim Abrams)\n\n       Washington (AP).--Legislation making it easier to build \n     roads through federal parks and wilderness areas survived a \n     Senate challenge Wednesday and headed toward a possible \n     showdown with the White House.\n       The measure, pushed by Alaska and Utah senators and \n     inserted into a crucial bill to provide billions of dollars \n     for victims of natural disasters, would give the federal \n     government less say in what constitutes a valid right of way \n     under a 130-year-old law.\n       Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., proposed that the road issue be \n     taken out of the disaster relief bill, but lost, 51-49.\n       Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., voted to take the issue out of \n     the bill while Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., was among the 51 \n     that voted for it to remain in the bill.\n       ``It is wrong as a matter of principle to tie controversial \n     issues to flood disaster relief,'' Baucus said. ``We simply \n     should not play politics when people's lives are in the \n     balance.''\n       The Senate also voted, 89-11, to provide $240 million in \n     the emergency relief bill to extend welfare payments to legal \n     immigrants until the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. \n     Under the new welfare law, legal immigrants were to lose \n     their benefits in August.\n       The amendment, offered by Sens. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., \n     and John Chafee, R-R.I, replaced a provision in the bill that \n     set aside $125 million for block grants to the states for \n     immigrants, an idea opposed by the administration.\n       Lawmakers resolved another sticking point in the bill when \n     they agreed to allow the Census Bureau, with congressional \n     oversight, to go ahead with plans for the use of sampling \n     methods in the 2000 census. Republicans from rural states in \n     particular had sought to ban sampling, which could record \n     greater urban and minority populations and lead to district \n     reapportioning.\n       Resolution of that issue left two outstanding disputes \n     efforts by Republicans to prevent future government shutdowns \n     and to weaken the Endangered Species Act. The administration \n     has indicated that President Clinton would veto any bill with \n     those provisions.\n       Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, used his position as chairman \n     of the Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for the \n     disaster relief bill, to promote the right-of-way measure. He \n     accused opponents of using scare tactics in claiming that it \n     would ``result in roads across our national parks and \n     wilderness. That is simply not true,'' he said.\n       ``What is at stake here for those of us in the West is the \n     preservation of what really amounts to the primary \n     transportation system and infrastructure of many rural cities \n     and towns,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.\n       Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit said the measure would \n     render the federal government powerless to stop the \n     conversion of footpaths, four-wheel-drive tracks and other \n     primitive roads on federal lands into paved highways. He has \n     urged the president to veto the disaster relief bill if the \n     road issue is included.\n       Baucus said the provision ``could allow roads to be built \n     through spectacular wilderness in Montana.\n       ``Equally disturbing, this section could prevent Montana \n     roadless areas from being designated as wilderness in the \n     future,'' Baucus said.\n       But Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota \n     said he doubted the Senate would sustain a presidential veto \n     and slow action on the disaster relief bill over the road \n     issue.\n       ``I don't know if we've got enough of a strength of \n     conviction to hold up the bill,'' he said.\n       The bill provides $8.4 billion in new spending, including \n     $5.5 billion for disaster victims and $1.8 billion for U.S. \n     troops in Bosnia and the Mideast.\n       The Senate, in a voice vote, agreed that no money from this \n     bill should support U.S. troop presence in Bosnia after June \n     1998, the date the administration has set for the end of the \n     mission there.\n       Stevens left open the possibility for compromise, saying \n     that when the House and Senate get together to work out \n     differences in their bills he might ask Babbitt for a \n     proposal ``that might set the policy for future realization \n     of these rights of way throughout the West.''\n       The controversy involves and 1866 law that was repealed in \n     1976 but then resurrected in part during President Reagan's \n     administration as it began aggressively processing thousands \n     of right-of-way claims it considered still valid.\n       The Clinton administration has recognized the validity of \n     claims, but has fought with state officials, particularly \n     from Alaska and Utah, about who has final say on their \n     validity.\n       Babbitt announced a new policy in January that requires \n     states to examine more closely whether a right of way \n     actually once was a significant corridor, which make it a \n     valid site for road building.\n       Stevens' measure would override Babbitt's new directive and \n     again swing the pendulum to the states.\n\n[[Page S4417]]\n\n     \n                                                                    ____\n Rider to Flood-Relief Bill Enrages Environmentalists--Alaska Senator \n                 Seeks To Pave Way for U.S. Park Roads\n\n                          (By H. Josef Hebert)\n\n       As his Senate Appropriations Committee grappled with how to \n     help victims of floods, chairman Ted Stevens saw an \n     opportunity he couldn't pass up.\n       Alaska's senior senator tacked onto the must-pass emergency \n     bill a pet piece of legislation to make it easier to build \n     roads through federal parks, refuges and wilderness areas.\n       Environmental activists were outraged, and Interior \n     Secretary Bruce Babbitt is urging a presidential veto if the \n     provision added last week stays in the bill. It goes before \n     the full Senate today.\n       The measure, also pushed by fellow Republican Sen. Bob \n     Bennett of Utah, would give the government less say in what \n     constitutes a valid right-of-way for roads built under a 130-\n     year-old law.\n       ``Such a requirement could effectively render the federal \n     government powerless to prevent the conversion of foot paths, \n     dog-sled trails, jeep tracks, ice roads and other primitive \n     transportation routes into paved highways,'' Babbitt \n     complained in a letter to Stevens.\n       Bennett and Stevens have accused Babbitt of overstepping \n     his authority by putting too many restrictions on such right-\n     of-way claims and usurping the states' authority. They \n     contend state law should determine validity of claims.\n       Road construction in federally protected parks, refuges and \n     wilderness areas has been a growing worry among \n     conservationists, especially in the West. Nowhere has it been \n     an issue more than in Alaska and Utah, where hundreds of \n     claims are pending for rights-of-way over federally protected \n     land.\n       The controversy involves a law enacted in 1866, repealed by \n     Congress 110 years later, then resurrected in part during \n     President Reagan's administration as it began aggressively \n     processing thousands of right-of-way claims it considered \n     still valid under the defunct Civil War-era statute.\n       No one disputes valid claims exist, but the Clinton \n     administration has waged a running battle with some state \n     officials-particularly those of Alaska and Utah-over who \n     should have the final say on their validity.\n       Babbitt announced a new policy in January that requires \n     states to examine more closely whether a right-of-way \n     actually once was a significant corridor, which would make it \n     a valid site for road building.\n       The measure Stevens inserted into the $5.5 billion \n     emergency relief legislation for victims of floods and other \n     disasters would override Babbitt's new directive and again \n     swing the pendulum to the states.\n       Stevens defended the measure. In 1976, he argued, Congress \n     ``absolutely stated, without any question,'' that prior \n     claims must be accepted.\n       ``The provision is aimed at preserving historic rights-of-\n     way established at least 20 years ago and creates no new \n     rights-of-way across federal land,'' Stevens insisted.\n       Many environmentalists see it differently.\n       ``It grants rights-of-way across millions of acres of \n     federal land to virtually any person who asserts a claim,'' \n     asserted William Watson of the National Parks and \n     Conservation Association, a private watchdog group. ``It \n     threatens to carve up our national parks.''\n       Most claims under the 1866 law are in Alaska and Utah \n     because those states have been the most lenient in \n     considering what constituted a historic pathway. \n     Conservationists say the Stevens legislation may bring old \n     claims boiling to the surface in other states. Rumblings \n     already have been heard in Oklahoma, Nebraska, New Mexico and \n     the Dakotas, said Phil Vorhees of the park association.\n       Adam Kolton of the Alaska Wilderness League said hundreds \n     of rights-of-way claims are pending in Alaska, including some \n     through the Denali National Park and seven in the coastal \n     plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n       ``Sen. Stevens wants to make Swiss cheese of the Arctic \n     refuge and other wilderness areas by building roads through \n     them,'' Kolton complained.\n       In Utah, where much of the land also is federal, an \n     estimated 5,000 rights-of-way claims are pending. Many are in \n     federal parks and refuges, as well as in the recently \n     declared 1.7 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National \n     Monument.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              Westerners Eke Out Senate Win on Rural Roads\n\n       Salt Lake City.--A White House move opponents claimed could \n     block access to rural byways in Utah and Alaska has been \n     narrowly defeated by the U.S. Senate.\n       Western senators led the revolt, even though Interior \n     Secretary Bruce Babbitt said he would recommend that \n     President Clinton veto the entire emergency flood and \n     disaster relief bill to which the byways measure is attached.\n       ``This is not an issue where the senators from the Western \n     states are trying to do something improper,'' said Sen. Bob \n     Bennett, R-Utah. ``The real issue is that there are a number \n     of roads in rural Utah that the federal government wants \n     closed.''\n       The vote Wednesday was 51-49.\n       At issue are rights-of-way created under an 1866 law that \n     allowed counties to put roads on unreserved federal lands. It \n     was repealed in 1976, but existing byways were allowed to \n     continue. But no inventory of them was made.\n       Congress and the administration have fought for years over \n     proposals by Babbitt to force counties now to prove the \n     byways existed before 1976 and were used for vehicular \n     traffic, not just livestock or horses.\n       Congress had blocked that move, but in January Babbitt \n     issued administrative rules outlining how until a final \n     compromise is reached counties could gain emergency, \n     permanent recognition on some claims. The status would be \n     granted only for those byways where vehicular traffic and \n     upgrades for them occurred.\n       Senators from Utah and Alaska, where most of the byways \n     claims are pending, charged the White House was trying to \n     take the first step toward federalizing local roads.\n       ``What is at stake here for those of us in the West is the \n     preservation of what amounts to the primary transportation \n     system and infrastructure of many cities and towns,'' said \n     Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.\n       ``In many cases, these roads are the only routes to farms \n     and ranches; they provide necessary access for school buses, \n     emergency vehicles and mail delivery.''\n       Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., countered that Westerners were \n     really pushing the issue to block wilderness designations by \n     claiming roads in the areas.\n       He also charged Westerners want to put roads in sensitive \n     areas to foster development.\n       ``Can you imagine anything so insane as allowing states to \n     build roads across public lands, no matter where they may \n     be?'' he said. ``You cut the weeds, it becomes a `highway.' \n     You move a few rocks, it becomes a `highway' ''\n       Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-\n     Alaska, reacted angrily to those claims. He pounded his desk \n     so hard he tipped over this water glass into his documents. \n     He also trembled as he declared the byways ``are our \n     lifeblood.''\n       Bennett recalled that when Garfield County bulldozed in \n     Capitol Reef National Park to widen the Burr Trail by four \n     feet on a blind curve but still within its right of way the \n     federal government sued.\n       ``It has little or nothing to do with the county \n     maintaining this kind of right of way. What it had to do with \n     is who's going to make the decision and the federal \n     government is determined it will make the decision.'' Bennett \n     said.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have spoken on the floor many times about \nthe judicial vacancies in our Federal courts. It concerns me. In fact, \nI believe other than the subject of antipersonnel landmines, I have \nprobably spoken on this subject more than any other. I am concerned \nthat some in the Republican Party are engaging in a court-bashing \nsituation that does not reflect the proud heritage of either the \nRepublican Party or the Democratic Party.\n\n  I have spoken about the crisis that has been created by the almost \n100 vacancies that are being perpetuated in the Federal courts around \nthe country. We have recently seen a constitutional amendment proposed \nto remove the life tenure that has been the bedrock of judicial \nindependence from the political branches since the ratification of our \nConstitution. It is just one of, I think, over 100 constitutional \namendments proposed this year alone. It ignores the fact that our \nindependent judiciary is the envy of the rest of the world. We have \nheard calls for impeachment when a judge rendered a decision with which \na Republican House Member disagreed. I have read the Constitution. It \nspeaks of very specific grounds for impeachment. Among those grounds is \nnot that a Republican House Member disagrees with a judge. We would \nprobably have a very difficult time if every judge could be impeached \nbecause any Member of the House or Senate disagreed with him.\n  We have heard demands that the Congress act as a supercourt of \nappeals and legislatively review and approve or disapprove cases on a \ncase-by-case basis. That is for the same Congress that has not yet even \ntaken up a budget bill, even though the law requires us to do it by \nApril 15.\n  We are seeing exemplary nominees unnecessarily delayed for months, \nand vacancies persist into judicial emergencies. We are seeing \noutstanding nominees nitpicked, probed, and delayed to the point where \none wonders why any man or woman would subject themselves to such a \nprocess or even allow themselves to be nominated for a Federal \njudgeship.\n  Instead of reforming the confirmation process to make it more \nrespectful of the privacy of the nominee, something that we all claim \nwe want to do, the Republican majority in the Senate is moving \ndecidedly in the other direction. They are approaching the imposition \nof political litmus tests, which some have openly advocated under the \nguise of opposing judicial activism, even though some of these same \nMembers were the ones who said that nobody should impose a litmus test \non judges.\n  Even conservatives like Bruce Fein, in his recent opinion column in \nthe New York Times, reject this effort. Actually, so do the American \npeople. We have not had a time when any President or any Senate should \nbe asked to impose litmus tests on an independent judiciary.\n  I recommend my colleagues read the excellent commentary by Nat \nHentoff on this new political correctness that appeared in the April \n19, 1997, edition of the Washington Post. I have spoken in broad \ngeneralities, although each are backed up by dozens of cases. But let \nme be specific on one. The nomination of Margaret Morrow to be a \nFederal judge for the Central District of California is an example of \nthe very shabby treatment accorded judicial nominees. The vacancy in \nthis Federal court has existed for more than 15 months, and the people \nin central California--Republican, Democrat, Independent--are being \ndenied a most needed, and in this case a most qualified, judge.\n  Ms. Morrow's nomination is stuck in the Senate Judiciary Committee \nagain. I am appalled by the treatment that Margaret Morrow has received \nbefore the Judiciary Committee. Ms. Morrow first came before the \nJudiciary Committee for a hearing and she was favorably and unanimously \nreported by the committee in June of 1996, almost exactly a year ago--a \nyear ago less a couple of weeks. Then her nomination just got caught in \nlast year's confirmation shutdown and she was not allowed to go \nthrough. So she has to start the process all over again this year.\n  Let me tell you about Margaret Morrow. She is an exceptionally well \nqualified nominee.\n  She was the first woman president of the California Bar Association, \nno small feat for anybody, man or woman. She is the past president of \nthe Los Angeles County Bar Association. She is currently a partner at \nthe well-known firm of Arnold & Porter, and she has practiced law for \n23 years. She is supported by the Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, \nwho, incidentally, is Republican, and Robert Bonner the former head of \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration under a Republican administration. \nRepresentative James Rogan from the House joined us during her second \nconfirmation hearing and, of course, she is backed and endorsed by both \nSenators from California.\n  Margaret Morrow has devoted her career to the law, to getting women \ninvolved in the practice and to making lawyers more responsive and \nresponsible as a profession. The Senate ought to be ashamed for holding \nup this outstanding nominee, and I question whether the Senate would \ngive this kind of treatment to a man. It sure as heck has been doing it \nto a woman.\n  Despite her qualifications, she is being made an example, I am not \nquite sure of what, but this woman who has dared to come forward to be \na Federal judge is being made an example before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  At her second hearing before the committee on March 18, even though \nshe already has gone through a committee hearing and even though the \ncommittee last year unanimously voted to confirm her with every single \nRepublican and every single Democrat supporting her, even though she \nhad gone through it once before, she was made to sit and wait until all \nthe other nominees were questioned, as though she were being punished. \n``We have these men who want to be heard, and even though you had to do \nthis before, you, woman nominee, sit in the back and the corner.'' She \nwas then subjected to round after round of repetitive questioning.\n  Then came a series of written questions from several members, and \nthey were all Republican members of the committee. Then came the ``when \ndid you start beating your husband'' type questions to Ms. Morrow, \nbased on her previous questions. I objected when Ms. Morrow was asked \nabout her private views on all voter initiatives on the ballots in \nCalifornia for the last decade. Basically, she was being asked how did \nshe vote in a secret ballot in the privacy of a voting booth on 160 \ninitiatives on the ballot in California over the last 10 years.\n\n[[Page S4419]]\n\n  I defy any Member of the Senate, if they were given a list of 160 \nitems in their local elections, State elections, that have been on the \nballot over the last 10 years, to be able to honestly say how they \nvoted on every single one of those. But even before they got to the \nquestion of could they say how they voted, I would stand up and say, \n``What has the Senate stooped to when we ask people how they voted in a \nsecret ballot?\"\n  Mr. President, we fought--successfully fought--a Revolutionary War, \namong other reasons, to maintain the sanctity of the ballot box. We \nfought a Civil War, among other reasons, to maintain the sanctity of \nthe ballot box. We stood up to fascism, Nazism, World Wars because we \nwere protecting our democracy and way of life. Some of the most \nremarkable and respected Republicans and Democrats of this country's \nhistory, and some of the most responsible and respected Republicans and \nDemocrats in my lifetime, and some of the most responsible and \nrespected Republicans and Democrats of my 22 years in the Senate have \nstood and fought to maintain the privacy of the ballot box. I, Mr. \nPresident, am not going to be a Senator on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee that allows that sanctity to be destroyed.\n  When I challenged the question, it was revised so as to demand only \nher private views on 10 voter initiatives on issues ranging from \ncarjacking to drive-by shootings to medical use of marijuana and the \nretention election of Rose Bird as chief justice of the California \nSupreme Court.\n  Ms. Morrow previously stated she did not take public positions on \nthese voter initiatives, so asking for her private views necessarily \nasked how she voted on them. We are, thus, quizzing nominees on how \nthey voted in their home State ballot initiatives. Why we need this \ninformation, even if we were allowed to follow someone into the ballot \nbox and see how they voted--something none of us would allow anybody to \ndo to us--even if we are allowed, to say while we would not do it to \nany of us, we would do it to this woman.\n  Why do we need this information to determine if she is qualified? In \nfact, she explained to the committee that she is not anti-initiative, \nand in response to written questions, she discussed an article she \nwrote in 1988 and explained:\n\n       My goal was not to eliminate the need for initiatives. \n     Rather, I was proposing ways to strengthen the initiative \n     process by making it more efficient and less costly, so it \n     could better serve the purpose for which it was originally \n     intended. At the same time, I was suggesting measures to \n     increase the Legislature's willingness to address issues of \n     concern to ordinary citizens regardless of the views of \n     special interests or campaign contributors. I don't believe \n     these goals are inconsistent.\n       The initiative process was a reform championed by \n     California Governor Hiram Johnson in 1911 to ensure that \n     the electorate had a means of circumventing the \n     Legislature when it could or would not pass legislation \n     desired by the people because of the influence of special \n     interests. As envisioned by Governor Johnson and others, \n     the initiative was designed to complement the legislative \n     process, not to substitute for it. This is my \n     understanding of the role of the initiative process, and \n     this is what I had in mind when I wrote the 1988 article. \n     The reasons that led Governor Johnson to create the \n     initiative process in 1911 are still valid today, and it \n     remains an important aspect of our democratic form of \n     Government.\n\n  I ask, Mr. President, does that response sound like somebody who is \nantidemocratic? Yet, she has been forced to answer questions about how \nshe views the initiative process in written questions and, again, in \nrevised follow-up written questions over the period of the last month.\n  Again, I remind everybody, this is a woman who was voted out \nunanimously last year by the committee. No objective evaluation of the \nrecord can yield the conclusion that she is anti-initiative. No fair \nreading of her 1988 article even suggests that. I might add, \nparenthetically, and what should be the only really important question, \nthere is nothing in her record that suggests she would not follow the \nprecedents of the court of appeals for her district or the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. There is nothing to suggest that she does not believe in stare \ndecisis or that she would not follow it.\n  Recently, I received a letter from a distinguished California \nattorney, and a lifelong Republican, who wrote to protest the unfair \ntreatment being accorded Margaret Morrow. He wrote that he was \n``ashamed of [his] party affiliation when [he sees] the people's \nelected representatives who are Republicans engaging in or condoning \nthe kind of childish, punitive conduct to which Ms. Morrow is being \nsubjected.'' He asks us to stop permitting the harassment of this \nnominee. I join with this distinguished Republican, and I ask the same \nthing: Stop harassing this nominee. I don't care if the harassment is \nbecause she is a woman, I don't care if the harassment is based on some \nphilosophical difference, the fact of the matter is, she is one of the \nmost qualified people I have seen before the committee in 22 years, \nRepublican or Democrat, and she ought to be voted on and confirmed with \npride--with pride--by the U.S. Senate.\n  We have heard nothing but praise for Ms. Morrow from those who know \nher and those who worked with her and litigated against her. In fact, \nthe legal community in and around Los Angeles is, frankly, shocked that \nMargaret Morrow is being put through this ordeal and has yet to be \nconfirmed. The Los Angeles Times has already published one editorial \nagainst the manner in which the Senate is proceeding with the Morrow \nnomination. I ask, to what undefined standard is she being held? What \nis this new standard --it is kind of hidden--which has never shown up \nbefore? It has not shown up for any male nominee that I know of.\n  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that a letter signed by a \nnumber of distinguished women in support of her nomination be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Women Lawyers Association of Los Angeles,\n                                    Los Angeles, CA, May 13, 1997.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: We write to you to protest the \n     treatment which one of President Clinton's nominees for the \n     Federal District Court is receiving. We refer to Margaret \n     Morrow, who has been nominated for the United States District \n     court in the Central District of California. As of today we \n     have been waiting a full year for her confirmation.\n       Margaret Morrow has qualifications which set her apart as \n     one uniquely qualified to be a federal judge. She is a magna \n     cum laude graduate of Bryn Mawr College and a cum laude \n     graduate of Harvard Law School. She has a 23-year career in \n     private practice with an emphasis in complicated commercial \n     and corporate litigation with extensive experience in federal \n     courts. She has received a long list of awards and \n     recognition as a top lawyer in her field, her community and \n     her state.\n       Margaret Morrow is widely respected by attorneys, judges \n     and community leaders of both parties. Many have written to \n     you. Because of her outstanding qualifications and broad \n     support, it is difficult to understand why she has not moved \n     expeditiously through the confirmation process.\n       Margaret Morrow is a leader and role model among women \n     lawyers in California. She was the second woman President of \n     25,000 member Los Angeles Bar Association and the first woman \n     President of the largest mandatory bar association in the \n     country, the 150,000 member State Bar of California.\n       Margaret Morrow is exactly the kind of person who should be \n     appointed to such a position and held up as an example to \n     young women across our country. Instead she is subjected to \n     multiple hearings and seemingly endless rounds of questions, \n     apparently without good reason.\n       We urge you to send a message that exceptionally well \n     qualified women who are community leaders should apply to the \n     U.S. Senate for federal judgeships. We urge you to move her \n     nomination to the Senate floor and to act quickly to confirm \n     it.\n     Nancy Hoffmeier Zamora, Esq.,\n       President, Women Lawyers Association of Los Angeles.\n     Judith Lichtman, Esq.,\n       President, Women's Legal Defense Fund.\n     Karen Nobumoto, Esq.,\n       President, John M. Langston Bar Association.\n     Steven Nissen, Esq.,\n       Executive Director & General Counsel, Public Counsel *.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     * Title and organization for identification purposes only.\n\n     Sheldon H. Sloan, Esq.,\n       President, Los Angeles County Bar Association.\n     Abby Leibman, Esq.,\n       Executive Director, California Women's Law Center *.\n\n[[Page S4420]]\n\n     Juliet Gee, Esq.,\n       President, National Conference of Women's Bar Associations.\n  (Mr. ROBERTS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, that is from the Women's Lawyer Association \nof Los Angeles.\n  Last week, at a Judiciary Committee executive business session, I \nasked her name be added to the agenda and that the committee report her \nnomination to the Senate for confirmation. All questions have been \nanswered. The Republican Senator who propounded the questions on \ninitiatives said he would not filibuster her nomination and agreed not \nto hold her up any longer. I thank him publicly and appreciate his \nforthrightness.\n  But even though we looked around that room and said, ``Does anybody \nhave any objection to her,'' and I had gotten absolute confirmation \nfrom every single Democratic Senator that they were ready to vote \npositively for her and would vote for her on the floor immediately, her \nnomination was not called up. My requests that she be called up for a \nvote before the committee was rejected, and she remains in limbo almost \n2 months after her second confirmation hearing and one full year after \nshe was first nominated.\n  There is now what amounts to a secret hold on this nomination in the \nJudiciary Committee. Some Senator is holding her up. Some Senator \ndoesn't have the courage to come on the floor of the U.S. Senate and \nsay why this woman is objectionable to him. Some Senator will hold her \nup secretly because he doesn't want to vote on her publicly, even \nthough I guarantee you, if we had a rollcall vote on her, it would be \noverwhelmingly positive. We should proceed with the nomination of \nMargaret Morrow without further delay.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will my friend yield for about 2 minutes?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course. I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am appreciative of the Senator taking to the floor \ntoday to discuss this entire issue. We all learned growing up that \njustice delayed is justice denied.\n  We have these openings. Look, I was told very clearly by the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, ``Senator, you have to come in with \nnominations that will pass by Republicans and Democrats. You need to \nbring forward nominees who are supported by Republicans and \nDemocrats.''\n  Mr. President, I have done just that. I think Senator Leahy has \noutlined this magnificently--I have never seen a nominee with such \nbipartisan support as this woman. This is what is so extraordinary \nabout the kind of treatment she is receiving: a secret hold that has \nbeen placed on her.\n  Mr. President, this is not the way to run the U.S. Senate. Let's \nallow this woman's name to be placed on the floor and then those who \nhave any objection can express their objections and vote no. But I am \nso confident that the vast majority of our colleagues will vote for \nMargaret Morrow.\n  I say that not only because of her extraordinary bipartisan support, \nbut because of her incredible qualifications. I say to my friend from \nVermont how much I appreciate his leadership on this. Sometimes we \nforget these nominees have private lives. This is a woman who is a law \npartner in a law firm making preparations for a new career. She is a \n45-year-old wife and mother. She has a very loving family. They are \nvery proud of her. They are completely mystified about these questions \nthat keep coming. I have talked to several members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, both Democrats and Republicans, and when I speak with them, \nI say to you, Mr. President, one on one, I am very confident that \nMargaret Morrow will get a vote and a fair vote.\n  I want to quote from one letter that is so important.\n  H. Walter Croskey, associate justice in the Court of Appeals for the \nState of California, Second Appellate District, describes himself, Mr. \nPresident, as a conservative Republican. He has written to Senator \nHatch, and he wrote to Senator Hatch about an article he read that \nsuggested that ``concerns have been raised in the [Judiciary] Committee \nabout judicial activism and noted that there were questions as to \nwhether Margaret would be a judge who would follow the Constitution and \nthe laws as they are written.'' He says, ``Such concerns are not shared \nby anyone who knows Margaret.'' And he goes on to say, ``Her well known \nand often expressed reverence for our system of government and justice \nand her great intellectual integrity provides full assurance that she \nwould be the kind of judge who would follow and apply the laws as \nwritten * * *.''\n  He goes on.\n  Mr. President, we have Republican after Republican from my State. \nThis particular judge was appointed by George Deukmejian, Republican \nGovernor of the State of California.\n  Mayor Richard Riordan, Sheriff Sherman Block, a Republican-elected \nsheriff, supports her nomination.\n  So it is so difficult, frankly, for this Senator to understand why we \nwould play with the life of a woman like this and not give her her fair \nchance.\n  I understand that women's organizations have written to Senator Leahy \nand Senator Hatch. They have been very patient. But when you see a \npanel of people, as Senator Leahy has described, three men and one \nwoman, and the three men get reported out of the committee--and I \nventure to say, I know they are all extremely qualified--I would put \nMargaret's qualifications right up against any of those.\n  So I am very pleased that my colleague, the ranking member on the \nJudiciary Committee, has raised this issue. I am hopeful, I say to my \nfriend and the Presiding Officer today, that because Senator Grassley \nhas lifted his objection to bringing the nomination to the floor and \nothers on the committee have done the same, that they will prevail upon \nthat secret hold, they will find who that particular Senator is who has \nput a hold here. If we start putting holds on each other's nominations \nand on each other's bills and on each other's amendments, I say to my \nfriend, we are only going to deteriorate in this U.S. Senate. The \npeople expect more.\n  To reiterate Mr. President, I come to the floor today to urge that \nMargaret M. Morrow be voted out of the Judiciary Committee and \nconfirmed to sit on the U.S. District Court for the Central District of \nCalifornia.\n  Margaret Morrow is an outstanding candidate for the Federal bench, \nwho enjoys broad bipartisan support. She has over a dozen support \nletters from prominent, widely respected Republicans, including judges, \nelected officials, and others. It has been my honor to recommend such a \nfine candidate to the President. Her name was submitted to me by my \njudicial advisory committee for the Central District of California. My \ncommittee enthusiastically found her to be a superior judicial \ncandidate.\n  However, despite her strong bipartisan support and strong \ncredentials, her nomination remains indefinitely stalled in committee. \nShe has had two hearings, and has had several rounds of questions with \nno end in sight. No Member has come forward to explain why she should \nnot be confirmed.\n\n\n                       Margaret Morrow's History\n\n  Margaret Morrow was first nominated by the administration on May 9, \n1996. She received the first of her nomination hearings before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee on June 25, 1996, and was reported out of \ncommittee just 2 days later without any opposition from the committee.\n  For several months, Margaret Morrow's nomination sat on the Executive \nCalendar waiting to be moved, and finally died on the floor of the \nSenate when we adjourned at the end of the session.\n  Margaret was then renominated on January 7 of this year because of \nher impeccable credentials. Her nomination languished for over 2 more \nmonths until further action on March 18, when she had yet another \nhearing.\n  Twice, now, the Judiciary Committee has reviewed stacks of \ninformation she provided to the committee, a full FBI background \ninvestigation, and her testimony before the committee. Yet, Margaret \nstill sits in committee, facing repeated rounds of questions with no \nend in sight.\n\n\n                           Judicial Vacancies\n\n  Margaret Morrow's confirmation should not be held hostage for \npolitical reasons, Mr. President. According to the U.S. Constitution, \nthe President nominates, and the Senate shall provide advice and \nconsent. It is not the role of the Senate to obstruct the process and \nprevent numbers of highly\n\n[[Page S4421]]\n\nqualified nominees from even being given the opportunity for a vote on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Today, we have 26 nominations from the President to consider. Every \none of these nominations should be voted out of committee and placed on \nthe calendar for consideration on the Senate floor.\n\n\n                   Margaret Morrow's Life is on Hold\n\n  The vacancy Ms. Morrow would be filling has been vacant since January \n24, 1996. In 2 short months, this vacancy will become a judicial \nemergency. That will make three judicial emergencies in the ninth \ncircuit courts, and four judicial emergencies in the California \ndistrict courts. Two of those judicial emergencies will be in the \nCentral District of California. I don't think I need to remind this \nbody that the Central District of California in Los Angeles is one of \nthe busiest courts in the Nation.\n  To provide some historical context, in 1992, every one of the 66 \nnominees approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee were approved by \nthe full Senate. Every single person nominated, Mr. President, was \nunder a Republican administration and a Democratic-controlled Senate. \nIncluded in those 66 judges were 11 circuit court nominees. In 1992, \nthe Democratic Senate confirmed the highest number of judges of any \nyear of President Bush's term. And the confirmations did not slow as \nthe election approached. During the 4-month period between June and \nSeptember, the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported 32 \nnominees, including 7 appeals court nominees.\n  Former Majority Leader Bob Dole spoke of this process himself. In \nJune of last year, he said ``We should not be holding people up. If we \nneed a vote, vote them down or vote them up * * * because [the \nnominees] probably have plans to make and there are families \ninvolved.'' Even then-Majority Leader Dole recognized the necessity to \nprovide resolution for nominees out of fairness to these individuals \nand their families.\n\n  Before I speak about Ms. Morrow's credentials or historical precedent \nfor judicial confirmations, I wanted to make the point that there is \nalso a personal side to the judicial confirmation process. For nominees \nwho are awaiting confirmation, their personal and professional lives \nhang in the balance.\n  Margaret Morrow--a 45-year-old mother and law partner--has put her \nlife and her professional practice on hold while she waits for the \nSenate to approve her nomination. The Senate's delay has affected her \nability to assume certain responsibilities at her law practice. Her \nwhole family--particularly her husband and young son--have waited \npatiently for her confirmation to proceed. Many of us here in the \nSenate have no idea what kind of strain and stress awaiting \nconfirmation means for these nominees. We owe to her prompt Senate \nconsideration.\n  Mr. President, I am unaware of any substantive reason why Ms. \nMorrow's nomination has not been before the full Senate long before \ntoday. If another Member of this body has a reason for opposing her \nconfirmation, I want the opportunity to discuss those objections, as \ndoes Ms. Morrow, and to move on to Senate consideration.\n\n\n                              Three Points\n\n  There are three aspects of Margaret Morrow's qualifications, in \nparticular, I want to emphasize:\n  First, Ms. Morrow's long history and background in the legal \nprofession. Her credentials are impeccable.\n  Second, Ms. Morrow has the confidence of a broad spectrum of \nsupporters.\n  Third, Ms. Morrow's qualifications and the broad support she enjoys \nwould make her an exceptionally distinguished addition to the Federal \nbench.\n\n\n ms. morrow's long history and background in the legal profession, her \n                       credentials are impeccable\n\n  Ms. Morrow graduated magna cum laude from Bryn Mawr College, and \nreceived her law degree from Harvard University, graduating cum laude. \nMs. Morrow has enjoyed 23 years in private practice in commercial and \ncivil litigation, and is now a partner at the prestigious law firm of \nArnold & Porter. She is married to Judge Paul Boland of the Los Angeles \nSuperior Court and they have a son, Patrick Morrow Boland.\n  From 1988 to 1989, Ms. Morrow served as president of the 25,000-\nmember Los Angeles County Bar Association, the second largest voluntary \nbar association in the country, and created an innovative program in \nCalifornia called Pro Bono Council which calls on members of the \nassociation to do pro bono work for the poor. From 1993, she served a \n1-year term as president of the largest mandatory bar association in \nthe country, the 150,000-member State Bar of California. Ms. Morrow was \nthe first woman to ever hold this office in that organization.\n  Ms. Morrow has been recognized several times during her tenure in the \nlegal profession. A few of these include a listing in 1994 as one of \nthe top twenty lawyers in Los Angeles by California Law Business, a \nweekly publication of the Los Angeles Daily Journal. In 1995 and again \nin 1996, Ms. Morrow was included in the Los Angeles Business Journal's \n``Law Who's Who,'' a list of 100 outstanding Los Angeles business \nlawyers.\n  Just this February, Ms. Morrow received the Shattuck-Price Award, the \nhighest honor given by the Los Angeles County Bar Association for \nindividuals with outstanding dedication to the high principles of the \nlegal profession, the administration of justice and the progress of the \ncounty bar. Others who have received such distinction include Warren \nChristopher and Shirley Hufstedler, former U.S. circuit court judge and \nU.S. Secretary of Education.\n\n\n    Ms. Morrow has the confidence of a broad spectrum of supporters\n\n  I'm not the only one who believes Ms. Morrow has an excellent legal \nmind and is a credit to the legal profession. Ms. Morrow enjoys the \nbroad support of accomplished persons. Many of California's prominent \nand conservative Republican lawmakers and elected officials support her \nconfirmation:\n\n  H. Walter Croskey, associate justice in the Court of Appeals for the \nState of California, Second Appellate District, and self-described \nconservative Republican writes to Senator Hatch about an article he \nread that:\n\n       . . . suggested that concerns have been raised in the \n     [Judiciary] Committee about judicial activism and noted that \n     there were questions as to whether Margaret would be a judge \n     who would follow the Constitution and the laws as they are \n     written. Such concerns are not shared by anyone who knows \n     Margaret. Her well known and often expressed reverence for \n     our system of government and justice and her great \n     intellectual integrity provides full assurance that she would \n     be the kind of judge who would follow and apply the laws as \n     written with her only agenda to make that system work better \n     and more efficiently. . . . The reservations expressed about \n     her are simply without foundation and should not deter the \n     Judiciary Committee from taking prompt and favorable action \n     on what we here in California regard as a truly inspired \n     choice.\n\n  The district attorney of Orange County, Mike Capizzi, writes to \nSenator Lott:\n\n       I have absolutely no hesitation in commending her \n     nomination to you as being among the very best ever likely to \n     come before you. * * * Of particular interest to crime \n     victims, law enforcement and public prosecutors are her \n     initiatives and achievement in the fields of juvenile justice \n     and domestic violence, where her efforts have helped focus \n     national attention.\n\n  He ends his letter by stating:\n\n       The record of scholarship, citizenship, and dedication to \n     improving the legal system that Margaret will bring with her \n     to the federal bench reveals great promise for a truly \n     exceptional jurist of whom we will all be proud. I sincerely, \n     wholeheartedly and enthusiastically entreat you to confirm \n     Margaret's nomination for appointment to the district court, \n     without delay. We need her.\n\n  Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan writes in strong support of Ms. \nMorrow's nomination. He adds that Morrow, ``would be an excellent \naddition to the Federal bench. She is dedicated to following the law, \nand applying it in a rational and objective fashion.''\n  Representative James Rogan, former Republican assembly leader in the \nCalifornia Legislature, now Member of Congress, who gave a supporting \nintroduction for Margaret Morrow at her second hearing, wrote to \nSenator Trent Lott urging his support of Ms. Morrow's nomination \nbecause he believes she would be ``conscientious in applying the law.''\n  Republican Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block also supports Ms. \nMorrow's nomination, stating she is an extremely hard worker with \nimpeccable character and integrity.\n  Republican Robert Bonner, appointed by President Reagan as U.S. \nattorney for the Central District, later appointed to the U.S. District \nCourt in\n\n[[Page S4422]]\n\nthe Central District, and former head of the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration under President Bush has also lent his support, stating \nshe is a ``brilliant person with a first-rate legal mind * * * \nnominated based upon merit, not political affiliation.''\n  Lod Cook, chairman emeritus of ARCO, and a prominent Republican in \nthe State of California wrote of Ms. Morrow:\n\n       I am convinced she is the type of person who would serve us \n     well on the federal bench. I believe she will bring no \n     personal or political agenda to her work as a judicial \n     officer. Rather, her commitment will be to ensuring fairness \n     and openness in the judicial process and to deciding cases on \n     the facts and the law as they present themselves.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these and additional \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              State of California,\n\n\n                                              Court of Appeal,\n\n                                  Los Angeles, CA, April 17, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Re Nomination of Margaret Mary Morrow.\n\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am pleased to write in support of the \n     nomination of Margaret Morrow to the United States District \n     Court for the Central District of California. I have known \n     Margaret for over 15 years, both professionally and socially. \n     During that period, I have worked with her on many local and \n     state bar activities and committees; I have had repeated \n     opportunities to discuss legal issues with her; and she has \n     appeared before me in both the trial and appellate courts on \n     a number of occasions. Finally, I am very familiar with her \n     reputation in the legal community, both in Southern \n     California and statewide. Based on all of that, I believe \n     that she is the most outstanding candidate for appointment to \n     the federal trial court who has been put forward in my \n     memory.\n       Yesterday, I read an article in our local legal newspaper \n     about Margaret's second hearing before the Judiciary \n     Committee on March 18, 1997. That article suggested that \n     concerns have been raised in the Committee about judicial \n     activism and noted that there were questions as to whether \n     Margaret would be a judge who would follow the Constitution \n     and the laws as they are written. Such concerns are not \n     shared by anyone who knows Margaret. Her well known and often \n     expressed reverence for our system of government and justice \n     and her great intellectual integrity provides full assurance \n     that she would be the kind of judge who would follow and \n     apply the laws as written with her only agenda to make that \n     system work better and more efficiently. She will be a judge \n     of whom all Americans, Republican or Democrat, can be very \n     proud.\n       Every now and then we have the opportunity to bring into \n     government service a truly outstanding person, a person whose \n     knowledge, intelligence, integrity and industry are such as \n     to command universal respect and admiration. We have that \n     opportunity with Margaret's nomination. As the second woman \n     to head the Los Angeles County Bar Association, (the second \n     largest voluntary bar association, after the ABA, in the \n     nation), the first woman to be elected president of the \n     California State Bar Association, an attorney who has won \n     every award and accolade which can be bestowed by the \n     California legal community and a practicing lawyer with \n     superlative skills and reputation, she can truly be \n     characterized as an exceptional choice for appointment to the \n     District Court. Indeed, as I mentioned, I can recall none \n     better in my professional experience. The reservations \n     expressed about her are simply without foundation and should \n     not deter the Judiciary Committee from taking prompt and \n     favorable action on what we here in California regard as a \n     truly inspired choice.\n       As a lifelong conservative Republican, I would be very \n     disappointed to see members of the Committee, whose views I \n     share and admire on so many issues, fail to embrace this \n     exceptionally well qualified nominee. Margaret's nomination \n     should be promptly approved and sent to the Senate floor with \n     a favorable recommendation.\n       My best to you and your staff. Keep up the good work.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                H. Walter Croskey.\n\n       P.S. As a matter of information and convenience, I am \n     enclosing a copy of my resume. My appointment to California's \n     general trial court and subsequent elevation to the Court of \n     Appeal were made by Republican Governor George Deukmejian.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              Office of the District Attorney,\n\n                               Orange County, CA, August 15, 1996.\n     Hon. Trent Lott\n     Office of the Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: I am writing to urge you not to lose the \n     opportunity to add someone of Margaret Morrow's stature to \n     the district court bench in Los Angeles.\n       As the district attorney of one of the nation's most \n     populous counties, I know how important it is that the very \n     best nominees possible be confirmed for judicial office. And \n     knowing Margaret as I do, both on the basis of our \n     professional relationship and association, and by virtue of \n     her outstanding reputation within California's legal \n     community, I have absolutely no hesitation in commending her \n     nomination to you as being among the very best ever likely to \n     come before you.\n       Margaret's impressive credentials, from cum laude graduate \n     of Harvard Law School to President of the State Bar of \n     California, speak for themselves, of course. Of particular \n     interest to crime victims, law enforcement and public \n     prosecutors are her initiatives and achievements in the \n     fields of juvenile justice and domestic violence, where her \n     efforts have helped focus national attention.\n       The record of scholarship, citizenship, and dedication to \n     improving the legal system that Margaret will bring with her \n     to the federal bench reveals great promise for a truly \n     exceptional jurist of whom we will all be proud. I sincerely, \n     wholeheartedly and enthusiastically entreat you to confirm \n     Margaret's nomination for appointment to the district court, \n     without delay. We need her.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael R. Capizzi,\n     District Attorney.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                                   Los Angeles, CA, June 17, 1996.\n     Re Margaret M. Morrow.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch.\n     Chairman, Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: I write to strongly support the \n     nomination of Margaret M. Morrow for a judgeship on the \n     United States District Court for the Central District of \n     California.\n       Ms. Morrow has been a particularly active and contributing \n     member of the Los Angeles Legal community for most of the \n     twenty-two years she has practiced in our city. She has \n     worked tirelessly to improve the quality, efficiency and \n     accessibility of the courts proposing and advocating such \n     measures as the consolidation of our two-tier trial court in \n     California, working on efforts to improve our jury system, \n     and promoting greater use of alternative dispute resolution \n     by both the courts and the public.\n       She has also worked actively to improve life in our \n     community, addressing such problems as domestic violence, \n     child abuse, and juvenile delinquency with specific programs \n     designed to increase public awareness and improve both \n     private sector and governmental responses to these problems.\n       As the first woman President of the State Bar of California \n     in its 67-year history, Ms. Morrow commissioned a \n     comprehensive review of the attorney discipline systems in \n     California. The study was designed to investigate criticisms \n     from legal consumers that the system unfairly favored \n     lawyers, and criticisms from lawyers that attorneys in \n     certain practice areas were being targeted for selective \n     prosecution. Finally, the study was to evaluate the structure \n     and efficiency of the discipline operation, which at that \n     time cost between $15 and $20 million each year.\n       The final report found that the system operated fairly for \n     both clients and lawyers. Nonetheless, it recommended \n     important changes to increase responsiveness--streamlined \n     reorganization of the prosecutorial office, stiffer penalties \n     for serious violations, greater public access to information \n     concerning pending complaints, and reduced staffing and \n     better personnel utilization by the State Bar Court. These \n     improvements significantly strengthened what is generally \n     considered to be the best lawyer discipline system in the \n     country. To complement this effort, Ms. Morrow spearheaded \n     the creation of a lawyer-client mediation program to provide \n     a remedy for client complaints outside the scope of the \n     discipline system.\n       In her earlier tenure as President of the Los Angeles \n     County Bar Association, Ms. Morrow was responsible for the \n     Association's promulgation of a Pro Bono Policy which \n     established an annual goal for pro bono legal service by its \n     members, and ultimately generated an additional 150,000 hours \n     of pro bono time. Her efforts in this regard were designed to \n     ensure that low-income people could access the courts to \n     resolve problems and secure needed services, and thus feel \n     less need to take matters into their own hands. During this \n     period also, Ms. Morrow served as a member of the six-person \n     Commission to Draft an Ethics Code for Los Angeles City \n     Government. It was this body that proposed our city's current \n     ethics law, and helped to increase public trust in our \n     government.\n       As a lawyer, Ms. Morrow has had extensive federal and state \n     litigation experience at both the trial and appellate levels. \n     She is recognized within the profession as someone who can \n     analyze complex legal problems thoroughly and litigate \n     successfully. Ms. Morrow is perhaps best described as a \n     ``lawyer's lawyer''--someone to whom other practitioners turn \n     for advice and assistance at both the trial and appellate \n     level. Because of her frequent appearances in court, she is \n     also well respected by the state and federal judiciary, who \n     value her intelligence and integrity as well as the quality \n     of her written and oral advocacy.\n       I believe Ms. Morrow would be an excellent addition to the \n     federal bench. She is dedicated to following the law, and \n     applying it in\n\n[[Page S4423]]\n\n     a rational and objective fashion. The residents of our \n     community would be extraordinarily well served by her \n     appointment as a Central District Judge.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Richard J. Riordan,\n     Mayor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         Assembly Majority Leader,\n\n\n                                       California Legislature,\n\n                                  Sacramento, CA, August 30, 1996.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: I am writing to urge your support of \n     Margaret Marrow's nomination for a United States District \n     Court judgeship in Los Angeles.\n       Margaret is a former president of the Los Angeles County \n     Bar Association and the State Bar of California. In 1994, we \n     worked together to secure passage of the trial court \n     consolidation measure, and I found her to be tough, \n     thoughtful and fair. She currently is a civil litigation \n     partner with the Los Angeles law firm of Quinn, Kully and \n     Morrow.\n       A judicial evaluation conducted by the American Bar \n     Association's Judiciary Committee last year gave Margaret its \n     highest rating, ``very well qualified.'' I have every \n     confidence that, as a judge, Margaret would be conscientious \n     in applying the law.\n       Please give the matter of her nomination every due \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James E.

Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: I would like to take this opportunity \n     to endorse Margaret Morrow, who has been nominated by \n     President Clinton to a United States District Court Judge \n     position in Los Angeles.\n       Ms. Morrow is currently a partner in the law firm of Quinn, \n     Kully & Morrow. She has established herself as a highly \n     skilled attorney and has served as past president for the \n     State Bar of California, the Los Angeles Bar Association and \n     the Barristers' Section of the Los Angeles County Bar \n     Association. As a Barristers' Committee Chair, she worked \n     closely with the juvenile delinquency and dependency court \n     system, helping administrators at a local detention facility \n     improve the educational program and she published a handbook \n     to help lawyers and the public to better understand the two \n     systems.\n       She also established the Domestic Violence Counseling \n     Program and held training sessions for lawyers. She involved \n     law enforcement officials in planning and teaching the \n     sessions to ensure focus on the law enforcement perspective \n     on this type of case. Ms. Morrow's extensive professional \n     activities indicates her willingness to be a positive aspect \n     in the jurisprudence field.\n       Margaret Morrow is an extremely hard working individual of \n     impeccable character and integrity. Her list of credits, both \n     professionally and within the community is extensive.\n       I would like to recommend that you favorably consider her \n     appointment. I have no doubt that she would be a \n     distinguished addition to the United States District Court.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Sherman Block,\n     Sheriff.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              State of California,\n\n\n                                              Court of Appeal,\n\n                                   Los Angeles, CA, June 11, 1996.\n     Re Judicial Candidacy of Margaret M. Morrow.\n\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I write to endorse President Clinton's \n     nomination of Margaret Morrow for the United States District \n     Court in Los Angeles. I also recommend that you give priority \n     to her confirmation.\n       I am a lifelong Republican, some would call me a \n     conservative one. I was born in Utah, am an active member of \n     the LDS Church, and have sent my children to Provo, Utah, for \n     their post-high school education. The Los Angeles Chapter of \n     the J. Reuben Clark Law Society recently named me as \n     ``Outstanding Lawyer 1996.'' As a California Deputy Attorney \n     General in 1981-1984, I successfully prosecuted Angelo Buono \n     for the 1977-78 ``Hillside Strangler'' serial murders in Los \n     Angeles. Since then, Governor George Deukmejian has appointed \n     me to successive judicial positions (municipal and superior \n     courts, and California Court of Appeal). In 1993 Governor \n     Pete Wilson appointed me to my present position as Presiding \n     Justice of my division of the California Court of Appeal. I \n     provide you this background information to give some \n     perspective to my recommendation.\n       I have known Margaret Morrow for over ten years. I am \n     convinced that she will be a most dedicated and competent \n     United States District Court judge. She presently enjoys the \n     greatest respect from a very broad spectrum of the California \n     judiciary and bar. Her service as President of the California \n     Bar Association was widely applauded, and her professional \n     work as an attorney is considered of the highest caliber. She \n     is representative of the mainstream of California legal and \n     judicial culture.\n       I have also known her husband, Los Angeles superior court \n     judge Paul Boland, for many years as a colleague and friend. \n     He and Margaret are among the most decent people I know. They \n     are energetic, yet kind and considerate to everyone with whom \n     they come in contact. I also believe they embrace high moral \n     principles and values. This is the one nomination recommended \n     by our California senators that you should readily promote. I \n     am confident that prompt and full consideration of Margaret \n     Morrow's nomination will convince you that any President or \n     Senate would do well to select her as a federal judge. Please \n     feel free to call on me should you desire further \n     information.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                   Roger W. Boren,\n     Presiding Justice.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                        U.S. Court of Appeals,\n\n                                       Pasadena, CA, June 4, 1996.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Hatch: At the risk of being an ``officious \n     intermeddler,'' I thought I should formally let you know that \n     I have known Margaret M. Morrow, one of the President's \n     nominees for the Central District of California, for twenty \n     years or so and believe that she will be an outstanding \n     United States District Judge.\n       Apart from serving the bar in ways too numerous to mention, \n     she is among the ablest advocates in the country. As former \n     Chief Judge Wallace and I remarked after hearing her argue a \n     difficult matter before our panel a few years ago, hers was \n     one of the finest, most thoroughly professional, arguments we \n     had heard.\n       Ms. Morrow is an intelligent, extremely competent lawyer \n     who has specialized in complex litigation and has the kind of \n     experience and judgment necessary to manage the complicated \n     case load of the federal trial court. I have no doubt that my \n     view of her potential for bringing distinction to the court \n     is shared by my colleagues on the Central District and the \n     Ninth Circuit, as well as by the bar in Los Angeles.\n       If there is anything further I can add to your Committee's \n     consideration of Ms. Morrow's nomination, I would be happy to \n     talk to any member of your staff.\n           With best regards,\n     Pamela Rymer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                        U.S. Court of Appeals,\n\n                                       Boise, ID, August 13, 1996.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Re Margaret Morrow, Judicial Candidate--District Court, \n         Central District of California.\n       Dear Senator Lott: Although I am aware of the difficult \n     dynamics of Senate confirmation of judicial nominees during \n     an election year, nevertheless I would hope you would act \n     favorably on the candidacy of Margaret Morrow who is \n     currently on the floor waiting for a vote. She is without a \n     question a superior candidate with bipartisan support whose \n     confirmation would be received favorably by everyone in my \n     old district. We need her in the Circuit to attend to the \n     heavy case load generated in large measure by important \n     legislation enacted by Congress.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\n                                             Stephen S. Trott,\n\n     Circuit Judge.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                     June 7, 1996.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I understand that President Clinton has \n     nominated Margaret M. Morrow to serve on the United States \n     District Court for the Central District of California.\n       I have known Ms. Morrow as a lawyer of great distinction in \n     the Los Angeles Bar. In fact, it is more unusual to find a \n     lawyer who is held in such high esteem by his or her peers as \n     to have been, as has been Margaret, elected President of both \n     the Los Angeles County Bar Association (the largest voluntary \n     bar in the United States) and the State Bar of California.\n       As a former Judge, and President-Elect of the Los Angeles \n     County Bar Association, I have been in a position to observe \n     Ms. Morrow's ability and demeanor over an extended period of \n     time. As former Chairman of Senators (now Governor) Wilson's \n     and Seymour's Committee on Selection of Federal Judges, U.S. \n     Attorneys, and Marshals for the Central District of \n     California, I certainly believe I have gained an appreciation \n     for what kind of a combination of character, work ethic, \n     demeanor and intelligence is required to fulfill the \n     demanding position of a United States District Court Judge.\n       As an individual who has had the privilege of helping \n     select so many District Court Judges, I can say without fear \n     of contradiction that to a man and women, I believe the \n     entire Court of this District would welcome her with open \n     arms. She will be a great credit to the bench, and deserve \n     your serious consideration and acceptance.\n       I recommend Margaret Morrow without reservation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Sheldon H. Sloan.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Ms. Morrow's qualifications and the broad support she \nenjoys\n\n[[Page S4424]]\n\nwould make her an exceptionally distinguished addition to the Federal \nbench.\n  Finally, her qualifications and the broad support she enjoys makes \nher an exceptionally distinguished addition to the Federal bench. Mr. \nPresident, the Judiciary Committee has already reviewed Ms. Morrow's \nbackground, which is outstanding. To echo the recent words of \nRepublican Judge Pamela Rymer, appointed in 1989 to the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals by President Bush, I too am looking forward to the day \nMargaret Morrow sits on the bench of the U.S. Federal District Court in \nthe Central District of California. I am in agreement with Judge Rymer \nthat Ms. Morrow will bring distinction to the district court.\n  In sum, Mr. President, I continue to strongly support Ms. Morrow's \nrenomination by President Clinton.\n  I am fully confident that the Members of the Senate when fully \ninformed will agree with me that Margaret Morrow's qualifications are \noutstanding and she is deserving of expeditious Senate confirmation. \nHer exceptional experience as an attorney, her professional service, \nand her deep commitment to justice qualify her to serve our Nation and \nthe people of California with great distinction. And as evidenced by \nthe letters I have read from, she has strong bipartisan support from \nsome of the most prominent and conservative Republicans in my State.\n  Again, my deep thanks to my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I might say to my friend from California, we talk about \nthe secret hold. I mean, if there is a Senator who has some objection \nto her, let him vote against her.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Let us bring the nomination up.\n  The irony is, you know and I know, with her qualifications, anybody \nwould be embarrassed to vote against her because there would be no way \nthey could explain back home how a woman, one of the most qualified \nnominees to come before the Senate for a Federal court nominated by any \nPresident, Republican or Democrat, is held up.\n  I say to my friend from California, who has worked so hard and so \ndiligently, one-on-one with Members to get this moving, it is, \nunfortunately, part of a picture. I have this chart which shows now we \nhave 99 vacancies. We will have more. The number of judges who have \nbeen confirmed in the 105th Congress--when we first put this chart \ntogether, we wanted to show the vacancies on this side.\n  I see my friend from Maryland, too. I will show him, too.\n  We wanted to show the vacancies confirmed on the other side. We could \nnot see the number that have been confirmed, so we put in this \nmagnifying glass. I feel like Sherlock Holmes with my little magnifying \nglass going down.\n  There are 99 vacancies, and down here, two being confirmed. We have \nhad more vacancies this year than we have had judicial confirmations in \nthe U.S. Senate. Maybe we can shave a day off each one of these \nrecesses and confirm some judges during that time. We have not had time \nto do much else. We ought to at least confirm those.\n  In fact--and I will share one of these with my friend from Maryland. \nThe distinguished senior Senator from Maryland is on the floor. I \nthought he might be interested in noting where we stand on this.\n  You might want to take a look at that, I say to my good friend from \nMaryland. We came at the beginning of the year with actually 78 \nvacancies. And then, as often happens, people realize that they have \ngrown older or they're taking senior status, whatever, they start \nretiring. We go from 78 to 89, to 92, to 94, to 96, to 99.\n  We go in January, zero confirmed; in February, zero confirmed; in \nMarch, two confirmed; and those are the same two listed here. We have \nnot gone above two. So while this list goes up, that stays even. People \nare used to talking about zero population growth. This is zero \npopulation growth in the judiciary.\n  I understand that Speaker Gingrich and others felt there was some \npolitical gain to shutting down the Federal Government about a year and \na half ago. The American people did not think there was, but for some \nreason they did. It appears to me what they are trying to do is shut \ndown the Federal courts. This is an unprecedented, unprecedented \nsituation.\n  In the 102d Congress we had a Republican President and a Democratic-\ncontrolled Senate. We confirmed 124 judges.\n  In the 103d Congress we confirmed 129.\n  Even in the last Congress 75.\n  Now we confirmed 2 with 99 vacancies.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist says:\n\n       The number of judicial vacancies can have a profound impact \n     on a court's ability to manage its caseload effectively.\n\n  He says:\n\n       It's hoped that the administration and Congress will \n     continue to recognize that filling judicial vacancies is \n     crucial to the fair and effective administration of justice.\n\n  That is what it comes to.\n  The American taxpayers, Republicans and Democrats alike, pay taxes to \nhave their courts run. The courts do not run if the vacancies are \nthere. You do not have criminal cases handled the way they should. \nPeople are forced to plea bargain because they cannot get through. You \ndo not have civil cases that you may want to hear if you are a \nlitigant; you have a case you want heard, you cannot have it heard. \nThis is wrong.\n\n  I was in another State the other day, Monday, and somebody was \ntelling me how they have to go out and hire private judges to hear \ntheir cases. Now, these are people who are already paying the taxes. \nThey are already paying for courts that are sitting there. But there \nare no judges to hear the cases. The vacancies cannot be filled so they \ngo out and hire private judges.\n  I mean, this is sort of like saying I will pay my taxes to have a \npolice officer and a police department, and I paid for it. The money is \nthere. We pay the money for the police department and the police \nofficers, but some person in the community says, ``Well, we're not \ngoing to hire any police officers. We're not going to have anybody \nthere. So even though you paid your taxes for that, if you want your \nproperty protected, you have got to go out and hire a private police \nofficer.'' Well, we are doing the same thing with the judges.\n  Mr. President, I think this is an outrageous situation. Let us see \nwhat we have here.\n  In 1980, we did nine appeals courts--these were Presidential election \nyears during the second Senate session, Presidential election years, \nand we did 9 appeals court judges and 55 district court judges. All the \nway down through here you can see many times with Republican Presidents \nand a Democratic Congress we cooperated.\n  Nothing has happened here.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course I will.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think the chart the Senator has just put up is a very \ndramatic chart in demonstrating what has happened here. As I understand \nit, this chart shows the number of judges confirmed during a second \nSenate session in Presidential election years. We all know that what \nhappens in a Presidential election year is that there is a slowdown \nbecause the party that does not have the White House thinks it may get \nthe White House and then it will be able to effect the appointment of \njudges.\n  I ask the Senator from Vermont, as I understand his chart, this shows \nthat in 1996, last year, with a Democratic President and a Republican-\ncontrolled Senate, there was this incredible slowdown in the number of \njudges confirmed, which has continued into 1997.\n  But in 1996, no court of appeals judges were confirmed and only 17 \ndistrict judges. Is that correct?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator is not only correct, but I would ask him to \ncontrast that with the last year of the Bush administration with a \nDemocratic-controlled Senate and the difference in the cooperation of \nthe Democrats with a Republican President than they show the \nRepublicans with a Democratic President.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The able Senator from Vermont is very perceptive \nbecause he anticipated the next point I want to go to, which is to \ncontrast what happened last year with what happened in the last year of \nthe Bush Presidency, 1992, an election year.\n  The Senate majority was then in Democratic hands, and yet we \nconfirmed 11 judges for the court of appeals nominated--nominated--by\n\n[[Page S4425]]\n\nPresident Bush and 55 judges for the district court nominated by \nPresident Bush, for a total of 66 judges.\n  Last year, a comparable situation, except it was reversed. We had a \nDemocratic President making the nominations; the Republicans controlled \nthe Senate; 17 judges, a total of 17 judges. No court of appeals \njudges, 17 district judges compared with 66 judges in the last year of \nPresident Bush's term.\n  In fact, the last year of President Reagan's term, again with a \nDemocratic Senate, we confirmed 7 court of appeals judges and 35 \ndistrict court judges.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We actually did better with district court judges with the \nDemocrats in charge than President Reagan did at the end of his first \nterm with the Republicans in charge.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In 1984. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. President, this is an extraordinary slowdown in the confirmation \nof judges. Then, of course, what happens is none--only two have been \nconfirmed this year thus far.\n\n  So in the last virtually year and a half, 19 judges.\n  I just submit to you this game ought to stop. We ought not to be \nplaying with the Federal courts in this way. If people have a \nlegitimate objection to a particular nominee, they ought to voice that \nobjection and vote against them and try to persuade their colleagues to \nvote against them. But this is crippling the courts. The Chief Justice \nof the United States has been driven to the unusual posture of \nregistering his complaint about it.\n  I am frank to say to you, I think that Members of this body, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike, have a responsibility to ensure that \nthe Federal court system can work in a reasonable fashion. It is not \ngoing to work in a reasonable fashion if you slow up the confirmation \nof judges to this extent.\n  It has not been done before. I mean, this breaks with all previous \npatterns and previous precedents. I just submit that we are not going \nto maintain public confidence in the judicial system, and we ought not \nto politicize the judicial process the way it is being done.\n  So I want to commend strongly the senior Senator from Vermont, the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, for bringing this issue once \nagain to our attention. It is beginning to cripple the Federal courts. \nThere is no question about it.\n  As my colleague from California pointed out, it is terribly unfair to \nsome very able and dedicated people who have been nominated and then \ntheir life simply placed on hold in terms of their normal activities. \nIt is a marked departure from any sense of comity that has heretofore \nprevailed in this body and a marked departure from the respect that has \ntraditionally been shown to the Federal court system.\n  I very much hope that we can begin to address this situation, begin \nto hold hearings, report the people out, confirm them when they come \nbefore the Senate. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his forceful \nleadership on this issue.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend and colleague from Maryland and my \nfriend and colleague from California for their statements.\n  I ask the Chair how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has approximately 9 \nminutes and 50 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in \ndecrying the stranglehold that has been placed on Federal judicial \nnominations by the Senate, including the Judiciary Committee, of which \nI am a member.\n  The numbers bear repeating, because they are simply appalling. Last \nyear, the Republican Senate confirmed an abysmally low number of \njudges--only 17. And none of these was for the courts of appeals.\n  Compare this to when the roles were reversed in 1992, the year a \nRepublican President was running for reelection and the Democrats \ncontrolled the Senate. That year, the Democratic Senate confirmed 66 \nFederal judges, including 11 court of appeals judges.\n  It was thought that, after the election was over, the Senate would \nreturn to the normal course of fulfilling its constitutionally-mandated \nrole in the judicial nomination process.\n  Unfortunately, however, that has not proven to be the case. It is now \nmid-way through May, and the Senate has confirmed just two Federal \njudges. The Judiciary Committee has only held two nominations hearings.\n  California has been especially hard-hit by this slowdown on Federal \njudges. More than one-fourth of the judges whose nominations are \nlanguishing in the Senate are from California--7 out of 26.\n  Five of these seven judges were nominated in the last Congress. Let \nme tell you a little bit about each of them, to put some faces on the \nnominees whose lives have been disrupted by the Senate's extended \nfailure to act on their nominations:\n\n  Richard Paez is already a respected Federal judge on the district \ncourt in Los Angeles. He was nominated by the President to the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals on January 25, 1996. The Judiciary Committee \ngave him a hearing on July 31, 1996. However, the committee has never \ntaken any further action on his nomination.\n  Tomorrow, Christina Snyder will have been before the Committee for 1 \nfull year, as she was first nominated by the President to Federal \ndistrict court in Los Angeles on May 15, 1996. Ms. Snyder is a graduate \nof one of the top law schools in the country, Stanford Law School, for \nwhich she has since gone on to serve on the board of visitors. She is a \nmember of the prestigious American Law Institute, and her nomination \nhas received bipartisan support, including endorsements from the \nRepublican mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan, and the Republican \nSheriff of Los Angeles County, Sherman Block. I am not aware of one \nwhit of substantive opposition to her nomination.\n  And yet, Ms. Snyder has been unable to get even a hearing before the \nJudiciary Committee. Already this year, the committee has held hearings \non the nominations of four men who were nominated after Ms. Snyder, \nincluding one who was only nominated for the first time this year, in \n1997. I am optimistic that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee will \nagree to place Ms. Snyder on the agenda for the committee's next \nnomination hearing, and again urge him to do so.\n  Margaret Morrow actually was favorably reported by the committee last \nyear, unanimously, but her nomination died on the floor. She was \nnominated over a year ago, on May 9, 1996. Morrow is a graduate of \nHarvard Law School, was the first woman president of the State Bar of \nCalifornia, and has received numerous awards for her work as a lawyer \nand her commitment to public service.\n  The committee held a second hearing on her nomination this year. But \nwhile the three men who were heard along with her have all been \nfavorably reported out of the committee, she has not even been brought \nup for a vote. Her nomination has been slowed while members of the \ncommittee from the other side of the aisle pose round after round of \nfollow-up questions to her, including asking for her view on some of \nthe most controversial issues that have been considered by Californians \non the ballot over the last 10 years. This level of scrutiny previously \nhas been reserved for Supreme Court nominees, who shape constitutional \ninterpretation, rather than merely following precedent a district court \njudge does. In my time on the committee, I have never seen this level \nof scrutiny applied to a male district court nominee.\n\n  Jeffrey Miller is a superior court judge in San Diego, who was \nappointed to that post by Republican Governor Deukmejian. An \naccomplished jurist and a veteran of the State attorney general's \noffice, he has been complimented by numerous fellow judges. First \nnominated last July, his nomination is now on the floor of the Senate. \nI hope that the majority leader will call up his nomination for action \nby the Senate.\n  William Fletcher's nomination to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nhas been languishing for more than 2 years, having first been made on \nApril 25, 1995. Fletcher is a professor at the Boalt Hall School of Law \nat the University of California at Berkeley, where he has won the \nDistinguished Teacher Award. He is a magna cum laude graduate of \nHarvard; he earned his law degree from Yale Law School; he is a Navy \nveteran, a Rhodes Scholar, and a former clerk on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. He was favorably reported by the committee almost a year\n\n[[Page S4426]]\n\nago, on May 16, 1996. However, the committee has taken no action on his \nnomination this year.\n  This outstanding group of holdover nominees from the last Congress \nhas been joined this year by two more nominees, Anthony Ishii and Lynn \nLasry, who have been nominated to the Federal district courts for the \nEastern District and Southern District of California, respectively.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to act on these nominations. I'm not \nasking for a rubber stamp; let's hold hearings on those nominees who \nhaven't had them, and vote on all of them, up or down, yes or no.\n  California needs these judges. The chief judge of the ninth circuit, \nProcter Hug, Jr., has said,\n\n       our federal courts here in the 9th Circuit, and \n     particularly our court of appeals, are facing a vacancy \n     crisis of serious proportions. We simply do not have enough \n     active district and appellate judges to hear and decide cases \n     in a prompt and timely manner.\n\n  While filings in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals have increased by \nover 60 percent since 1985, the court currently has 8 vacancies, more \nthan any other circuit in the Nation.\n  In the last 5 years, case filings in the Eastern District of \nCalifornia have skyrocketed by 49.7 percent.\n  In the Southern District of California, case filings have increased \nby 94.7 percent since 1991--a pace that more than triples the national \nrate of increase of 27.5 percent.\n  In an editorial last month, the Los Angeles Times put it well:\n\n       [The Margaret Morrow] case is only one of many in a \n     deplorable situation that has gone on far too long. Justice \n     is not served by an empty bench. Nor is society. Whichever \n     party holds the Congress and the White House, gamesmanship \n     over judicial appointments produces no winners. It only \n     leaves a void . . .\n       [The Senate's] record of delay, attempts to kill funding \n     for some appellate seats and its harassment of Morrow and \n     other qualified nominees reveals a deeply troubling \n     partisanship.\n\n  Last we looked, the U.S. Constitution grants the President the power \nto nominate and directs the Senate to ``advise and consent,'' not \nstonewall. The 26 nominations now pending would be a good place to \nstart.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's end the gridlock on judges. Let's not \nhold the third branch of government hostage to partisan politics.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Federal courts today suffer from far \ntoo many unfilled judgeships. There are at least 99 vacancies for \njudges in the appeals courts and district courts. Twenty-four of these \nvacancies--in the appellate courts and in the trial courts--are \njudicial emergencies according to the definition of the Judicial \nConference of the United States. That is, the positions have been \nvacant for at least 18 months.\n  As a result, caseloads are backlogged throughout the country, and the \nvictims of this situation are the American people. Justice delayed is \njustice denied. Thousands of Americans with legitimate grievances \ncannot get their day in court, because there are few Federal judges to \nhear their cases. Citizens must wait excessive lengths of time to \nresolve disputes, answer constitutional questions, and obtain justice.\n  We need strong courts to combat crime, to put criminals behind bars \nand make sure they serve their time. We need strong courts to protect \nfamilies, jobs, and businesses. Where else can Americans go when they \nare treated unfairly on the job or when their small businesses are run \nover by larger corporations?\n  Just this week, I received a letter from a lawyer in San Diego who is \nconcerned that the Federal court serving the city has had two vacancies \nunfilled for over 2 years.\n  He writes,\n\n       Our federal court in San Diego is at the breaking point. \n     For more than two years, the Court has valiantly struggled \n     with a burgeoning case load and managed barely to keep its \n     head above water by dedicated and innovative work on the part \n     of our senior and active judges and our magistrate judges. \n     But the system has been stretched as far as it can go. It \n     desperately needs its two judges.\n\n  In fact, President Clinton has submitted two qualified nominees to \nfill these vacancies, but the Senate has yet to take action on them. \nJeffrey Miller was nominated last July. In March, he finally had a \nhearing and was approved unanimously by the Judiciary Committee in \nApril. But his nomination has been languishing ever since, waiting for \nthe Senate to act. The Republican leadership won't let the nomination \ncome up for a vote.\n  The problems in San Diego are being repeated in communities \nthroughout the United States, and a major cause is the intentional \nstall by Congress in processing new judges.\n  So far this year, the Republican-controlled Senate has approved only \ntwo judicial nominees. Three more have been approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee, but the Republican leadership has made no effort to put them \nbefore the Senate for confirmation.\n  Last year, in the Republican-controlled Senate, only 17 district \ncourt judges were approved, and no appeals court judges were approved--\nnone--zero.\n  Since 1980, the Senate confirmed an average of 51 judges per year. \nWhen measured against this standard of performance, today's Republican \nSenate gets a failing grade.\n  Republicans shut down the Federal Government in 1995 and were rightly \ncriticized for that unwise action. They say they will never do it \nagain, and are even trying to pass a law that would put the Government \non automatic pilot if a budget agreement is not reached. But at the \nsame time, behind the scenes, there is a Republican scheme to shut down \nour Nation's courts.\n  The issue is far more than a numbers game. What we are witnessing \ntoday is a direct assault on the President's constitutional power to \nnominate and appoint judges.\n  Our Republican friends claim they want to move ahead on nominees. \nThey say the current stall on judicial nominations is not an effort to \nforce President Clinton to apply Republican litmus tests to nominees. \nWe hear that the unwise plans proposed by Senator Gramm of Texas and \nSenator Gorton of Washington were defeated in the Republican caucus 2 \nweeks ago.\n  But the facts speak for themselves. Republicans have shut down the \ncourts and the American people are suffering the consequences.\n  Republicans say they want to make sure that no activist judges are \nappointed to the courts. They've also begun to attack sitting judges. \nJudge Martha Daughtry of Tennessee is a case in point. She was \nnominated by President Clinton to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals \nand confirmed by the Senate in 1993 with broad bipartisan support.\n  Later, a prominent State judge in her circuit was convicted of \nFederal civil rights offenses involving sexual assaults on court \nemployees, job applicants, and female attorneys. A three-judge panel of \nthe sixth circuit affirmed the conviction. But the en banc court, \ndominated by Reagan and Bush appointees overturned it. They ruled that \nthe U.S. Constitution does not give Congress the power to protect women \nfrom sexual assaults by State officials.\n  Judge Daughtry dissented. She said that the right of citizens to be \nfree from physical harm by public officials who abuse their authority \nhas been recognized ``since the sealing of the Magna Carta.''\n  But Presidential candidate Bob Dole attacked Judge Daughtry and \nplaced her in his ``Hall of Shame.'' He cited her as an example of the \nliberal activist judges that President Clinton appointed to the bench.\n  Judge Daughtry had the last laugh. Two months ago, the Justices of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court not only reversed the sixth circuit decision, \nthey reversed it unanimously, and cited Judge Daughtry's dissent in \ntheir opinion.\n  Another case in point is Margaret Morrow, whose nomination is pending \nin the Judiciary Committee. There should be no doubt about her \ncompetence and judicial temperament. Her nomination received the \nAmerican Bar Association's highest rating. She has numerous \nendorsements from her peers in California--both Democrats and \nRepublicans. She is a corporate lawyer, hardly an activist by anyone's \ndefinition. She was the first woman president of the State Bar of \nCalifornia. She is a past president of the Los Angeles County Bar \nAssociation. She has received numerous awards from the Los Angeles Bar \nAssociation, the California Judicial Council, and other legal \nassociations. In 1994, she was listed as one of the top 20 lawyers in \nLos Angeles in\n\n[[Page S4427]]\n\nCalifornia Law Business. The Los Angeles Business Journal named her one \nof the top 100 business lawyers in Los Angeles in 1995 and 1996.\n  Probably the greatest test of her temperament for the job is the \nmanner in which she has responded to the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nDespite the fact that she was held over for a second hearing in the \ncommittee and the many questions addressed to her, she has responded \nthoroughly, professionally, efficiently, and appropriately to each one. \nThat is exactly what we want in a Federal judge.\n  An extremely well-qualified woman is being held up arbitrarily. There \nis no justification whatsoever for this unfair delay.\n  I hope that our Republican friends will reconsider their stall on \njudicial nominations. The rule of law in America depends on a healthy \njudiciary.\n  And if the Republican majority in the Senate does not move ahead to \nrespond to the crisis in the courts, I hope that President Clinton will \nconsider the only alternative he has left. In their wisdom, the \nFounding Fathers gave the President a useful additional power, the \npower of recess appointments. If the log jam doesn't break soon--very \nsoon, the President should start using that power. The Memorial Day \nrecess offers the next opportunity to make recess appointments, and the \nPresident should not hesitate to use it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a letter from the \nNational Women's Law Center be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  National Women's Law Center,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n      Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: We are writing to express our grave \n     concerns regarding the process being followed with respect to \n     the nomination of Margaret Morrow to the district court in \n     the Central District of California. Her original nomination \n     was made one year ago. Yet, her nomination has not been moved \n     through the process.\n       Ample information has been presented regarding her \n     qualifications. She is a magna cum laude graduate of Bryn \n     Mawr College and a cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School. \n     She has a 23-year career in private practice with an emphasis \n     in complicated commercial and corporate litigation with \n     extensive experience in federal courts. She has received a \n     long list of awards and recognition as a top lawyer in her \n     field, her community and her state. She is a leader and path \n     blazer among women lawyers, as the second woman President of \n     25,000 member Los Angeles Bar Association and the first woman \n     President of the largest mandatory bar association in the \n     country, the 150,000 member State Bar of California. She has \n     consistently been a voice within the legal community for \n     women and for the disadvantaged. She has received broad \n     support from attorneys, judges and community leaders.\n       You questioned four nominees on March 18, 1997. The other \n     three, all men, have moved forward toward a Senate vote. \n     Margaret Morrow has not.\n       No explanation has been provided which in any way justifies \n     this extraordinary and harmful delay. Superb women lawyers \n     should not be given the message that we fear is being sent by \n     the handling of Margaret Morrow's nomination--that no woman \n     need apply unless she is prepared to be singled out for \n     particularly harsh treatment.\n       We urge you to send her nomination to the Senate floor \n     immediately.\n           Sincerely,\n     Nancy Duff Campbell,\n       Co-President.\n     Marcia D. Greenberger,\n       Co-President.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note that over the past 2 weeks I have \ntwice corrected a misstatement with respect to the three nominations \npending on the Senate executive calendar. Twice, Republicans have said \nthat some unknown Democrat had a hold on these judicial nominations. \nThis is not so. Every single Democrat in the Senate is ready to vote, \nand vote today, on all the judicial nominees, the three judicial \nnominees is all it is, that have been voted out of committee so far. \nEvery Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee is prepared to vote at \nthe next Judiciary Committee meeting on all the nominees that are \npending there. There is no, no Democrat with a hold on any judicial \nnominee--I want that very, very clear--neither in the committee nor in \nthe Senate. If we have to have rollcall votes, we are glad to do that. \nBut we should have these people come up.\n  We received Jeffrey Miller's nomination in July 1996, last Congress. \nThe President renominated him on the first day of this Congress for the \nsame vacancy, a vacancy that has existed since December 1994. We are in \n1997 now. This is one of the judicial emergency vacancies we should \nhave filled. He has the support of both Senators. He finally had a \nconfirmation hearing 2\\1/2\\ years, almost, after the vacancy occurred. \nHis nomination was considered. It has been reported to the Senate. We \nshould vote on it.\n  We first received Donald Middlebrooks' nomination in September of \n1996, last year. He was not accorded a hearing last Congress. This is \nfor a vacancy that has been there since 1992, 5 years ago. That is a \njudicial emergency vacancy, and he has the support of both Senators \nfrom his State, one a Democrat, senior Senator, Senator Graham, one a \nRepublican, Senator Mack. This was reported by the Judiciary Committee \nto the Senate April 17.\n  Now, here is a vacancy that has existed for 5 years. We have a judge \nwho has gone through the Senate Judiciary Committee, reported to the \nSenate, supported by the two Senators from his State, one a Democrat, \none a Republican. For God's sake, if we cannot vote on it, what in \nHeaven's name can we vote on? This should be about as noncontroversial \nas voting to commend the Fourth of July.\n  We first received Robert Pratt's nomination in August of 1996. We did \nnot get a hearing last Congress. The President renominated him on the \nfirst day of this Congress for the same vacancy in the district court \nfor the southern district of Iowa. He had a confirmation hearing on \nMarch 18. He was supported by the two Senators from Iowa, Senator \nHarkin and Senator Grassley, and was reported to the Senate by the \nJudiciary Committee on April 17.\n  Well, why can we not go forward with him? You look at what we have, a \ndistinguished woman who is being shunted aside by somebody who does not \nhave the guts to come forth on the Senate floor and say why that \nSenator is holding her up. We have distinguished other judges that have \ngone through the confirmation process, supported by the two Senators, a \nRepublican and a Democrat from their State, they cannot come forward.\n  I take our advise-and-consent function very seriously, especially \nwhen it comes to confirmation of Federal judges who have a lifetime \nappointment. Our system of government with coordinate branches and \nseparation of powers, that is our responsibility. I voted to confirm \nsome judges who ended up rendering decisions which I strongly \ndisagreed. I voted for some judges to move from one Federal court to \nanother, even though they had also had decisions with which I \ndisagreed. I voted against some who turned out to be better than I \npredicted. But we voted on them.\n\n  If a judge decides a case incorrectly, well, then you have appeal. I \nremember when I used to prosecute cases, I remember somebody saying, as \nthe juror went out to defense counsel, ``Well, let justice be done,'' \nand they said, ``Well, if that happens, we will appeal.'' If you lose a \ncase, appeal it. If you think you have bad law, have a legislative \nchange. In fact, the reason the founders included the protection of \nlifetime appointments for Federal judges was to insulate them from \npolitics and political influence.\n  Merrick Garland had an 18-month wait for confirmation--a judge \nvirtually everybody in the country that ruled on this, from the right \nto the left, on the judicial selection, said he was one of the most \nqualified persons ever to be up for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia. Mr. President, 23 Members of this body, all on \nthe other side of the aisle, voted against Merrick Garland for that \njudgeship. Not one of them spoke against the nominee. Not one of them \nspoke against his impeccable credentials. In fact, some who voted \nagainst him praised his qualifications. They say they voted against \nfilling an unneeded seat on the court of appeals, in the face of a \nletter from Chief Judge Silberman, who said they did need the seat, and \na statement from Senator Hatch, who said it was needed.\n  In his concluding remarks, Senator Hatch said, ``Playing politics \nwith judges is unfair, and I am sick of it.'' I agree with the \ndistinguished chairman\n\n[[Page S4428]]\n\nof the Senate Judiciary Committee. Let the Senate quit playing partisan \npolitics with judicial nominations. Let us do our constitutionally \nmandated job and proceed to confirm the judges we need for the Federal \nsystem.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       In 1987 I heard from Tom Jipping, a student at the \n     University of Buffalo Law School. The faculty had imposed a \n     speech code that was more contemptuous of the First Amendment \n     than even most of the politically correct gag rules \n     proliferating on campuses around the country.\n       ``Remarks,'' said the code, ``directed at another's race, \n     sex, religion, national origin, sexual preference'' et al. \n     would be severely punished. There was no further definition \n     of ``remarks.'' Also prohibited were ``other remarks''--not \n     defined--``based on prejudice and group stereotype.'' Any \n     prejudice?\n       Unique to this law school code--unanimously passed by the \n     administration and faculty--was a provision that the \n     administration would provide the rap sheets of any guilty \n     student to the character and fitness committees of any bar \n     association to which the pariah might apply.\n       Tom Jipping, though vilified by a prominent faculty member \n     and other speech police, fought the code, sending news of it \n     to the outside world. (I wrote about it in The Post, and \n     William Bennett spoke about it.) Eventually, after Jipping \n     was graduated, this embarrassment to the law school faded \n     away.\n       Jipping is now in Washington, where he directs the Judicial \n     Selection Monitoring Project, an offspring of the Free \n     Congress Foundation.\n       In his official role, Jipping sent a letter to all 100 \n     senators, demanding they act to purge those ``activist'' \n     federal judges who do not agree with Jipping's \n     interpretations of the Constitution. On Feb. 4 a follow-up \n     letter went to Sen Partick Leahy (D-Vt.).\n       In the letter, Jipping reminded Leahy that the senator had \n     previously received ``a letter from the largest coalition in \n     history to oppose judicial activism. . . . Please find \n     enclosed an opportunity to express your position on this \n     critical issue.''\n       He then quoted a resounding call for purges by Orrin Hatch, \n     chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee: ``Those nominees \n     who are or would be judicial activists should not be \n     nominated by the President or confirmed by the Senate, and I \n     will do my best to see to it that they are not.''\n       Jipping went on to warn Sen. Leahy that if he did not sign \n     the ``Hatch Pledge''--which Sen. Hatch will not sign because \n     he doesn't sign pledges--the forces of judicial correctness \n     will be unleashed. They will let Leahy's perfidy be known \n     ``to the more than 260 national and state organizations and \n     dozens of talk show hosts in our growing coalition.'' The \n     talk show hosts can surely be depended on the assess Leahy's \n     character and fitness.\n       Leahy must have enjoyed writing his answer to Jipping: ``I \n     do not take pledges demanded by special interest groups on \n     either the right or the left. Nor do I appreciate your thinly \n     veiled threat that you will employ talk show hosts and \n     national organizations to pressure me into making such a \n     pledge.\n       ``These tactics to force others to adopt your narrow view \n     of political correctness are wrong, and reminiscent of a dark \n     period from our history.''\n       The ever-vigilant Judicial Selection Monitoring Project \n     should alert the dozens of talk show hosts that a relentless \n     judicial activist, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, insists \n     that ``the idea of an independent judiciary, with authority \n     to finally interpret a written constitution . . . is one of \n     the crown jewels of our system of government.'' Then there \n     was a Founder, Alexander Hamilton, who wrote in the \n     Federalist Papers that ``the complete independence of the \n     courts of justice is peculiarly essential'' because the duty \n     of the courts ``must be to declare void all acts contrary to \n     the manifest tenor of the Constitution. Without this, all the \n     reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount \n     to nothing.''\n       Copies of the Federalist Papers might well be distributed \n     to members of the Senate, particularly those hunting \n     ``judicial activists'' and demanding their impeachment.\n       When Gerald Ford (R-Mich.) was in the House, he anticipated \n     the current jihad with a rousing speech calling for the \n     impeachment of Justice William O. Douglas. Ford, not a noted \n     constitutional scholar, said that ``an impeachable offense is \n     whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers \n     it to be at a given moment in history.''\n       That was spoken like the stunningly overbroad University of \n     Buffalo Law School speech code. Majority Whip Rep. Tom DeLay \n     (R-Tex.), a leader of the judge-baiters, recently quoted \n     Ford's definition of impeachment approvingly in a letter to \n     the New York Times.\n       It is a wonder that the Constitution, however battered from \n     time to time, survives the U.S. Congress.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GEN. GEORGE T. BABBITT, JR.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination \nthat is before the Senate of Lt. Gen. George T. Babbitt, Jr. to be \npromoted and receive an additional star to become general in the U.S. \nAir Force.\n  When this nomination came to the Senate at an earlier time several \nmonths ago, I notified the majority leader that I would like to be \ninformed prior to its coming to a vote. In Senate parlance, that is \ncalled putting a hold on this nomination. It was never my intention to \nhold up General Babbitt from receiving his additional star. But it was \nmy intention to focus seriously on the policy of the Air Force which \nGeneral Babbitt will be called upon to implement. Accordingly, I told \nthe majority leader that I do not want this nomination to go forward \nuntil we have had an opportunity to discuss that policy in some length. \nThe majority leader responded appropriately to my request, and we have \nhad a series of events that I think satisfy my requirement for full \ndiscussion. I would like to outline those for the Senate today before I \nmake it clear that I will have no further objection to proceeding with \nthe nomination of General Babbitt. I speak entirely for myself. There \nare a number of other Senators who have also put holds on this \nnomination. What they will do with their holds is something that they \nwill, of course, speak to on their own. I am speaking entirely, as I \nsay, for myself on this matter.\n  I have been criticized by some Members of this body for putting a \nhold on a nomination for a member of the uniformed services, and was \ntold, ``No. This should apply only to civilian personnel in the \nDepartment of Defense. You are using the uniformed services for a \npolitical purpose.''\n\n[[Page S4429]]\n\n  Mr. President, if anyone has been using the uniformed services for \npolitical purposes and political gain it has been the Department of \nDefense, not the Senator from Utah. The Department of Defense, under \ninstructions from the Base Realignment and Closure Commission--or \nBRCC--was told to close two of its five air logistics centers. That \nwould be the best result for the uniformed services; in this case the \nAir Force.\n  A Member of this body, the then senior Senator from Maine, Senator \nCohen, stood on this floor and berated the Department of Defense for \nits failure to abide by BRCC recommendations. He said very clearly that \nthe Department of Defense was in violation of the BRCC recommendation \nby their attempts to keep two of those air logistic centers operating \nunder the guise of privatization for competition. They invented a new \nterm of art. They call it privatization in place. ``We will privatize \nthe facility right where it is, which means we will not, as BRCC \nordered us to, send the work that is currently going on in those \nfacilities to the other facilities that can handle the work.'' That was \nwhat BRCC intended. That is what Senator Cohen attacked. And, yet, that \nis the policy that Secretary Cohen is now carrying out. That is the \npolicy that I protested when I said that I do not want the nomination \nof General Babbitt to go forward until we can have a full airing of \nthis issue.\n  I am happy to report to the Senate that the full airing for which I \ncalled has, indeed, taken place. We had a hearing before the Armed \nServices Committee, particularly before the Readiness Subcommittee, \nchaired by the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe].\n  In addition, we had a hearing before the Appropriations Committee, \nand in those hearings we found that, according to the General \nAccounting Office, the GAO, that the Air Force proposal for \nprivatization in place will cost this country an additional $500 to \n$700 million--maybe even $800 million. At a time of tight defense \nbudgets, at a time when we are talking about balancing the budget, it \nseems perverse for the Defense Department to say that we are going to \nwaste that much money.\n  The Air Force in those hearings said, ``No. We will not waste that \nmuch money.'' But to the question of how much money will you save with \nyour proposal of privatization in place, the Air Force has been \nbasically silent. And their response has been overwhelmingly ``Trust \nus. We will not tell you how much money we will save, but trust us. We \nwill save some, and the General Accounting Office figure is wrong.''\n  ``How wrong?''\n  ``Well, we do not know.''\n  ``Why wrong?''\n  ``Well, they don't understand our business.''\n  Mr. President, the General Accounting Office is the arm of the \nCongress created by law to be the fiscal watchdog of the executive \nbranch. There can be no better example of the value of the General \nAccounting Office than this one, as they have gone behind the`trust me \nfacade created by the Air Force and come up with numbers--lowest level \n$500 million, highest level $800 million, with $700 million being the \nguess about where it will finally come out.\n\n  So, by virtue of the hold that I put on General Babbitt's nomination, \nwe have had those two hearings and have gotten that information into \nthe public and on the record for the Senate.\n  In addition to those hearings, in response to my request to the \nmajority leader, the Secretary of the Air Force last week met with me \nand two other Senators, Senator Nickles and Senator Inhofe. And we had \na full and frank discussion about this issue. To be honest with you, \nMr. President, there was not much encouragement to come out of that \ndiscussion. Essentially, Secretary Widnall said, ``There is no problem. \nTherefore, we will not discuss with you any solution.'' She said to me, \n``Please remove your hold on General Babbitt because it is having a \ncorrosive effect on the personnel of the Air Force to have them \ncontinue without a commander.'' I said to her, and I repeat here today, \nthere is a corrosive effect in this area certainly. But it is not \ncaused by the fact that there is no confirmed commander. The corrosive \neffect is being caused by the Air Force's callous disregard for the \nneeds of their personnel in the surviving air logistics centers, and \nfor their refusal to abide by the BRCC process.\n  Following the meeting with Secretary Widnall today, I had a meeting \nagain with Senator Nickles, Senator Inhofe, and with General Babbitt. \nWhere the Air Force said there was no problem relating to overcapacity \nin the air logistics centers, General Babbitt acknowledged that there \nis a big problem, and pledged himself to do the best he could to try to \nresolve it. He made it very clear, as he appropriately should, that he \nwas not going to violate Air Force policy; that, as a uniformed \nofficer, he would carry out his orders in this regard. And we would \nexpect nothing less from him. But he did acknowledge, as the Air Force \nhas not, to my satisfaction, that there is a serious problem of \novercapacity, and that it calls for serious management solutions. And \nhe pledged himself to provide those solutions to the degree he could \nwithin the policy dictated by his civilian superiors.\n  The Air Force has refused, as I have indicated, to give us any \nnumbers. They have taken basically a trust me stance on this issue. \nGeneral Babbitt, on the contrary, agreed, when I told him that we would \nwant to see numbers, that he would make numbers available to the \nCongress. I said, ``General, as you proceed down this program of \nprivatization in place, surely you are going to get some financial \ninformation that will tell you whether you are or are not saving \nmoney.'' And the financial information out of the Air Force should be \navailable to us in Congress to compare with the analysis of the General \nAccounting Office. The Air Force, as I have said, Mr. President, has \nalways refused to give us those numbers in the past. General Babbitt \npledged that those numbers would be made available to Congress.\n  I consider this a significant act of good faith on the part of the \ngeneral, because, once we have those numbers in front of us in the \nCongress, we can appropriately deal with this issue. And, if we find \nthat the Air Force is correct, and they are saving the taxpayers \nhundreds of millions of dollars of privatization in place, and the \nGeneral Accounting Office is wrong, I will be the first to come to the \nfloor and congratulate the Air Force, because certainly I, like every \nother Senator, want to see to it that we save the taxpayers' money. \nBut, if we find that, once we have the real numbers, the Air Force is \nwrong and the General Accounting Office is right, then I will be the \nfirst to come to the floor and once again demand that the Air Force try \nto solve this problem more intelligently.\n  The Air Force told us essentially there will be no change in policy \nregardless of whatever Congress does, regardless of your interpretation \nof the BRCC rules, and regardless of Senator Cohen's analysis, \nSecretary Cohen will insist that there be no change.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to continue \nfor another 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. General Babbitt agreed that he would do whatever he \ncould within the constraints of the policy laid down by the Air Force \nto give us intelligent management of this problem. That is the first \nsign of cooperation that I have seen out of this administration since \nthis issue first arose.\n  So, Mr. President, because General Babbitt has made it clear, now \nthat we have had our hearings in the Armed Services Committee, we have \nhad our hearings in the Appropriations Committee, we have had our \nmeeting with the Secretary of the Air Force, and we have had our \nmeeting with him, that he will do what he can to address the issue \nwithin the constraints placed upon him by his civilian superiors to try \nto solve the problem, I am announcing my willingness to no longer \ninsist that his nomination be held up. The purposes for which I made \nthat insistence in the first place have been fulfilled. I will allow \nhim to go forward to his additional star and his command, and I look \nforward to staying in touch with him in the spirit of the pledges he \nmade to me and the other Senators this morning to see that this issue \nis properly resolved once and for all in the long term.\n\n  In sum, Mr. President, I am in no way backing down from my conviction\n\n[[Page S4430]]\n\nthat this administration is shamelessly playing politics on this issue \nand has involved the uniformed services in a way that is totally \ninappropriate. I do not wish to be accused of doing the same thing in \nresponse because my desire is to solve the problem. I am hoping the \nadministration will address it in the same spirit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks the \nadditional views of Senator William S. Cohen on S. 1673 be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [Excerpt From a Senate Report]\n\n        Additional Views of Senator William S. Cohen on S. 1673\n\n       The FY97 National Defense Authorization Senate Armed \n     Services Committee report includes a provision that changes \n     the allocation of maintenance workloads between the public \n     depots and the private sector from a 60/40 to a 50/50 split. \n     Like most compromises, it will probably not satisfy everyone \n     with an interest in this issue. I do not believe that the \n     depot maintenance issue should be addressed this year as a \n     result of the inability of the Department of Defense (DOD) to \n     articulate its depot policy and its failure to adequately \n     answer depot-related questions Congress requested in last \n     year's National Defense Authorization Act. It appears that \n     DOD is not interested in providing Congress with the data it \n     needs to make an informed decision.\n       There is a need to reform how the Pentagon operates. \n     Finding more efficient ways to support our war-fighters could \n     result in billions of dollars in savings that can be \n     transferred to support the modernization of our forces. DOD \n     has proposed three methods of savings to fund modernization--\n     procurement reform, base closings, and privatization. I am \n     highly skeptical about significant savings accruing from any \n     of these. The Congress has given DOD three revolutionary \n     procurement reform acts in the last two years which could \n     generate savings but I am fearful these may fail to achieve \n     the desired effects due to management inertia. Likewise, the \n     savings from BRAC may prove illusionary if the Administration \n     continues to come up with proposals which are designed not \n     for cost savings but to avoid the pain doled out in BRAC to \n     politically important communities.\n       With regard to privatization, I believe the Pentagon has a \n     misplaced sense of priorities. In the private sector, which \n     DOD claims to emulate, organizations most frequently contract \n     out for building management, fleet management, and \n     information technology to better focus on their ``core \n     competencies''. DOD has decided to turn this on its head by \n     first outsourcing core competencies--for example, maintaining \n     advanced weapon systems--while keeping most commercial \n     business processes in-house.\n       If we are truly going to maximize the benefits of the \n     commercial marketplace, I believe we should instead focus on \n     those areas where the private sector has chosen to outsource, \n     such as data processing, accounting, audit, transportation, \n     and inventory. But the Pentagon wants to continue to operate \n     its own data processing centers, develop its own software for \n     financial systems when it can buy them off-the-shelf, like \n     most private companies do, and manage its own inventory so \n     the taxpayer ends up spending $36 billion more on goods that \n     DOD does not need. And yet, the Pentagon wants to move \n     quickly to privatize depots that were slated for closure by \n     BRAC and further contribute to the excess capacity problem at \n     public depots that have served our country so well since \n     1799.\n       On the point of privatizing closing facilities, there also \n     seems to be a misunderstanding about the intent of the BRAC \n     and the closure of the Air Logistics Centers at Kelly AFB and \n     McClellan AFB. First, let there be no misunderstanding about \n     the fact that the BRAC decisions were made under the \n     assumption that 60 percent of the workload would go to public \n     depots. The need to change this ratio to accommodate the \n     Administration's plans to shift work to Kelly and McClellan \n     illustrates that what we are doing in this bill is a clear \n     circumvention of the BRAC process. To change the 60/40 \n     criteria as the Armed Service Committee has agreed to will \n     deteriorate critical warfighting capabilities, impede \n     investment in the public domain, and most likely require \n     further closures beyond what has been accomplished in BRAC.\n       The BRAC did not recommend or authorize ``privatization-in-\n     place'' at Kelly or McClellan. Indeed for those facilities \n     where the BRAC thought there was a unique capability that \n     could lend itself to privatization-in-place (such as those at \n     the Naval Air Warfare Center in Indianapolis or the Naval \n     Surface Warfare Center in Louisville), a recommendation was \n     made to that effect. The BRAC made no such identification or \n     recommendation for facilities at the Kelly or McClellan Air \n     Logistics Centers. Perhaps, it can be argued that the BRAC \n     made a mistake and that it did not adequately recognize the \n     unique potential of these two facilities. I would then argue \n     that the BRAC did not adequately recognize the unique \n     capabilities of Loring AFB in Presque Isle, Maine and I am \n     sure some of my colleagues could argue the same for \n     facilities in their states. The fact of the matter is that \n     the BRAC made a recommendation and the Congress and the \n     Administration accepted that recommendation with all of its \n     consequences for national security and the economic impact on \n     these communities.\n       Because of the implications of any change to 60/40 on \n     excess capacity and concerns over DOD's direction on the \n     privatization of defense depots, Congress asked the DOD to \n     prepare a depot policy report. If Congress agreed with this \n     policy, it would repeal the 60/40 rule. DOD ignored their \n     deadline and sent up a policy just four weeks ago. The report \n     did not meet the requirements that were outlined in last \n     year's National Defense Authorization Act and was rejected by \n     the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n       The Department of Defense's depot policy report was non-\n     responsive and it was clear from DOD's April 17th testimony \n     before the Senate Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee that \n     DOD's policy was not well developed or supported. DOD's \n     definition of core capability is so general that it is \n     virtually meaningless. The report did not address how new \n     weapons systems would be introduced in depots, or how public \n     depots would be kept cost-efficient. There was a complete \n     lack of detailed statistical data supporting the Pentagon's \n     policy decisions and no data on past depot maintenance \n     performance in which to support privatization decisions. In \n     addition, there were neither plans to assure effective \n     competition in a market where 76 percent of contracts are now \n     let on a sole-source basis, nor a risk assessment on how \n     plans for privatization-in-place would affect existing excess \n     capacity and overall maintenance costs.\n       With the move to 50/50, the Senate Armed Services Committee \n     is now saying DOD does not have a depot policy and Congress \n     does not have the data to adequately develop its own policy, \n     but we are going to repeal 60/40 anyway because it meets the \n     short-sighted political agenda of the day. By repealing 60/40 \n     at this time, we are rewarding DOD for not adequately \n     responding to a congressionally mandated requirement. DOD's \n     policy and the repeal of 60/40 were inextricably linked. to \n     reject DOD's policy as the Armed Services Committee has done, \n     is to reject DOD's call for a repeal of 60/40.\n       I do not believe we should give DOD any more flexibility in \n     this area until DOD establishes a coherent policy on depot \n     maintenance. It was apparent that this position was not \n     universally accepted by my colleague on the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee. When a compromise was offered to change \n     the mix to 50/50, I reluctantly accepted it as I felt this \n     was the best way to continue to maintain our nation's \n     investment in the unique capabilities the public depots \n     provide our armed forces in war and peace.\n       The committee report does provide some direction to require \n     DOD to develop a rational depot policy. The final Committee \n     agreement again asks DOD to report in detail on the \n     provisions where it has failed to adequately respond. The \n     committee directs DOD to provide answers to crucial questions \n     needed by Congress in order to support an informed decision \n     about maintaining a core logistics capability in the public \n     sector. Some of the questions include:\n       What workloads should be ``core'' in each service?\n       What procedures will be used to conduct public-private and \n     public-public competitions?\n       What is DOD's maintenance plan for new weapon system?\n       What level of organic work is necessary to provide \n     efficient capacity utilization of the public depots that \n     remain?\n       How does DOD plan to improve the productivity of the \n     remaining public depots?\n       What are the estimated savings that will result from \n     increased privatization?\n       This last question is crucial as DOD is proclaiming savings \n     from consolidating depots, but then plans to keep more excess \n     capacity with its policy of privatization-in-place. While DOD \n     risks future modernization on savings supposedly generated by \n     privatization of depot maintenance, these savings are \n     unproven. DOD's estimated savings of 20-30% from depot \n     privatization rely on past studies of the privatization of \n     commercial type functions in the government where there is \n     significant competition for contacts. This is in stark \n     contrast to the marketplace for depot maintenance activities. \n     In fact, the General Accounting Office found the Air Force is \n     implementing a privatization plan at facilities at the Newark \n     AFB that will most likely increase maintenance costs and not \n     save the taxpayer any money as promised.\n       I would have preferred to delay any decision on depot \n     maintenance until we secured all of the facts from DOD. \n     However, the Senate Armed Services Committee has agreed to a \n     compromise that I fully supported. Given the fact that the \n     committee report allows DOD to shift to 50/50 while not \n     obligating DOD to provide an adequate response to Congress, \n     my continued support is dependent on the degree to which DOD \n     satisfies the Committee's request for information on DOD's \n     depot policy between now and the conference with the House of \n     Representatives over the Fiscal Year '97 National Defense \n     Authorization bill. I look forward to the Chairman and \n     Ranking Member's letter directing DOD to provide this \n     information. The Senate Armed Services Committee rejected \n     DOD's proposed policy this year and is offering DOD another \n     opportunity to get it right. DOD does not plan to meet the \n     60/40 ceiling for several years, so I believe we have the \n     time to ensure that a coherent depot maintenance plan\n\n[[Page S4431]]\n\n     that will truly save taxpayer dollars and effectively meet \n     wartime surge requirements and readiness needs can be \n     properly developed and implemented.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

The clerk will report H.R. 1122.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1122) to amend title 18, United States Code, \n     to ban partial-birth abortions.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as I spoke last night, we are now moving \nto consideration of the partial-birth abortion ban that has passed the \nHouse of Representatives with a constitutional majority, more than two-\nthirds I should say, more than two-thirds majority in the House, which \nmeans, if there is a Presidential veto, we would be able to override it \nin the House. It now comes to the Senate where we have an assured \nmajority of the votes to be able to pass this legislation. The question \nreally is whether we are going to have 67 votes necessary to do it. So \nwe commence the debate today. I am hopeful, now that this bill has 42 \ncosponsors, we will have a spirited debate with many people \nparticipating, adding their thoughts on this subject.\n  I have a unanimous-consent request first. I ask unanimous consent \nthat Donna Joy Watts be allowed access to the Senate gallery. This is \nan exception to the Senate regulations governing access to the gallery \nbecause Ms. Watts is not yet 6 years of age.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I would like to ask my \ncolleague for what purpose does he wish--how old is the child?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Five and a half.\n  Mrs. BOXER. A 5\\1/2\\-year-old child to be in the gallery during this \ndebate?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. She is very interested in this subject. I will discuss \nher case, and she would like to hear the debate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am going to object on the basis of my being a \ngrandmother, and I think that it is rather exploitive to have a child \npresent in the gallery at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I do not think we are off to a very good \nstart on this debate. I was hopeful that the Senator from California \nwould continue to try to assure the comity that is usually accorded \nMembers when it comes to these kinds of situations. I know that that \nunfortunate incident occurred a few weeks ago with a unanimous-consent \nrequest. I would hate to see that this kind of occurrence becomes a \nnormal course.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We have coarsened the comity of this place to the point \nwhere someone sitting in the gallery, who is literally months away from \nthe age that has been set by the Senate rules, who has a particular \ninterest in this piece of legislation would not be accorded the decency \nof being able to at least observe. But I respect the Senator's right to \ndo what she wants to do, and she certainly is within her rights to do \nit. I think it is unfortunate that a young girl who has had as close to \na personal encounter with this issue as possible and still be here to \ntalk about it is not able to listen to a procedure to protect others \nfrom what she was threatened with. And that is certainly within the \ndiscretion of the Senator from California.\n\n  I will proceed with my opening statement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much. I just want the Senator to understand \nthat this is nothing to do with a lack of comity. It is my deep belief, \nin my heart, that this is a very emotional debate. People can watch it \nhere. They can watch it on television. I just, really, in my heart \nbelieve this--and I would not do it otherwise. It has nothing to do \nwith comity--that given the fact that you have expressed here, I think \nI am acting in the best interests of that child.\n  That is my opinion. You have a different one. It is just some \ncolleagues, some moms and dads, and in my case a grandmother, who has a \ndifferent view of it. I ask the Senator to respect that, just as I \nrespect his view.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I can, I find myself almost incredulous, to believe \nthat you are--in arguing, as I know you have in the past, and other \nMembers have, that we have no right here in the U.S. Senate to dictate \nwhat other parents should be able to do with their children with \nrespect to whether they should be able to abort them or not. But when a \nmother seeks to share with her daughter, mother and father, share with \nher daughter some information that is important to her in a very \nprofound way and that you are going to stand up, as a Member of the \nU.S. Senate, and suggest that you know what is better for her daughter \nthan she does, I think is rather troubling. But again, it is your right \nas a Senator to object to these things. I respect that right. I just \ndon't happen to agree with the characterization that allowing their \ndaughter the opportunity to witness something that is very important to \nall of their lives is in any way exploiting her. But that is--your \nobjection is so noted.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important as we start this debate that \nwe understand what we are debating, that is partial-birth abortion. So \nI am going to explain what a partial-birth abortion is, when it is \nused, who it is used on, and why it is used.\n  There has been a lot of talk about this procedure and the facts \naround the procedure. We have seen in recent months how some of the \nfacts in fact did not turn out to be facts, particularly things that \nwere used and said by Members here on this Senate floor as to what \npartial-birth abortion was all about, when it was used, who it was used \non, why it was used. So this debate unfortunately a year ago was \nshrouded in a cloak of inaccuracies. In this debate, as much as many of \nus tried to articulate what we knew to be the facts, we were countered \nwith arguments that in fact have turned out not to be true. So I am \nhopeful that with this new information having been brought to light, \nthat the facts as we now know them--and I cannot attest, because some \nof the facts have been provided by the abortion industry themselves, \nwho are opposed to this bill, so I cannot verify the information we \nhave been given is in fact accurate. All I can verify is that they have \nadmitted to at least this. But what we do know is that those set of \nfacts that they now admit to are different than what they were saying \nbefore, and different in a material enough way that Members who relied \non that information last time, if they rely on the different set of \nfacts this time, can come to a different conclusion.\n  That happened in the House of Representatives. Several Members who \nvoted against the partial-birth abortion ban based on a set of facts as \nthey knew them provided by the abortion industry, when those facts were \nshown to be inaccurate, changed their position in light of those, that \nnew information, and supported the legislation and supported it to such \na degree that it passed with over 290 votes, which is the necessary \nvote to override the Presidential veto.\n\n[[Page S4432]]\n\n  So, let us look at what partial-birth abortion is. By the way, the \ndrawings that I am going to use are drawings that were copied--derived \nfrom drawings that Dr. Haskell, who was the inventor of this procedure, \nhad. Dr. Haskell, by the way, is not an obstetrician and gynecologist--\npeople whose business it is to deliver babies. Dr. Haskell is a family \npractitioner who does abortions, and he invented this procedure. This \nprocedure is not in any medical textbook. This procedure is not taught \nin any medical school. This procedure has not been peer reviewed. In \nother words, no other doctors have looked at this to see whether this \nis safe and healthy and a proper procedure. It has not been recognized \nas a legitimate procedure. But he has invented this thing, this \nmonstrosity, and he wrote a paper on it. From the description and from \nthe pictures in that paper we reproduced this, these drawings.\n  Dr. Haskell, when asked about these particular drawings, the ones you \nare going to see, said they were accurate, from a technical point of \nview. So any comments that these drawings are somewhat of a fabrication \nor whatever does not hold water.\n  I also suggest when you see the drawings of the baby in these \npictures, the drawing of the baby in these pictures is a drawing of a \n20-24 week gestation baby. It is not a big baby or has not been blown \nup to look like it is more life size than it is. It is the exact size. \nIf you look at the size of the baby relative to the size of the \ndoctors' hands, which is the way you can judge size, you can see a baby \nat that gestation which is when most of the partial-birth abortions are \nperformed. In fact, it is at the low end of when they are performed \nbecause they are performed in the fifth and sixth month, and this is \nfifth month. So, it is the small end of when these abortions are \nperformed.\n\n  This is a 3-day procedure. You are going to hear about life of the \nmother, health of the mother, we need to do some things to protect the \nlife and health of the mother. This is a 3-day procedure. The mother is \ngiven drugs the first 2 days to dilate her cervix, to open her womb so \nthe doctor can then reach in as you see here to grab the baby. I would \njust ask this question, and you don't have to be a doctor to answer it. \nIf a woman presents herself to a physician in a life-threatening \nsituation, would anyone do a 3-day procedure? Second, if the woman \npresented herself in a health-threatening situation, would any doctor \ndo a procedure that says: Take these pills, come back tomorrow; take \nthese pills that are going to dilate your cervix, open your womb up to \ninfection, which is in fact a risk, and call back?\n  So, when you hear these, ``we have to keep this legal because there \nmay be some circumstance,'' let me assure you--and I will have a quote \nthat I will share with you--there is never a case, there is never a \ncase where this procedure has to be performed to protect the life or \nhealth of the mother. Period. Having said that, the bill still provides \nfor a life-of-the-mother exception. So I would just want Members to \nunderstand that this procedure is a 3-day procedure. It is done on an \noutpatient basis. When the mother presents herself in the third day--\nand this was the reason Dr. Haskell developed this, was so he could \nbring her in, the dilation of the cervix would be done, and simply he \nwould perform the procedure. He wouldn't have to wait and have her in \nthe clinic and do these other procedures which are done in 1 day. So \nthis is done for the convenience of the doctor, the abortionist, not \nfor the health of the mother, not for the safety of the baby or anybody \nelse, because you are going to kill the baby. Now you understand why it \nis done.\n  Guided by an ultrasound, the abortionist grabs the baby with forceps \nby the feet or leg. Babies at this time, generally they move around, \nbut they are generally in a head-down position. So the doctor has to \nreach around, grab the baby by the foot, turn the baby around inside \nthe womb, inside the amniotic sack.\n  Second, they then grab the baby's leg and pull it breach. For those \nof you who are not physicians--I think there is only one physician in \nthe Senate, the Senator from Tennessee--a breach birth, as any mother \nor parents know, is a very dangerous occurrence, when a child is \ndelivered breach. To deliberately turn a baby and deliver the baby \nbreach is a risk unto itself. But they deliberately turn this baby and \nthen they pull the baby by the leg out of the uterus, out through the \ncervix to where the baby is delivered, the entire body except for the \nhead. So you have a baby, now, that is outside the uterus with the \nexception of the head and, as nurse Brenda Shafer said when she \nwitnessed this procedure, the baby's arms and legs were moving.\n  You might ask, why are they doing this? Why are they delivering this \nbaby in this fashion? Why do they not just take the baby that is head \ndown and just deliver the baby head first and then do what I am going \nto describe next to the baby? Why don't they do that?\n  The reason they don't deliver the baby out and kill the baby is \nbecause once the head exits the mother, it is considered a live birth \nand has protection. So, if you delivered it in a normal fashion and the \nbaby's head were out and the rest of the body were in, you couldn't \nkill the baby. The only reason you do this is so it is easier to kill \nthe baby and it is then legal to kill the baby--at least it is if we do \nnot pass this law.\n  So just understand the difference here is a matter of which end comes \nout first. If the head came out first you can't touch that baby. It is \na live birth, protected under the Constitution. Unfortunately, its feet \nare not protected by the Constitution nor its leg nor its trunk--just \nits head. At least that is what the courts have said.\n  So now we have this little baby that is outside the mother and a \ndoctor takes some scissors and jams it right here, right in the back of \nthe base of the skull, that soft baby's skull. You know, those of you \nwho have children, how soft that skill is. And they thrust the scissors \ninto the base of the skull.\n  Nurse Brenda Shafer described what the baby did in the partial-birth \nabortion that she saw. She said the baby's arms and legs flew out, like \nwhen you are holding a baby and you drop it and it goes like this. It \njust doesn't know what to do, it just sort of shoots its legs out, that \nnervous--nerve reaction. She said it shot its legs out, its arms and \nleg--for those who believe that the baby doesn't feel anything. And \nthen they went limp.\n  To finish the procedure the doctor takes a suction tube, a high-\npressure suction catheter, inserts it in the baby's skull, and suctions \nthe brains out of the baby. That causes the head to collapse, and then \nthe baby is delivered.\n\n  This is what we are trying to ban. Nothing else; nothing else. This \nis what we are trying to ban. I cannot help but think, as I look around \nand see the statues of the Vice Presidents of the United States that \nring the Senate Chamber, that if we had been on the Senate floor 30 \nyears ago, 50 years ago, 100 years ago and talked about this as \nsomething that was legal in America, we would have had 100 percent of \nthe U.S. Senate saying, ``Why is this bill even here? This is obviously \nsomething that is so barbaric that we cannot allow to have happen.''\n  But, unfortunately, we have reached the point in our country where \nthis is defensible. This is defensible, treating a little baby like \nthis, a fully formed little baby, not a blob of protoplasm, not a \ntissue that many would like to believe, this is a baby fully formed, \nand in many cases viable, that we treat like this, that we murder like \nthis. Let's call it what it is. And we are saying in this country, it's \nOK.\n  Now, if we did this procedure, if you would take these graphics out \nand leave some of the definitions out there, if we did this procedure \nof jamming scissors in the base of the skull and suctioning out the \nbrains on someone who had raped and murdered 30 people, the Supreme \nCourt and every Member of this Senate would say, ``You can't do that, \nyou can't do that, that's cruel and inhumane punishment.'' Oh, but if \nyou are a little baby, if you haven't hurt anybody, if you are nestled \nup in your mother's womb, warm and safe--supposedly safe--we can do \nthat to you. In fact, it is our right, it is my right that I can do \nthat.\n  The thing about this debate that is probably the most important \nthing--and you will hear rights, you will hear rights, my right to do \nthis, my right to do that, it's my body, I can do whatever I want, I \ncan kill this baby, it's my baby. Rights. Well, in this case, we are \nhaving an abortion debate on the\n\n[[Page S4433]]\n\nfloor of the U.S. Senate where you cannot miss the other side of this \ndebate. You cannot miss the baby in a partial-birth abortion. It is not \nhidden from view anymore. It is not the dirty little secret we tell \nourselves to survive, to live with ourselves that we allow this kind of \nmurder to occur in this country.\n  We cannot hide anymore from the truth of what is happening out there. \nWe cannot lie to ourselves that this is not what we are doing. In fact, \nRon Fitzsimmons said, the person who blew the whistle on the abortion \nindustry, we have to face up to the fact that abortion is killing a \nliving being. Let's face up to it. If you want to defend it, defend it, \nbut defend it on what it is: It is killing a little baby who hasn't \nhurt anybody, who just wants a chance like all of us to live.\n  One of the great ironies that struck me as I walked on the floor \ntoday--I walked on the floor and I passed the Senator from Vermont, the \nSenator from Tennessee, and the Senator from Iowa, who had been so \ninstrumental in the bill that we just passed on the Senate floor. Do \nyou know what bill we just passed on the Senate floor? The Individuals \nWith Disabilities Education Act. Individuals with disabilities.\n  The principal reason that the people who oppose this ban use for \ndefending this procedure is, You know, a lot of these children have \ndeformities. They might have Down's syndrome or they might not have any \narms or legs or they might not even live long, they might have \nhydrocephaly, they might have all these maladies. And that, of course, \nis a good reason to kill them. That is the argument. That was the \nargument that was made over and over and over again, that fetal \nabnormality is a good reason --in fact, the courts, unfortunately, have \nlegitimized this reason saying it is a legitimate reason to do a third-\ntrimester abortion.\n  I just found it absolutely chilling that a Member could stand up here \nand rightfully, passionately argue that children are all God's children \nand perfect in his eyes, and while they may not be perfect, they \ndeserve the dignity of being given the opportunity to maximize their \nhuman potential. That is what IDEA is all about, the ability to protect \ntheir civil rights to maximize their human potential--except to be born \nin the first place. Because some of the most passionate defenders of \nIDEA, some of the most passionate defenders of ADA, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, say it is OK to kill a baby because it is not \nperfect, any time in a pregnancy--any time in a pregnancy--by using \nthis, the most barbaric of measures.\n  We are going to educate you if you make it, if you survive this. If \nyou survive, if you are lucky enough that your mother loves you enough \nto give you a chance at life, then we will protect you, but you are on \nyour own until then; you are on your own; we're not going to protect \nyou. You don't deserve protection.\n  Abraham Lincoln, quoting Scripture, said that a house divided against \nitself cannot stand. I just ask every Member who proudly stands and \nsupports the disabled among us how you can then stand and allow this to \nhappen to those very same children and say that you care? The ultimate \ncompassion here is at least giving them a chance to live. I guarantee \nyou that if you gave a lot of disabled people the choice of whether \nthey would rather be educated or live, it is a pretty easy call. But \nsomehow or another, that is lost here. Well, it is not lost on me, and \nI don't think it is lost on the American public. You cannot \nlegitimately argue both ways. So this is the debate.\n\n  You will hear a lot about health exceptions--and I want to address \nthat issue right up front--that we need this procedure to be legal \nbecause there might be instances in which the life and health of a \nmother are in danger and this procedure would have to be done. I am \ngoing to put a quote up from a group of close to 500 physicians, almost \nall of whom are obstetricians, people in the field:\n\n       While it may become necessary--\n\n  This is a quote from a letter--\n\n       While it may become necessary, in the second or third \n     trimester, to end a pregnancy in order to protect the \n     mother's life or health, abortion is never required.\n\n  I want to repeat that:\n\n       . . . abortion is never required--i.e., it is never \n     medically necessary, in order to preserve a woman's life, \n     health or future fertility, to deliberately kill an unborn \n     child in the second or third trimester, and certainly not by \n     mostly delivering the child before putting him or her to \n     death. What is required--\n\n  And this is important--\n\n       What is required in the circumstances specified by Senator \n     Daschle is separation of the child from the mother, not the \n     death of the child.\n\n  What do they mean by that? Sometimes you might have to induce and \ndeliver the baby. Sometimes you may have to do a cesarean section to \ndeliver the baby. But you never have to kill the baby in order to \nprotect the mother's life. You can at least give the baby a chance. \nGive him or her a chance. If it is not viable, then he will not live or \nshe will not live very long, but you have at least dignified one of our \nhuman beings, one of us, your son, your daughter.\n  I just suggest to any mother or father that if you found out that \nyour child was going to die, had a particular virulent form of cancer \nand the child was 5 years old and the child, according to the doctors, \nwould almost certainly not live more than a few weeks, would you, would \nany parent in America say, ``Well, my child's going to die, I might as \nwell kill them now''? Would any parent deliberately kill their child \nbecause they may not live long? Or, worse yet, would they kill their \nchild because they were in a car accident and lost a leg? Or were in a \ncar accident and are going to be in a wheelchair the rest of their \nlives and maybe has brain damage and does not have a whole lot of \nmental capacity, but some, or even none, would you deliberately kill \nyour child? And in doing so, would you do the procedure that I \nsuggested? Would you puncture their skull and suck their brains out? \nWould you do that?\n  Well, if you would not do that for a 5-year-old son or daughter, why \nwould you do it to a 5-month-old son or daughter? Why? You don't have \nto.\n  If there is any message, whether this bill passes or not--I say \npasses, becomes law--that is so important, but it is so important for \npeople to understand that you don't have to kill the baby. You don't \nhave to do that. I know. There is always a more dignified way to treat \nanother human being than to deliberately kill them.\n  So the debate will rage on this afternoon, but just remember these \nfacts--facts: Partial-birth abortion is never necessary to protect the \nlife or health of the mother. Fact: It is never medically indicated. It \nis not an accepted procedure.\n  It is rare, according to the abortion industry. It is only 3,000 to \n5,000 a year, as if that's OK, only killing 3,000 to 5,000 children a \nyear and that is not very many. I guess against 1.4 million or so, it \nis not many, but can you imagine what we would do in the U.S. Senate if \nwe knew 3,000 children were going to die this year and we could stop \nit? What lengths would we go? What lengths would we go for 1,000? What \nlengths would we go for one? I don't know anymore. I wonder whether we \ncan muster up the moral courage to stand up to the powerful lobbies out \nthere and do the right thing.\n  This procedure does not have to be there for any reason--no reason \nother than for the convenience of the doctor doing the abortion. This \nprocedure is not done at major medical facilities. This procedure is \ndone at abortion clinics, period, and, in most cases, not even by--at \nleast the people who developed it were not even obstetricians.\n  So I hope that we can have a debate on the facts. Because on the \nfacts, if you look at the facts, there is no reason for this procedure \nto be legal--none. And if you look at the heart, what kind of message \nare we sending out to the young people all over the country?\n  You know, we have debates here on the floor, and we have committee \nmeetings even to talk about juvenile crime, talk about generation X and \nhow they have no respect for our institutions or even each other, that \nthey think everybody is in it for themselves. The cynicism is so \nrampant.\n  If you want to know why that occurs, tune in to this debate. Children \nare not oblivious to what is going on in this country when it comes to \nthe issue of abortion. Ask why a child should be any more concerned \nabout shooting their neighbor if Members of the U.S. Senate and the \nPresident of the United States says we can kill a little baby.\n\n[[Page S4434]]\n\nWhat is the difference? There is no difference. We are going to have \nall sorts of problems with this future generation. I hear all the time, \n``Oh, they have no values. They don't have any direction. They don't \nhave any purpose. They are so self-centered.'' Gee, I wonder why.\n  What is more self-centered than what I have just described? We are \nsending a message. A message is being received. And 1.5 million \nabortions is a very loud message to everybody in our country, \nparticularly the young, the impressionable. And we wonder why, we \nwonder what the problem is.\n  We can begin to send a positive message today. We can begin to say, \nyou know, there are rights and wrongs--not just rights--rights and \nwrongs. And this is wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  When my colleague from Pennsylvania started this debate, he asked \nthat a 5\\1/2\\-year-old be allowed in the gallery, that the Senate rules \nbe waived. And then he went on--and I am quoting very much from his \ntext--he went on to talk about what he believes that a medical \nprocedure, which he has called a barbaric act, a procedure that doctors \ntell us is used to save the life of the woman, to spare her irreparable \nharm--and he calls that a ``murderous act''--his words. He used the \nterm over and over about ``killing a baby.'' He ascribed it to the \nPresident of the United States. He wanted a 5\\1/2\\-year-old to hear \nthat.\n  He said, you will hear words like ``rights,'' and then he quoted \nwomen, and he said, ``I can kill this baby.'' Is that what he thinks \nwomen want to do? And he wants a 5\\1/2\\-year-old to hear that?\n  Talk about messages that we are sending out, this is the greatest \ncountry in the world. We ought to approach these issues as a family, \nnot turn one group against another, one gender against another.\n  Mr. President, this is the third time we are having this debate. And \nevery time it is more painful than the one before. And the reason it is \nso painful is because the basic assumption of the Santorum bill is that \nwomen do not deserve the full range of medical options available to \nthem in order to have a safe and legal abortion.\n  I know that every Senator in this U.S. Senate who calls himself or \nherself pro-choice believes, as the President of the United States \nbelieves, that abortion must be safe, legal, and rare.\n  Mr. President, I truly believe--and I will explain it in the body of \nmy statement--that what the Santorum bill is really about is outlawing \none procedure, and then they will go after the next procedure, and then \nthey will go after the next and the next. And that will be the way \nabortion is made illegal in this country at any stage.\n  Mr. President, that is not the view of the American people. They \nbelieve very strongly that Government does not belong in this debate.\n  Mr. President, the Santorum bill prohibits the use of a specific \nabortion procedure, the intact dilation and extraction regardless of \nthe medical needs of the woman. But some doctors consider that \nprocedure the safest for the women. I am not saying that every doctor \nsays that; I am saying many, many doctors believe that. And yet, the \nSantorum bill would outlaw this procedure.\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an \norganization representing more than 37,000 physicians stated that an \nintact dilation and extraction ``may be the best or most appropriate \nprocedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the \nhealth of a woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the \npatient, based upon the woman's particular circumstances, can make this \ndecision.''\n  That is 37,000 doctors who are trained in obstetrics and gynecology.\n  Doctor Charles Bradley, medical director of Planned Parenthood in \nSanta Barbara, CA, wrote to me and said:\n\n       The intact dilation and extraction procedure presents \n     several advantages over the other techniques available for \n     late-term abortion. Foremost among these, the procedure is \n     short and the risk of damage to the mother's tissues and, \n     therefore, the risk to her life and health is considerably \n     reduced.\n\n  Dr. Seymour Romney, chair of the Society for Physicians for \nReproductive Choice and Health sent me a letter. And he wrote:\n\n       In complicated and some potentially tragic obstetrical \n     situations, intact dilation and extraction can be the safest \n     therapeutic procedure. In competent hands, it carries the \n     least risk of bleeding, perforation, infection or trauma to \n     the birth canal.\n\n  So this is a procedure that many doctors say is the safest, and yet \nthe Santorum bill would outlaw it.\n  Mr. President, this is not a perfect world. If we could make it so, \nevery child would be planned, every child would be wanted, every \npregnancy would be uncomplicated, every fetus would be viable, would be \nhealthy, every father would be proud to take responsibility, every \nmother would be physically and mentally healthy, there would be no rape \nor no incest. That is the world we should strive for. That is the world \nwe want.\n  But, Mr. President, we are not there. This is not a perfect world. \nFamilies must make tough choices, and sometimes must decide, of course, \nto take, when things go tragically wrong--we must not pass reckless \nlegislation which moves politicians into the hospital rooms where we do \nnot belong. Mr. President, we do not belong in a hospital room.\n  We have laws in this land. We have court decisions in this land. And \nthe laws relating to pregnancies are set. And they say, as follows: \nBefore viability in the early stages of a pregnancy, a woman gets to \ndecide, with her family and her doctor and with her God, what her \noptions are. It is her choice. It is not Senator Boxer's choice. It is \nnot Senator Santorum's choice. It is not Senator Helms' choice. It is \nnot Senator Feinstein's choice. It is her choice. She will make this \ndecision with her family, with her loving family, with her doctor. She \ndecides. And that is it. And that is what the law says. And it was \ndecided in 1973, in a previability situation, a woman has the right to \nchoose.\n  There are those in this Chamber who want Government to enter this \ndebate and stop that constitutionally protected right. And to do that \nthey need a constitutional amendment. And for many years now they have \nnot tried that because the American people do not support it. So they \nwill go to procedures one at a time. They will do what it takes so in \nessence this constitutionally protected right will become meaningless \nto the women of this country.\n  How does the Santorum bill, endorsed by the antichoice groups in this \ncountry, treat a woman in the early stages of her pregnancy where, \nunder law, it is her constitutional right to decide?\n  The Santorum bill says to the doctor that a particular procedure \ncalled intact dilation and extraction--and as Senator Santorum has \ngiven it a name of his own, partial-birth abortion, which is in no \nmedical dictionary--that procedure is banned at any time. Any time in \nthe pregnancy, before viability or after viability, it would be banned. \nAnd we know right off the bat that outlawing procedures in the \npreviability stage of pregnancy before the fetus can live outside the \nwomb, with or without life support, is a clear violation of Roe versus \nWade, on which the constitutional right to choose is based.\n  So let us be clear. The Santorum bill infringes on a woman's right to \nchoose in the earliest stages of her pregnancy and is clearly \nunconstitutional and against the law of the land.\n  In the late term what do the laws say? Postviability, the court \ndecisions say that the Government does have a legitimate interest and \ncan legislate, can legislate postviability, but with a caveat. And that \nis, that always the health of the woman and the life of the woman must \nbe considered.\n  Let me repeat. Postviability, the Government can act to regulate \nabortion, but always the health of the woman and her life must always \nbe protected.\n  What does the Santorum bill do in the late term? It outlaws the \nprocedure and fails to give a health exception. My colleagues, this is \ndangerous. There is no health exception in the Santorum bill. And that \nis callous toward the women of this country.\n  Court cases have always ruled that any laws passed regarding \nabortion--\n\n[[Page S4435]]\n\nand there are many of these in the States; and my colleague, Senator \nFeinstein, has become a real expert on studying what the States have \ndone--they always make an exception for the health of the woman. And \nthis U.S. Senate, under this bill, would be so radical as to not \naddress the health of a woman.\n  This is very troubling to me, Mr. President. And I believe it shows a \nlack of concern for the women of this country, many of whom want their \nstories told.\n  In the interest of time, I am not going to go into all the stories \nthat I have, but I am going to talk about one. And perhaps in the \ndebate later on I will give you the other stories, because we must put \na face on this issue.\n  This is Coreen Costello with her family. She happens to be a \nregistered Republican. She describes herself as very conservative. And \nshe is very clear that she and her family do not believe in abortion.\n  In March 1995, when she was 7 months pregnant--actually this is a \nphotograph of her when she was pregnant--she was 7 months pregnant with \nher third child, and she had premature contractions and was rushed to \nthe emergency room.\n  She discovered through an ultrasound that there was something \nseriously wrong with her baby. The baby, named Katherine Grace--she \nnamed her baby Katherine Grace while she was carrying her baby--had a \nlethal neurological disorder and had been unable to move inside \nCoreen's womb for almost 2 full months. The movements Coreen had been \nfeeling were not that of a healthy, kicking baby. They were nothing \nmore than fluid which had puddled in Coreen's uterus. The baby had not \nmoved for a long time--not her eyelids, not her tongue. The baby's \nchest cavity was unable to rise or fall. As a result of this, her lungs \nwere never stretched to prepare them for air. Her lungs and chest were \nleft severely underdeveloped to the point of almost nonexistence. Her \nvital organs were atrophied.\n  The doctors told Coreen and her husband the baby was not going to \nsurvive, and they recommended termination of the pregnancy. To Coreen \nand Jim Costello, termination of the pregnancy was not an option. \nCoreen wanted to go into labor naturally. She wanted the baby born on \nGod's time and did not want to interfere.\n  The Costello's spent 2 weeks going from expert to expert. They \nconsidered many options, but every option brought severe risks. They \nconsidered inducing labor, but they would be told it would be \nimpossible due to the baby's position and the fact that the baby's head \nwas so swollen with fluid it was already larger than that of a full-\nterm baby. They considered a cesarean section, but the doctors were \nadamant that the risk to her health and her life were too great. Coreen \nsaid, ``There was no reason to risk leaving my two children motherless \nif there was no hope of saving Katherine Grace.''\n  These are the women my colleague stands and talks about as wanting to \nkill their babies? I am ashamed of that. It is unnecessary to talk \nabout the mothers of America, the women of America in such a fashion.\n  Coreen and her husband faced a tragedy that most people, thank God, \nnever have to face. In the end, they made a decision which saved \nCoreen's life. She underwent a late-term abortion.\n  In December of last year, I showed you this picture of Coreen and her \nfamily, and I reminded you at the time of this photo, Coreen was \npregnant with Katherine Grace. Now I want to show another picture of \nthe Costello family. Here is Coreen and her family with their newest \naddition, her son, Tucker.\n  Coreen writes that she is against abortion. She is a registered \nRepublican. She says she is a conservative. She writes to us, ``This \nwould not have been possible without this procedure. Please give other \nwomen and their families a chance. Let us deal with our tragedies \nwithout any unnecessary interference from our Government.'' She writes, \n``Leave us with our God, our families and our trusted medical \nexperts.''\n  Now, that is one story. To me, it just says it all, that this \nSantorum bill, if it became the law of the land, could have resulted in \nthis woman dying or being impaired or losing her fertility. We stand \nhere and talk as if the mothers of this country, the women of this \ncountry, want to end these pregnancies, when, in fact, these women--\nagain, I have many of these stories which I will tell tomorrow, story \nafter story--the last thing they wanted was to end the pregnancy. They \nwanted these babies.\n  Mr. President, I want to put the face of these women into the debate. \nI know those who wish to ban this procedure want the face of the woman \ngone. I want to show you what the New York Times quotes Ralph Reed, the \nhead of the Christian Coalition, as saying in a March 23, 1997 article. \nThis appeared:\n\n       ``Mr. Reed said that by focusing on the grizzly procedure \n     itself--and on the potential viability of a fetus--abortion \n     foes undercut the primacy of the woman and made her secondary \n     to the fetus.''\n\n  In other words, what Mr. Reed is quoted as saying, in what I consider \nto be an unguarded moment, is the reason he was so excited about this \ndebate is that for the first time, the woman was made secondary to the \nfetus.\n  Those who are pushing this bill want us to forget about the women. As \nRalph Reed is quoted as having said, to forget about our daughters, our \nsisters, our nieces. They want us to forget about them.\n  Why, the Senator from Pennsylvania, in his opening remarks, portrayed \nwomen as killers. His words: ``I have a right to kill this baby,'' as \nif that is what a woman wants to do.\n  If they succeed in outlawing this procedure, they will go to the next \nand the next, as I have said. With all due respect to my colleagues on \nthe other side of this debate, they are very good at getting votes and \nthey are very good at winning elections. But I do not think they are \nworth a whit in the gynecological operating room. I do not want them in \nthat operating room telling a doctor what procedure to use for my \ndaughter or my niece or, frankly, even for their daughter or their \nniece.\n  If a loved one--and I ask all Americans to think about this. Think \nabout it, think of a woman in your life of child-bearing age. Think of \nthat woman, be it your wife, be it your aunt, be it your sister, be it \nyour niece, be it your daughter, be it your granddaughter, think of \nthat woman, have that woman in front of your face, and think if that \nwoman was in trouble with a pregnancy gone tragically wrong like \nCoreen's pregnancy. I will put her and her family's picture back up. \nSuppose you found out that she was carrying a fetus whose brain was \ngrowing outside the head, where the doctor has said to you the baby \nwould live but a few moments, maybe, and in torture, and that your \nloved one, if this particular procedure were not used, because many \nhave said it is, in fact, the safest, might suffer irreparable harm, \nirreparable harm, never to be able to have a child again, maybe could \nbe blinded, maybe could be paralyzed. In your heart of hearts, you \nwould not want Senators making that decision. You would want the \ndecision to be made by the medical experts, the best in the world.\n  I do not want that doctor afraid at that moment that he or she might \nbe hauled off to jail if he acted to help a family to spare a woman's \nlife or health. I do not want that loved one in despair, pain, and \ngrief to be told that her openings were narrowed because her doctor was \nafraid to do what he or she really thought had to be done to save her \nfertility or to save her life or to save her health.\n  Who decides? Senator Santorum? I hope not. Who decides? Senator \nBoxer? I hope not. I know politicians have big egos, but we are not \ndoctors. We can show drawings done by a doctor, but that does not \nqualify us. Where is the humility around here? Why do we not just do \nour job? I think every woman in this country deserves a free range of \noptions when she is in deep, deep trouble.\n  Mr. President, Senators Feinstein, Moseley-Braun, and I have a bill \nthat I believe is the most humane and the most sensible and the most \nconstitutional of those that will be before the Senate. It zeros in on \nthe timeframe that concerns most Americans, and that is the late term \nof a pregnancy, after viability, and is consistent with Roe versus \nWade, which says the Government has an interest after viability. Our \nbill outlaws all post-viability abortions--all procedures, not just \none. The Santorum bill does not do that. It zeros in on one procedure. \nWe say after the\n\n[[Page S4436]]\n\nfetus is viable, no abortion, no procedure except to protect the \nwoman's life or to spare her serious adverse health consequences.\n  Life and health are constitutional requirements, and it is the right \nthing to do for the women of this country. Mr. President, if we abandon \nthe principle that a woman's health and life must always be considered \nwhen an abortion is considered, we are harming women, plain and simple, \nwomen like Coreen Costello and the other women that I will talk about.\n  Mr. President, the day we start passing laws that harm half of our \npopulation--women are more than half of our population--the day we \nstart passing laws that harm more than half of our population is the \nday I will worry about the future of this, the greatest country in the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, I just celebrated my second Mother's Day as a \ngrandmother, and my daughter celebrated her second Mother's Day as a \nmom. This is the greatest thing for our family. And everyone who always \nsaid to me, ``When you are a grandmother, you will see how great it \nis,'' including Senator Feinstein, who told me that years ago, I \nthought, well, maybe they are exaggerating. You know what? They are \nnot. To see your baby have a baby, to get the continuity of life is an \nextraordinary feeling.\n  I happen to believe as I watch my daughter be a great mother that \nAmerica's moms deserve to be honored every day. We just celebrated \nMother's Day. They deserve to be honored every day.\n  Senator Byrd came down right before Mother's Day and talked about the \nincredible job that our moms are doing, working moms, supermoms, \nworking hard so that families have the resources to educate their \nchildren, to give their children the American dream. It is hard for me \nto imagine why we would want to pass legislation that will harm women.\n  Now, it is interesting to me, in the Santorum bill, this procedure is \noutlawed. As a matter of fact, the Senator from Pennsylvania called it \na barbaric act, and yet in his own bill he says, ``The procedure can be \nused when it is necessary to save the life of the mother'' if you can't \nfind another medical procedure.\n  So, first, he says it is barbaric. And then he admits in his \nlegislation that it may be necessary to save the life of the mother.\n  So what is this really all about? It is about banning one procedure \nand then the next and then the next. Women as moms and future moms \nshould not be put at risk because the big arm of Government wants to \nreach further into their private medical and family physician.\n  We can pass a bill that respects women and their families, that is \ncaring and trusting toward American moms and future moms while \nprotecting a baby in the post-viability stage of pregnancy. We can pass \na bill that is consistent with Roe.\n  That is what the Feinstein-Boxer-Moseley-Braun bill is about. This \nbill should not be about what the New York Times article quotes Ralph \nReed as saying, which reveals, I think, a real malice toward the women \nof this country--that a woman should be secondary to a fetus. This \nshould not be about mothers versus fetuses. This should be about all of \nus together as a society passing laws that help our families cope with \ntragedy and urgency in a way that is moral and in a way that is \nrespectful of everyone involved.\n  So this is a painful debate, Mr. President, but my intent is clear. I \nwill not allow the fate of the woman to be lost in this debate. I will \ntell story after story after story about the Coreen Costellos of our \nNation who are loving, caring moms, many of whom would never have an \nabortion at any stage unless they were told they had to have one to \nspare their life or to preserve their fertility so they can be alive \nfor their families, for their other children.\n  I will do all I can to spare families long-lasting, horrible pain \nthat I think would come about as a result of the Santorum bill putting \nSenators into a hospital room and making decisions they are not \nqualified to make. I think this bill will cause pain to innocent, \ncaring, and loving families in the name of sparing pain. It is a first \nstep toward making all abortions illegal.\n  If you ask those who are on the floor and if you study their record, \nyou will see they are on record as wanting to ban all abortions from \nthe first second.\n  So, Mr. President, although this is a very painful debate for all of \nus, I will be here throughout this debate. I will work with my \ncolleagues to put the fate of the woman on this debate, to never let \nanyone forget what we are doing if we pass this bill, which is to hurt \nAmerican families. That is my deep belief.\n  If you are really about making sure that there is no abortion post-\nviability in the late term, you have the Daschle proposal that deals \nwith it, and you have the Feinstein-Boxer-Moseley-Braun proposal. If \nyou really want to do something about what Americans care about, that \nis what you should do. But don't go to a procedure which you say is \nbarbaric, but then you allow it in the case of a woman's life, ban that \nand tell the American people you are doing something about the late \nterm which, in fact, you are not when, in fact, what you are doing is \ninterfering with medical treatment of women who--all of these women--\nare put in tragic circumstances where they could have lost their life \nor their health.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise once again to support the ban on \nthe procedure known as partial-birth abortions.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot in the last year or two about this \nprocedure. We have heard the graphic details, the details which are \ncertainly not very pleasant. But we know that they are true. They are \nindisputable. We know exactly what this ``procedure'' consists of. \nSenator Santorum earlier this afternoon very graphically described it. \nIt is unconscionable.\n  Mr President, the public reaction to disclosure about this \n``procedure''--the disclosure of what partial-birth abortion really \nis--has been loud and convincing. There is a good reason for this. Yes, \nthis procedure is barbaric. There is simply no other way to describe \nit.\n  Many people have asked the question. Why? Why does it take place? Why \nis it done? Why do they do this procedure? Is it really necessary?'' \nThen the question is, ``Why do we as a people allow this to happen?''\n  The opponents of this measure argue that it is medically necessary. \nMr. President, this is simply not true. This is not a valid argument, \nwhen you have probably the single most respected physician in this \ncountry, Dr. C. Everett Koop, who says exactly the opposite. Dr. Koop \nin an interview with the American Medical News on March 3 of this year \nsays: ``In no way can I twist my mind to see that the late-term \nabortion as described . . . partial birth, and then destruction of an \nunborn child before the head is born--is a medical necessity for the \nmother.''\n  Mr. President, America's most respected physician is not alone in \nthis view.\n  Dr. Nancy Romer, chairman of OB-GYN and professor at Wright State \nUniversity Medical School in Ohio says: ``This procedure is currently \nnot an accepted medical procedure. A search of medical literature \nreveals no mention of this procedure, and there is no critically \nevaluated or peer review journal that describes this procedure. There \nis currently no peer review or accountability of this procedure. It is \ncurrently being performed by a physician with no obstetric training in \nan outpatient facility behind closed doors and no peer review.''\n  Dr. Romer also says, Mr. President: ``There is no medical evidence \nthat a partial-birth abortion procedure is safer or necessary to \nprovide comprehensive health care to women.''\n  Let me stress, Mr. President, what the doctor said, ``no medical \nevidence''; none.\n  Just this week the American Medical Association also endorsed this \nview. This is what they say. They said there were no situations in \nwhich partial-birth abortion ``is the only appropriate procedure''; no \ncircumstances, Mr. President, where partial-birth abortion ``is the \nonly appropriate procedure.''\n  I think it is often instructive to look at what those who perform the \nabortions have to say. One of the most famous or infamous abortionists \nis Martin Haskell. He has admitted--this is uncontroverted; no one \ndisputes this--Dr. Haskell, who has performed hundreds of thousands of \nthese probably,\n\n[[Page S4437]]\n\nadmits that at least 80 percent of the partial-birth abortions he \nperformed are elective. And the late Dr. James McMahon, a person who \nperformed many abortions, says he performed nine of these partial-birth \nabortions because the baby had a cleft lip.\n  Let me repeat that. Nine were performed, according to Dr. James \nMcMahon, for no other reason than the baby had a cleft lip.\n  Medical necessity, Mr. President? Medical necessity? So much for \nmedical necessity.\n  Why then is this procedure performed? Is it because some of these \nfetuses are deformed?\n  Betty Friedan, in a televised debate, called such little babies \n``monsters''; ``monsters.'' She said it not once but twice.\n  Are we now in the business of killing people for being defective, Mr. \nPresident? My colleague from Pennsylvania has pointed out very \neloquently the irony of this argument, the fact that today--we tried \nearlier this week to protect people with handicaps, protect them in \nschool to make sure they had a full education, but at the same time \nabortions are being performed, partial-birth abortions are being \nperformed not for medical necessity but rather this child is somehow \nnot ``perfect,'' at least as we see perfection.\n  Are we now, Mr. President, in the business of killing people for \nbeing defective? I would submit that the world has gone down that path \nonce already in this blood-soaked 20th century. Are we really willing \nto go down that road again? Are we willing to go down that road again \nin this country that is based on the sanctity of human life, the \nsanctity of human rights? I hope not.\n  Mr. President, when the child which is subject to a partial-birth \nabortion exits the birth canal, once he or she is out, the child, of \ncourse, is protected by the U.S. Constitution. If the doctor performing \nthe abortion slips, sneezes, something happens, and as a result the \nchild's head exits the mother's body, then that doctor cannot legally \nkill that child.\n\n  Mr. President, do we as a nation really believe that those few inches \nbetween being inside the mother and being outside the mother, do we \nreally believe that defines the difference between a legitimate medical \nprocedure and barbaric murder? I hope and believe that we are better \nthan that, that even our jaded, contemporary public morality would \nrebel in calling this a legitimate medical procedure.\n  Mr. President, the defenders of this procedure used to try to change \nthe subject. They used to say that it rarely happens, so we shouldn't \nget all worked up about it.\n  Well, it is funny. You do not hear much of that argument anymore. The \nreason we do not hear that argument much anymore is because of the \nshocking confession made by a leader in the abortion rights movement. \nRon Fitzsimmons is the executive director of the National Coalition of \nAbortion Providers. In 1995, when the Senate was considering the \npartial-birth abortion bill, he was helping lead the fight against this \nvery bill. He went on ``Nightline'' to argue that the procedure ought \nto remain legal. At that time, he said the procedure was rare and was \nprimarily performed to save the lives or the fertility of the mothers.\n  You know, a funny thing happened after that. Apparently his \nconscience starting gnawing at him. He says now that he felt physically \nill about the lies he had told. He said to his wife the very next day, \n``I can't do this again.''\n  Meanwhile, President Clinton was using Mr. Fitzsimmons' false \nstatements to buttress his case for vetoing the partial-birth abortion \nbill that this Senate passed.\n  But a couple of months ago Mr. Fitzsimmons admitted that, in his own \nwords, he ``lied through his teeth.'' The facts, as he now publicly \nacknowledges them, are clear. Partial-birth abortion is not a rare \nprocedure. It happens tragically all the time. And it is not limited to \nmothers and fetuses who are in danger. It is performed on healthy \nwomen, it is performed on healthy babies--all the time.\n  Remember Dr. Haskell's quote that 80 percent of the abortions he \nperformed are elective.\n  Mr. President, it is true that everyone is entitled to his or her \nopinion. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But people are not \nentitled to their own facts.\n  Ruth Padawer of the Record newspaper in Bergen, NJ, reported last \nSeptember 15 that 1,500 of these partial-birth abortions happened in \none local clinic in 1 year.\n  Once you confront the reality of what partial-birth abortion really \nis, you realize that from a moral perspective one of these atrocities \nis as bad as 1,500, but let nobody say this procedure is somehow de \nminimis, that it does not happen often enough to deserve legal notice.\n  Let me now describe briefly some of the proposed amendments to this \nlegislation. I know we will have the opportunity later during this \ndebate to talk about this at length. Let me just for a moment talk \nabout several of the amendments at least as I now understand them.\n  Under the Boxer-Feinstein amendment, the exceptions swallow the rule. \nIt is the old trick. Make it sound good, but then put an exception in \nthere that, in reality, the way it really works as interpreted already \nby courts, the exception swallows up the entire rule and really makes \nthe bill, in this case the amendment, meaningless. Under the Bolton \nprecedent, the Bolton case, the ``health'' language clearly has \nunlimited meaning. So once the term ``health'' is in there, as \ninterpreted by the Court, it swallows up the entire amendment and makes \nit useless. It is determined by the existence of health circumstances \nas decided by the very same doctor who performs the abortion. That is \nwho does the decision. That is who makes the decision about the health \nunder the Boxer-Feinstein amendment. Clearly that exception renders the \nbill meaningless.\n  Furthermore, if this really is about maternal health, then why do we \nhave to kill the baby? Senator Santorum very eloquently talked about \nthis a few minutes ago. No doctor, no witness, no Senator has yet \noffered any evidence that tells us why, when the health of the mother \nis in danger, you have to kill the baby. Why? Why can't we, if it is \nthreatening the mother's health, deliver the baby and, if possible, \nsave it? Why does this child have to be killed?\n  Senator Santorum earlier read in part from this letter, the letter \nfrom the Physicians Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth. I want to read one of \nthe paragraphs because it addresses this very issue, and this is what \nthe doctors said:\n\n       As specialists in the care and management of high-risk \n     pregnancies complicated by maternal or fetal illness, we have \n     all treated women who during their pregnancies have faced the \n     conditions cited by Senator Daschle. We are gravely concerned \n     that the remarks by Senator Daschle and those who support the \n     continued use of partial-birth abortion may lead such women \n     to believe that they have no other choice but to abort their \n     children because of their conditions. While it may become \n     necessary, in the second or third trimester, to end a \n     pregnancy in order to protect the mother's life or health, \n     abortion is not required--i.e., it is never medically \n     necessary, in order to preserve the woman's life, health or \n     future fertility, to deliberately kill an unborn child in the \n     second or third trimester, and certainly not by mostly \n     delivering the child before putting him or her to death. What \n     is required in the circumstances specified by Senator Daschle \n     is separation of the child from the mother, not the death of \n     the child.\n\n  Why then can't we as a society, if the child is threatening the \nmother's health, deliver the child and, if possible, to try to save it? \nWhy does that child have to be killed? There is no medical answer for \nthat, there is no medical reason. But let me submit a reason that I \nthink is critically clear from the debate and, more importantly, from \nthe evidence and, more importantly, from the words of the doctors who \nperform these abortions. Why is it done? Why does the child have to be \nkilled? The child has to be killed because that is the goal. That is \nthe goal. That is what the doctor wants to do.\n  Now, Dr. Haskell, who has performed hundreds and hundreds and \nhundreds of these, has said as much. In an interview with the American \nMedical News, he said:\n\n       You could dilate further and deliver the baby alive, but \n     that's really not the point. The point is you are attempting \n     to do an abortion. And that's the goal of your work, is to \n     complete an abortion. Not to see how do I manipulate the \n     situation so that I get a live birth instead.\n\n  Dr. Haskell admits it. He admits what the goal is. He admits why it \nis done. Why can't we on the Senate floor?\n\n[[Page S4438]]\n\n  An abortion is legal in this country. I happen to be pro-life. But \nnothing says we have to allow this procedure simply because it allows \nthe doctor to speed up the procedure and move on to the next one. These \nare done for the doctor's convenience.\n  Let me specifically go back to the issue of the Daschle amendment, \nand again we will have the exact language in the Chamber, I am sure, \nand we will have the opportunity to more thoroughly debate this. Let me \naddress the third trimester ban that is proposed by this amendment. The \nreality is that the exceptions are simply too numerous and the way they \nwill be applied it will again swallow up the amendment.\n  The facts are that the vast majority of these partial-birth abortions \noccur in the fifth and sixth months. All the abortionist has to do \nunder this amendment is to certify that either the baby is not viable, \njust certify it, or that the abortion is medically necessary. The \nconditions are spelled out apparently in the amendment. In practice, \nthis means there will be no limit on the will of the abortionist. The \nsame person who will be certifying is the person such as Dr. Haskell \nwho has described why he performs this procedure. In practice, there \nwill be no limit to what the abortionist does. Our colleague, my friend \nfrom Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, has compared it--he does it better \nthan anybody I have heard--to passing an assault weapons ban and then \nentrusting gun dealers to decide what constitutes an assault weapon. \nWould anybody propose to do that? I think not.\n\n  Viability has also been proposed as a standard. I fail to see what \nviability has to do with whether this procedure should really be \npermitted. Whether it should be permitted is a question of humaneness \nor arguably a question of health. If one can show that the fetus \nthreatens maternal health and that abortion is the only way to save the \nmother's health, the opponents of the ban are still confronted with the \ninsufferable difficulty of proving this specific procedure, partial-\nbirth abortion, is the only way to accomplish that goal.\n  As Dr. Koop and Dr. Romer have testified, there is absolutely no way \nthe partial-birth supporters can meet that test because this procedure \nis never medically necessary. The proponents of partial-birth cannot \nhide behind a false claim of medical necessity. There is no medical \nnecessity. The evidence is abundantly clear.\n  Let us again, because I think it is so instructive, hear what Dr. \nMartin Haskell says, the abortionist who has performed so many of these \nabortions and who, frankly, has been so very candid about what he does \nand why he does it. Let us hear Dr. Haskell describe this procedure, \nagain a procedure that is not medically necessary. This is what he \nsays, not Mike DeWine, not Senator Santorum, not Senator Boxer. This is \nwhat Dr. Martin Haskell, who performs these abortions, has to say.\n\n       I just kept on doing D because that is what I was \n     comfortable with up until 24 weeks. But they were very tough. \n     Sometimes it was a 45-minute operation. I noticed that some \n     of the later D were very easy so I asked myself why can't \n     they all happen this way. You see the easy ones would have a \n     foot-length presentation, you'd reach up and grab the foot of \n     the fetus, pull the fetus down and the head would hang up and \n     then you would collapse the head and take it out. It was \n     easy.\n\n  It was easy, Mr. President, it was easy for Dr. Haskell. Dr. Haskell \ndoes not say it was easy for the mother. I suspect that he really does \nnot care. His goal is to perform abortions.\n  Under these proposed amendments, is Dr. Martin Haskell, a man who has \nsaid--you have heard what he had to say--is he the person we are going \nto trust to decide whether abortions are necessary? He has a production \nline going. Nothing is going to stop him from meeting his quota.\n  Dr. Haskell concludes, again quoting:\n\n       I would reach around trying to identify a lower extremity \n     blindly with the tip of my instrument. I'd get it right about \n     30-50 percent of the time. Then I said, ``Well, gee, if I \n     just put the ultrasound up there I could see it all and I \n     wouldn't have to feel around for it.'' I did that and, sure \n     enough, I found it 99 percent of the time. Kind of \n     serendipity.\n\n  Kind of serendipity, Mr. President.\n  Let me conclude. I believe we need to ask ourselves, what does our \ntoleration of this procedure as a country, as a people, say about us? \nWhat kind of a people are we? What kind of a nation are we? I think you \njudge a country not just by what it is for. I think you also judge a \ncountry and a people by what we are against, and we judge a country and \nthe people by what we tolerate. We tolerate a lot in this country, \nunfortunately. This is one thing that we should not have to tolerate. \nWhere do we draw the line? At what point do we finally stop saying, oh, \nI really don't like this, but it doesn't really matter to me so I will \nput up with it? It really doesn't affect me so I will put up with it.\n  At what point do we say, unless we stop this from happening, we \ncannot justly call ourselves a civilized nation. I think it is very \nclear what justice demands. That is why I strongly support this ban. \nThat is why I strongly support this bill to ban a truly barbaric \nprocedure.\n  I look forward to the opportunity as this debate continues to debate \nthe various amendments and talking about this bill further. At this \npoint I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it has often been said that one is a product of one's \nlife experiences. Because this is a bill about so-called partial-birth \nabortion, and because there is no medical definition of partial-birth \nabortion, and because most of us believe that what is being referred to \nis a procedure either called intact D or intact D that is not \nreflected in the bill--and because the bill affects more than just the \nthird trimester of a pregnancy but also goes into the second trimester, \nand because it carries with it criminal penalties, I want to share with \nthis body how I am a product of my life experiences with respect to \nabortion.\n  I well remember my early days. In college during the 1950's, abortion \nwas illegal, and I knew young women who were in trouble. I knew one who \ncommitted suicide. I knew others who passed the plate to those of us in \na dormitory--and this was Stanford University--to go to Mexico for an \nabortion.\n  Later in the 1960's, I spent 8 days a year for 5 years sentencing \nwomen in the State prison, and I sentenced abortionists because \nabortion was still illegal in California in the early 1960's. I \nremember these cases particularly well. I remember the crude \ninstruments used. I remember women who were horribly damaged by some of \nthese illegal abortions. I remember mortality as well. And I always \nthought maybe one day we will get past this and not have to go back to \nit.\n  What concerns me about this debate is that I see it as the opening \nwedge of a long march to take us back 30 years, back to the passing of \nthe plate at Stanford, back to the back-alley abortionists.\n  I will never forget one woman because abortion carried with it a \nmaximum sentence of 10 years in State prison at the time. I sentenced \nthis woman--I remember her name, I am not going to say it here--to the \nmaximum sentence because she had been in and out of the State \ninstitution. This was her third time. Every time she went out I asked \nher why she continued. She said, ``Because women were in such trouble \nand they had no other place to go, so they came to me because they knew \nI would take care of them.'' That was the reality of life from 1960 to \nat least 1966 in California. I do not want women, young women, to have \nto go back to those days again.\n\n  So basically I am pro-choice. I am also a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee of the Senate, so I have been present at all of the hearings \non this so-called partial birth abortion bill. Essentially, I believe \nthat abortion should be a matter for a woman, for her doctor, for her \nfaith, for medicine, and not for politicians. One of the most \nperplexing things in my life has always been why men are so desperate \nto control a woman's reproductive system.\n  Nonetheless, about 4\\1/2\\ years ago, I became a grandmother of a \nlittle girl who is the light of my life. Her birth was not \nuncomplicated. My daughter had a pregnancy-related condition. It was a \ncondition that women bleed to death from. You have, essentially, about \n20 minutes from the time you begin to hemorrhage before your life is \nextinguished, and that of the child.\n  This case of my daughter's is really only related to this whole \ndebate in\n\n[[Page S4439]]\n\nthat it caused me to really think. I never thought that my daughter \nwould be in a situation of this type. I began to think of the ``whens'' \nand ``ifs,'' and whether one could really predict all of the exigencies \nthat a woman in pregnancy is subject to. I could not with my own \ndaughter, because I never would have dreamt that this would have \nhappened. For her, she was a lucky one. Although at home I am a block \nand a half from the hospital, they would not let her stay with me. She \nstayed in the hospital right next to an operating theater, so that for \n2 months the baby grew in her womb, and then at 35 weeks she was able \nto have a C section. And we have a wonderful little granddaughter--\nbright eyed, bushy tailed--and the story came out OK.\n  But I came to a few conclusions. The conclusion is, no matter how \nall-seeing we think we are, no one can possibly know all of the \ncircumstances one may find themselves in. So, if we are going to pass \nlaws, laws need to be flexible enough to anticipate the circumstances \nand to provide for a worthy exception. I basically believe that this \nintact D, or intact D, whichever one chooses to call it, is a \nprocedure that should not be used. That is my basic belief and I think \nthe AMA is beginning to come to grips with this and set down some \nprecepts, as to when one should consider a late-term abortion.\n  I believe that abortions post-viability should not take place except \nin the rarest of circumstances. And that the only case for a post-\nviability abortion is either to protect the life and health of the \nmother or in cases where there is such a serious, severe fetal \nabnormality that the abnormality is inconsistent with life. In other \nwords, the child could not survive outside of the womb for any period \nof time.\n  So, with my colleagues, Senator Boxer and Senator Moseley-Braun, we \nwill offer a substitute at the appropriate time to the Santorum bill \nand one that will also be a substitute to the Daschle bill. Our bill \nwill have the following provisions:\n  It will prohibit all abortions after viability in a way that will \nmeet the test of constitutionality. The provision for life and health \nof the mother does just that.\n  The health requirement is drawn to correspond with the mandate of Roe \nversus Wade, to prevent serious adverse health consequences to the \nmother and not to restrict the judgment of the physician.\n  Additionally, the goal is to provide for post-viability abortions \nonly in cases of serious fetal anomalies--or abnormalities incompatible \nwith life.\n  The penalties of the bill will be civil but substantial. They will be \nlimited to the physician. The penalty for the first violation will be \nup to $100,000, along with referral to a State licensing board for \npossible suspension of the license. For a second offense, a fine up to \n$250,000 and referral to a State licensing board for possible \nrevocation of the license. Unlike the Daschle substitute, we would not \nwithhold Medicaid funds. But we would allow the State to, essentially, \nregister its will.\n\n  I am very much persuaded by the fact that some 41 States have already \npassed legislation limiting late-term abortions. In Arizona, no \nabortion may be performed after viability; in Arkansas, same thing; in \nConnecticut, no abortion may be performed after viability; and on and \non.\n  So I, for one, have a very hard time understanding why it is \nnecessary for the Federal Government to get involved in this area at \nthis time. But, if we do, I think we ought to do it in a way that does \nnot limit the doctor, that prohibits post-viability abortions, and \ncontains an exception that accounts for those rare cases when the fetus \nhas a severe abnormality that is not consistent with human life.\n  So, we would offer this as a substitute for that offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, and as a substitute to the \nDaschle legislation as well.\n  I would like to illustrate the ways in which this bill that the three \nof us would offer would differ from that of the Senator from \nPennsylvania. Most profoundly, our legislation would fully comport with \nthe Supreme Court's landmark decision, Roe versus Wade, which affirms a \nwoman's constitutional right to choose whether or not to have an \nabortion. According to Roe, in the first 12 to 15 weeks of pregnancy, \nwhen 95.5 percent of all abortions occur, that procedure is medically \nthe safest. The Government cannot, under Roe, place an undue burden on \na woman's right to have an abortion.\n  In the second trimester, when the procedure in some situations \nprovides a greater health risk, abortion may be regulated but only to \nprotect the health of the mother. This might mean, for example, \nrequiring that an abortion be performed in a hospital or performed by a \nlicensed physician.\n  In the later stages of pregnancy, at the point the fetus becomes \nviable and able to live independently from the mother, Roe recognizes \nthe strong interest in protecting potential human life. On that basis, \nabortions can be prohibited, except in cases where the abortion is \nnecessary to protect the life and health of the woman. The life or the \nhealth of the woman. Thus, Roe strikes a delicate balance in protecting \nthe fetus as well as the mother.\n  Our bill will fully comport with Roe. It applies only to post-\nviability abortions, not pre-viability abortions. And it contains \nexceptions to protect the health as well as life of the mother.\n  In my humble opinion, the bill before us now, presented by the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, is unconstitutional and it \nrepresents a direct challenge to Roe. It provides no exception for \ncases where the banned procedure may be necessary to protect a woman's \nhealth. It ignores the viability line established in Roe and reaffirmed \nin Casey. Although the term ``partial-birth abortion'' is not a \nmedically recognized term, the bill's focus on a particular procedure \nmeans that this procedure will be banned even if performed pre-\nviability, during the second trimester. Roe does not permit abortions \nto be banned prior to viability. That is the constitutional framework \nhere.\n  I think the proponents of this bill know well the challenges to Roe \nthat this legislation presents. The magnitude of this bill is enormous \nfor the long-term preservation of safe and legal abortion in this \ncountry. The Santorum bill would have an immediate and direct effect on \nthe lives of women facing tragic and health-threatening circumstances, \neven in the second trimester of pregnancy. The bill also holds a doctor \ncriminally liable unless he or she can prove that the banned procedure \nwas the only one that would have saved the woman's life. Not the \nwoman's health, but the woman's life.\n  The vagueness of the term ``partial-birth abortion'' makes the use of \ncriminal penalties particularly troublesome. Doctors will not \nnecessarily know when they are violating the law, since no precise \nprocedure is referred to in the law.\n  During last year's hearing before the Judiciary Committee, none of \nour medical experts who testified had heard of the term partial-birth \nabortion. Since then, of course, times have changed. But none could \npoint to a medical text that used the term.\n  Georgetown law professor, Michael Seidman, stated in hearings last \nyear:\n  If I were a lawyer advising a physician who performed abortions, I \nwould tell him to stop because there is just no way to tell whether the \nprocedure will eventuate in some portion of the fetus entering the \nbirth canal before the fetus is technically dead, much less being able \nto demonstrate that after the fact.\n  This is the catch-22 in the bill of the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania. It can be applied to much more than just the procedure we \nthink is at hand. The use of criminal penalties in conjunction with a \nvague term such as ``partial-birth abortion'' is likely to make the \nSantorum bill unconstitutionally vague and, therefore, unenforceable.\n  Our bill, instead, provides civil penalties for any post-viability \nabortion performed without sufficient medical justification. I believe \nthat these civil penalties will effectively deter any physician who \nwould perform a post-viability abortion for anything other than the \nmost serious reasons.\n  Women's health, I think, should be of great importance to this body, \nand I would also hope that every woman in the United States would want \na Congress to legislate based on what we thought would help their \nhealth, rather than create situations which would\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\ndeny them the opportunity prevent long-term damage to their physical \nhealth.\n  Late in certain types of highly troubled pregnancies, there are only \nlimited options available to physicians, and I would like to give some \nexamples of rare medical conditions that could necessitate a post-\nviability procedure for which there are no other alternatives \navailable.\n  One example would be a fetus that has a greatly enlarged \nhydrocephalic head, three times the normal size, the cranium filled \nwith fluid. The head is so large the woman physically cannot deliver \nit. Labor is impossible because the fetus cannot get through the birth \ncanal. A caesarean may well be impossible for medical reasons.\n  Let me give you an actual case, the case of Viki Wilson. She stated:\n\n       Then I had a final ultrasound at 36 weeks, just 4 weeks \n     from my due date, and the world came crashing down around us. \n     Our child was diagnosed with encephalocoele. Most of her \n     brain had grown outside her head, and what did form was \n     abnormal. Abigail could not survive outside the womb, and she \n     was already suffering from seizures. At first I said, let's \n     do a C-section, let's get her out of there! My doctor said, \n     sadly, ``Viki, we do C-sections to save babies. I can't save \n     Abigail, and I can't justify the risks of a C-section to your \n     health when you are going to lose your daughter no matter \n     what.'' So even though my medical training--\n\n  And this woman was a nurse--\n\n     told us that there was no hope, my husband and I went to \n     several specialists in the desperate belief that there was \n     someone out there with a magic wand who would say, ``I can \n     help save your daughter.'' No one did, no one could. Finally, \n     we made a decision, based entirely on love, to end the \n     pregnancy.\n\n  This is one of those situations that no one knows beforehand that \nthey may be in.\n  There is also a case of a rigid fetus caused by arthrogryposis. This \nkind of fetus cannot move through the birth canal. It risks rupturing \nthe woman's cervix. With prolonged intense pushing, the mother's heart \nis placed at risk.\n  Other health conditions can prevent a woman from being able to \ntolerate the stress of labor or surgery. They include cardiac problems \nlike congestive heart failure, severe kidney disease, renal shutdown, \nsevere hypertension, and so on.\n  In fact, it is certain health-related concerns that has caused me to \npart ways with Senator Daschle's approach. In many regards, the bill \nwhich we are introducing is similar to Senator Daschle's in several \nrespects, but in one it is different.\n  We are alike in that both bills would limit all forms of post-\nviability abortions. The principal difference is the health exception. \nOur bill would allow third trimester abortions only in cases where the \nlife of the mother is at issue or where an abortion is necessary to \navert serious adverse health consequences to the mother. The Daschle \nbill, as I understand it, would allow an exception only in cases where \ncontinuation of the pregnancy would risk grievous injury to the \nmother's physical health. Grievous injury is defined as a seriously \ndebilitating disease or impairment specifically caused by the pregnancy \nor an inability to provide necessary treatment for a life-threatening \ncondition.\n  I believe that the Daschle substitute would not allow the abortion \nprocedure for certain serious conditions that, although they are not \ncaused by the pregnancy, are exacerbated by the pregnancy. I believe \nthe limiting language of this bill could foreclose a doctor's option in \ncertain situations that cannot be anticipated, and that is my concern. \nWho knows what situation one may be in or if the situation may not \narise until labor or delivery?\n  For example, one House witness testified that her baby had a brain \nimproperly formed, pressured by a backup of fluid, a greatly enlarged \nhead, a malformed and failing heart, a malfunctioning liver, and a \ndangerously low amount of amniotic fluid. A physician, we believe, \nneeds the latitude to deal with these complex emergency situations as \nthey are trained to do.\n  I also believe it is important to understand, and I hope if I am \nwrong that the Senator will correct me, that the Daschle substitute \nmakes no provision for a severely malformed fetus incompatible with \nlife, if that baby can be delivered in a live condition even for a \nmatter of minutes or days.\n  Roe simply states if the State is interested in protecting fetal life \nafter viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that \nperiod, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of \nthe mother.\n  I think that is a very important constitutional mandate, that any \nbill passed here in the next day or so must meet the test of \nconstitutionality.\n  So we will, at an appropriate time, present a bill that we hope will \nmeet this test.\n  Let me just end by saying that everything that I have read, \neverything that I have seen indicates that post-viability abortions are \nextremely rare, and that the vast majority, over 99 percent of \nabortions, are performed very early in pregnancy. The latest data that \nwe have from the Guttmacher Institute, whose figures are relied upon by \nthe Centers for Disease Control, indicates that 99 percent of all \nabortions are performed before 20 weeks of gestation; 90 percent are \nperformed within the first 12 weeks; and less than 1 percent are \nperformed after 20 weeks. Only four-hundredths of 1 percent performed \nafter 20 weeks are performed during the third trimester. So this means \nthere is a total of about 400 to 600 abortions performed annually \nduring the third trimester of pregnancy.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, 98.9 percent of all \nabortions are performed by the simple curettage procedure, which simply \ninvolves the scraping of the interior of the uterus.\n  So any way you view it, we are looking at a very small number of \ncases. I guess my plea is for those circumstances which cannot be \nanticipated, for circumstances where the mother's life and health truly \nare at risk and--as I learned firsthand with my own daughter--nobody \nreally understands or can have a looking glass to indicate what those \ncircumstances may be.\n  As I said, I basically believe that the intact D or intact D, \nwhatever one may choose, should not be used. I am hopeful that the \nmedical profession will take that view, and I believe that there are \nongoing discussions on that subject.\n  But I believe that when we pass legislation that affects every single \nwoman in the United States who can possibly be at issue in this case, \nthat to pass a piece of legislation which would mandate that a \nseriously abnormal fetus, unable over time to sustain life outside the \nwomb, would have to be delivered regardless of the health impacts on \nthe mother, is not a piece of legislation that I, in good conscience, \ncan support. So, Madam President, at the appropriate time, Senators \nBoxer, Moseley-Braun, and I will present a substitute amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Madam President. I will just say in response \nto the Senators from California, I just need to reiterate what we \nstated earlier, and Senator DeWine read earlier, that there is no \nhealth reason where this is the only option. AMA said that today. They \ncame out with a report saying that today. The American College of \nGynecologists and Obstetricians have said so.\n  This is not going to limit anybody's access to abortion if that is \nwhat they choose to do. It eliminates a procedure, a procedure, as I \nsaid before, that is not medically recognized, it is not in the \nliterature, it is not peer reviewed, it is not taught anywhere in any \nmedical school. It eliminates a procedure which many of us believe, and \nI believe the vast majority of the American public believes, goes too \nfar, is too brutal, is outside the realm of what we should allow in a \ncivilized society.\n  So I keep hearing the concerns that, ``Well, maybe there's something \nout there, maybe there's a case out there that this is necessary.'' I \nknow that the Senator from California started with the case of Viki \nWilson and talked about one of those instances being the case of \nhydrocephaly. I am going to talk about a case of hydrocephaly. I am \ngoing to talk about a case where a mother involved with a little baby \nin her womb, diagnosed with hydrocephaly, was confronted with the very \nsame problems that Viki Wilson was confronted with, the very same \nchallenges Viki Wilson was confronted with, the very same challenges \nthat not just Viki Wilson or Laurie Watts\n\n[[Page S4441]]\n\nwere confronted with, but, unfortunately, lots of mothers and fathers \nare confronted with.\n\n  I suggest that there is a different way, that there are other \noptions, options that are much more fulfilling, more decent, more \nhuman, more humane than the option of a partial-birth abortion.\n  We hear so much talk about the people who came to the White House and \nstood with the President. The Senator from California, Senator Boxer, \nis very fond of putting up charts of individual families that have gone \nthrough this very difficult time. I have often talked about the \nmillions of children who die because of abortion, and the thousands of \nabortions of partial-birth abortion. But somehow or another, that does \nnot seem to lock on, at least with the media or, in some respects, even \nwith the American public. It reminds me of what Joseph Stalin once \nsaid. He said:\n\n       A single death is a tragedy--a million deaths is a \n     statistic.\n\n  I think for far too often, we have been arguing statistics here, \nabout the numbers of millions of children, and maybe, oddly, we can \nlearn something from Joseph Stalin.\n  So today I am going to talk about what could have been a single \ntragedy, what could very well have been a Viki Wilson, what could have \nbeen a whole host of other mothers and fathers who are confronted with \nthis terrible dilemma of having a child who just might not survive.\n  Let me tell you the story about Donna Joy Watts and Lori and Donny \nWatts. The Watts live in Green Castle, PA. They did not always live \nthere. They lived, until just a month or so ago, in western Maryland.\n  Seven months into her third pregnancy, Lori Watts learned that her \nchild would not be normal, that there was a problem. A sonogram showed \nthat her child had a condition known as hydrocephalus, the same \ncondition that the Senator from California has just described with one \nof the cases the President points to as the reason for keeping this \nprocedure legal. Hydrocephaly is an excessive amount of cerebral fluid \nin the skull, also known as water on the brain.\n  Lori's obstetrician said, after the sonogram was done, that he was \ngoing to refer her to a genetics counselor. I could talk for a long \ntime about genetics counselors. But I think this story sums up, \nunfortunately, what far too many genetics counselors do.\n  Lori Watts phoned the clinic to ask directions and what they planned \nto do. The staff member told her that most hydrocephalic fetuses do not \ncarry to term so that she should terminate her pregnancy. When she \nasked, how could you do an abortion so late in pregnancy at 7 months, \nshe was told that the doctor could use a skull-collapsing technique \nthat we refer to as partial-birth abortion.\n  Donny Watts demanded to know why they had been referred to a facility \nthat counsels for abortion when talking to his obstetrician, whom he \ncalled. And the obstetrician said, ``Well, you know, there are doctors \nthere who didn't encourage abortion. I thought you would talk to them, \nand you talked to the wrong person.''\n  It is amazing--but not amazing--that you can call a clinic, and \ndepending on who you talk to is what kind of advice you are going to \nget as to whether to terminate your pregnancy or not. But I am, \nfrankly, pleased that at least there are some counselors who will \nsuggest other alternatives. Far too many do not in cases as severe as \nwas confronting the Watts family.\n  In that conversation with their obstetrician, he advised the Watts to \nsee a specialist in high-risk obstetrics. I can say that in \nconversations with the Watts, they were amazed at the attitude of the \npeople they confronted.\n  The obstetrician, the original obstetrician, said that he could not \ntake care of the baby anymore; it was too complicated. So they went and \nasked doctors at Johns Hopkins. They said they--well, they would not \neven see them. All they wanted to do was an abortion. They would not \ndeliver the baby.\n  Then she went to Union Memorial Hospital, same thing. You hear so \nmuch talk about, well, we cannot get availability for abortions. How \nabout availability for delivery?\n  She finally went to the University of Maryland Hospital in Baltimore. \nThey were very quick to dismiss her also. They said the baby's chances \nfor survival were nil, that she would be ``a burden, a heartache, and a \nsorrow.''\n  Where have we come in this country where we have so little respect \nfor the little children among us who just may not be perfect, that they \ncan be disposed of, that you can look into the eyes of a mother who \ndesperately wants her child and tell her, ``It would just be a burden \nto you''?\n  I do not know of any child that is not at times a burden. Children \nare joys and struggles. I mean, that is just part of life. If you are \nnot ready to have some burdens with your children, then you better not \nget pregnant in the first place and try to have children.\n  Where have we arrived?\n  She went through four separate occasions. They were discouraging her \neven from delivering her child, as desperately as she wanted to do so, \nnot unlike what Viki Wilson ran into.\n  Lori Watts did not give up. Lori Watts finally found somebody who \nwould do it, someone who was not going to say that it was a burden, a \nheartache, or a sorrow, or as the other doctors said, ``If you didn't \nabort, you would be jeopardizing your own fertility, your own health.''\n  So after all that treatment, they finally found someone who would do \nit.\n  In the process of the care, prior to the delivery, they found out \nthat the fetus had occipital meningo-encephalocele, which is exactly \nagain what Viki Wilson had. Part of the brain was developing outside of \nthe skull.\n  There was an article from today's Washington Times, on page 2, about \nthe Watts family. In that article, Mrs. Watts is quoted saying at this \ntime in her life that ``everyone on the other side talks about choice, \nbut they didn't want to give us a choice. They said they would not \ndeliver her.''\n  Imagine, people wonder how far we have gone. People wonder how we can \nbe debating partial-birth abortion on the floor of the U.S. Senate and \nhave people get up and argue that it should be legal.\n\n  Listen to this. They would not even deliver her at four places--four \nplaces. They did finally find someone who would deliver the baby at the \nUniversity of Maryland Hospital. They delivered through a cesarean \nsection. The Watts' third daughter, Donna Joy--Donna, named after her \ndad, Donny; Joy, for obvious reasons--was born on November 26, 1991.\n  Yes, she was born with a lot of problems, a lot of serious problems. \nBut let me describe to you what they had to confront now after they \nfought and did not give up to give their daughter a chance. Donna Joy \nwas born with hydrocephaly.\n  That is a picture of her shortly after her birth.\n  For 3 days--for 3 days--they refused to drain the water off her \nbrain. They said she was going to die, and so they refused to put a \nshunt in and drain the water. For 3 days they hydrated her, gave her \nfluids, but they did not feed her because they said she was going to \ndie.\n  Mrs. Watts said in this article, ``The doctors wouldn't operate on \nher to save her life. I just about had to threaten one of the doctors \nphysically. And I was seconds from throwing him against the wall. She \nwas already born and they were still calling her a fetus.''\n  But Lori and Donny Watts did not give up. They did not cave in to \nwhat our culture around sick babies is any more, and they fought on. \nThey had the surgery performed. They began the feeding. Initially, she \nfed the baby with breast milk in a sterilized eyedropper. Then, at 2 \nweeks of age, the shunt that was put in failed, and Donna Joy was \nreadmitted to the hospital.\n  A tray of food was delivered by mistake to her room. It had some \ncereal and bananas and some baby formula on it. And so Lori decided \nthat she would mix this together to form a paste, put it in an \neyedropper, and place a drop in the back of Donna's tongue.\n  You see, Donna Joy was born with about 30 percent of her brain. Donna \nJoy was born without a functioning medulla oblongata, with a deformed \nbrain stem. She had no control over her sphincter muscle, so things \nthat were given to her would come straight back up. There was nothing \nto hold the food in her stomach. So Mrs. Watts came up with the idea of \ngetting something that was heavy, pasty, and putting it way back. And \nit worked.\n\n[[Page S4442]]\n\n  You want to talk about a burden and a joy? For the next several \nmonths, they had to feed Donna Joy that way. It took an hour and a half \nto feed their daughter; an hour-and-a-half break and then an hour-and-\na-half feeding, 24 hours a day. She had to fight. She had to fight.\n  Four months later, a CT scan revealed she also suffered from lobar-\nhaloprosencephaly, a condition that results in the incomplete cleavage \nof the brain.\n  She also suffered from epilepsy, a sleep disorder, and continuing \ndigestive complications. The neurologist suggested that ``We may have \nto consider a gastronomy tube [a gastronomic tube] in order to maintain \nher nutrition and physical growth.''\n  She was suffering from apnea, a condition which spontaneously stops \nbreathing.\n  At 18 months, Donna Joy had another brush with death. She contracted \nencephalitis, which is the inflammation of the brain. So a little girl, \nwith 30 percent of her brain, who has to take medicine so she does not \nhave seizures, hit with another problem of encephalitis.\n  As a result of high temperature--she had a 106 temperature--it was a \nbig setback. Up until that time, she was developing along, using sign \nlanguage. She was not talking, but she was communicating. That \ntemperature wiped out, that encephalitis wiped out her memory. She \ncould not walk or talk. She was laying in bed having all sorts of \ndifficulty, could not focus on anybody, and had deteriorated \nsubstantially.\n\n  Then a miracle. Lori would tape shows late at night and put them on \nto give some diversion for Donna Joy to direct her attention. Nothing \nseemed to work, until one day a television show came on, a tape of a \ntelevision show called Quantum Leap. The star of the show, Scott Bakula \nsings a song ``Somewhere in the Night.''\n  Upon hearing that song, she reacted as follows, according to the \nnewspaper: ``The child stopped crying. Mrs. Watts rewound the piece and \nplayed it again. This time Donna sat up and tried crawling toward the \ntelevision. The more she watched Quantum Leap the more Donna improved. \nShe would only eat and drink when the TV character was on the screen. \nJust before she turned 2, she took her first steps toward Scott Bakula \non the TV set.''\n  At 2 years, Donna Joy had already undergone eight brain operations, \nmost of which occurred at the University of Maryland hospital. Finally, \nthey received news about Donna Joy's prospects. The neurologist who \nexamined her after her seizure in 1996 noted that at 4\\1/2\\ years of \nage Donna Joy could speak, walk, and handle objects fairly well. He \nalso thanked a colleague for ``the kind approval for the follow-up in \nallowing me to reassess this beautiful young child who is, remarkably, \ndoing very well in spite of significant malformation of the brain.''\n  Today, the story of Donna Joy Watts has inspired many, many people. \nShe can do a lot in spite of her disabilities. She has cerebral palsy, \nepilepsy, tunnel vision, and Arnold-Chiari Type II malformation, which \nprevented development of her medulla oblongota. She walks, runs, plays. \nIn fact, she was in my office most of the afternoon playing with my \nchildren. I know she has very good dexterity because we have Hershey \nkisses and Three Musketeer bars in the front of the office, and she can \nunwrap them as fast as any 5-year-old I have seen.\n  Prior to Donna Joy moving to Pennsylvania, the Governor of Maryland, \nParris Glendenning, honored her with a Certificate of Courage \ncommemorating her fifth birthday. The mayor of Hagerstown, MD, Steve \nSager, proclaimed her birthday Donna Joy Watts Day. Members of the \nScott Bakula fan club sent donations and Christmas presents for the \nWatts children. People from all over the world who learned about Donna \nJoy on the Internet have been moved to write and send gifts. Perhaps \nthe most important is that the Watts' determination has inspired a \nDenver couple to fight for their little boy who was born with similar \ncircumstances.\n  I asked the Watts if there are other children whom they know who have \nsurvived and done this well. Mrs. Watts looked back at me and said, \n``Other children with this condition are aborted. We don't know. We \ndon't know.'' We don't know the power of the human brain. I hear the \nstory all the time about how you do not use all your brain. Well, I \nguess you do not need it all to be a functioning human being in our \nworld. She is very functional.\n  There is a lot of talk that we need to have the abortions, \nparticularly in the case of hydroencephaly to prevent future \ninfertility. In June 1995, Lori and Donny Watts welcomed another child, \nShaylah, into the family. Mrs. Watts looked at me very proudly and \nsaid, ``On the first try.''\n  I had the opportunity to walk over here with Donna Joy, hold her \nhand, ride the subway with her, go up the escalator, which was a big \ntreat, and come up and be in the Senate gallery for only a brief time. \nShe is now back in my office. I encourage anybody who would like to \nmeet her, any one of my colleagues, I encourage all of them to go and \ntalk to the Watts family and to look into the eyes of this little girl, \nthis little girl who could have died through a partial-birth abortion. \nYou want a face on partial-birth abortions? All of the faces are not \nhere to be seen. They die. Brutal. This is the little girl who was \nsaved from partial-birth abortion at 5\\1/2\\ years of age.\n  I will read the end of Tony Snow's article about this situation of \nthe Watts. Lori and her husband, both children of steelworkers, had to \novercome the contempt of snobbish doctors and social workers as they \npainstakingly built their own miracle. They never got any help from \nfeminists, liberal Democrats or the President. These days, Don works \nthe 4 p.m.-to-midnight shift in the local corrections facilities so he \ncan spend time with his four kids. Lori educates them in the evening \nwhile he is gone. Unfortunately, they went bankrupt a couple years ago \nand have moved to Pennsylvania, Greencastle, a beautiful community in \nFranklin County, where they live in a 2-bedroom bungalow on a friend's \nfarm.\n  As for choice, here is what Lori has to say: ``Choice they didn't \ngive me. I had to beg for a choice. Why did I have to go out of my way \nwhen they wanted to kill my baby, when they didn't want to operate or \nfeed her? I didn't get to choose anything.''\n  As I mentioned earlier today, I rose and asked unanimous consent to \nhave little Donna Joy Watts sit up there with her mom and dad and watch \nthis proceeding and watch Members debate whether we are going to allow \na procedure that could have been used to kill her still be legal in \nthis country. When I asked for that unanimous consent, the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, objected. Donna Joy Watts is only 5\\1/2\\ \nyears of age, although I suggest she has lived a lot in those 5\\1/2\\ \nyears. But you have to be 6 years of age to sit in the Senate gallery \nunless you can get unanimous consent in the Senate to do otherwise, and \nSenator Boxer rose and objected. She said, and I quote, ``I think I am \nacting in the best interests of that child.'' Oh, how many times has \nLori Watts heard that? How many people have said to her, ``I am doing \nthis for the best interests of your child.'' But she did not listen to \nthem. If she had listened to them she would not be here today, sitting \nhere in Washington, and Donna Joy would not be on this Earth. Thank God \nLori did not listen to all of the voices, thank God Donny didn't listen \nto all of the voices that said, ``I think I'm acting in the best \ninterests of your child.''\n  There is no reason--there is no reason--for the conditions that the \nSenator from California outlined as medically necessary reasons to do \npartial-birth abortions. There is no reason. Those are not good \nreasons. Here is an example of why it is not a good reason. You do not \nhave to kill the baby. You can deliver the baby. You can do a cesarean \nsection. You may at times--in this case, it was not the case--you may \nat times have to separate the mother from the child, but you never have \nto kill the child in the process. You do not have to do it.\n  So for all the arguments out there, for all the people who wanted to \nhave a face, that is a beautiful face. It is a beautiful addition, a \nbeautiful contribution to the human spirit. Does it not make you just \nfeel good to know that people love their children so much, love life \nand respect it so much, that they will get up every 3 hours for an hour \nand a half every day to feed their children painstakingly one drop at a \ntime? It ennobles us all. It lifts us all up.\n\n[[Page S4443]]\n\n  What is the alternative? Death, destruction of a little baby. I do \nnot see how that elevates any of us. How does that add to the human \ncondition? How does that improve the quality of life in America? How \nare we ennobling our culture by this? How are we standing as a \ncivilization on righteousness with this? There are beautiful tales to \nbe told. Just give these children a chance.\n  That is what this bill does. It outlaws a barbaric procedure that is \nnever, never, never, never, never necessary. Hold that thought. Believe \nthat truth, then ask yourself why, why do we have people on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate, the greatest deliberative body on the face of the \nEarth, defending such cruelty, such barbarism, to some of the most \nvulnerable among us?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the issue of \npartial-birth abortions. We know that public opinion on abortion is \ndeeply divided, and reasoned debate too often degenerates into the \nshouted distortions of polarized parties. As elected leaders, we have a \nresponsibility to resist the temptation of knee-jerk politics and \ncarefully sift the facts from among the chaff of many fictions.\n  Americans, pro-life and pro-choice, Democrat and Republican, have \nunited in opposition to partial-birth abortions because this issue \ntranscends the politics of abortion. As a society, we have been shocked \nto realize we have allowed doctors to perform a procedure that is a \nmere 3 inches from infanticide. The nature of this brutal procedure has \nso shocked us that many pro-choice Americans fear that women and their \ncircumstances will be forgotten in a backlash.\n  Fear has driven many activists to turn to deception for a defense. \nUnderstandable possibly, but unfortunate. As a physician, I know that \nwomen's health will never be served in the long term by myth and by \ndeceit. Therefore, as we debate this procedure this afternoon, this \nevening, and tomorrow, I appeal to my colleagues to represent the facts \naccurately. Again and again, we have had to come to the floor to \naddress the fallacies perpetuated by the opponents of the ban.\n  As a case in point, I would like to read an excerpt to illustrate the \nfirst myth, the myth that we have heard again and again, and the myth \nis that partial-birth abortion is necessary to preserve the health of \nthe mother.\n  This myth really has been used as the primary objection, to the ban \non partial-birth abortion. President Clinton has cited the absence of a \nhealth exception as his primary reason for carrying out the veto of the \nban last year. In an Associated Press interview on December 13, 1996, \nPresident Clinton described a hypothetical situation where, without a \npartial-birth abortion, a woman could not ``preserve the ability to \nhave further children.'' He said that he would not ``tell her that I am \nsigning a law which will prevent her from having another child. I am \nnot going to do it.''\n  The scenario described by President Clinton is heart wrenching, and \nis something that people listen to. It grabs their attention. But his \nclaim about partial-birth abortion is entirely fictional. Partial-birth \nabortion is never necessary to preserve the health of a woman.\n  The College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently issued a \nstatement admitting that their select panel on partial-birth abortion \n``could identify no circumstances under which this procedure would be \nthe only option to save the life or preserve the health of the \nmother.''\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed into Record \nthe entire statement of policy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     ACOG Statement of Policy As Issued by the ACOG Executive Board\n\n\n             STATEMENT ON INTACT DILATATION AND EXTRACTION\n\n       The debate regarding legislation to prohibit a method of \n     abortion, such as the legislation banning ``partial birth \n     abortion,'' and ``brain sucking abortions,'' has prompted \n     questions regarding these procedures. It is difficult to \n     respond to these questions because the descriptions are vague \n     and do not delineate a specific procedure recognized in the \n     medical literature. Moreover, the definitions could be \n     interpreted to include elements of many recognized abortion \n     and operative obstetric techniques.\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     (ACOG) believes the intent of such legislative proposals is \n     to prohibit a procedure referred to as ``Intact Dilatation \n     and Extraction'' (Intact D & X). This procedure has been \n     described as containing all of the following four elements: \n     (1) deliberate dilatation of the cervix, usually over a \n     sequence of days; (2) instrumental conversion of the fetus to \n     a footling breech; (3) breech extraction of the body \n     excepting the head; and (4) partial evacuation of the \n     intracranial contents of a living fetus to effect vaginal \n     delivery of a dead but otherwise intact fetus.\n       Because these elements are part of established obstetric \n     techniques, it must be emphasized that unless all four \n     elements are present in sequence, the procedure is not an \n     intact D & X.\n       Abortion intends to terminate a pregnancy while preserving \n     the life and health of the mother. When abortion is performed \n     after 16 weeks, intact D & X is one method of terminating a \n     pregnancy. The physician, in consultation with the patient, \n     must choose the most appropriate method based upon the \n     patient's individual circumstances.\n       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC), only 5.3% of abortions performed in the United States \n     in 1993, the most recent data available, were performed after \n     the 16th week of pregnancy. A prelimary figure published by \n     the CDC for 1994 is 5.6%. The CDC does not collect data on \n     the specific method of abortion, so it is unknown how many of \n     these were performed using intact D & X. Other data show that \n     second trimester transvaginal instrumental abortion is a safe \n     procedure.\n       Terminating a pregnancy is performed in some circumstances \n     to save the life or preserve the health of the mother. Intact \n     D & X is one of the methods available in some of these \n     situations. A select panel convened by ACOG could identify no \n     circumstances under which this procedure, as defined above, \n     would be the only option to save the life or preserve the \n     health of the woman. An intact D & X, however, may be the \n     best or most appropriate procedure in a particular \n     circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a \n     woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, \n     based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this \n     decision. The potential exists that legislation prohibiting \n     specific medical practices, such as intact D & X, may outlaw \n     techniques that are critical to the lives and health of \n     American women. The intervention of legislative bodies into \n     medical decision making is inappropriate, ill advised, and \n     dangerous.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, in addition, the AMA task force entitled \n``The Report of the Board of Trustees,'' convened on this very issue, \nconcluded that ``There does not appear to be any identified situation \nin which intact D''--their attempt to coin a phrase the procedure we \ncall partial birth abortion--``is the only appropriate procedure to \ninduce abortion,'' and they admitted that ``ethical concerns have been \nraised about intact D''\n  Madam President, I will read the second myth. It comes directly from \na Planned Parenthood press release. It says: ``The D abortion is a \nrare and difficult medical procedure. It is usually performed in the \nmost extreme cases to save the life of the woman or in cases of severe \nfetal abnormalities.''\n  That is taken from Allen Rosenfeld, dean of the Columbia School of \nPublic Health, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, press release \nof June 15, 1995.\n  This simply is not true. I direct my colleagues' attention to the \nrecent admissions of Ronald Fitzsimmons, executive director of the \nNational Coalition of Abortion Providers. Mr. Fitzsimmons has shown \namazing integrity and courage by stepping forward and really coming \nclean on this misinformation campaign surrounding this bill. While he \nhimself opposes and is very adamant when he speaks to all of us that he \nopposes the ban on philosophical reasons, he admits that he ``lied \nthrough his teeth'' when he said that partial-birth abortion was used \nrarely and only on women whose lives were in danger or whose fetuses \nwere damaged.\n  He said he just went out there to ``spout the party line.'' In a \nrecent American Medical News article in March of 1997, he explained \nthat he could no longer justify lying to the American people, saying, \n``You know they're primarily done on healthy women and healthy fetuses, \nand it makes you feel like a dirty little abortionist with a dirty \nlittle secret.''\n  I admire him for his integrity in coming forth.\n  Let me quote another partial-birth practitioner, Dr. James McMahon. \nHe aborted nine babies simply because they had a cleft lip. Many \nothers, at\n\n[[Page S4444]]\n\nleast 39, were aborted because of the psychological and emotional \nhealth of the mother, despite the advanced gestational age and health \nof the child. Another practitioner, Dr. Martin Haskell claims that 80 \npercent of the partial-birth abortions he performed were for ``purely \nelective'' reasons.\n  So, in summary, we can categorically dismiss claims that the \nprocedure is necessary for the health of the mother and that most of \nthese babies are severely deformed.\n  Women always have safe and effective alternatives to partial-birth \nabortion in any trimester. The Washington Post put it this way: ``It is \npossible--and maybe even likely--that the majority of these abortions \nare performed on normal fetuses, not on fetuses suffering genetic or \ndevelopmental abnormalities. Furthermore, in most cases where the \nprocedure is used, the physical health of the woman * * * is not in \njeopardy.''\n  That is from the Washington Post of September 17, 1996.\n  I submit that part of the confusion on this issue is due to the \ndeliberate manipulation of the collective sympathy that we all have \nwhen we talk about the health of the mother. When the President of the \nUnited States defends his veto of the partial-birth abortion ban on the \ngrounds that he wants to protect women's health, most people assume \nthat he is talking about women's physical health. I imagine that most \nAmericans would actually be surprised to learn that babies in the late \nsecond and early third trimesters may be legally aborted for reasons \nother than the life and/or the physical health of the mother. What the \nPresident does not tell you is that under Doe versus Bolton, a 1973 \nSupreme Court case, health is defined to include ``all factors--\nphysical, emotional, psychological, familial, and a woman's age--\nrelevant to the well-being of the patient.''\n  A broad definition of health.\n  People in the abortion industry understand that there are many late-\nterm abortions performed for social reasons as well as health reasons. \nA 1993 National Abortion Federation internal memorandum acknowledged, \n``There are many reasons why women have later abortions,'' and they \ninclude ``lack of money or health insurance, social-psychological \ncrises, lack of knowledge about human reproduction, et cetera.'' So \nwhen you see legislation come to the floor of the U.S. Senate to allow \nlate-term abortions if the mother's health is at risk, just remember \nhow health is being defined--so broadly that you can drive a truck \nthrough it.\n\n  Unfortunately, opponents of the bill don't stop there. You will hear \na third carefully crafted myth that goes something like this.\n  This procedure, if not wildly accepted, could possibly be the best \nprocedure in a particular woman's situation.\n  As a physician, I have a sworn commitment to preserve the life and \nhealth of every single patient. So I have taken the liberty of calling \nand checking with people around the country, checking with key \nobstetricians and abortion providers all across this Nation. From the \noutset, I will admit that it has been difficult for me to imagine how a \nprocedure that is not taught in residency programs where obstetricians \nare trained--it is not taught today; it is not referenced in our peer \nreview journals, which is really the substance, the literature through \nwhich we teach each other, and share information; it is not in peer \nreview journals--it is a little bit hard for me to understand how \npeople could argue that this is the best procedure available. Really \nuntil the recent controversy, many practitioners who you talk to had \nnever heard of this particular procedure.\n  On the other hand, a lot of my medical colleagues--they rightly fear \nthe Government coming in and trying to control everything that they do \nin their practice--have said that this procedure could be the best \nalternative in a given situation. They have not endorsed it. They have \nnot listed specific medical indications for the procedure, and they \nhave not even recommended that it be used in most circumstances, but \nthey have said--again, with this great fear that the Federal Government \nwill come in and control everything that they do--that the physician \nshould retain the right to use this procedure if a circumstance should \nhypothetically arise in which an individual might think it is the best \noption.\n  But when questioned about this very specific issue, the ACOG \npresident of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Dr. \nFredric Frigoletto, maintains that, ``There are no data to say that one \nof the procedures is safer than the other.'' When asked why the \nstatement then said that the procedure ``may be the best'' in some \ncases, Dr. Frigoletto answered, ``or it may not be.''\n  That interview is from the American Medical News, March 3, 1997.\n  Moreover, Dr. Warren Hern, author of the textbook Abortion Practice, \nthe Nation's really most widely used textbook on abortion procedures \nand abortion standards, said, ``I have very serious reservations about \nthis procedure * * * You really can't defend it * * * I would dispute \nany statement that this is the safest procedure to use.''\n  Dr. Hern specializes in late-term abortions.\n  Incidentally, Madam President, I would like to note that it is \ndifficult from a medical perspective to categorically describe late-\nterm surgical abortions as the best option. In the first place, \nmedical, nonsurgical, late-term abortion methods are generally regarded \nas superior to surgical methods.\n  Second, the National Abortion Federation concedes that at this point \nin time residents may not receive enough training in abortion to ``be \ntruly competent.''\n  Third, Dr. Haskell who, is considered to be one, if not the creator, \nof the creators of the procedure we are talking about, specifically \nacknowledged in his paper that a disadvantage of the partial-birth \nprocedure was that it requires a ``high degree of surgical skill.''\n  So let me just recap briefly. You have a brutal, basically repulsive \nprocedure designed to kill a living infant outside of the birth canal--\nexcept for the head. Leading providers of women's obstetrical and \ngynecological services condemn it. They recommend it not be used. They \nrefuse to endorse it. They highlight its risks, and say that there are \nother safe and effective alternatives available. But for political \nreasons--and I understand the politics involved--they urge us not to \nban it because that would be violating the sanctity of the physician-\npatient relationship.\n\n  Madam President, as a physician and as a father, I submit that any \nprovider who performs a partial-birth abortion has already violated \nthat sanctity of the physician-patient relationship.\n  Another myth: Medical procedures should never, under any \ncircumstances, be criminalized.\n  It is a myth that I thought about. I would like to defer to this \nmatter to the American Medical Association which concedes that there \nare circumstances where Government intervention, even in the form of \ncriminalization of specific medical procedures, is appropriate.\n  I am quoting now from the letter of AMA Executive Vice President P. \nJohn Seward, M.D., to Representative Cardin: He says:\n\n       AMA's generic policy calls for opposition to the \n     criminalization of medical procedures and practices. \n     Therefore, on the surface, it would seem obvious for the AMA \n     to oppose this bill. However, our policy cannot be applied \n     without context. For example, the AMA has a strong ethical \n     and policy position against . . . the practice some have \n     called ``physician-assisted suicide'' and we have opposed \n     efforts to legalize such activities even though current law \n     could be considered the criminalization of a medical \n     procedure.\n\n  The context in the case of partial-birth abortion, as in the case of \nphysician-assisted suicide, is the time-honored Hippocratic principle, \n``First do no harm.'' An additional component of the context is the \nreality that this procedure is not endorsed by the medical academy, and \nis made unnecessary by other widely used, safe and effective options.\n  Those of us in this room have followed this debate for 2 years now, \nsome for much longer. From day one, there has been a pattern of \nmanipulation, deception, misinformation, and coverup; even at the risk \nof harming women's health.\n  There is one final myth that has been perpetuated, and then I will \nyield the floor.\n  Those of us in opposition to the partial-birth abortion have had to \ndispel the notion--actually dangerous to women's health--that their \nbabies\n\n[[Page S4445]]\n\nwould be killed if they took anesthesia for any reason during \npregnancy.\n  Let me quote again from some pro-choice literature trying to appease \nwomen's fears about partial-birth abortion by asserting that the baby \nis already dead when the doctor plunges the scissors into the back of \nthe baby's head.\n  ``The fetus dies of an overdose of anesthesia given to the mother \nintravenously.''\n  That is from a Planned Parenthood fact sheet.\n  No. 2. ``Neurological fetal demise is induced, either before the \nprocedure begins or early on in the procedure, by the steps taken to \nprepare the woman for surgery.''\n  That is from the National Abortion Federation news release July 1995. \nIt is simply not true. I will turn to the president of the American \nSociety of Anesthesiologists who personally came to Capitol Hill to \nrefute this argument, and he basically, in testifying before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, said that intravenous anesthesia would not kill \nthe baby. He said:\n  ``In my medical judgment, it would be necessary in order to achieve \nneurological demise of the fetus in a partial-birth abortion to \nanesthetize the mother to such a degree as to place her own health in \nserious jeopardy.''\n  Now, in closing, we have heard many eloquent statements today, and we \nwill likely hear them tomorrow, in defense of this brutal and inhumane \nprocedure, but in the words of the great poet Milton, ``All is false \nand hollow.'' Despite the preponderance of evidence, we are compelled \nto again listen to arguments designed solely to ``make the worse appear \nthe better reason,'' and we must continue to address deceptions \ndesigned to ``perplex and dash'' honest counsel. There is no excuse at \nthis stage of the game for not knowing the truth, the absolute truth. \nThere is no room--no room any longer to pretend that this procedure is \nnecessary for the health of the mother or that it might be the best. It \nis time, as Mr. Fitzsimmons so plainly put it, for ``the [abortion] \nmovement to back away from the spins and half truths.''\n  Partial-birth abortions cannot and should not be categorized with \nother medical procedures or even other abortions. They should not be \nallowed in a civilized country. With the reintroduction of the partial-\nbirth abortion ban legislation in the Senate, we have the opportunity \nto right now to right a wrong, and now once again the American people \nare calling on us to listen not to political advisers, not to radical \ninterest groups--but to our conscience. It will take moral courage to \nput a stop to the propaganda, but we all have the means at our disposal \nto do the right thing. For the sake of women, for the sake of their \nchildren, and for the sake of our future as a society, we must put a \nstop once and for all to partial-birth abortion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. FAIRCLOTH assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, when President Clinton vetoed the Partial-\nBirth Abortion Ban Act a year ago, he said there are ``rare and tragic \nsituations that can occur in a woman's pregnancy in which, in a \ndoctor's medical judgment, the use of this procedure may be necessary \nto save a woman's life or to protect her against serious injury to her \nhealth.''\n  I do not doubt that the President made that statement about the \nrarity of the procedure and its utility, relying in good faith on \ninformation provided at the time by certain organizations involved in \nthis debate. We now know, however, that the information given the \nPresident was of questionable value, if not downright inaccurate.\n  A number of pro-abortion organizations, for example, had suggested \nthat partial-birth abortions totaled only about 500 a year and that \nthey were limited to very serious and tragic cases where there was no \nalternative.\n  This is how the Planned Parenthood Federation of America \ncharacterized partial-birth abortion in a November 1, 1995, news \nrelease: ``The procedure, dilation and extraction (D), is extremely \nrare and done only in cases when the woman's life is in danger or in \ncases of extreme fetal abnormality.'' Let me quote that again, done \nonly--only--in cases when the woman's life is in danger or in cases of \nextreme fetal abnormality.\n  The organization repeated this several times. In a press release \nissued on March 26, 1996, Planned Parenthood said, ``The truth is that \nthe D procedure is only used when the woman's life or health is in \ndanger or in cases of extreme fetal anomaly.'' The statement is \nabsolute: the procedure is only used under these conditions, said the \norganization.\n  In fairness, I will point out that Planned Parenthood was not the \nonly group to make such sweeping statements at that time.\n  Within the last few months, however, the story has started to \nunravel. On February 26, the New York Times reported that Ron \nFitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion \nProviders, admitted he ``lied in earlier statements when he said \n[partial-birth abortion] is rare and performed primarily to save the \nlives or fertility of women bearing severely malformed babies.'' \nAccording to the Times, ``He now says the procedure is performed far \nmore often than his colleagues have acknowledged, and on healthy women \nbearing healthy fetuses.''\n  Mr. Fitzsimmons told American Medical News the same thing--that is, \nthe vast majority of these abortions are performed in the 20-plus week \nrange on healthy fetuses and healthy mothers. He said, ``The abortion \nrights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks know it, and so, \nprobably, does everyone else.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the New York Times and \nthe American Medical News articles be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Ron Fitzsimmons' admission is really not all \nthat surprising. Even at the time of the debate in the Senate last \nyear, the preponderance of evidence suggested that the procedure was \nmore common than some of its defenders wanted the public and Congress \nto believe. Consider, for example, that Dr. Martin Haskell, who \nauthored a paper on the subject for the National Abortion Federation, \nsaid in a 1993 interview with American Medical News, ``in my particular \ncase, probably 20 percent--of the instances of this procedure--are for \ngenetic reasons. And the other 80 percent are purely elective.'' He \nsuggested at the time that an estimate of about 4,000 partial-birth \nabortions a year was probably accurate.\n\n  Another doctor, Dr. James McMahon, who acknowledged that he performed \nat least 2,000 of the procedures, told American Medical News before he \ndied that he used the method to perform elective abortions up to 26 \nweeks and nonelective abortions up to 40 weeks. His definition of \n``non-elective'' was expansive, including ``depression'' as a maternal \nindication for the procedure. More than half of the partial-birth \nabortions he performed were on healthy babies.\n  The Record of Bergen County, NJ published an investigative report on \nthe issue last year and reported that in New Jersey alone, at least \n1,500 partial-birth abortions are performed annually, far more than the \n450 to 500 such abortions that the National Abortion Federation said \nwere occurring across the entire country.\n  According to the Record, doctors it interviewed said that only a \n``minuscule'' number of these abortions are performed for medical \nreasons.\n  Mr. President, evidence overwhelmingly indicates that partial-birth \nabortions are performed far more often than President Clinton suggested \nwhen he vetoed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act last year. But what \nabout his comments about the need to protect the life and health of the \nmother?\n  Here is what the former Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. C. \nEverett Koop--a man who President Clinton singled out for praise as \nsomeone trying ``to bring some sanity into the health policy of this \ncountry''--had to say on the subject. He said that ``partial-birth \nabortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or \nfuture fertility. On the contrary, this procedure can pose a \nsignificant threat to both.''\n  That is consistent with testimony that the Judiciary Committee \nreceived in late 1995 from other medical experts. Dr. Nancy Romer, a \npracticing ob-gyn\n\n[[Page S4446]]\n\nfrom Ohio, testified that in her 13 years of experience, she never felt \ncompelled to recommend this procedure to save a woman's life. ``In \nfact,'' she said, ``if a woman has a serious, life threatening, medical \ncondition this procedure has a significant disadvantage in that it \ntakes three days.''\n  Even Dr. Warren Hern, the author of the Nation's most widely used \ntextbook on abortion standards and procedures, is quoted in the \nNovember 20, 1995 edition of American Medical News as saying that he \nwould ``dispute any statement that this is the safest procedure to \nuse.'' He called it ``potentially dangerous'' to a woman to turn a \nfetus to a breech position, as occurs during a partial-birth abortion.\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which, many \nwill recall, supported the President's veto last year, was quoted by \ncolumnist Charles Krauthammer on March 14 as conceding that there are \n``no circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option \nto save the life of the mother and preserve the health of the woman.'' \nI would point out that, in the event that a doctor determined that a \npartial-birth abortion was the only procedure available to save a \nwoman's life, he should or could proceed since the legislation includes \na life-of-the-mother exception.\n  Mr. President, I know that there are several other concerns that have \nbeen expressed about the legislation. For example, some have questioned \nits constitutionality, and that is a legitimate question. Of course, we \nall can speculate about how the U.S. Supreme Court might rule on the \nmatter. But as Harvard Law School Professor Lawrence Tribe noted in \na November 6, 1995 letter to Senator Boxer, there are various reasons \n``why one cannot predict with confidence how the Supreme Court as \ncurrently composed would rule if confronted with [the bill].'' He noted \nthat the Court has not had any such law before it. And he noted that \n``although the Court did grapple in 1986 with the question of a State's \npower to put the health and survival of a viable fetus above the \nmedical needs of the mother, it has never directly addressed a law \nquite like [the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act].''\n\n  Mr. President, neither Roe versus Wade nor any subsequent Supreme \nCourt case has ever held that taking the life of a child during the \nbirth process is a constitutionally protected practice. In fact, the \nCourt specifically noted in Roe that a Texas statute that--making \nkilling a child during the birth process a felony--had not been \nchallenged. That portion of the law is still on the books in Texas \ntoday.\n  Remember what we are talking about here: ``an abortion in which the \nperson performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living \nfetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.'' That is \nthe definition of a partial-birth abortion in the pending legislation.\n  So we are talking about a child whose body, save for his or her head, \nhas been delivered from the mother--that is, only the head remains \ninside. No matter what legal issues are involved, I hope no one will \nforget that we are talking about a live child who is already in the \nbirth canal and indeed has been partially delivered.\n  Even if the Court did somehow find that a partially delivered child \nis not constitutionally protected, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act \ncould still be upheld under Roe and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern \nPennsylvania versus Casey. Under both Roe and Casey, the Government may \nprohibit abortion after viability, except when necessary to protect the \nlife or health of the mother. As I indicated earlier in my remarks, \nmedical experts, including the former Surgeon General, Dr. C. Everett \nKoop, have said that this procedure is never medically necessary to \nprotect a mother's health or future fertility. Others have even \nquestioned its safety, calling it ``potentially dangerous.''\n  By contrast, in cases prior to viability, Casey allows regulation of \nabortion that is reasonably related to a legitimate State interest, \nunless the regulation places an ``undue burden'' on a woman's right to \nchoose an abortion. But as I just indicated, the pending bill would \nonly ban one type of procedure, involving the partial delivery of a \nchild before it is killed. Other procedures would still be available if \na woman's health were threatened. And the bill would allow a doctor to \nproceed with a partial-birth abortion if the woman's life were \nthreatened.\n  Mr. President, Notre Dame's Professor of Constitutional Law, Douglas \nW. Kmiec, made the point in testimony before the Judiciary Committee on \nNovember 17, 1995, that ``even in Roe the Court explicitly rejected the \nargument that a woman `is entitled to terminate her pregnancy at \nwhatever time, in whatever way, and for whatever reason she alone \nchooses' [410 U.S. at 153].'' Professor Kmiec went on to note that \nunder Casey, there is an elementary difference between banning all \nabortions and banning one procedure that medical testimony indicates is \nnot at all necessary to save a mother's life.\n  Mr. President, although I believe the law would be upheld by the \nCourt, I will concede that no one can say with certainty how the \nSupreme Court will rule until it has ruled. Until then, I suggest that \nwe not use that as an excuse to avoid doing what we believe is right.\n  Mr. President, the other issue I want to address briefly before \nclosing involves the question of when this procedure is performed. Some \npeople, suggesting a way to compromise on the legislation, are now \nfocusing on the third trimester, proposing that limitations on the \nprocedure be restricted to that time period. Of course, all of the \nevidence suggests that the vast majority of partial-birth abortions--\nsome 90 percent--occur during the second trimester of pregnancy. And as \nRon Fitzsimmons put it, they are performed for the most part on healthy \nwomen and healthy babies.\n  A third-trimester partial-birth abortion ban would be a hollow \ngesture at best, and at worst, a cynical hoax on an American public \nthat is outraged at the barbarity of this procedure.\n  It seems to me that a third-trimester limitation is merely a way for \ndefenders of the status quo to make it appear that they are doing \nsomething to end this horrifying procedure without doing anything at \nall.\n  Mr. President, the spotlight is on this body. The facts are on the \ntable. Let us do what is right and put a stop to what our colleague, \nSenator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, has appropriately characterized as \ninfanticide. Let us pass this bill.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 26, 1997]\n\n        An Abortion Rights Advocate Says He Lied About Procedure\n\n                            (By David Stout)\n\n       Washington.--A prominent member of the abortion rights \n     movement said today that he lied in earlier statements when \n     he said a controversial form of late-term abortion is rare \n     and performed primarily to save the lives or fertility of \n     women bearing severely malformed babies.\n       He now says the procedure is performed far more often than \n     his colleagues have acknowledged, and on healthy women \n     bearing healthy fetuses.\n       Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National \n     Coalition of Abortion Providers, said he intentionally misled \n     in previous remarks about the procedure, called intact \n     dilation and evacuation by those who believe it should remain \n     legal and ``partial-birth abortion'' by those who believe it \n     should be outlawed, because he feared that the truth would \n     damage the cause of abortion rights.\n       But he is now convinced, he said, that the issue of whether \n     the procedure remains legal, like the overall debate about \n     abortion, must be based on the truth.\n       In an article in American Medical News, to be published \n     March 3, and an interview today, Mr. Fitzsimmons recalled the \n     night in November 1995, when he appeared on ``Nightline'' on \n     ABC and ``lied through my teeth'' when he said the procedure \n     was used rarely and only on women whose lives were in danger \n     or whose fetuses were damaged.\n       ``It made me physically ill,'' Mr. Fitzsimmons said in an \n     interview. ``I told my wife the next day, `I can't do this \n     again.' ''\n       Mr. Fitzsimmons said that after that interview he stayed on \n     the sidelines of the debate for a while, but with growing \n     unease. As much as he disagreed with the National Right to \n     Life Committee and others who oppose abortion under any \n     circumstances, he said he knew they were accurate when they \n     said the procedure was common.\n       In the procedure, a fetus is partly extracted from the \n     birth canal, feel first, and the brain is then suctioned out.\n       Last fall, Congress failed to override a Presidential veto \n     of a law that would have banned the procedure, which abortion \n     opponents insist borders on infanticide and some abortion \n     rights advocates also believe should be outlawed as \n     particularly gruesome. Polls have shown that such a ban has \n     popular support.\n       Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, \n     has suggested a compromise that would prohibit all third-\n     trimester abortions, except in cases involving\n\n[[Page S4447]]\n\n     the ``life of the mother and severe impairment of her \n     health.''\n       The Right to Life Committee and its allies have complained \n     repeatedly that abortion-rights supporters have misled \n     politicians, journalists and the general public about the \n     frequency and the usual circumstances of the procedure.\n       ``The abortion lobby manufactures disinformation,'' Douglas \n     Johnson, the committee's legislative director, said today. He \n     said Mr. Fitzsimmon's account would clarify the debate on \n     this procedure, which is expected to be renewed in Congress.\n       Mr. Fitzsimmons predicted today that the controversial \n     procedure would be considered by the courts no matter what \n     lawmakers decide.\n       Last April, President Clinton vetoed a bill that would have \n     outlawed the controversial procedure. There were enough \n     opponents in the House to override his veto but not in the \n     Senate. In explaining the veto, Mr. Clinton echoed the \n     argument of Mr. Fitzsimmons and his colleagues.\n       ``There are a few hundred women every year who have \n     personally agonizing situations where their children are born \n     or are about to be born with terrible deformities, which will \n     cause them to die either just before, during or just after \n     childbirth,'' the President said. ``And these women, among \n     other things, cannot preserve the ability to have further \n     children unless the enormity--the enormous size of the baby's \n     head--is reduced before being extracted from their bodies.'' \n     A spokeswoman for Mr. Clinton said tonight that the White \n     House knew nothing of Mr. Fitzsimmons's announcement and \n     would not comment further.\n       In the vast majority of cases, the procedure is performed \n     on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus that is 20 weeks or \n     more along, Mr. Fitzsimmons said. ``The abortion-rights folks \n     know it, the anti-abortion folks know it, and so, probably, \n     does everyone else,'' he said in the article in the Medical \n     News, an American Medical Association publication.\n       Mr. Fitzsimmons, whose Alexandria, Va., coalition \n     represents about 200 independently owned clinics, said \n     coalition members were being notified of his announcement.\n       One of the facts of abortion, he said, is that women enter \n     abortion clinics to kill their fetuses. ``It is a form of \n     killing,'' he said. ``You're ending a life.''\n       And while he said that troubled him, Mr. Fitzsimmons said \n     he continues to support this procedure and abortion rights in \n     general.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the American Medical News, Mar. 3, 1997]\n\n Medicine Adds to Debate on Late-term Abortion--Abortion Rights Leader \n                      Urges End to ``Half Truths''\n\n                         (By Diane M. Gianelli)\n\n       Washington--Breaking ranks with his colleagues in the \n     abortion rights movement, the leader of one prominent \n     abortion provider group is calling for a more truthful debate \n     in the ongoing battle over whether to ban a controversial \n     late-term abortion procedure.\n       In fact, Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the \n     National Coalition of Abortion Providers, said he would \n     rather not spend his political capital defending the \n     procedure at all. There is precious little popular support \n     for it, he says, and a federal ban would have almost no real-\n     world impact on the physicians who perform late-term \n     abortions or patients who seek them.\n       ``The pro-choice movement has lost a lot of credibility \n     during this debate, not just with the general public, but \n     with our pro-choice friends in Congress,'' Fitzsimmons said. \n     ``Even the White House is now questioning the accuracy of \n     some of the information given to it on this issue.''\n       He cited prominent abortion rights supporters such as the \n     Washington Post's Richard Cohen, who took the movement to \n     task for providing inaccurate information on the procedure. \n     Those pressing to ban the method call it ``partial birth'' \n     abortion, while those who perform it refer to it as \n     ``intact'' dilation and extraction (D) or dilation and \n     evacuation (D).\n       What abortion rights supporters failed to acknowledge, \n     Fitzsimmons said, is that the vast majority of these \n     abortions are performed in the 20-plus week range on healthy \n     fetuses and healthy mothers. ``The abortion rights folks know \n     it, the anti-abortion folks know it, and so, probably, does \n     everyone else,'' he said.\n       He knows it, he says, because when the bill to ban it came \n     down the pike, he called around until he found doctors who \n     did them.\n       ``I learned right away that this was being done for the \n     most part in cases that did not involve those extreme \n     circumstances,'' he said.\n       The National Abortion Federation's Vicki Saporta \n     acknowledged that ``the numbers are greater than we initially \n     estimated.''\n       As for the reasons, Saporta said, ``Women have abortions \n     pre-viability for reasons that they deem appropriate. And \n     Congress should not be determining what are appropriate \n     reasons in that period of time. Those decisions can only be \n     made by women in consultation with their doctors.''\n\n\n                     bill's reintroduction expected\n\n       Rep. Charles Canady (R. Fla.) is expected to reintroduce \n     legislation this month to ban the procedure.\n       Those supporting the bill, which was also introduced in the \n     Senate, inevitably evoke winces by graphically describing the \n     procedure, which usually involves the extraction of an intact \n     fetus, feet first, through the birth canal, with all but the \n     head delivered. The physician then forces a sharp instrument \n     into the base of the skull and uses suction to remove the \n     brain. The procedure is usually done in the 20- to 24-week \n     range, though some providers do them at later gestations.\n       Abortion rights activists tried to combat the images with \n     those of their own, showing the faces and telling the stories \n     of particularly vulnerable women who have had the procedure. \n     They have consistently claimed it is done only when the \n     woman's life is at risk or the fetus has a condition \n     incompatible with life. And the numbers are small, they said, \n     only 500 to 600 a year.\n       Furthermore, they said, the fetus doesn't die violently \n     from the trauma to the skull or the suctioning of the brain, \n     but peacefully from the anesthesia given to the mother before \n     the extraction even begins.\n       The American Society of Anesthesiologists debunked the \n     latter claim, calling it ``entirely inaccurate.'' And \n     activists' claims about the numbers and reasons have been \n     discredited by the very doctors who do the procedures. In \n     published interviews with such newspapers as American Medical \n     News, The Washington Post and The Record, a Bergen County, \n     N.J., newspaper, doctors who use the technique acknowledged \n     doing thousands of such procedures a year. They also said the \n     majority are done on healthy fetuses and healthy women.\n       The New Jersey paper reported last fall that physicians at \n     one facility perform an estimated 3,000 abortions a year on \n     fetuses between 20 and 24 weeks, of which at least half are \n     by intact D One of the doctors was quoted as saying, ``we \n     have an occasional amnio abnormality, but it's a minuscule \n     amount. Most are Medicaid patients . . . and most are for \n     elective, not medical reasons: people who didn't realize, or \n     didn't care, how far along they were.''\n       A Washington Post investigation turned up similar findings.\n\n\n                        `spins and half-truths'\n\n       Fitzsimmons says it's time for his movement to back away \n     from the ``spins'' and ``half-truths.'' He does not think \n     abortion rights advocates should ever apologize for \n     performing the procedure, which is what he thinks they are \n     doing by highlighting only the extreme cases.\n       ``I think we should tell them the truth, let them vote and \n     move on,'' he said.\n       Charlotte Taft, the former director of a Dallas abortion \n     clinic who provides abortion counseling near Santa Fe, N.M., \n     is one of several abortion rights activists who share many of \n     Fitzsimmons' concerns.\n       ``We're in a culture where two of the most frightening \n     things for Americans are sexuality and death. And here's \n     abortion. It combines the two,'' Taft said.\n       She agrees with Fitzsimmons that a debate on the issue \n     should be straight-forward. ``I think we should put it on the \n     table and say, `OK, this is what we're talking about: When is \n     it OK to end these lives? When is it not? Who's in charge? \n     How do we do it? These are hard questions, and yet if we \n     don't face them in that kind of a responsible way, then we're \n     still having the same conversations we were having 20 years \n     ago.''\n       Fitzsimmons thinks his colleagues in the movement shouldn't \n     have taken on the fight in the first place. A better bet, he \n     said, would have been ``to roll over and play dead, the way \n     the right-to-lifers do with rape and incest.'' Federal \n     legislation barring Medicaid abortion funding makes \n     exceptions to save the life of the mother and in those two \n     cases.\n       Fitzsimmons cites both political and practical reasons for \n     ducking the fight. ``We're fighting a bill that has the \n     support of, what, 78% of the public? That tells me that we \n     have a PR problem,'' he said, pointing out that several \n     members of Congress who normally support abortion rights \n     voted to ban the procedure the last time the measure was \n     considered.\n       From a practical point of view, it also ``wasn't worth \n     going to the mat on. . . . I don't recall talking to any \n     doctor who said, `Ron you've got to save us on this one. They \n     can't outlaw this. It'd be terrible.' No one said that.''\n       He added that ``the real-world impact on doctors and \n     patients is virtually nil.'' Doctors would continue to see \n     the same patients, using an alternative abortion method.\n       In fact, many of them already do a variation on the intact \n     D that would be completely legal, even if the bill to \n     outlaw ``partial birth'' abortions passed. In that variation, \n     the physician makes sure the fetus is dead before extracting \n     it from the birth canal. The bill would ban only those \n     procedures in which a live fetus is partially vaginally \n     delivered.\n       Lee Carhart, MD, a Bellevue, Neb., physician, said last \n     year that he had done about 5,000 intact D, about 1,000 \n     during the past two years. He induces fetal death by \n     injecting digoxin or lidocaine into the fetal sac 72 hours \n     before the fetus is extracted.\n\n\n                             Damage control\n\n       Fitzsimmons also questions whether a ban on an abortion \n     procedure would survive constitutional challenge. In any \n     event, he concludes that the way the debate was fought by his \n     side ``did serious harm'' to the image of abortion providers.\n       ``When you're a doctor who does these abortions and the \n     leaders of your movement appear before Congress and go on \n     network\n\n[[Page S4448]]\n\n     news and say these procedures are done in only the most \n     tragic of circumstances, how do you think it makes you feel? \n     You know they're primarily done on healthy women and healthy \n     fetuses, and it makes you feel like a dirty little \n     abortionist with a dirty little secret.''\n       Saporta says her group never intended to send this message \n     to doctors.\n       ``We believe that abortion providers are in fact maligned \n     and we work 24 hours a day to try to make the public and \n     others understand that these are heroes who are saving \n     women's lives on a daily basis,'' she said.\n       When Fitzsimmons criticizes his movement for its handling \n     of this issue, he points the finger at himself first. In \n     November 1995, he was interviewed by ``Nightline'' and, in \n     his own words, ``lied,'' telling the reporter that women had \n     these abortions only in the most extreme circumstances of \n     life endangerment or fetal anomaly.\n       Although much of his interview landed on the cutting room \n     floor, ``it was not a shining moment for me personally,'' he \n     said.\n       After that, he stayed out of the debate.\n\n\n                 don't get ``sidetracked'' by specifics\n\n       While Fitzsimmons is one of the few abortion rights \n     activists openly questioning how the debate played out, it is \n     clear he was not alone in knowing the facts that surround the \n     procedure.\n       At a National Abortion Federation meeting held in San \n     Francisco last year, Kathryn Kohlbert, one of the chief \n     architects of the movement's opposition to the bill, \n     discussed it candidly.\n       Kohlbert, vice president of the New York-based Center for \n     Reproductive Law and Policy, urged those attending the \n     session not to get ``sidetracked'' by their opponent's \n     efforts to get them to discuss the specifics of the \n     procedure.\n       ``I urge incredible restraint here, to focus on your \n     message and stick to it, because otherwise we'll get \n     creamed,'' Kohlbert told the group.\n       ``If the debate is whether the fetus feels pain, we lose. \n     If the debate in the public arena is what's the effect of \n     anesthesia, we'll lose. If the debate is whether or not women \n     ought to be entitled to late abortion, we probably will lose.\n       ``But if the debate is on the circumstances of individual \n     women . . . and the government shouldn't be making those \n     decisions, then I think we can win these fights,'' she said.\n\n\n                            public reaction\n\n       The abortion rights movement's newest strategy in fighting \n     efforts to ban the procedure is to try to narrow the focus of \n     the debate to third-trimester abortions, which are far fewer \n     in number than those done in the late second trimester and \n     more frequently done for reasons of fetal anomaly.\n       When the debate shifts back to ``elective'' abortions done \n     in the 20- to 24-week range, the movement's response has been \n     to assert that those abortions are completely legal and the \n     fetuses are considered ``pre-viable.''\n       In keeping with this strategy, Sen. Thomas Daschle (D. \n     S.D.), plans to introduce a bill banning third-trimester \n     abortions. Clinton, who received an enormous amount of heat \n     for vetoing the ``partial birth'' abortion ban, has already \n     indicated he would support such a bill.\n       But critics counter that Daschle's proposed ban--with its \n     ``health'' exception--would stop few, if any, abortions.\n       ``The Clinton-Daschle proposal is constructed to protect \n     pro-choice politicians, not to save any babies.'' said \n     Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right \n     to Life Committee.\n       Given the broad, bipartisan congressional support for the \n     bill to ban ``partial birth'' abortions last year, it's \n     unlikely Daschle's proposal would diminish support for the \n     bill this session--particularly when Republicans control both \n     houses and therefore, the agenda.\n       And given the public reaction to the ``partial birth'' \n     procedure--polls indicate a large majority want to ban it--\n     some questions occur: Is the public reaction really to the \n     procedure, or to late-term abortions in general? And does the \n     public really make a distinction between late second- and \n     third-trimester abortions?\n       Ethicists George Annas, a health law professor at Boston \n     University, and Carol A Tauer, PhD, a philosophy professor at \n     the College of St. Catherine in St. Paul, Minn., say they \n     think the public's intense reaction to the ``partial birth'' \n     abortion issue is probably due more to the public's \n     discomfort with late abortions in general, whether they occur \n     in the second or third trimesters, rather than to just \n     discomfort with a particular technique.\n       If Congress decided to pass a bill banning dismemberment or \n     saline abortions, the public would probably react the same \n     way, Dr. Tauer said. ``The idea of a second-trimester fetus \n     being dismembered in the womb sounds just about as bad.''\n       Abortions don't have to occur in the third trimester to \n     make people uncomfortable, Annas said. In fact, he said, most \n     Americans see ``a distinction between first-trimester and \n     second-trimester abortions. The law doesn't, but people do. \n     And rightfully so.''\n       After 20 weeks or so, he added, the American public sees a \n     baby.\n       ``The American public's vision of this may be much clearer \n     than [that of] the physicians involved.'' Annas said.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes Mr. Campbell, the \nHonorable Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Chair. We in the Chamber may agree or not \nagree with our colleague from Pennsylvania, but, frankly, I know of no \none who would ever question his commitment to his beliefs or the \nability to take on a tough, difficult, emotional issue such as we face \ntoday. It is an issue to which there probably is no universal right \nanswer in the eyes of our fellow Americans.\n  I know that many people have very strong opinions, sometimes driven \nby religion, by culture, by their own experiences, and perhaps I am no \ndifferent than they are, but I do wish to commend the Senator from \nPennsylvania for bringing this to the floor.\n  I wish to speak for a few moments about this extremely emotional and \ndifficult issue of partial-birth abortion. As the Senators from \nCalifornia know--they are not on the floor. I had hoped they would be. \nBut as they know, I have defined myself over the years as pro-choice \nand have supported their efforts in protecting the rights of women in \nalmost every debate in the last 10 years which I have known Senator \nBoxer and in the last 5 that I have known Senator Feinstein. In fact, \nI, like them, have had a 100 percent voting record for NARAL.\n  Last year, I voted with them in opposition to the ban, this ban. I \nhave always believed that all the laws in the world will not prevent a \nwoman from aborting an unwanted fetus. Efforts to prevent it I think \nsimply drive it underground. In fact, I saw that in graphic results \nyears ago on a couple of occasions when I was a policeman in California \nprior to Roe versus Wade.\n  Last year, before the override of the President's veto of the bill \ncame about, I listened very carefully to those who hold very strong \nviews on both sides of the issue. I think I learned a great deal from \nconversations with the medical community about this procedure and its \nimplications. I am certainly not an expert, not a doctor, as is our \nprevious speaker, but I think like most Americans I respect doctors and \nlisten to their views very carefully when it deals with health.\n  Certainly I will never suffer the tragic decision a woman has to make \nwhen she decides whether to terminate or not to terminate a pregnancy. \nBut it did become clear to me that the procedure which would be banned \nis inflicted on a fetus so far along in its development that it is an \ninfant, not a fetus, in the eyes of a layman like me.\n  We are subject, of course, to very emotional debate, charts and \ngraphs that are very explicit and tragic when we look at them, but we \nhave to make a decision based on conscience, and last year I thought I \ndid. When the vote, however, to override came about, I found myself \nconfined to a hospital bed in the little town of Cortez, CO, as a \nresult of an injury I sustained in a vehicle accident. I was there for \na week. I watched C-Span, as so many Americans do. I had a chance to \ntalk to the doctors who were involved in operating on me when I was in \nthe hospital. And in watching the dedicated health professionals in \nthat hospital working so hard day and night to save lives, as the days \nwent by, it became increasingly clear to me that a vote to override the \nveto also represented an effort to save lives and not take lives.\n  I had the opportunity to speak candidly to several of the doctors in \nthat hospital as well as our doctor colleague here and a number of \nothers about how this procedure is done and how often it is used.\n  Mr. President, each of us has to make our own decisions based on our \nown frame of reference with our own conscience as our guide, and so it \nwas with me last year. And although I was in the hospital, I did send a \nstatement to be read into the Record by Senator Dan Coats, our \ncolleague from Indiana, that I would have, had I been here at the time, \nchanged my position and voted to override the President's veto.\n  In recent testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, a key \nwitness on this issue, Dr. Ron Fitzsimmons, another physician whose \nopinion I respect, stated that this procedure is performed more often \nthan he had originally testified, which supports what other doctors had \ntold me. In light of this evidence and the evidence indicating that \nthis procedure is only one among several options that women may elect \nto protect the life and health\n\n[[Page S4449]]\n\nof the mother, this year I intend to support my colleague from \nPennsylvania and support this ban.\n  Now, I probably will not be alone among my colleagues in changing my \nview on this, and I am certainly aware that any time a Senator changes \nhis mind, even if it is based on new evidence, he opens the door to all \nkinds of accusations of flip-flopping, being in someone's pockets, \nselling out, and all the other ludicrous charges that are immediately \nlevied against him or her when he finds new evidence and does change \nhis mind. I can live with that. What I cannot live with is not voting \nmy conscience and will, therefore, vote in support of the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the junior Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair. I rise in support of H.R. 1122, \notherwise referred to as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997.\n  As we have just heard from the previous comments, there are strongly \nheld views on both sides of the abortion issue. I see this every day in \nmy discussions with Coloradans, and I realize that this debate will \ncontinue for a long time. The people of my home State of Colorado know \nthat personally I am pro-life and as a State Senator I had a strong \npro-life voting record. I maintained that strong stance in my 6 years \nin the House of Representatives, and I intend to continue to vote my \nconscience on the issue of abortion during my tenure in the Senate. But \nwhat we have before us today is not an issue that breaks down between \nthe pro-choice camp versus the pro-life camp. Even people in the pro-\nchoice camp believe that there are certain reasonable restrictions that \nshould be placed on abortion. A good example is the restriction that we \nplace on public funding of abortions. Each year pro-life people come \ntogether with pro-choice individuals to include the Hyde amendment \nlanguage in the Labor, HHS appropriations bill so that Medicaid money \nwill not be used to fund abortions. Partial-birth abortions should be \nviewed in a similar light to the public funding issue.\n  Mr. President, in my comments I have just used the term partial-birth \nabortion, and I refer to the bill itself to see how ``partial-birth \nabortion'' is defined in the bill. It is defined in this section, and I \nquote:\n\n       The term ``partial-birth abortion'' means an abortion in \n     which the person performing the abortion partially vaginally \n     delivers--\n\n  In other words, the baby is in the birth canal--\n\n     a living fetus or baby before killing the fetus and \n     completing the delivery.\n\n  So this is a procedure where the baby is in the birth canal and then \nwhoever is doing the procedure kills the baby and then finishes the \ndelivery. Many pro-choice people agree that the partial-birth abortion \nprocedure should be banned, and a general consensus seems to be forming \nthat this is a brutal procedure which should not be tolerated in a \ncivilized society.\n  The reason for this apparent consensus is that it is a medically \nunnecessary, barbaric procedure. In fact, the front page of today's \nWashington Times notes that the American Medical Association's board of \ntrustees has determined that there are no situations in which a \npartial-birth abortion is the only appropriate procedure to induce \nabortion--the only appropriate procedure to induce abortion.\n  It seems likely that President Clinton will bow to political \npressures from the extremes in the pro-choice camp and veto this bill. \nThe House passed this bill H.R. 1122 by a veto-proof margin of 295 to \n136. In the Senate we will likely need 67 votes in order to ban this \nprocedure. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation so \nthat we can ban this brutal procedure.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair.\n  I am proud today to join the Senator from Pennsylvania and my other \ncolleagues in voicing support for H.R. 1122, the Partial-Birth Abortion \nBan Act of 1997. I was an original cosponsor of the Senate version of \nthis bill, and I commend my friends in the other body for passing this \nlegislation by such a compelling majority. I urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to take action and pass this bill by a margin that can withstand \nthe President's threatened veto.\n  Mr. President, we are debating an issue that has an important bearing \non the future of this Nation. Partial-birth abortion is a pivotal issue \nbecause it demands that we decide whether or not we as a civilized \npeople are willing to protect that most fundamental of rights--the \nright to life itself. If we rise to this challenge and safeguard the \nfuture of our Nation's unborn, we will be protecting those whose voices \ncannot yet be heard by the polls and those whose votes cannot yet be \nweighed in the political process. If we fail in our duty, we will \njustly earn the scorn of future generations when they ask why we stood \nidly by and did nothing in the face of this national infanticide.\n  We must reaffirm our commitment to the sanctity of human life in all \nits stages. We took a positive step in that direction a few weeks ago \nby unanimously passing legislation that bans the use of Federal funds \nfor physician-assisted suicide. We can take another step toward \nrestoring our commitment to life by banning partial-birth abortions.\n  In this barbaric procedure, the abortionist pulls a living baby feet \nfirst out of the womb and through the birth canal except for the head, \nwhich is kept lodged just inside the cervix. The abortionist then \npunctures the base of the skull with long surgical scissors and removes \nthe baby's brain with a powerful suction machine. This causes the head \nto collapse, after which the abortionist completes the delivery of the \nnow dead baby. I recount the grisly details of this procedure only to \nremind my colleagues of the seriousness of the issue before the Senate. \nWe must help those unborn children who are unable to help themselves.\n  Opponents of this legislation have relied on distortions to bolster \ntheir position. Just this past February, the executive director of the \nNational Coalition of Abortion Providers, Ron Fitzsimmons, admitted \nthat he lied through his teeth about the true number of partial-birth \nabortions performed in the United States every year. Mr. Fitzsimmons \nhad originally joined Planned Parenthood and the National Abortion and \nReproductive Rights Action League in falsely claiming that this \nabortion procedure was used only in rare cases to save the life of the \nmother. Mr. Fitzsimmons now admits that partial birth abortions are \ncommon and that the vast majority of them are performed in the second \ntrimester--at 4 to 6 months' gestation--on healthy unborn children with \nhealthy mothers. Mr. Fitzsimmons summed up the chilling truth of this \nprocedure when he admitted that partial-birth abortion is ``a form of \nkilling. You're ending a life.''\n  Opponents have argued that this procedure is necessary in some \ncircumstances to save the life of the mother or protect her future \nfertility. These arguments have no foundation in fact. First, this bill \nprovides an exception if the procedure is necessary to save the life of \nthe mother and no alternative procedure could be used for that purpose. \nMoreover, leaders in the medical profession including former Surgeon \nGeneral C. Everett Koop have stated that this procedure is never \nnecessary to save the life of the mother. In fact, it is more dangerous \nmedically to the mother than allowing the child to be born alive. \nFinally, a coalition of over 600 obstetricians, perinatologists, and \nother medical specialists have stated categorically that there is no \nsound medical evidence to support the claim that this procedure is ever \nnecessary to protect a woman's future fertility. These arguments are \noffered as a smoke-screen to obscure the fact that this procedure \nresults in the taking of an innocent life. The practice of partial \nbirth abortions has shocked the conscience of our nation and it must be \nstopped.\n  Since I was sworn in as a Member of this distinguished body in \nJanuary, we have had the opportunity to discuss a number of pieces of \nlegislation which will have a direct impact on our families and our \nchildren. I have based my decision on every bill that has come before \nthis body on what effect it will have on those generations still to \ncome. We in the Senate have deliberated about what steps we can take to\n\n[[Page S4450]]\n\nmake society a better place for our families and the future of our \nchildren. We as Senators will cast no vote that will more directly \naffect the future of our families and our children than the vote we \ncast on this bill.\n  Mr. President, when I ran for office, I promised my constituents I \nwould protect and defend the right to life of the unborn. The sanctity \nof human life is a fundamental issue on which we as a nation should \nfind consensus. It is a right which is counted among the unalienable \nrights in our Nation's Declaration of Independence. We must rise today \nto the challenge that has been laid before us of protecting innocent \nhuman life. I urge my colleagues to join me in casting a vote for life \nby supporting the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act.\n  Now, I know there has been a big change in the approach to the whole \nsituation by Mr. Fitzsimmons, who testified a year ago that this was \nnot a common practice. I know now that he says it is common practice, \nand that is part of the debate that made a big difference on the House \nside, and I am convinced it will make a big difference on the Senate \nside, someone who is admitting that this is a common practice, that it \ntakes lives and that he regrets what he said and what has been done as \na result. I think that will make a difference in the vote we have over \nhere, and I hope it will make a difference in the approach that the \nPresident takes to the bill.\n  I would like to concentrate my remarks on the miracle of life. A year \nand a half ago, I had a torn heart valve and was rushed to the hospital \nfor emergency surgery. I had never been in a hospital except to visit \nsick folks before. I have to tell you that I am impressed with what \nthey were able to do, but I have also been impressed with what doctors \ndo not know. That is not a new revelation for me.\n  Over 24 years ago, a long time ago, my wife and I were expecting our \nfirst child. Then one day early in the sixth month of pregnancy, my \nwife starting having pains and contractions. We took her to the doctor. \nThe doctor said, ``Oh, you may have a baby right now. We know it's \nearly and that doesn't bode well. We will try to stop it. We can \nprobably stop it.'' I had started storing up books for my wife for 3 \nmonths waiting for the baby to come. However, the baby came that night, \nweighing just a little over 2 pounds. The doctor's advice to us was to \nwait until morning and see if she lives. They said they didn't have any \ncontrol over it.\n  I could not believe the doctors could not stop premature birth. Then \nI could not believe that they could not do something to help this \nnewborn baby. Until you see one of those babies, you will not believe \nwhat a 6-month-old baby looks like. At the same time my wife gave birth \nto our daughter, another lady gave birth to a 10-pound baby. This was a \nsmall hospital in Wyoming so they were side by side in the \nnursery. Some of the people viewing the other baby said, ``Oh, look at \nthat one. Looks like a piece of rope with some knots in it. Too bad.'' \nAnd we watched her grasp and gasp for air with every breath, and we \nwatched her the whole night to see if she would live.\n\n  Then the next day they were able to take this baby to a hospital \nwhich provided excellent care. She was supposed to be flown to Denver \nwhere the best care in the world was available, but it was a Wyoming \nblizzard and we couldn't fly. So we took a car from Gillette, WY, to \nthe center of the State to Wyoming's biggest hospital, to get the best \nkind of care we could find. We ran out of oxygen on the way. We had the \nhighway patrol looking for us and all along the way, we were watching \nevery breath of that child.\n  After receiving exceptional care the doctor said, ``Well, another 24 \nhours and we will know something.'' After that 24 hours there were \nseveral times we went to the hospital and there was a shroud around the \nisolette. We would knock on the window, and the nurses would come over \nand say, ``It's not looking good. We had to make her breathe again.'' \nOr, ``Have you had the baby baptized?''\n  We had the baby baptized in the first few minutes after birth. But \nthat child worked and struggled to live. She was just a 6-month-old--3 \nmonths premature.\n  We went through 3 months of waiting to get her out of the hospital. \nEach step of the way the doctors said this isn't our doing. It gave me \na new outlook on life. Now I want to tell you the good news. The good \nnews is that the little girl is now an outstanding English teacher in \nWyoming. She is dedicated to teaching seventh and ninth graders \nEnglish, and she is loving every minute of every day. The only problem \nshe had was that the isolette hum wiped out a range of tones for her, \nso she cannot hear the same way that you and I do. But she can lip read \nvery well, which, in the classroom, is very good if the kids are trying \nto whisper. But that has given me an appreciation for all life and that \nexperience continues to influence my vote now and on all issues of \nprotecting human life.\n  When I first came to the Senate, we talked about cloning. I thought \ncloning had been going on for a long time. Of course, we used to call \nit identical twins, and it was pretty unpredictable. But I want to tell \nyou, through all of that cloning, nobody produced life. They took life \nand they changed it.\n  Life is such a miracle that we have to respect it and work for it \nevery single day in every way we can. I think this bill will help in \nthat effort, and I ask for your support for this bill.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, first let me congratulate the Senator \nfrom Wyoming for that very touching story about his daughter. I \ncongratulate him for his courage in standing up for her and fighting \nfor her and his willingness to share that with us and his support of \nthis legislation.\n  I also would like to thank the junior Senator from Colorado, Senator \nAllard, for his excellent statement in support of this measure.\n  I want to cite specifically the senior Senator from Colorado, Senator \nBen Nighthorse Campbell. Last year I very vividly remember receiving a \ncall from Senator Coats about Ben sitting in a hospital room in \nColorado, watching the debate and talking to doctors and seeing so many \npeople do so much to save life, and his incredibly insightful comments \nabout how he could watch through his door efforts to save life and then \nlook up on the television screen and see C-SPAN and see people who \nwanted to extinguish life. That conflicted him and disturbed him.\n  It is a very hard thing, it is a very hard thing in politics for \nsomeone on the abortion issue to walk out of a camp. This issue is a \nvery polarized issue. You are in one camp or the other. You are pro-\nlife or you are pro-choice and you don't waffle. You don't walk down \nthe middle of this one or you get run over. It takes a lot of courage \nto walk out of that camp because you know they are wrong.\n\n  A lot of folks are struggling with this issue today. They are \nfighting themselves in looking at this issue. They don't feel \ncomfortable being in this camp against this bill. But it takes courage \nto step out and do the right thing for you, do the right thing \naccording to your conscience, the right thing according to what you \nbelieve is best for America. It has political risks, tremendous \npolitical risks. You alienate your friends, you open yourself up to \nattack.\n  But I think it just shows a tremendous amount of courage and \ncommitment to your principles, to stand up to your friends. It is easy \nto stand up to your opponents. We do that all the time. But when you \nstand up and face the people that you have supported on issue after \nissue and say, ``This time you are wrong,'' do you know how hard that \nis? You know in your own lives, anybody listening here knows how \ndifficult it is to talk to a friend and say, ``You know, I have been \nwith you,'' and just say, on something they care about, they deeply \ncare about, ``You are wrong and I cannot be with you.'' It is great \ncourage, the courage of convictions. I applaud him for doing that in a \nvery dramatic and sensitive way.\n  Finally, I thank the Senator from Tennessee, Senator Frist, the only \nphysician in the Senate who articulated, not just from a medical point \nof view but from a moral point of view, why this ban is absolutely \nnecessary and why this procedure is absolutely unnecessary for any \nreason to be performed on anyone.\n  So, we have just begun this debate. Unfortunately, as soon as some \nother\n\n[[Page S4451]]\n\nSenators come down here to start the next--I see the Senator from North \nCarolina is here. I will move on. We will have to break off the debate \nfor a short period of time. I hope we will have more time to debate \nlater this evening, and then, pursuant to this unanimous consent that I \nwill read, we will move tomorrow at 11 o'clock to reconsideration of \nthis bill, bringing this bill back up for consideration, and debate the \nBoxer amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time between 11 a.m. \nand 2 p.m. on Thursday be equally divided for debate regarding the \nFeinstein amendment to H.R. 1122, that no amendment be in order to the \nFeinstein amendment, and, further, at the hour of 2 p.m., the Senate \nproceed to a vote on or in relation to the Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in executive session I ask unanimous-\nconsent the Senate now proceed to the consideration of Executive \nCalendar No. 2, the Treaty Doc. No. 105-5, the CFE Treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Treaty Document 105-5, Flank Document Agreement to the \n     Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished senior \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair very much. Mr. President, may I ask that \nthe unanimous-consent be stated as to time on this resolution of \nratification?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 1\\1/2\\ hours equally divided between \nthe chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and the ranking member.\n  Mr. HELMS. Senator Byrd has some time, too?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And an additional 30 minutes for Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. HELMS. Very well. I do thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee this past Thursday reported a \ntreaty to amend the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty. The \nvote was unanimous.\n  I have never hesitated to oppose, or seek to modify, treaties that \nignore the best interests of the American people. As long as I am a \nMember of the U.S. Senate, I will be mindful of the advice and consent \nresponsibilities conferred upon the Senate and the Senators by the U.S. \nConstitution. Therefore, I have never hesitated to oppose bad treaties \nand bad resolutions of ratification without hesitation. But when a \ntreaty serves the Nation's interests, if it is verifiable, and if the \nresolution of ratification ensures the integrity of these two points \nfor the life of the treaty, I unfailingly offer my support to it. That \nis why I support the treaty before us today.\n  In that connection, let the record show that the pending treaty was \nsigned on May 31, 1996, and was not submitted by the President to the \nSenate for our advice and consent April 7, 1997. With the bewildering \ndelay in the delivery of this treaty, the administration demanded \naction by May 15, 1997, which is tomorrow.\n  So, after wasting an entire year, the administration demanded that \nthe Senate act on this treaty within 1 month's time. I believe it is \nobvious that the Foreign Relations Committee has been more than helpful \nin fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities to advise and \nconsent.\n  The treaty before us today is a modification of the treaty approved \nby the Senate in 1991. Specifically, it will revise the obligations of \nUkraine and Russia in what is known as the flank zone of the former \nSoviet Union. In recognition of the changes having occurred since the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union, the 30 parties to the CFE Treaty have \nagreed to modify the obligations of Ukraine and Russia.\n  The 1991 CFE Treaty could not and did not anticipate the dissolution \nof the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, let alone the expansion of \nNATO to include Central and Eastern Europe countries. Consequently, \nrecent years have been occupied with efforts to adapt the treaty to the \nnew security environment of its members.\n  Mr. President, in its essentials, the Flank Agreement removes several \nadministrative districts from the old flank zone, thus permitting \ncurrent flank equipment ceilings to apply to a smaller area. In \naddition, Russia now has until May 1999 to reduce its forces sufficient \nto meet the new limit.\n  To provide some counterbalance to these adjustments, reporting \nrequirements were enhanced and inspection rights in the zone increased.\n  Mr. President, with the protections, interpretations, and monitoring \nrequirements contained in the resolution of ratification, I recommend \napproval of this treaty because it sets reasonable limits and provides \nadequate guarantees to ensure implementation.\n  However, the simple act of approving this treaty does not diminish \nthe need for further steps by the U.S. Government to strengthen the \nsecurity of those countries located on Russia's borders. If this \nagreement is not implemented properly, Russia will retain its existing \nmilitary means to intimidate its neighbors--a pattern of behavior with \nstark precedents.\n  As the Clinton administration is so fond of saying, this treaty is \nbut a tool to implement the foreign policy of the United States. During \nthe past 4 years, the Clinton administration has remained silent while \nRussia has encroached upon the territory and sovereignty of its \nneighbors. It was the lack of a foreign policy--not a lack of tools--\nthat allowed this to happen.\n  I have confidence that the new Secretary of State will correct the \ncourse of our policies toward Russia, and I gladly support this treaty \nto aid the Honorable Madeleine Albright in that endeavor. The collapse \nof the Soviet Union was one of the finest moments of the 20th century. \nTo allow even a partial restoration of the Soviet Union before the turn \nof the century would be a failure of an even greater magnitude.\n  Mr. President, a final and related issue in the resolution of \nratification is one upholding the prerogatives of the Senate in matters \nrelated to the ABM Treaty. During the past few years, the executive \nbranch has sought to erode the Senate's constitutional role of advice \nand consent regarding treaties. In fact, the executive branch \noriginally refused to submit for advice and consent the treaty that is \nbefore the Senate today. Through protracted negotiations, the Senate \nsuccessfully asserted its proper role to advise and consent to new, \ninternational treaty obligations. Likewise, on revisions to the ABM \nTreaty, it is only through a legally binding mandate that we can ensure \nthe proper, constitutional role of the U.S. Senate. I hope, Mr. \nPresident, that we can proceed to do that without delay. Mr. President, \nI ask for the yeas and nays on the resolution of ratification.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I believe the Senator from Delaware wishes to speak.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me begin by acknowledging what the \nSenator and chairman of the committee said, and that is that this \ntreaty has been around a long time, and all of a sudden it came popping \nup here. Some of us, like the Senator from North Carolina and the \nmajority leader and others, myself included, have felt it is a Senate \nprerogative to determine whether or not this flank agreement should be \nagreed to. It is an amendment to the treaty. The administration for a \nlong time concluded it was not a prerogative of the Senate, and it was \nnot necessary to submit this treaty.\n  Some have asked, why are we acting so expeditiously on this treaty? \nWhy is there this deadline? Two reasons: One, we waited a long time to \nagree we had the responsibility to accede to this or it could not \noccur, and, two, there is a real May 15 deadline by which all 30 \nnations must ratify this agreement. If, in fact, they do not, the \nagreement will have to be reviewed by all of them.\n\n[[Page S4452]]\n\n  We are right now dealing with the enlargement of NATO, we are now \ndealing with the NATO-Russia Charter, and if it looks as though the \nUnited States is reneging on this flank agreement, it can just create a \nlot of confusion.\n  Having said that, had I been chairman of the committee rather than \nthe ranking member and had it been a Republican President, I probably \nwould have spent more time chastising the administration than the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina. He just rolled up his \nsleeves and said, ``OK, this is a necessary and important treaty,'' and \ndidn't spend a lot of time in recriminations about why it took so long \nto get here. I thank him for that, and I thank him for the way in which \nhe moved this. I doubt there is any treaty or change in a treaty as \nsignificant as this that has moved as rapidly through the Foreign \nRelations Committee with as studied an approach as under the leadership \nof my colleague from North Carolina.\n  Mr. President, nearly 6 years ago, as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEuropean Affairs, I managed the ratification of the original CFE \nagreement for the then Democratic chairman of the committee. The treaty \nwas, I believe then and I believe now, a monumental achievement, \ncapping some two decades of negotiations between NATO and Warsaw Pact \ncountries to establish a secure conventional military balance in \nEurope. I would argue, it was sort of the prelude to the undoing of our \nadversary at the time, the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact.\n  Mr. President, the treaty has succeeded as few other arms reduction \nmeasures have. Since 1992, it has fundamentally altered the military \nlandscape from the Atlantic to the Urals, dramatically reducing the \nnumber of pieces of equipment that could be used to wage war.\n  In the last 5 years, the CFE Treaty has resulted in the removal or \ndestruction of more than 53,000 pieces of heavy equipment, including \ntanks, artillery, armored combat vehicles, attack helicopters, and \ncombat aircraft.\n  Since 1991, of course, the political face of Europe has changed \ndramatically. These developments had an impact on the relevance and \npotential durability of the CFE Treaty. Particularly effective were the \nso-called flank limits. To the average citizen out there, a flank limit \nis not much different than a flank steak or flank cut. The fact of the \nmatter is, it has real significance; it is very important.\n  The flank limits were included to prevent military equipment that was \nremoved from Central Europe from being concentrated elsewhere. We set \nlimits on how much equipment could be set on that inter-German border, \nwhich we necessarily focused on for so many years. As that equipment \nwas removed or destroyed, what we did not want to have happen is to \nhave the Soviets take that equipment and move it into the flanks, \nmoving it on the Turkish border or moving it up by Norway and having a \npredominance of force accumulated there.\n  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia began to argue that \nthe treaty, particularly the so-called flank limits, did not adequately \nreflect its security needs in the flank zone. We had placed limits on \nwhat type of equipment and how much could be placed in these flanks. \nHad I a map, I would reference it, but the fact of the matter is, we \nput limits on this. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia \nbegan to argue that the treaty, particularly the flank limits, did not \nadequately reflect its security needs in the flank zone.\n\n  Put another way, all those folks in the Caucasus and Transcaucasus \nare now independent countries. When this was negotiated, they weren't \npart of the deal. They weren't part of the deal, and it was some Soviet \ngeneral in Moscow deciding what could and could not be done in those \ncountries.\n  Now the Russians come back and say, ``Hey, wait, this isn't the deal \nwe signed on to.'' Russell Long--a great Senator who the Senator from \nNorth Carolina remembers well, but not nearly as well as the Senator \nfrom West Virginia sitting behind me--one of Russell Long's many \nexpressions used to be, ``I ain't for no deal I ain't in on.'' All of a \nsudden, the Russians realized that they had signed on to a deal that, \nin a strong way, they were no longer in on, as it related to what was \nleft of the Soviet Union.\n  Consequently, the NATO alliance agreed to negotiations on revising \nthese flank limits, and the result was the agreement before us now \nknown as the Flank Document that was signed by 30 states parties--a \nfancy term for saying 30 countries--to the treaty in Vienna on May 31, \n1996. Reiterating the point made by my friend from North Carolina, this \nwas signed a year ago, 1996. I believe that our negotiators, while \nmeeting some Russian concerns, did an excellent job of protecting the \ninterests of this country and the democracies on the northern and \nsouthern flanks of the former Soviet Union.\n  The CFE Flank Document removes some areas from what we call the old \nflank zone, but maintains constraints on equipment both in the new \nflank zone and in the old one. There are also limits on armored combat \nvehicles in each area that were removed from the old flank zone so as \nto prevent any tremendous concentration of equipment in any one place.\n  We all are concerned about Russian troop deployments outside its \nborders, Mr. President. We cannot allow Moscow to coerce its \nindependent neighbors into accepting the presence of foreign forces on \ntheir soil or into giving up their own rights to military equipment, \nwhich would now be folded into this total limit.\n  But I believe the Flank Document and the resolution of ratification \nnow before the Senate addresses these concerns and recognizes that \nsovereign countries must have the right to refuse Russian demands. \nIndeed, the chairman and I have found common ground on most of the \nissues in this resolution.\n  There are a total of, if I am not mistaken, 14 conditions, Mr. \nPresident. Two of these conditions of ratification, however, I think \nare extraneous and give me some concern. Of the 14, there are only two \nthat I would flag for my colleagues, and I am not going to move to \nstrike either one of them. I am not going to move to do anything about \nit. I just want to make the point of why I think they are unnecessary \nor counterproductive.\n  The first is condition 5, which includes a provision calling for a \nspecial report on possible noncompliance of the CFE Treaty by Armenia. \nI regret that this provision was included in the resolution at the \ninsistence of the majority, but I am pleased that we have reached an \nagreement through the efforts of Senator John Kerry and Senator \nSarbanes--and I am sure if they reached an agreement they must have run \nit by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia or it would not have \nbeen agreed to--to mitigate the one-sided nature of this original \nagreement.\n  More troubling, though, is condition 9. I will not speak more about \ncondition 5 in the interest of time. Condition 9 also is insisted upon \nby the majority, and I note from a brief discussion, while working out \nyesterday out of the Senate environs with my distinguished friend from \nVirginia, that he feels very strongly about, and I happen to disagree \nwith him on it.\n\n  Condition 9 requires the President to submit an agreement which will \nmultilateralize the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to the Senate \nfor advice and consent. Put another way, there is a condition placed on \nhere, very skillfully, I might add, by my friends who have concerns \nabout the ABM Treaty that has nothing to do with this flank agreement. \nI was of the view it should not be included as part of a condition to \nthis treaty. I did not have the votes. I must say to my friend from \nNorth Carolina, it is not merely because I hope I am a gentleman that I \nam not attempting to remove the condition, I do not have the votes to \nremove the condition, so I am not going to attempt to do something that \nI know will not prevail. But, I would like to point out, the condition \nis titled ``Senate Prerogatives.'' The title is interesting but, I \nthink, inaccurate.\n  I take a back seat to no one when it comes to Senate prerogatives. As \na matter of fact, it was the Byrd-Biden amendment attached to the INF \nTreaty. We have been jealous of the protection of our constitutional \nobligations and responsibilities. With all due respect, and it sounds \nself-serving, but I take a back seat to no one in the Senate in terms \nof protecting the constitutional obligations and responsibilities of \nthe Senate. But in this case, I do not\n\n[[Page S4453]]\n\nthink we have a prerogative to exercise, notwithstanding condition 9 is \ncalled ``Senate Prerogatives.''\n  The issue involves two powers: recognition of successor states and \nthe power to interpret and implement treaties, both of which are \nexecutive functions.\n  Mr. President, it is undisputed that the President has the exclusive \npower, under the powers of article 2 of the Constitution, to recognize \nnew states. I am not going to take a long time on this, so don't \neverybody worry I am in for a long constitutional discussion; I am only \ngoing to spend another 3 or 4 minutes, but I want to make the point for \nthe Record. Under article 2, section 2 of the Constitution, the \nPresident and the Senate have a shared duty to ``make treaties.'' But \nonce the treaty is made, it is the law of the land, and the President, \nunder article 2, section 3, has the duty to take care that it is \nfaithfully executed.\n  In exercising this duty, it is for the President to determine whether \na treaty remains in force, a determination that, of necessity, must be \nmade whenever a state dissolves.\n  So what are we talking about here? We had an ABM Treaty and CFE \nTreaty with the former Soviet Union. The Soviet Union dissolved. And \nthe question remains, all those constituent countries that are now \nindependent countries, is the President able to recognize Ukraine, for \nexample, and, as a consequence, recognize the Ukrainians' assertion \nthat they want to be part of the ABM Treaty? They were part of it when \nthey were part of the whole Soviet Union, but as the constituent parts \nbroke apart, the question was: As each individual country within that \nwhole signs on to the continued commitment to ABM, does that require \nratification by the United States Senate with each of them again? I \nwould argue, and I will argue at a later date--I am sure we will hear \nmore of this--that it does not require that. It is not a Senate \nprerogative.\n  In the case before us, the ABM Treaty, the President has the power to \ndeclare whether Russia and the other New Independent States inherit the \ntreaty obligations of the former Soviet Union, provided those states \nindicate a desire to do so and provided that the succession agreement \neffects no substantive change in the terms of the treaty.\n  Both the Bush and Clinton administrations exercised this power \nfollowing the breakup of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, \nand Ethiopia as it relates to other issues, not as it relates to ABM. \nMoreover, it bears emphasis that the two arms control treaties, the CFE \nTreaty and the INF Treaty, were multilateralized by the executive \naction without the advice and consent of the Senate. By definition, we \nare all here, we are not asking for multilateralization of the flank \nagreement. It is somewhat curious that we say ABM requires the Senate \nto have a treaty vote on every successor nation, but on CFE, which we \nall like and we have no substantive disagreement on, we are not asking \nfor that.\n\n  So the point I am making is that this condition has nothing to do \nwith CFE and it is more about whether you like ABM or do not like ABM, \nnot about who has what constitutional responsibility, I respectfully \nsuggest.\n  I agree with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the \nother side of the issue in one respect, that this is the subject of \nlegitimate debate. But the debate, which I am confident we can win on \nthe merits, can readily be conducted at another time on a more germane \nsubject than a treaty that it has nothing to do with. Nonetheless, the \nmajority insisted upon this extraneous condition, and I think I can \ncount votes.\n  I will never forget going to former Chairman Eastland as a young \nmember of the Judiciary Committee asking for his support. He sat behind \nhis desk, I say to the chairman of the committee, and said, ``Did you \ncount?'' I didn't understand what he said.\n  I said, ``I beg your pardon, Mr. Chairman?''\n  He took that cigar out--I was asking to be chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Criminal Laws, because Senator McClellan had just \npassed away and, for years, it had been his job. It was a contest \nbetween me and another Senator.\n  I was looking at him, and he said, ``Did you count?'' I seriously did \nnot understand what he was saying. ``I beg your pardon?'' I said. I \ntried to be humorous. I said, ``Mr. Chairman, I don't speak Southern \nvery well.'' He smiled and looked at me, and he took the cigar out of \nhis mouth, and said, ``Son, when you have counted, come back and talk \nto me.''\n  Well, I learned to count. The reason I am not contesting this now, as \nI said, I counted. I do not have the votes at this moment to remove \ncondition 9 and still get this treaty up and out of here in time. So I \nwill reserve that fight for another day.\n  Despite the inclusion of condition 9, I will strongly support the \nflank agreement because of its integral role in protecting American \ninterests in maintaining security and stability in Europe. Indeed, the \nFlank Document we will be voting on is an important bridge to the \nbroader revision of the CFE Treaty now under discussion as we talk \nabout the enlargement of NATO. Those talks will allow us to achieve \nfurther reductions in military equipment in Europe and ensure that the \nconfidence-building measures embodied in the CFE Treaty remain in \nplace.\n  Mr. President, the CFE Treaty is just one component of the \narchitecture of arrangements, including NATO, the Partnership for \nPeace, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, all of \nwhich are designed to ensure that in the post-cold war era, the \nEuropean nations remain free and independent and are partners in a zone \nof security and prosperity.\n  But by maintaining the integrity of the CFE Treaty, we maintain the \nforum in which an enlarged NATO will make clear to Russia that our \nobjective is stability in Europe, not military intimidation. \nRatification of the flank agreement is a modest but important step \ntoward the new European security system.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to do two things--thank the chairman of \nthe full committee for expediting this, and when we get very shortly to \na vote on it, to vote their advice and consent to ratification.\n  I thank again the chairman of the full committee.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator from Delaware.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 41 minutes 42 seconds.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia [Mr. Warner].\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the \nsenior Senator from North Carolina. May I join others in urging that \nthe Senate give its advice and consent to this very important treaty, a \ntreaty brought forward by the leadership of the chairman and the \ndistinguished ranking member at a critical time in the ever-increasing \ndebates regarding Europe, whether it be NATO expansion or other issues.\n  I was prepared today to go toe to toe with my good friend, the \nranking member of this committee, the Senator from Delaware, on the \nquestion of condition 9. I have spent a good portion of my career in \nthe Senate on the question of the ABM Treaty. I think it was a very \nwise addition to this particular resolution of ratification, a \nprovision, condition 9, that addresses the issue of the \nmultilateralization of the ABM Treaty.\n  I go back to the Fiscal Year 1995 Defense Authorization Act, section \n232. It was my privilege to introduce that provision as an amendment to \nthat bill. That provision provided:\n\n       The United States shall not be bound by any international \n     agreement entered into by the President that would \n     ``substantively'' modify the ABM Treaty unless this agreement \n     is entered [into] pursuant to the treaty making power of the \n     President under the Constitution.\n\n  That is section 232 of the Fiscal Year 1995 Defense Authorization \nAct. That is precisely, really a recitation, of what condition 9 \nrequires--follow the law of the land. President Clinton signed section \n232 into law, and yet, time and again, this President claims exemptions \nfrom the requirement to submit to the Senate agreements which clearly \nchange the rights and obligations of the United States under the ABM \nTreaty.\n\n[[Page S4454]]\n\n  For years, I have joined a number in this Chamber, primarily the \nRepublicans, in insisting that the ``demarcation'' agreement, which the \nadministration is currently completing in negotiations with the \nRussians, represents again another ``substantive'' change to the ABM \nTreaty that must be submitted to the Senate. I am pleased that the \nadministration has at long last acknowledged that very fact and has \nagreed to bring that demarcation agreement before this body for the \nadvice-and-consent responsibility entrusted to the Senate by the \nConstitution.\n  I, like the Senator from Delaware, was concerned about the use of the \nword ``prerogative'' in condition 9. I view the advice and consent role \nas an obligation of the U.S. Senate under the Constitution of the \nUnited States. It is an obligation that we must exercise in cases such \nas the demarcation and the multilateralization of the ABM Treaty.\n  I ask my colleagues to indulge me just for a minute. I go back to May \n1972, a quarter of a century ago. As a much younger man, I was \nprivileged to be a part of the delegation, headed by the President of \nthe United States, that went to Moscow for the summit which culminated \nin the signing of SALT I, the ABM Treaty and other agreements. The \nparticular matter for which I had primary responsibility was the \nIncidents at Sea Executive Agreement, which was also signed at that \ntime.\n  I had been in the Pentagon as Secretary of the Navy during the course \nof the negotiation of the ABM Treaty. As such, I have spent a good deal \nof my career, beginning with the inception of that treaty to date, in \ntrying to analyze it and defend it. I think it is a valuable part of \nour overall arms control relationship with the then-Soviet Union and \ntoday Russia. But there is a limit to which that treaty should be \napplied to other activities that this Nation must now undertake--\nactivities that were not contemplated at the time the treaty was \nnegotiated.\n  One of those activities--and I do not know of a more important one--\nis to protect the men and women of the Armed Forces when they are \ndeployed abroad, and any number of civilians in their positions abroad, \nfrom the ever-growing threat of short-range ballistic missiles.\n  Hopefully, this year we will forge ahead and finally clarify--\nclarify--the misunderstandings about what the ABM Treaty was intended \nto do and what it was not intended to do on this issue. I have talked \nto so many of my colleagues who were in that delegation a quarter of a \ncentury ago who had a primary responsibility for the ABM Treaty. One \nafter one they will tell you that they never envisioned at that time, \nfrom a technological standpoint, this new class of weapons, namely, the \nshort-range ballistic missiles, and that that treaty was never intended \nto apply to those missiles.\n  As the Senator from Delaware said, there will be another day on which \nwe can have that debate on the issue of that treaty's application to \nthe current research and development now underway to develop and deploy \nthose systems desperately needed in the Armed Forces of the United \nStates to protect us from the short-range threat, an ever-growing \nthreat, which is proliferating across the world.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee did precisely what it should have \ndone: included in as condition 9 the protection of future debate on the \nABM Treaty such that the U.S. Senate can make the decisions as to \nwhether or not there are successions to the ABM Treaty by other \nnations.\n  The ABM Treaty was contemplated, negotiated, and signed as a \nbilateral treaty. It was approved by the Senate as a bilateral treaty. \nIt strains credibility for the administration to now argue that the \nconversion of that treaty from a bilateral to a multilateral treaty is \nnot a ``significant'' change to warrant Senate advice and consent.\n  At the time this treaty was negotiated, no one involved in the \nnegotiations could ever have envisioned the dissolution of the Soviet \nUnion in their lifetimes--much less within 20 years. Likewise, \ntechnical advances in the areas of both strategic offensive and \ndefensive systems could not be adequately anticipated. That is why the \ntreaty has provisions for amendment to adapt it to changing times \ncircumstances, and technologies. I am personally of the view that this \ntreaty should have been--and still needs to be--amended to allow the \nUnited States to protect its citizens, stationed abroad from short-\nrange ballistic missile attacks which were not contemplated 25 years \nago. But I also strongly believe that any amendment which alters U.S. \nrights and obligations--any substantive changes--must be submitted to \nthe Senate for advice and consent.\n  We could argue for days about the international legal principles and \nrequirements in this area. But one thing is clear--domestic law on this \nissue is unambiguous. Section 232 of the fiscal year 1995 Defense \nauthorization bill, which I referred to earlier, clearly requires the \nPresident to submit for Senate advice and consent any international \nagreement which substantively modifies the ABM Treaty.\n  It is clear that multilateralization would constitute a substantive \nchange to the ABM Treaty. For 25 years, this has been a bilateral \ntreaty. If new parties are added, the geographic boundaries, which \ngovern many aspects of the treaty, would be changed. Existing U.S. \nrights under the treaty to amend it by bilateral agreement would be \nlost. The draft memorandum of understanding on succession, the three \nnew states parties will be given full voting rights in the Standing \nConsultative Commission [SCC], the body which supervises treaty \nimplementation and negotiates amendments to the treaty. According to \nthe guidelines of the SCC, changes to the ABM Treaty can only be made \nthrough a consensus of the parties. That means that any one of these \nthree new states parties could block United States efforts to amend \nthis treaty to allow for effective missile defenses to deal with \ncurrent threats--even if the Russians agree to the changes.\n  The succession issue with the states of the former Soviet Union has \nbeen handled on a case-by-case basis. In the case of the CFE Treaty and \nthe START I Treaty, the Senate specifically addressed the succession \nissue during consideration of the resolutions of ratification for those \ntreaties. INF succession was handled without Senate involvement. It is \nclear that the matter of succession--far from being a legal absolute--\nis, at best, a murky legal issue.\n  The unique status of the ABM Treaty was highlighted in the 1994 \nlegislation requiring Senate advice and consent of any international \nagreement that ``substantively'' modifies the ABM Treaty. This is not \nthe case for the hundreds of other treaties we had in effect with the \nformer Soviet Union.\n  Since the ABM Treaty reinterpretation debate of the late 1980's, the \nDemocrats have insisted that any change to a treaty that differs from \nwhat was presented to the Senate at the time of ratification must be \nresubmitted to the Senate or the Congress for approval. \nMultilateralization of the ABM Treaty is not simply a reinterpretation \nof the treaty, it is a substantive change to the treaty text. By the \nDemocrats own standards, such a change should clearly require Senate \nadvice and consent.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the comments by the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee. I must \nsay for the record that I also enjoy the privilege of working with him. \nI think the committee has been more active in the last year or two than \nit has been for some time. But in any case, I am grateful to Senator \nBiden.\n  Mr. President, the history of the succession agreements to the \nvarious treaties concluded between the United States and the Soviet \nUnion further supports the case for Senate consideration of ABM \nmultilateralization. In only one case was advice and consent not \nrequired for multilateralization on an arms control treaty. Because the \nINF Treaty carried the so-called negative obligation of not possessing \nany intermediate-range nuclear missiles, that treaty could be \nmultilateralized without altering any treaty terms or imposing any new \ntreaty rights or obligations on the United States or new parties.\n  Multilateralization of the START I Treaty under the Lisbon Protocol, \non the other hand, required Senate advice\n\n[[Page S4455]]\n\nand consent because this change had clear implications for the treaty's \ntext and object and purpose. The Lisbon Protocol determined the extent \nto which countries other than Russia would be allowed to possess \nstrategic nuclear weapons. Similarly, ratification of the Lisbon \nProtocol also effectively determined successorship questions to the \nTreaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT. Under that \nprotocol, Belarus and other countries agreed to a legally binding \ncommitment to join the NPT as nonnuclear weapons states. Thus when the \nSenate offered its advice and consent to the Lisbon Protocol, it \napproved successorship to both the INF and the START treaties.\n  Finally, the Senate specifically considered the question of \nmultilateralization of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in \nEurope under condition 5 of the resolution of ratification for the CFE \nTreaty.\n  Under article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution, the Senate \nholds a co-equal treaty-making power. John Jay made one of the most \ncogent arguments in this respect, noting:\n\n       Of course, treaties could be amended, but let us not forget \n     that treaties are made not only by one of the contracting \n     parties, but by both, and consequently that as the consent of \n     both was essential to their formation at first, so must it \n     ever afterwards be in order to alter . . . them.\n\n  Now, my colleagues of the Senate may disagree on the wisdom of \ncontinuing the national strategy embodied in the ABM Treaty. Where I \nhope all of our colleagues could agree, however, is on the imperative \nof upholding the constitutional responsibilities of the Senate, as \nreposed in this body by the Founding Fathers.\n  Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated:\n\n       The accretion of dangerous power does not come in a day. It \n     does come, however, slowly, from the generative force of \n     unchecked disregard of the restrictions that fence in even \n     the most disinterested assertion of authority.\n\n  I know the administration has demonstrated nothing if not disregard \nfor the Senate's constitutional authority. The Senate's duty with \nregard to the issue of ABM multilateralization is, I believe, Mr. \nPresident, clear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  How much time does the distinguished Senator from Texas want?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I do not know what the time limitations are. At least \n10 minutes, in your range, or I could cut it back.\n  Mr. HELMS. If the Senator could do with 8 minutes, I think I could \ncover everybody, and the distinguished President pro tempore.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I need about 10 minutes. I can ask for extra time.\n  Mr. HELMS. Why don't you proceed.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will be happy to yield to the distinguished \nSenator.\n  Mr. HELMS. I say to Senator Thurmond, you have been yielded to by the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Would you like to go next, Mr. Chairman?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Whatever suits you.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. After him, if I could have 8 to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the CFE Flank \nDocument resolution of ratification. My support of the CFE Flank \nDocument is based largely upon the 14 conditions that the Foreign \nRelations Committee attached to the resolution of ratification. I am \nparticularly pleased that the Foreign Relations Committee included \ncondition 9, which deals with the Senate's prerogatives on \nmultilateralization of the ABM Treaty. This has been an issue with \nwhich the Armed Services Committee has been deeply involved for many \nyears.\n  I would strongly oppose any effort to dilute or eliminate condition 9 \nfrom the resolution of ratification. Condition 9 does not take a \nposition, as such, on the ABM Treaty or treaty succession. It simply \nseeks to protect the Senate's prerogatives in case the treaty is \nsubstantively changed. I find it difficult to believe that any Member \nof this body would be opposed to this objective. In my view, it is a \nsolemn and fundamental obligation of a Senator to consistently guard \nthe rights and prerogatives of the Senate, regardless of which \npolitical party may occupy the White House at any given time.\n   Mr. President, although international law is ambiguous on the \nquestion of treaty succession, the U.S. Constitution and statutory law \nis clear. As section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 1995 states, ``the United States shall not be bound by any \ninternational agreement entered into by the President that would \nsubstantively modify the ABM Treaty unless the agreement is entered \npursuant to the treaty making power of the President under the \nConstitution.'' This provision originated as an amendment sponsored by \nSenator Warner of Virginia and Senator Wallop of Wyoming, two of the \nSenate's foremost experts on the ABM Treaty.\n  Notwithstanding the administration's assertion that treaty succession \nis an executive branch responsibility, or any argument that one might \nderive from international law, the real issue is simple and clear. Only \none overarching question needs to be answered: Does multilateralization \nof the ABM Treaty constitute a substantive change to the treaty? If so, \nthe President has no choice, under the law and the Constitution, other \nthan to submit such an agreement to the Senate for advice and consent.\n  Ironically, those who have asserted that the President does not need \nto submit the multilateralization agreement to the Senate for advice \nand consent have not even attempted to answer the one relevant \nquestion: Is it a substantive change or not? Instead they have chosen \nto base their views strictly on ambiguity-laden international law and a \nsimple assertion of executive prerogative.\n  If one carefully analyzes the issues associated with ABM Treaty \nmultilateralization, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the \nABM Treaty will indeed be modified in several substantive ways. The \nconferees to the fiscal year 1997 Defense Authorization Act recognized \nthis in stating that ``the accord on ABM Treaty succession, tentatively \nagreed to by the administration, would constitute a substantive change \nto the ABM Treaty, which may only be entered into pursuant to the \ntreaty making power of the President under the Constitution.'' This \nconference language, which was supported overwhelmingly on a bipartisan \nbasis, was the culmination of 2 years of effort by several key Senators \non the Armed Services Committee: I have been joined in this fight by \nSenator Lott of Mississippi, Senator Warner of Virginia, Senator--now \nSecretary of Defense--Cohen of Maine, and Senator Smith of New \nHampshire, as well as other stalwart supporters of the Senate's \nprerogatives.\n\n  Why would multilateralization of the ABM Treaty constitute a \nsubstantive change? First, because the basic strategic rationale for \nthe treaty would be altered. The ABM Treaty was intended to be part of \nan overarching arms control regime for regulating United States-Soviet \ncompetition in strategic offensive forces. But under a multilateral ABM \nTreaty, some members will have neither strategic offensive nor \nstrategic defensive forces, and hence no direct stake in the treaty's \nsubject matter. Overall, the United States faces strategic and \npolitical circumstances that are vastly different than those that \nexisted in 1972 when the ABM Treaty was signed. The Senate must \ncarefully consider how these bear on the issue of treaty succession.\n  Second, the ABM Treaty will change from a treaty between two equal \nparties to one in which different parties have different rights and \nobligations. Some states will be entitled to a deployed ABM system, \nothers will not. The United States will also face four states rather \nthan one at any future negotiation concerning the future of the treaty. \nThis clearly diminishes the weight of the American vote in the Standing \nConsultative Commission and increases the complexity of seeking changes \nor clarifications to the treaty.\n  Third, the actual mechanics of the ABM Treaty will be altered by \nmultilateralization since the treaty is largely defined in terms of \n``national territory.'' Some items that are regulated by the treaty, \nincluding large phased array radars, are currently located outside the \nnational territory of any of the states that plan to accede to the ABM \nTreaty. Also, those former Soviet States that opt not to stay in the \ntreaty would be legally permitted to deploy an unlimited ABM system \neven though their national territory\n\n[[Page S4456]]\n\nwas formerly covered by the treaty's definition of Soviet ``national \nterritory.''\n  Mr. President, these are only a few of the ways in which a \nmultilateral ABM Treaty would constitute a substantive change from the \noriginal treaty. The evidence is overwhelming. For the Senate to do \nanything other than to insist on its right to provide advice and \nconsent to such an agreement would be an abandonment of its rights and \nobligations. I urge my colleagues to stand together on this important \nconstitutional prerogative of the Senate. The executive branch must not \nbe permitted to circumvent the Senate on a matter of such fundamental \nimportance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Texas is now \nrecognized for 8 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee and, of course, the distinguished senior Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  Mr. President, there is no Senate responsibility I take more \nseriously than the obligation we have to advise and consent on \ntreaties. We are discussing two treaties today that mark the past and \nthe future of arms control. It is interesting to me that they have \nbecome linked in the manner before us today. I commend the \ndistinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for his \nvision in this effort.\n  The Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty is a pillar of post-cold-war \nsecurity in Europe. That treaty, over a decade in negotiation and \nfinished by President Bush in 1990, solidified NATO's victory in the \ncold war by dramatically reducing the size of the conventional forces \narrayed against each other.\n  That treaty also restricted the areas on the flanks of Europe where \nthe Soviet Union or its successors could place troops and equipment. \nThis particular provision was one of the most difficult to negotiate \nbecause it was one of the most meaningful. By restricting the size of \nforces on Europe's northern and southern flanks, we greatly reduced the \nlikelihood that the Soviet Union or its successors could conduct an \neffective assault on western forces.\n  Because of the importance of this provision, it is with great \nreluctance that I support the changes to the agreement before us today, \nwhich will relax these flank restrictions.\n  It is true that over 50,000 pieces of equipment limited by the CFE \nTreaty have been destroyed or removed since the treaty went into \neffect. Nevertheless, with the changes in the agreement regarding the \nflanks of Europe, we will all have to be watchful that we not slide \nback too far from the high standard we set for ourselves and for Russia \nin the original treaty.\n  Mr. President, I will also say that we will have to reevaluate our \nactions when we learn the full details of the NATO-Russia agreement \njust announced today. For example, I am hopeful that we did not place \nunilateral restrictions on our own ability to deploy troops in the \npotentially expanded area of NATO responsibility in exchange for Russia \nsupport for NATO expansion. I light of the changes we are making to the \nCFE Treaty--permitting Russia to deploy forces in areas that have been \noff-limits until now--such a unilateral restriction on our own ability \nto move troops around Europe would be shortsighted indeed.\n  Even with these reservations, though, I am willing to support the \ntreaty document before us today because of condition 9, which will \nrequire the President to submit to the Senate for ratification any \nsubstantive changes to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. My \nsupport for an effective, global ballistic missile defense system \ngreatly outweighs the concerns I may have with changes to the CFE \nTreaty.\n\n  Mr. President, if the CFE Treaty is a forward looking treaty that \nreflects the new realities of post-cold-war Europe, the ABM Treaty is \nan outdated document that harkens back to an era that is thankfully \nbehind us. The ABM Treaty was with the USSR. Now that the cold war is \nover it is restricting the inexorable march of technology, a technology \nthat I am convinced will make ballistic missiles obsolete.\n  The Clinton administration wants to bring new countries into this \noutmoded agreement. If the United States was limited in its ability to \ndeploy an effective missile defense when the treaty was with Russia \nalone, how much more restricted will we find ourselves when there are \nhalf-a-dozen or more new members in this treaty?\n  The document before us today does not prejudice the Senate's action \nregarding the ABM Treaty. It only says that if the President wishes to \npermit other countries to join this treaty, then the Senate must \nfulfill its constitutional role to advise and consent on such a change \nto the treaty. Colleagues will have the opportunity at that time to \ndebate the merits of bringing new countries into the treaty or simply \nletting this treaty fade into the history it represents.\n  While I support the latter, we aren't deciding that matter today. \nToday, we're simply asserting our prerogative to advise and consent on \ntreaties. No Member of this body should be comfortable that any \nadministration would want to make major modifications to a treaty \nwithout Senate approval.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the resolution of ratification before \nus today and assert their rights as a Member of the U.S. Senate. I \ncommend Senator Helms once again with the wisdom and leadership, a \nstaunch defender always, of senatorial prerogatives and U.S. national \nsecurity.\n  I commend all of those who are going to stand for the rights of the \nSenate and therefore the people, to change any potential treaty that \nthis country has committed itself to, because we will keep our treaty \nobligations and we must make sure that the people of our country are \ninformed and support any changes in those treaties.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 12 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 12 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, before the Senate this afternoon is the \ntask of taking the appropriate action, in fulfillment of the Senate's \nvital constitutional advice and consent responsibility and power, to \nadapt the Conventional Forces in Europe [CFE] Treaty to the constant \nchange that affects our world--change which has been more sweeping and \nprofound in Europe in the past 7 or 8 years than at any time in the \npreceding 40.\n  In 1990, after years of grueling negotiations to control the \nhistorically unprecedented conventional weaponry arrayed on opposite \nsides of the Iron Curtain in Central Europe, the CFE was signed. It \nentered into force in November of 1992. The long, difficult journey \nthat led to the CFE treaty included one failed effort--the Mutual and \nBalanced Force Reduction Treaty episode--where negotiators eventually \nhad to throw up their hands and acknowledge defeat in their efforts. \nBut fortunately that failure was not permitted to become permanent. \nWith U.S. leadership, efforts recommenced, and the CFE is the result.\n  The CFE treaty is the first in the post-World War II period to \nsucceed in limiting and reducing conventional weaponry. While \nunderstandably strategic weapons treaty negotiations captured greater \nattention, since those negotiations addressed weapons of mass \ndestruction each of which can annihilate great numbers of people and \nlarge cities, the CFE arguably addressed the greater threat to peace in \nEurope, because I believe it always was more likely that any conflict \nthere would start as a conventional conflict. The CFE negotiating \neffort was successful in large part because it approached the issue of \nobtaining multilateral agreement to limitations of key offensive-\ncapable weapons systems on an alliance-to-alliance basis--addressing on \nthe one side the armaments possessed by not only the Soviet Union but \nall the Warsaw Pact nations taken together, and on the other side the \narmaments possessed by all the NATO nations taken together.\n  The CFE placed numerical limits on the numbers of five types of \nweapons systems critical to effective offensive operations which each \nalliance could possess in the Atlantic-to-the-Urals region of Europe \nwhere the Warsaw Pact confronted NATO: tanks; artillery pieces; armored \ncombat vehicles; attack aircraft; and attack helicopters. It also \ncontained sublimits based on\n\n[[Page S4457]]\n\ngeographical regions--in realization of the fact that while a certain \nnumber of the covered items might not be a threat to peace or indicate \ndiabolical intentions if spread evenly across the entire geography of \neach alliance, that same number if massed in a subregion could be \nthreatening indeed and could indicate intentions to launch an attack or \nengage in other destabilizing behavior.\n\n  The treaty has been a notable success. It has resulted in reductions \nof over 50,000 items of heavy military equipment, verified by an \nintrusive verification regime that has included nearly 3,000 on-site \ninspections conducted to date under treaty auspices. It has worked and \nworked well. It is not a prospective treaty about which we all must \nguess or predict. It is a here-and-now, real-world treaty that has \nresulted in tangible reduction in armaments and consequently in real \nreduction in the threat of conflict. It is a treaty that we would do \nwell to preserve and protect.\n  Its underlying premise remains valid. If buildups of a critical mass \nof the categories of treaty-limited equipment can be prevented, it will \nbe very difficult for any nation to launch an attack against another \nwith a significant prospect of success. And even if a nation seeks to \nflaunt the treaty's terms, and engage in a buildup of these weapons \nsystems for the purpose either of conducting offensive military \noperations or engaging in a form of extortion, the treaty's \nverification procedures will reveal those efforts so that appropriate \ndiplomatic and military responses can be made, and its terms give the \nother parties to the treaty the means to condemn violative activities \nand to enlist the community of nations in efforts to prevent escalation \ninto conflict.\n  The implementation and ongoing administration of every treaty result \nin cases of different interpretations and various disagreements, and \nthe CFE Treaty is no exception. But the mechanisms included in the \ntreaty for resolving such conflicts or disagreements have worked \nreasonably well. And one can presume that the treaty would have \ncontinued to make a significant contribution to the security of Europe \nand, in turn, of the globe in a relatively smooth manner had the world \nremained as it was when the treaty was negotiated and entered into \nforce. But, of course, the world has not stood still. The Soviet Union \nimploded. The Warsaw Pact disintegrated. Some of the very nations and \narmies that stared across the Iron Curtain at NATO's forces and their \nkey United States components have become great friends of the United \nStates and other NATO nations. Several of these appear to be on the \nverge of becoming a part of NATO itself. That, of course, is a matter \nof considerable controversy which should be and I trust will be debated \nseparately and thoroughly. But our focus today is or should be on the \nCFE treaty.\n\n  In addition to the disappearance of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw \nPact, and the realignment of some of the former pact nations with the \nNorth Atlantic Alliance, other components of the Eurasian security \npicture have changed dramatically. No longer is Russia's biggest \nconcern the need to be ready for full-scale battle with NATO troops on \nthe German and Benelux plains. Today ethnic conflict in some provinces \nand efforts of other provinces to obtain independence require much \ngreater Russian attention. The ferment in the Middle East, and \nactivities in Iran and Turkey south of the Russian Caucasus region also \nare of greater concern to Russia.\n  Not surprisingly the alterations in Russia's view of its own security \npicture resulted in alterations in what it believed to be the vital \ndisposition of its security forces. Other nations of the former Soviet \nUnion, including Ukraine, and of the now-defunct Warsaw Pact were faced \nwith unanticipated anomalies resulting from the new maps of Eurasia. \nThe changes occurred in and affected primarily one of four zones to \nwhich the CFE Treaty applies, the so-called flank region which consists \nof Norway, Iceland, Turkey, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova, \nGeorgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and parts of Ukraine and Russia.\n  To address the desires by Russia, Ukraine, and others to reallocate \ntheir forces, but to ensure that those reallocations protect the \naccomplishments and security provided by the CFE, the parties to the \nCFE Treaty negotiated the so-called flank agreement consisting of \namendments to the original CFE treaty. The parties agreed to the flank \nagreement on May 31, 1996. It will enter into force if approved by all \nCFE Treaty party states by May 15, 1997.\n\n  The agreement does not change numerical limits for either of the two \nmajor sides of the post-World War II European alignment. Instead, it \nadjusts the boundaries of the flank, providing Russia and Ukraine more \nflexibility than they had before with respect to deployment of \nequipment limited by the treaty.\n  The flank agreement is in NATO's security interest, and, \nspecifically, it is in the security interests of the United States. \nWithout the adjustments it provides, it is likely Russia and possibly \nUkraine would feel so impeded in their ability to meet their own \nnational security requirements that they either would leave the treaty \naltogether or fail to comply with some of its provisions. The \nimplications of neither of these outcomes would be acceptable, and \nwould weaken or destroy the protections and added security offered by \nthe CFE Treaty.\n  The judgment that the flank agreement is in our national interest is \nnot just a judgment of our diplomatic community. It is fully endorsed \nby our Armed Forces leadership. On April 29 of this year, Brig. Gen. \nGary Rubus testified:\n\n       In the judgment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Flank \n     Agreement is militarily sound. It preserves the CFE treaty \n     and its contribution to U.S. and Allied military security. \n     The additional flexibility permitted Russia in the flank zone \n     does not allow a destabilizing new concentration of forces on \n     the flanks of Norway, Turkey and other States in that area. \n     Moreover, the agreement includes significant new safeguards, \n     including greater transparency and new constraints on flank \n     deployment:\n\n  The benefits of this agreement are apparent. The Foreign Relations \nCommittee last week approved the resolution of ratification by a \nunanimous vote of 17-0. I am confident that a great majority of \nSenators approve of the flank agreement. But I am very troubled by how \nsome in the majority seem determined to transform the constitutional \ntreaty advice and consent process into an obstacle course.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee last week approved the resolution of \nratification by unanimous vote. Mr. President, as the Foreign Relations \nCommittee last week approved this by unanimous vote of 17 to 0, it \ndoesn't mean that there were not some reservations. I just want to \nspeak to them.\n  I am confident that the great majority of our colleagues will support \nthe Flank Agreement. But I am troubled by the way in which some have \ntransformed the constitutional treaty advise and consent process into \nsomething of an obstacle course that involves things that aren't \ndirectly in the treaty.\n  The conditions for ratification which the majority required before it \nwould permit the Foreign Relations Committee and then the full Senate \nto perform the advice and consent role, fall into four rough \ncategories. I find several of them--primarily those which the Senate \nappropriately and routinely attaches to treaties--beneficial and \ndesirable. I find several others reflect a degree of fear and anxiety \non the part of some Members, the basis for which I cannot ascertain--\nbut which, all things told, appear unlikely to do fundamental damage to \nwhat should be our objective here: To keep the CFE Treaty in operation \nin order to continue to derive its benefits to security in Europe and a \nreduction in the risk of conflict there.\n  The third category, Mr. President, consists of a condition whose \nobjective may have been desirable but which inadvertently or \ninadvisedly singles out one nation for implicit criticism when the \nkinds of actions it is implicitly criticized for taking may place it in \nthe company of other nations in its region, and when it would be more \nappropriate to address these situations as a group so that all nations \nare held accountable to the same treaty standards. I speak of paragraph \nF of condition 5 which, in the form approved by the committee, singles \nout Armenia and requires a report directed solely at its activities and \nwhether they comply with the terms of the treaty. I will address that \nmatter separately, and will\n\n[[Page S4458]]\n\noffer an amendment to establish what I believe is an important balance \nand equity with respect to the entire Caucasus region.\n  Then, Mr. President, there is condition 9 which forms a special \ncategory all its own. I understand why a Senator who has not been \ndeeply involved in the Senate's processing of the CFE Flank Agreement \nmay be puzzled by the fact that condition 9 pertains to the ABM Treaty. \nIn fact, I have been involved in the effort to move the Flank Agreement \nto Senate approval, and I cannot discern a reasonable or defensible \nrationale to link the issue of multilateralization of the ABM Treaty to \naction on the CFE Flank Agreement except for the reason of taking \nsomething that ought to happen that is important to our security and \nlinking it to something that is not necessarily yet thoroughly \nconsidered by the Senate.\n\n  But even so, I do believe I understand what is going on here. \nProposed condition 9 is hostage-taking, pure and simple. I think there \nare some who have a fundamental aversion to arms control agreements and \nwant the United States to simply go it alone in the interdependent \nworld of the last decade of the 20th century. Unfortunately they insist \nthat unless the President concedes to their position on the unrelated \nissue of ABM multilateralization, they will refuse to let the United \nStates ratify the CFE flank agreement.\n  I readily agree that the issues surrounding the ABM Treaty are both \nvital and very controversial. The Committee on Foreign Relations, with \nthe contribution of the Committee on Armed Services, should devote \nconsiderable time and energy to thoroughly exploring those issues, and \nthen the Senate as a whole should carefully determine how to proceed \nwith respect to them.\n  But I want to register the strongest possible dissent from this \ntactic of hostage-taking. In my judgment these issues are separate and \nought to be treated separately. Treaties are fundamentally different \nthan bills on which this Congress acts on a daily basis. We ought to \napproach our advice and consent responsibility--a solemn constitutional \nduty--with more abstract side bar process. We should not load up \nresolutions of treaty ratification with essentially nongermane \namendments.\n  Further, purporting to resolve the complex and very important ABM \nissues by attaching a condition to a wholly unrelated treaty--and \nwithout thoroughly airing and deliberating on those issues at the \ncommittee level via hearings and other means--is risky and ill-advised. \nBecause I understand the power of the majority, perhaps the most \nsignificant feature of which is its considerable control over \ndetermining whether and when the Senate will address important issues, \nand because I believe it is of great importance that this flank \nagreement be considered and acted on by the full Senate, and that the \nSenate do so prior to the May 15 deadline which is imminent, I did not \nseek because of my aversion to condition 9 to derail the Foreign \nRelations Committee's action on the resolution of ratification last \nweek, but I expressed my concerns which were published as additional \nviews in the committee's report on the resolution.\n\n  Mr. President, as Senators, every one of us is sworn to uphold the \nConstitution. In my judgment that requires maintaining the separation \nof powers which plays so critical a part in maintaining the equilibrium \nof our unique form of government which has permitted it to survive and \nfunction successfully for over 200 years. Maintaining the separation \nrequires a careful allegiance to preserving and protecting not only the \nconstitutional obligations, responsibilities, and prerogatives of the \nlegislative branch, and the Senate in particular, but also of the \njudicial and the executive branches.\n  We in this Chamber are most accustomed, understandably, to rising to \nthe defense of the responsibilities, role, and prerogatives of our own \nbranch and our own Chamber. I have joined many times in such efforts. \nIndeed, the very fact that the CFE Flank Agreement is being considered \nby the Senate is attributable to an effort to assert that the Senate \nproperly should act on that agreement under the treaty clause of the \nConstitution because it substantively alters the original CFE Treaty.\n  Itis my view, and, I believe, the view of most Senators on both sides \nof the aisle who have carefully examined the issue, that the ABM \nDemarcation Agreement also makes a substantive change in a treaty to \nthe ratification of which the Senate previously gave its advice and \nconsent--thereby necessitating that U.S. ratification of the \nDemarcation Agreement can occur only if the Senate gives its advice and \nconsent by means of the complete constitutional process.\n  But the ABM Succession Agreement is a different matter entirely. It \neffects no substantive change in the ABM Treaty or any other treaty. It \ndoes one and only one thing: It codifies the status with respect to the \ntreaty of the states which succeeded to the rights and obligations of \nthe former Soviet Union. It is a function of the executive branch, not \nthe legislative branch, to determine if new nations which descend from \na dissolved nation inherit the predecessor nation's obligations such as \nthose under a treaty. This is not a matter of defending a Senate right \nor obligation or prerogative; the Senate has no right, obligation, or \nprerogative to defend with respect to determination of succession.\n  This principle has been illustrated on many occasions by its \napplication. Recently, and of direct relevance, it has been applied in \na number of circumstances with regard to the dissolution of the Soviet \nUnion.\n  I believe I understand the objective here, Mr. President, and I do \nnot believe it is the defense of a nonexistent constitutional principle \nor a nonexistent constitutional right or prerogative of the Senate. \nThis is a wolf in sheep's clothing--a maneuver by opponents of the ABM \nTreaty to gain strategic advantage in their quest to demolish the ABM \nTreaty. The objective is to give them one additional shot at killing \nthe Treaty.\n  I am prepared for the debate on the ABM Treaty. I look forward to \nthoroughly assessing whether this treaty continues to serve our \nNation's security interests as I strongly believe it has well served \nthose interests since its ratification. I look forward to examining in \ndetail the probable reactions in Russia and elsewhere if we abandon the \ntreaty.\n  But let me return to an earlier point that ABM opponents have shown \nthey are willing to ignore. The Senate is not currently debating the \nABM Treaty. The matter that is before us today is the Conventional \nForces in Europe Treaty Flank Agreement. Condition 9 is an unwise, \nunnecessary, destructive digression from what we should be doing here \ntoday. It is yet another example of distressing political expediency \ntoo often illustrated in this Chamber in recent years. Fortunately, \nthat expediency rarely has sunk to the level of sacrificing a vital \nconstitutional principle--such as the separation of powers--for the \nsake of tactical gain. But, Mr. President, let there be no mistake: It \nis sinking to that level today in condition 9.\n\n  When we do such things, Mr. President, there is a price to be paid. \nEither we who serve here today will pay that price at a later time, or \nthose who follow in our footsteps will pay that price. We disserve the \nConstitution we are sworn to uphold when we permit that to occur.\n  I must remark, Mr. President, on the peculiar and troubling silence \nof the administration on this issue. The administration, by position \nand motivation, is best situated to defend the constitutional \nprerogatives and responsibilities of the executive branch. And yet, for \nsome unknown reason, perhaps a tactical calculus, or exhaustion, or \ndistraction--for some reason--the administration never even joined this \nissue. I say to the administration: Despite the appearances given by \nyour silence and inaction on this issue, this truly does matter in the \nlong run. And this administration, and others to follow it, will regret \nthis day. Much more is being ceded here than the authority to decide \nwhat nations properly hold the obligations of the ABM Treaty that \npreviously were held by the Soviet Union.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the ratification of the Flank \nAgreement. Before we vote on the resolution of ratification, I will \noffer the amendment I referenced earlier to address the Caucasus \nregion, which I hope will be\n\n[[Page S4459]]\n\napproved. Then, despite the reservations about condition 9 I have \nenunciated, because of how important I believe the CFE Treaty is and \nwill continue to be to European security and stability and therefore to \nworld security and stability, I will vote to approve the resolution of \nratification and urge all other Senators to do so.\n\n\n             questions of treaty adherence in the caucasus\n\n  Mr. President, the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty was \nnegotiated to limit the numbers and geographical distribution in Europe \nof five key types of offensive-capable weapons systems. The treaty \ncontains sublimits for portions of the Atlantic-to-the-Urals region \ncovered by the treaty that apply to the five types of treaty-limited \nequipment.\n  The treaty, when it was negotiated, was focused on the protracted \ncold war and the confrontation at the Iron Curtain that ran through \nCentral Europe. Its design was to make it less likely that the cold war \nwould turn hot, by making it more difficult to amass sufficient \nquantities of the weapons systems that would be needed for a successful \nattack of one side on the other, or, at the very least, to amass such \nweaponry without the other side being aware of the preparations for \nsuch an attack. The weapons limitations and the transparency are the \ntreaty's keys.\n  But as the astonishing events of the late 1980's and early 1990's \nunfolded, the entire structure of Europe changed in such a fashion as \nto be virtually unrecognizable. For the most part, this was a very \nwelcome change. For the first time in 40 years, there was no tense \nface-off of the world's greatest armies at the Warsaw Pact/NATO border.\n  But the disintegration of the Soviet Union, which was one of the most \nprominent of the changes in the region, removed the authority and \ncontrol that had kept a lid on ethnic conflicts and territorial \ndisputes in several regions of what had been the Soviet Union. Ancient \ntensions and hatreds soon began to bubble to the surface, and nowhere \nmoreso than in the Caucasus region.\n  The Russian province of Chechnya sought to secede from Russia. Ethnic \nArmenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan sought to gain \nindependence so they could align with Armenia. Abkhaz separatists in \nGeorgia have fought a long-running civil war with the central \ngovernment.\n  Wars and revolutions are fought with weapons, of course. All parties \nto these conflicts have done all in their power to increase their \nfirepower. Not surprisingly, these actions, when they involve treaty-\nlimited equipment, have implications for the CFE Treaty even though \ncontending with such situations was not the primary purpose for which \nthe treaty was negotiated.\n  Responding to an allegation made publicly by a Russian Army general \nwho now serves in the Duma, the majority included in the text of the \nresolution of ratification of the CFE flank agreement, as a part of \ncondition 5 titled ``Monitoring and Verification of Compliance,'' \nparagraph F, which is a requirement that the President submit a report \nto the Congress regarding ``whether Armenia was in compliance with the \ntreaty in allowing the transfer of conventional armaments and equipment \nlimited by the treaty through Armenian territory to the secessionist \nmovement in Azerbaijan.''\n  Mr. President, wherever there are credible allegations or concerns \nthat the provisions of any arms control treaty have been violated, \nthose allegations or concerns should be explored thoroughly and the \ntruth determined. That, certainly, applies in this case. However, I \nbelieve this portion of condition 5 is too limited in its scope, and \nbecause of that limitation, leaves the impression that the Senate is \nnot as concerned about the effects on the treaty of arms transfer and \nacquisition actions in other areas of the Caucasus region.\n  If we are to carefully examine alleged violations of treaty \nprovisions in one specific location in this conflicted region, we \nshould direct the same level of inquiry at all portions of the region. \nWe know that arms buildups in other Caucasus locations have violated \nprovisions of the CFE Treaty. Some of those violations, in fact, have \nbeen openly acknowledged.\n  It is my belief that the Senate should address this matter directly, \nand do so by expanding the scope of the report that will be required by \nparagraph F of condition 5. Together with Senator Sarbanes, and with \nthe support of several other Senators, I have prepared an amendment to \ndo this. The amendment inserts a new subparagraph ii requiring that the \nPresident's report address ``whether other States Parties located in \nthe Caucasus region are in compliance with the Treaty.'' The President \nalso must indicate what actions have been taken to implement sanctions \non any of these states found to be in violation.\n  I believe this change will make this provision of the resolution of \nratification more useful. Because the report the Congress will receive \nwill give a more complete picture of the level of compliance with or \nviolation of the CFE Treaty in the Caucasus region, the United States \ncan formulate a response that will be more complete and suitable.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 279\n\n (Purpose: To require a compliance report on Armenia and other States \n                    Parties in the Caucasus region)\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the amendment that I send to the desk is an \namendment that seeks very simply to create the equity and balance that \nI sought with respect to the question of Armenia.\n  I believe that we have an agreement on this language. It will simply \nreflect that we ought to hold all nations in the area to the same \nstandard.\n  In my judgment, it is self explanatory. I believe it has been \napproved by both sides as a consequence of that.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), for himself, \n     Mr. Biden, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Abraham, and Mrs. Feinstein, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 279.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike subparagraph (F) of section 2(5) and insert the \n     following:\n       (F) Compliance report on armenia and other states parties \n     in the caucasus region.--Not later than August 1, 1997, the \n     President shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Relations \n     of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     a full and complete classified and unclassified report \n     regarding--\n       (i) whether Armenia was in compliance with the Treaty in \n     allowing the transfer of conventional armaments and equipment \n     limited by the Treaty through Armenian territory to the \n     secessionist movement in Azerbaijan;\n       (ii) whether other States Parties located in the Caucasus \n     region are in compliance with the Treaty; and\n       (iii) if Armenia is found not to have been in compliance \n     under clause (i) or, if any other State Party is found not to \n     be in compliance under clause (ii), what actions the \n     President has taken to implement sanctions as required by \n     chapter 11 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (22 U.S.C. 2295 et seq.; relating to assistance to the \n     independent states of the former Soviet Union) or other \n     provisions of law.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe we have an agreement on this \nparticular amendment.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nfor working, as he always does, in order to find a common ground in \nthese matters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The amendment (No. 279) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire, [Mr. Smith].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the resolution of \nratification reported by the Senate Foreign Relations\n\n[[Page S4460]]\n\nCommittee. I want to specifically commend the distinguished chairman, \nSenator Helms, for his outstanding leadership in moving this resolution \npromptly and responsibly.\n  I also want to commend the Foreign Relations Committee for including \ncondition No. 9, which would require the administration to submit any \nagreement that would multilateralize the ABM Treaty to the Senate for \nadvice and consent. This is an extremely important issue, Mr. \nPresident, and this provision ensures that the Senate retains its \nconstitutional prerogatives to advise and consent on international \ntreaties.\n  By way of background, there is an existing statutory requirement, \nwith precedent, that any substantive change to an international treaty \nmust be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent, as prescribed \nunder the Constitution.\n  The Clinton administration has spent the better part of the past 4 \nyears negotiating changes to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile [ABM] \nTreaty. Foremost among these changes are a demarcation agreement that \nwould restrict the performance of certain theater defense programs, and \na multilateralization agreement that would expand the ABM Treaty to \ninclude the Republics of the former Soviet Union. It is this \nmultilateralization agreement that condition No. 9 would address.\n  Mr. President, condition No. 9 has become necessary because the \nadministration refuses to submit the multilateralization agreement to \nthe Senate for advice and consent. They have rightly conceded that both \na demarcation agreement and the CFE flank limits agreement are \nsubstantive changes requiring approval of the Senate, but they \nadamantly refuse to submit multilateralization for approval.\n  The administration asserts that the executive branch alone has the \nauthority to recognize nations and determine the successor states on \ntreaties whose participants no longer exist. They also argue that \nmultilateralization is merely a clarification, not a substantive change \nto the ABM Treaty.\n  It is a very significant change that will fundamentally alter both \nthe nature of the treaty and the obligations of its parties. It is most \ncertainly a substantive change, and as such, it must be submitted to \nthe Senate for advice and consent.\n  Mr. President, let me elaborate on exactly why a multilateralization \nagreement would represent a substantive change. The ABM Treaty was \nsigned by the United States and the Soviet Union. It was premised on \nthe policy of mutual assured destruction and it codified the bipolar \nstrategic reality of the cold war. All negotiations on compliance and \nall discussions concerning amendments to the treaty were to be \nbilateral in nature, with any decisions being approved by each side. \nThe negotiating ratio was 1 to 1, the United States versus the Soviet \nUnion.\n\n  However, one of these two parties has now ceased to exist. There is \nno longer a Soviet Union. If the treaty is multilateralized, and \nthereby expanded to include multiple parties on the former Soviet side, \nit will dramatically change this negotiating ratio, both theoretically \nand practically.\n  Instead of the 1-to-1 ratio that the treaty was premised on, it will \nbecome at a minimum a 1-to-4 ratio, of the United States versus Russia, \nKhazakstan, Ukraine, and Belarus, and perhaps even a 1-to-15 ratio of \nthe United States versus all 15 of the former Soviet Republics. We just \ndon't know and the administration isn't saying.\n  Under a multilaterlization agreement, each of these former Soviet \nRepublics would have an equal say in negotiations, even though they \nclearly would have unequal rights and unequal equipment holdings. For \ninstance, only the United States and Russia would be permitted to field \nan ABM system, but other nations would be free to deploy ABM radars and \nother related components of a system. Further, while the ABM Treaty \nprohibits defense of the territory of a nation, the term territory is \nbeing redefined to mean the combined territories of all former Soviet \nRepublics who choose to join the treaty.\n  What does this mean? It means that instead of the treaty applying to \nthe territory of an individual nation, it applies to a number of \nnations, unevenly and in a manner that is very detrimental to the \nUnited States. For example, Russia could legally establish new early \nwarning radars on the territory of other States, well beyond the \nperiphery of Russia, while the United States is restricted to its own \nborders. Compounding this inequity, the territory and borders of the \nso-called former Soviet Union could change over time because the \nmultilateralization agreement allows the admission of additional \nrepublics even after entry into force.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is multilateralization would by \ndefinition and practice create a fundamental asymmetry in the ABM \nTreaty. Rather than having two parties with equal offensive strategic \nforces and defensive capabilities, this agreement would create a \ntremendous imbalance. For us to negotiate any changes to the treaty, \nsuch as an agreement to permit multiple sites or to change the \nlocation, we would now need to convince all the participating Republics \nof the former Soviet Union rather than just one.\n  In essence, each of those countries would be able to veto our \nposition at any time. And they would individually leverage the vote in \nthe Standing Consultative Commission for more foreign aid, or trade \nrecognition, or concessions on a variety of issues. Whenever we finally \nmet any single Republic's demands, another could instantly leverage \nsimilar concessions. When would it end? Never. This scenario is very \ntroubling. It is troubling there are people in the Senate who would be \nwilling to accede to that kind of situation. At the very least, it will \ncause huge complications in our process for negotiating changes to the \ntreaty.\n  There can be no question, an agreement to multilateralize the ABM \nTreaty is a substantive change to the ABM Treaty, plain and simple. It \nmust be submitted for advice and consent. Condition 9 merely says that \nbefore the CFE Flank Limits Agreement can take effect, the President \nmust certify that he will submit the ABM Treaty multilateralization \nagreement to the Senate for advice and consent.\n  Nothing in this condition will require any renegotiation of any \nprovision of the CFE Flank Limits Agreement or, for that matter, \nrequire any renegotiation of any provision of the ABM Treaty \nmultilateralization agreement. This condition will not affect any other \ncountry or any other treaty or the cause of strategic stability in any \nrespect. That is a fact.\n  Contrary to the parochial appeals of the administration, it is not \ngoing to kill NATO expansion. It will not kill START II. And it will \nnot kill the CFE Treaty. In fact, all the President has to do is send \nus a letter this afternoon certifying he will submit the agreement to \nthe Senate for advice and consent and we will be done with it. Case \nclosed.\n  I am pleased the Senate has seen fit, thanks to the tremendous \nleadership of Chairman Helms, to adopt this very important condition. \nSenator Helms, as he does so many times and often on the floor of the \nSenate and in private meetings on issues, stands sometimes alone. I am \nproud to be standing with him on this very important issue, and I think \nfuture generations will thank him for his leadership when we get to the \npoint where this treaty does take effect. People will be thanking him \nfor his leadership on the multilateralization issue.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. I assure him it is \nan honor to serve in the Senate with him.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I am pleased to support this CFE Flank \nTreaty today. It is good for the security of the United States and the \nsecurity of our NATO allies.\n  This treaty modifies the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. This \ntreaty was reached in 1990 before the breakup of the Soviet Union and \nthe Warsaw Pact. The modifications in CFE flank restrictions contained \nin this treaty are reasonable, and we all should support them.\n  Under Chairman Helms' guidance, the Foreign Relations Committee added \na number of important conditions to this treaty. These conditions\n\n[[Page S4461]]\n\nclarify parts of the treaty that could be construed as granting special \nrights to Russia to intimidate its neighbors, but most importantly are \nthe clarifications that nothing in the CFE Flank Treaty grants to \nRussia any right to continue its current violations of the sovereignty \nof several neighboring states.\n  I am pleased that these clarifications were fully bipartisan \nconditions that received the support of our distinguished Foreign \nRelations ranking member, Senator Biden.\n  There is, however, one remaining condition that caused some \ncontroversy. This is condition 9, which requires the President to \nsubmit to the Senate for ratification another treaty modification, the \nABM multilateralization treaty. This is not a question of support or \nopposition to the ABM Treaty. This is purely a matter of the \nprerogative of the Senate, of whether or not to adhere to the clear \nintent of the Constitution of this country.\n  During negotiations over the Chemical Weapons Convention, Senator \nHelms and Majority Leader Lott succeeded in convincing the President to \nsubmit to the Senate two out of three pending treaty modifications that \nthe President had intended to implement as executive agreements. One of \nthose treaty modifications, the CFE Flank Treaty now before us today, \nand another, the ABM Demarcation Treaty, is before the Foreign \nRelations Committee where it will receive serious consideration.\n  Only one treaty modification has yet to be submitted to the Senate, \nthe ABM multilateralization treaty agreed to in Helsinki by Presidents \nClinton and Yeltsin. It is right to require that treaty to be submitted \nas well.\n\n  Again, this issue is merely the constitutional obligation of each of \nus in this body to give our advice and consent on the ratification of \ntreaties, not whether this treaty modification is good or bad.\n  I again congratulate Chairman Helms, Senator Biden, and the \ndistinguished majority leader. I am proud of the leadership they have \nshown on this treaty and on the constitutional prerogatives of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I yield my time.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I have a little housekeeping function. I ask what I am \nabout to do will not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Unanimous-Consent Agreement--H.R. 1122\n\n  Mr. HELMS. As in legislative session, Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that immediately following disposition of the Feinstein \namendment to H.R. 1122 during Thursday's session of the Senate, Senator \nDaschle be recognized to offer an amendment and it be considered under \nthe following time agreement: 2\\1/2\\ hours under the control of Senator \nDaschle or his designee, and 2\\1/2\\ hours under the control of Senator \nSantorum or his designee.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the conclusion or \nyielding back of time on the Daschle amendment, the Senate proceed to \nvote on or in relation to the Daschle amendment without further action \nor debate, with no amendments in order during the pendency of the \nDaschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 12 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Delaware.\n  First, let me congratulate the Senators from North Carolina and \nDelaware, the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, for working together so speedily and quickly to bring this \ntreaty to the floor. It is a real feat. It is difficult to do this in \nthis length of time. The kind of bipartisan cooperation that this takes \nreally, I think, reflects great honor on this body.\n  There is one condition that I have some difficulty with that I want \nto address some remarks to this afternoon, and that is condition 9, \nwhich is now part of the resolution before the Senate.\n  Condition 9 requires the President to submit to the Senate for its \nadvice and consent the memorandum of understanding concerning successor \nstates to the ABM Treaty. In my view, this condition is probably \nunconstitutional but certainly unwise. As a general rule, a condition \non a resolution of ratification is a stipulation which the President \nmust accept before proceeding to ratification of a treaty. And if the \nPresident finds the condition unacceptable, he generally has but one \nchoice, which is to refuse to ratify the treaty. There is, however, a \ngenerally recognized exception: If the condition is inconsistent with \nor invades the President's constitutional powers, in which case the \ncondition would be ineffective and of no consequence. The restatement \nof foreign relations law puts the matter this way:\n\n       The Senate has not made a practice of attaching conditions \n     unrelated to the treaty before it. If the Senate were to do \n     so and were to attach a condition invading the President's \n     constitutional powers, for example, his power of appointment, \n     the condition would be ineffective. The President would then \n     have to decide whether he could assume that the Senate would \n     have given its consent without the condition.\n\n  In this matter before us, condition 9 has no relation to the CFE \nflank agreement. The condition, therefore, on that ground is improper. \nIt seeks to invade the President's constitutional powers to recognize \nstates and to implement treaties, and thus is probably \nunconstitutional.\n  When the Senate deals with the important issue of advice and consent \nto a treaty, I think it should limit itself to the treaty before it. \nWhen we go beyond that, it seems to me we do not bring honor on this \ninstitution, when we try to force the hand of the President in areas \nbeyond the immediate treaty that is being considered.\n  In a very ironic twist, condition 9 could imperil the continued \nviability of the treaty that we are ratifying because if the ABM \nTreaty, when it is multilateralized, needs to come back for \nratification, the same principle would apply to other treaties, of \nwhich we have dozens. The same principle, if it applies to ABM, would \napply to CFE, the treaty before us.\n  Is this treaty binding on those other states, those other successor \nstates of the Soviet Union without coming back to the Senate? INF, \nSTART I, probably dozens of treaties with the former Soviet Union which \nhave been multilateralized, which have been accepted by the successor \nstates, which we now, I hope, consider binding on those States and on \nus, even though they have not been brought back to the Senate for \nratification, if the logic of condition 9 is correct, it would \nundermine the viability, the efficacy of those other treaties that we \nhad with the former Soviet Union. It would call into question treaties \nthat I do not believe this body wants to call into question.\n  The reason that it does that is that condition 9 requires the \nPresident to submit to the Senate for its advice and consent his \nrecognition of the Soviet Union successor states to the ABM Treaty. It \ndoes provide an opportunity for opponents of the ABM Treaty to try to \ndefeat that memorandum of understanding as it relates to the successor \nstates. But in doing so, it jeopardizes the continuing viability of the \nacceptance by those successor states of their obligations under the ABM \nTreaty and, in terms of the point I am making, their obligations under \na number of other treaties which have been signed by the former Soviet \nUnion.\n  This outcome could undermine the reductions of former Soviet nuclear \nweapons that our military has testified are so clearly in our national \nsecurity interests. Opponents of having successor states other than \nRussia appear to worry about the potential difficulty of negotiating \nchanges or amendments to the ABM Treaty in order to permit deployment \nof a national missile defense system in the future. Their notion \nappears to be that while it may be straightforward for us to negotiate \nrequired changes with Russia, it will somehow be more difficult to get \nthe other three successor states to agree to any changes. And according \nto that view, rather than to give each of the other three states a \npotential veto over changes to the ABM Treaty, it would be better to \nprevent those successor states from ever joining the ABM Treaty as a \nparty.\n\n[[Page S4462]]\n\n  That is what this condition is all about, but it is misguided from a \nnumber of perspectives. First, the notion that Ukraine, Belarus, and \nKazakstan would obstruct any changes to the ABM Treaty but that somehow \nRussia would be an easier negotiating partner flies in the face of \nexperience. In the negotiations at the Standing Consultative \nCommission, it is Russia that has been the most challenging negotiating \npartner, while Ukraine, Kazakstan, and Belarus have been more amenable \nto American proposals.\n  Furthermore, as the administration has pointed out on many occasions, \nif the United States determines that there is the threat that requires \nus to deploy a national missile defense system that would conflict with \nthe ABM Treaty, they would seek to negotiate changes with our treaty \npartners to permit such a deployment. We would seek to adapt the treaty \nto our security requirements. But if the Russians would not agree to \nour proposed changes, then the administration would consider whether to \nwithdraw from the ABM Treaty, as is our right under the treaty's \nprovisions relating to our supreme national interests. That is the \nprudent approach and the one that best serves our security.\n  Let me just give one other example of the implication of this \ncondition. In 1995, the United States recognized Ukraine as a successor \nto the former Soviet Union for 35 nonarmed control treaties that we \npreviously had with the U.S.S.R. We did this without a Senate vote. So \nnow we presumably want the Ukraine to be bound by 35 treaties \npreviously negotiated. But there is no Senate vote ratifying that \ntreaty with Ukraine.\n\n  In a diplomatic note from the United States Embassy to the Government \nof Ukraine dated May 10, 1995, the United States listed the 35 \nagreements that have continued in force with Ukraine and they include \nsuch treaties as the incidents at sea agreement of 1972 with its \nprotocol, which our good friend from Virginia, Senator Warner, \nnegotiated when he was Secretary of the Navy. They included the \nprevention of dangerous military activities agreement of 1989, which is \ndesigned to prevent an accident or mistake from erupting into \nhostilities. These are extremely important agreements and we should not \nput those agreements in limbo, or in doubt, by setting this precedent \nrelative to the ABM Treaty.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of those 35 treaties that \nUkraine is hopefully bound by, through that note--but which we have not \nratified, vis-a-vis Ukraine--that that list and note be printed in the \nRecord at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Embassy of the United States of America--Kiev, May 10, 1996\n\n       The Embassy of the United States of America presents its \n     compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine and \n     has the honor to refer to discussions between technical \n     experts of our two Governments concerning the succession of \n     Ukraine to bilateral treaties between the United States of \n     America and the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in \n     light of the independence of Ukraine and the dissolution of \n     the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. In conducting their \n     discussions, the experts took as a point of departure the \n     continuity principle set forth in Article 34 of the Vienna \n     Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties. In \n     examining the texts they found that certain treaties to which \n     the principle applied had since expired by their terms. \n     Others had become obsolete and should not be continued in \n     force between the two countries. Finally, after a treaty-by-\n     treaty review, which included an examination of the \n     practicability of the continuance of certain specific \n     treaties, they recommended that our two Governments agree no \n     longer to apply those treaties.\n       In light of the foregoing, the Embassy proposes that, \n     subject to condition that follows, the United States of \n     America and Ukraine confirm the continuance in force as \n     between them of the treaties listed in the Annex to this \n     Note.\n       Inasmuch as special mechanisms have been established to \n     work out matters concerning succession to bilateral arms \n     limitation and related agreements concluded between the \n     United States and the former Union of Soviet Socialist \n     Republics, those agreements were not examined by the \n     technical experts. Accordingly, this Note does not deal with \n     the status of those agreements and no conclusion as to their \n     status can be drawn from their absence from the list \n     appearing in the Annex.\n       With respect to those treaties listed in the Annex that \n     require designations of new implementing agencies or \n     officials by Ukraine, the United States understands that \n     Ukraine will inform it of such designations within two months \n     of the date of this Note.\n       If the foregoing is acceptable to the Government of \n     Ukraine, this Note and the Ministry's Note of reply \n     concurring therein shall constitute an agreement between our \n     two Governments which shall enter into force on the date of \n     receipt by the Embassy of the Ministry's Note in reply.\n       The Embassy of the United States of America avails itself \n     of this opportunity to renew to the Ministry of Foreign \n     Affairs of Ukraine the assurance of its highest \n     consideration.\n       Enclosure: Annex.\n\n\n                                 annex\n\n       Convention relating to the rights of neutrals at sea. \n     Signed at Washington July 22, 1854; entered into force \n     October 31, 1854.\n       Agreement regulating the position of corporations and other \n     commercial associations.

If the logic of condition 9 were extended to Ukraine, all \nthose 35 treaties would be in limbo until we ratified the succession of \nthe treaties. And this list of treaties is just one case of the 12 \nsuccessor states to the former Soviet Union. Condition 9 could cast \ninto doubt the effect of all of those treaties for all of those states.\n  I think the aim here, while it is aimed at ABM, does not hit ABM \nbecause our ABM Treaty is not touched by this condition. Our treaty \nrelative to ABM, with Russia, is not affected by condition 9. Condition \n9 does not refer to Russia. It is the other states that it refers to. \nSo our ABM Treaty with Russia is not affected. It is all the other \ntreaties which are undermined, with all the other successor states. It \nis the arms control treaties and the nonarms control treaties which are \nput in jeopardy, left in limbo by the logic of this condition. So, \nwhile the aim is at the ABM Treaty, it misses that and, instead, hits \ntreaties that I believe this body wants to be binding on the successor \nstates to the Soviet Union.\n  What about the treaty before us, the CFE Treaty? Does this have to be \nratified with each of the successor states to the Soviet Union? If so, \nwe are putting this very treaty in limbo. This very CFE Treaty which we \nare ratifying, by the logic of condition 9, is left in limbo as to the \nother successor states, because there is no ratification of this treaty \nrelative to the other states.\n  Mr. President, I fail to understand the logic of the supporters of \ncondition 9 that appears to say that Russia is a successor state to the \nformer Soviet Union but the other states of the former Soviet Union can \nonly become successor states if the Senate ratifies that action. If the \nSenate must ratify the succession of one state, then logically it \nshould ratify the succession of all. Thus this condition would cast \ninto doubt the continuing validity of Russia's obligations under the \nnumerous treaties that the United States had entered into with the \nSoviet Union but which were not submitted to the Senate for \nratification subsequent to the breakup of the Soviet Union.\n  And it could cast into similar doubt other treaties with other \ncountries that have dissolved, such as former Czechoslovakia, or former \nYugoslavia, where the Senate has not ratified the succession of states \nto those treaties.\n  We should also consider the impact of condition 9 on other arms \ncontrol agreements which successor states to the former Soviet Union \nhave joined. Since we are considering the resolution of ratification \nfor the CFE Flank Agreement, let us start with the underlying CFE \nTreaty. It was ratified by the Senate in November 1991, prior to the \naccession of successor states based on the Oslo document in June of \n1992. In other words, it was after the Senate voted for ratification of \nthe CFE Treaty that the former successor states agreed on the \narrangement for joining the CFE Treaty.\n  The precedent that condition 9 would set would, if followed in other \ncases, call into question whether those states are considered members \nof and bound by the CFE Treaty until the Senate votes on their \nsuccession to the treaty.\n  There is also the case of the intermediate-range nuclear forces, or \nINF, Treaty signed between the United States and USSR. When the Soviet \nUnion dissolved into 12 successor states, 6 of those states had INF \nfacilities on their soil while the other 6 did not. All twelve are \nsuccessors to the INF Treaty, with six having obligations related to \ntheir INF facilities and the other six having the obligation not to \nhave such facilities or INF missiles.\n  The logic of condition 9 would suggest that the successor states are \nnot parties to, or bound by, the INF Treaty unless and until the Senate \nprovides its advice and consent to their accession. I cannot imagine \nany Member of the Senate wanting to cast doubt on the obligation of \nthese states to comply with the INF Treaty, but that is what condition \n9 does when its logic extended to other treaties.\n  In a June 11, 1996, letter, then-Secretary of Defense William Perry \nexplained the Defense Department's concerns with a proposed provision \nof law that was essentially the same as condition 9:\n\n       . . . this section runs counter to the successful U.S. \n     policy of involving within the framework of strategic \n     stability all states which emerged from the former Soviet \n     Union with nuclear weapons on their territory. Moreover, \n     Russia, Belarus, Kazakstan, and Ukraine perceive a clear link \n     between their participation in the START and INF Treaties and \n     the ABM Treaty. Casting doubt on their ability to be equal \n     partners in the ABM Treaty could poison our overall \n     relationship with these states and needlessly jeopardize \n     their compliance with their denuclearization obligations \n     under START I.\n\n  The logic of condition 9, when extended to other treaties, could well \nlead the successor states to the former Soviet Union to reconsider \nwhether they are bound by these treaties as well as the ABM Treaty. \nSuch a move would be decidedly against our security interests.\n  I should point out, Mr. President, that the Congress itself urged the \nPresident to discuss ABM Treaty issues ``with Russia and other \nsuccessor states of the former Soviet Union'' in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994. At that time there was no \nquestion that there were other successor states to the former Soviet \nUnion with whom we would want to discuss possible changes to the ABM \nTreaty. Section 232(c) of that Act states:\n\n       Congress urges the President to pursue immediate \n     discussions with Russia and other successor states of the \n     former Soviet Union, as appropriate, on the feasibility of, \n     and mutual interest in, amendments to the ABM Treaty to \n     permit--\n       clarification of the distinctions for the purposes for the \n     purposes of the ABM Treaty between theater missile defenses \n     and anti-ballistic missile defenses . . .\n\n  I find it strange that the Senate, after urging the President to \ndiscuss the ABM Treaty with Russia and other successor states to the \nformer Soviet Union on demarcation, now would call into question \nwhether there are other successor states to the ABM Treaty without a \nSenate ratification.\n  If a treaty must be submitted to the Senate for ratification of \nsuccessors to the former Soviet Union, or other countries, before it is \nbinding, then hundreds of our treaty commitments are in doubt. All of \nthis is because opponents of the ABM Treaty are trying to maim or kill \nthis one treaty.\n  Additionally, we should consider the impact of accepting condition 9 \non other parliaments in other nations that may take this signal as an \ninvitation for them to reconsider their nation's treaty commitments. I \nfind it ironic that on an act of treaty ratification the Senate is on \nthe verge of creating a potential international treaty uncertainty.\n  There is no need for the Senate to drag in the ABM Treaty issue on \nthe CFE Flank Agreement resolution of ratification. The Senate will \nhave ample opportunity to debate the ABM Treaty when the administration \nsubmits the ABM demarcation agreement to the Senate, as they have \ncommitted to do. But this is neither the time nor the vehicle to try to \ndecide this issue.\n  Furthermore, this issue of the memorandum of understanding on \nsuccessor\n\n[[Page S4464]]\n\nstates to the ABM Treaty is already connected to Senate consideration \non the demarcation agreement. The text of the demarcation agreement \nstates that the MOU on successor states will not go into effect until \nthe Agreed Statement on Demarcation goes into effect. So in effect, the \nMOU cannot take effect until the Senate votes on the demarcation \nagreement. Consequently there is no need for this condition and it \nshould not be included in this resolution of ratification.\n  Mr. President, thankfully, condition 9 is limited to the memorandum \nof understanding concerning successor states to the ABM Treaty. It is \nmy fervent hope and expectation that the President will make clear in \nhis signing statement for the CFE Flank Agreement that this \nextraordinary action is not a precedent. In that way he can limit the \ndamage that could otherwise flow from this unwise condition.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that condition 5(f) dealing with \npotential violations of the CFE Treaty in the Caucasus region has been \nmodified. I would have much preferred that it not make any reference to \nany particular country.\n  More importantly, I am very concerned with the word ``secessionist'' \nin condition 5(f). The situation in this troubled area has a long and \nunfortunate history, and I am disturbed that this condition would seek \nto so characterize a conflict there.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased the administration has \ndecided not to contest condition 9 in the resolution of ratification \nnow before the Senate. That condition makes the advice and consent of \nthe Senate a condition precedent to the addition of parties to the \nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\n  Any agreement between the administration and the Government of Russia \nor other states that were part of the Soviet Union which purports to \nenlarge the ABM Treaty by adding new parties must be submitted to the \nUnited States Senate and a resolution of ratification approved by the \nSenate before it will have the force and effect of law.\n  There are important reasons why it is necessary for the Senate to \ninsist on its constitutional role in treaty making in this resolution. \nThe administration has announced its intent not to submit a memorandum \nof understanding on succession to the Senate for advice and consent to \nratification, and it purports to transform the ABM Treaty from a \nbilateral agreement into a multilateral accord.\n  The addition of new parties to the ABM Treaty clearly would have \nserious national security implications for the United States. It would \nmake it much more difficult and time consuming to negotiate other \nchanges in the treaty that may be considered necessary in the future to \nprotect our security interests.\n  Unless the Senate insists on fulfilling its advice and consent \nresponsibilities with respect to the ABM Treaty, there may be a \nmistaken view taken by the administration that a demarcation amendment \nbeing negotiated now with Russia could likewise be the subject of an \nexecutive agreement without the benefit of Senate ratification.\n  I am concerned that by our inaction the Senate could be forfeiting \nits constitutional role in the making of treaties. It should be clear \nthat no treaty or material change in a treaty can be entered into by \nour government without the consent of the Senate. That is what the \nConstitution says, and that is what condition 9 says, and that is what \nthe Senate says today as it provides advice and consent to ratification \nof the amendments to the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nboth the resolution of ratification to the Conventional Forces in \nEurope Treaty flank agreement, and, more importantly, the manager's \namendment to condition 5 regarding compliance with the treaty by member \nstates in the Caucasus region. True, the manager's amendment does not \nchange the original language to the extent that I would desire, but I \ndo wish to thank Senator Helms and the staff of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee for being so open to my ideas and engaging in very full \nnegotiations. I also wish to thank Senators McConnell, Kerry, and \nSarbanes for providing such critical leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. President, it is indeed important that the United States respond \nforthrightly to violations of the CFE Treaty. And considering this \ndeals with numerical limits on military equipment, the degree of \nalleged violations is also important. But in executing such diligence, \nI hope we do not assume too quickly that all alleged violations are, in \nfact, true. That is why I applaud the inclusion of the request for a \nreport on alleged violations, to ensure that the United States does not \nblindly enter a treaty which others may disregard.\n  But in requesting such reports, we must also be mindful of the impact \nour actions may have upon the delicate fabric of ongoing negotiations \nto which the United States is party. Specifically, Mr. President, I \nrefer to the OSCE negotiations, to which the United States is co-\nchairman, regarding the future status of the Nagorno-Karabakh region. \nTo single out one nation for alleged violations, in this case Armenia, \nwithout taking into account the full geo-political environment under \nwhich that nation's government must operate, may subvert the very \nprocess we think has been violated. Better, in my opinion, to err by \nrequesting too much information than not enough, and take into account \nthe region as a whole, and all the players in the current dispute. To \nensure we do not upend this ongoing process of peaceful resolution, we \nshould minimize giving credence to unverified allegations and cast as \nwide a net as possible in requesting additional analysis.\n  Mr. President, Armenia has had a tough go of it in its short period \nof independence. It is landlocked, its ethnic population is \ngeographically divided, and it has suffered egregiously in the past \nfrom the crimes of others who condemned them simply because of their \nheritage. Add on top of that a 70-year legacy of abuse and political \ngame playing by the Soviet Union, and it is understandable that Armenia \nmay find itself hard-pressed to execute the policies that we Americans \nwould like to see in a perfect world. But it is not a perfect world, \nand sometimes we must understand the realities of a situation, and make \nthe best of it.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I appreciate the willingness of the Foreign \nRelations Committee chairman to work with me on making condition 5 more \ninclusive of all potential threats to U.S. interests and the treaty's \nviability. By taking a more evenhanded approach, hopefully no party to \nthe current negotiations will feel slighted. And, Mr. President, they \nshould not feel slighted at this point in the process. This condition \nis meant to address violations to the CFE Treaty, not express an \nopinion on the legitimacy of any party's negotiating position. Any \nother interpretation is, in my opinion, a misunderstanding of the \ncondition's intent. Further, I do not believe that this will, or \nshould, be interpreted in any manner that would impugn the ability of \nthe United States to continue as co-chair to the OSCE negotiations. The \nUnited States has energetically taken on this mantle of leadership, and \nI reaffirm my support for this process.\n  Mr. President, both the viability of the CFE Treaty, and the \ncontinued good-faith negotiations regarding the future status of \nNagorno-Karabakh are important United States interests. We can, and \nmust, work toward the success of both. I thank the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee for his leadership in these areas, and the \nassistance of Senators Kerry and Sarbanes in bringing about this \namendment which I have cosponsored.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address Senate \nconsideration of the CFE Flank Agreement.\n  The Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty [CFE] entered into in 1990 \nis an outstanding arms control achievement, requiring the destruction \nof over 50,000 items of heavy weaponry, including tanks, armored \npersonnel carriers, artillery pieces, and attack helicopters. The CFE \nhas helped to make the Europe of 1997 a far safer place than the Europe \nof even just a few years ago, and in doing so has served American \nnational security interests well.\n  The implementation of CFE helps guarantee that a destabilizing \nconcentration of military equipment--or a massed military attack in \ncentral Europe of the kind that has dominated strategic thinking in \nEurope through two World Wars and a cold war--will\n\n[[Page S4465]]\n\nnow be next to impossible for any nation or group of nations to \nachieve.\n  But, as the flank agreement underscores, the treaty negotiated \nbetween NATO and the Warsaw Pact in 1990 is not adequate to the \nrealities of the new European security environment.\n  To begin with, the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact no longer exist. \nThere are now Soviet successor states in the Baltics and the \nTranscaucasus--the flank zones--with very different security and \npolitical concerns. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the \nTranscaucasus have been a region of almost singular instability. Russia \nand the Ukraine, likewise, have different security orientations than \ndid the Soviet Union, as do the states of both central and western \nEurope. NATO is undergoing a searching debate about the possibility of \nenlargement. The Europe that the CFE must be relevant to in 1997 is \nradically different than the Europe of 1990.\n  Thus, in ways unanticipated by its original negotiators, the issues \nraised by the flank agreement touch on some of the most central and the \nmost sensitive security issues of the new European security \nenvironment.\n  The history of the Transcaucasus since the breakup of the Soviet \nUnion have served as a grim reminder of the deadly subtleties of \nrapidly changing regional geography. Civil war and ethnic strife has \nbeen the rule, not the exception, in Nagorno-Karabagh, Osettia, \nAbkhazia, Georgia, and, of course, Chechnya.\n  Stabilizing the military balance in the Transcaucasus and inculcating \nconfidence and security building measures, as the CFE Treaty does, is \ncritical for peace in the region.\n  Although not racked with the violence that has characterized the \nTranscaucasus, the security concerns of the Baltic States in the \nnorthern flank zone will prove to be central to future stability in \nEurope, and the limits placed on threatening conventional weapons by \nthe CFE Treaty is a critical part of the security architecture of the \nBaltics.\n  Likewise, the flank agreement also touches upon the sensitive topic \nof Russian-Ukrainian ties, and the political and security relationship \nbetween the two, and it addresses the role of Turkey between Europe, \nthe Middle East, and central Asia.\n  Last, the flank agreement has profound implications for Russian \nnationalist sentiment, and may well have an impact on the future of \nRussian domestic political development, and the dynamics of those \ndomestic factors which may influence either a cooperative or \nconfrontational Russian foreign policy.\n  In this sense, the flank agreement is also critical issue for the \ndebate over NATO enlargement that is just now beginning to come to a \nsimmer. In structuring the balance of forces between NATO and Russia, \nthe CFE and the flank agreement--what it says as well as how it is \nimplemented--will be at the heart of Russian perceptions and \nassessments regarding the potential of an enlarged NATO.\n  In short, the CFE will play a central role in determining the future \ncourse of peace and stability in Europe.\n  Notwithstanding the positive contributions of the CFE to U.S. \nnational security interests--and it is a treaty which I will be voting \nfor--I feel that I would be remiss in my duty as a Senator if I did not \nalso point out some general concerns that I have with the flank \nagreement, as well as some specific concerns I have with the resolution \nof ratification for this treaty as it was voted out of the Foreign \nRelations Committee last week.\n\n  As I made clear in the Foreign Relations Committee hearing, I found \nthe way in which the flank agreement was negotiated--opening up an \nalready negotiated treaty for revision because of the reticence of one \nparty to live up to its commitments--deeply troubling.\n  Although I would agree with those who argue that it is necessary to \nrevisit international agreements when there has been a material change \nin circumstances--and few would argue that the breakup of the Soviet \nUnion does not count on this score--treaties, by their very nature, are \nonly worthwhile if they are binding the minute they are signed.\n  The post-cold-war world may very well be more turbulent and fluid \nthan the world which we are used to, but I hope that the way in which \nthe flank agreement was opened for renegotiation--with one party not in \ncompliance with a treaty which they had signed--does not set a \nprecedent which will call into question other treaties which, after the \nfact, a state may wish to change.\n  I think that it is important for the Senate to go on the record in \nsupport of the binding nature of the treaty obligations which we and \nother states enter into--obligations which should be opened for \nrenegotiation in only the most extreme of cases--even as we give our \nsupport to this agreement.\n  Second, in changing the CFE flank equipment ceilings to meet Russian \nsecurity concerns, we must be careful to make sure that we have not \nincreased the insecurity felt by other states in or bordering the flank \nzone.\n  In its original conception, the CFE Treaty was intended to make \nEurope safe from the dangers of a big war between East and West. I \nthink that there is general agreement that CFE has been and will \ncontinue to be effective in this respect.\n  But the CFE Treaty, as revised, must not become part of a European \nsecurity architecture in which Europe is made safe for little wars, \nbetween the large and the small, or as a tool for intimidation used by \nthe strong against the weak.\n  If such a situation were to result from the flank agreement \nrevisions, Europe would be less stable and secure, not more.\n  Third, as several of my colleagues have already pointed out, the \ninclusion of condition 9 regarding Senate advice and consent for the \nmultilateralization of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is, I think, \nunwarranted and unwise.\n  It is unwarranted because the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is not \nconnected in any way with the CFE. It is unwise because it calls into \nquestion whether the United States may attempt to reopen or \nsubstantively change a treaty because some now perceive that it is in \nour interests to do so.\n  There was an attempt to get this same language regarding the ABM \ninserted into last year's defense authorization bill. That effort \nfailed. On its own, the Senate has already rejected this language. Now \nthere is an attempt to resurrect this language and attach it to this \ntreaty. The consideration of treaties is one of the highest \nresponsibilities of the Senate, and I am disappointed that some of my \ncolleagues have chosen to place petty politics above the interests of \nU.S. national security.\n  The ABM Treaty is the diplomatic foundation of our intercontinental \nballistic missile reduction strategy. It was possible to negotiate and \nratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, and negotiate \nSTART II because of the strategic groundwork laid in the ABM Treaty. \nAbandoning or violating the ABM Treaty would threaten the strategic \nballistic missile reductions under these two treaties, which, when \nimplemented, would verifiably eliminate the intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles carrying two-thirds of Russia's nuclear warheads.\n  I would have preferred to have had the opportunity to eliminate this \ncondition from the final resolution of ratification, but, \nunfortunately, it does not appear that we will have this opportunity.\n  In addition to these general concerns, I also have one specific \nconcern with the resolution of ratification for this treaty as it was \nvoted out of committee last week, which I hope that we will have an \nopportunity to change.\n  I am concerned that condition 5 (F) of section 2 unfairly singles out \nArmenia for a report on compliance with the CFE Treaty. In so doing, \nthis condition makes the treaty weaker, and less effective in \nguaranteeing U.S. security interests in Europe, not more.\n  Although some of my Armenian friends might not want me to say this, I \ndo believe that there should be a report on Armenia's compliance with \nthe treaty. There have been some troubling questions raised in the \npress and in our committee discussions regarding Armenian \ntransshipments of arms from Russia, and whether Armenia is in violation \nof certain provisions of the CFE.\n  As I noted previously, this is a very sensitive part of the globe, \nand one in which even a relatively small amount of heavy weaponry can \nhave tremendous impact on the balance of power. If\n\n[[Page S4466]]\n\nArmenia is in violation of the treaty, then appropriate measures should \nbe taken.\n  However, it is precisely the volatile nature of this region that \ndictates that U.S. national security interests demand that we seek \ncompliance reports on the other states in the region as well. There are \nquestions regarding Azerbaijan's compliance with the CFE's Treaty \nLimited Equipment (TLE) limits, for example, and recent experience with \ncivil war and ethnic strife in Georgia, Osettia, Chechnya, Abkhazia, \nand elsewhere in the region all suggest that a condition calling for \nregion-wide compliance reports would be in order.\n  Indeed stigmatizing and isolating Armenia in this fashion may well \nprove to be counterproductive. If the CFE Treaty is perceived as a tool \nof one side or another in an already tense and volatile region, it will \nhave the effect of destroying confidence, not building it, and will \ncontribute to an atmosphere where the states of the region may seek to \nbuild their armed forces, not lessen them.\n  This would be a grave mistake, and that is why I believe that \ncondition 5 (F) must be changed to call for compliance reports for the \nother countries in the Transcaucasus as well. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment offered to make just these changes when we vote \non this issue.\n  Even with these reservations, however, I find that the treaty merits \nsupport. The CFE, with the revised flank agreement, provides an \ninvaluable tool for stabilizing European security and lessening \nregional tension. I would urge all of my colleagues to join me in \nvoting in favor of this treaty.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I voted in committee to support the CFE \nFlank Document and the accompanying resolution of ratification that was \nreported favorably by the Committee on Foreign Relations last week.\n  Let me review a few of the issues that commanded committee concern.\n\n\n   The Flank Document and Relations Between Russia and Former Soviet \n                                 States\n\n  During committee consideration of the CFE Flank Document, members on \nboth sides of the aisle voiced concern over United States willingness \nto serve as an intermediary in negotiations between Russia and other \nformer Soviet states to secure permission for temporary Russian troop \ndeployments on their soil or for revision of the Russian treaty-limited \nequipment quotas set in the 1992 Tashkent Agreement. Paragraphs 2 and 3 \nof section IV of the Flank Document restate Russia's right to seek such \npermission ``by means of free negotiations and with full respect for \nthe sovereignty of the States Parties involved''. A United States note \npassed to the Russians, according to Undersecretary of State Lynn \nDavis, said that the United States was ``prepared to facilitate or act \nas an intermediary for a successful outcome in'' such negotiations. \nUnited States officials state that Washington's offer to serve as an \nintermediary between Russia and other Tashkent Agreement signatories \nwas for the purpose of leveling the playing field between Russia and \nsmaller countries.\n  Many of the conditions in the resolution of ratification seek to bind \nthe executive branch to its asserted purpose.\n\n\n              The Flank Document and an Adapted CFE Treaty\n\n  In short, I agree with a number of the cautions presented by various \nwitnesses with regard to the impact of the flank agreement on both \nRussia and a number of the States of the former Soviet Union, as well \nas its implications for bordering Western States. Thus, I am supportive \nof most of the conditions in the Committee resolution.\n  But I also believe that, on balance, this flank agreement is a useful \ncontribution to the larger effort to adapt the original CFE agreement \nto the changed circumstances we now confront in Europe. I believe that \nthe Flank Agreement must be viewed in that context as well.\n  The original CFE agreement has been a useful instrument for winding \ndown the military confrontation in Europe that was a principal feature \nof the cold war. The United States is now presented with an opportunity \nto adapt that treaty to the new security situation in Europe in a way \nthat could, in my judgment, facilitate both NATO enlargement and \nimproved NATO-Russian cooperation. Because the former Soviet Army, and \nindeed some elements of the current Russian Armed Forces, always \ndisliked CFE and considered it inequitable, some have argued that \namending or adapting it now would be a concession to Russia or a price \nthe United States should not have to pay. In my view, it is in the \ninterest of the United States, NATO, and, for that matter, Russia to \nupdate the CFE Treaty as the only way to ensure its continued viability \nand its stabilizing influence in the Europe of the next century.\n\n  In light of the dramatic developments that have occurred in Europe \nsince the treaty was negotiated, the CFE Treaty should not be exempted \nfrom the kind of change that is occurring in so many other European \npolitical, economic and security institutions. Thus, it is wholly \nappropriate to eliminate the bloc-to-bloc character of the original \ntreaty in favor of national equipment ceilings and to reduce the amount \nof military equipment that will be permitted throughout the treaty \narea.\n  In short, I tend to analyze the benefits and costs associated with \nthe CFE Flank Agreement not only on their own merits, but also in terms \nof their contributions to overhauling the entire treaty; that is one of \nthe contexts in which I believe we must review the CFE Flank Agreement.\n  I am supportive of the general direction of NATO's recent proposals \nfor adapting the CFE Treaty. As a general matter, it would emphasize \nthe need for reciprocity in the adjustments that are made and encourage \ntransparency.\n  However, I would raise some concerns relating to three aspects of the \nNATO proposals for an adapted CFE regime and suggest that we need to \nbear them in mind as we consent to ratification of the CFE Flank \nAgreement.\n  First, NATO has proposed limits on the ground equipment that could be \ndeployed in the center zone of Europe, defined as Belarus, the Czech \nRepublic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine--other than the Odessa \nregion--and the Kaliningrad region of Russia. This could be viewed as \nsingling out potential new members of NATO for special restrictions, \nthus saddling them de facto with second-class citizenship within NATO. \nIt is one thing for NATO to make a unilateral statement, as it has \nrecently done, that it has, at present, no intention or need to station \npermanently substantial combat forces on the territory of new member \nstates. It is quite another for it to accept legal limitations on its \nability to station equipment on the territory of these states as part \nof an adapted CFE Treaty. While NATO would not be precluded from \nstationing forces on the territory of these states, such deployment \nwould be constrained by the individual national ceilings which apply to \nthe equipment of both stationed and indigenous forces.\n  It is certainly useful to have such a limitation with respect to the \nKaliningrad region of Russia. With that exception, however, all of \nRussian territory lies outside the central zone. While Russian forces, \npermitted by a pliant Belarus to be stationed on its territory, would \npresumably be subject to the national ceiling applicable to Belarus, \nsuch a deployment could be viewed by Poland, for example, as an attempt \nto intimidate it. This consideration needs to be taken into account by \nNATO negotiators as they elaborate the terms of the NATO proposal for \nadapting the CFE Treaty. It is possible that provisions covering \ncooperative military exercises and temporary deployments in emergency \nsituations, as well as ensuring adequate headroom in the national \nceilings of the Central European States, may resolve this concern.\n\n  Secondly, this special central zone could be viewed as isolating \nUkraine. If Russia chose to build up forces in the old Moscow Military \nDistrict abutting Ukraine, then Ukraine could find itself unable to \nrespond because it is subject to the special provisions of the central \nzone. It may be that in the negotiation of the revisions in the CFE \nTreaty, some arrangement can be found to allay Ukrainian concerns by \nsome special limitation on Russia with respect to all or a portion of \nthe Moscow Military District.\n  Finally, in negotiating changes to the CFE Treaty, NATO negotiators \nmust keep in mind the possibility of further enlargement of NATO at \nsome\n\n[[Page S4467]]\n\nfuture date to include states beyond three or four central European \nnations. It must ensure that whatever revised CFE limitations it \nnegotiates will permit NATO, should it so decide, to extend security \nguarantees to these countries that will be credible and on which NATO \ncan make good, even under the provisions of a revised CFE Treaty.\n  In sum, the CFE Flank Agreement, if ratified, provides the first \nbuilding block to a revised CFE Treaty. NATO's proposals for an adapted \nCFE Treaty are based on the assumption that the flank agreement will be \nratified. That being the case, it is appropriate that the Senate, in \nconsenting to the CFE Flank Document, not only judge it on its own \nterms but also in terms of the contribution it can make to a revised \nCFE Treaty.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Article II of the Constitution gave the \nPresident and the Senate equal treaty making powers, stating that the \nPresident ``shall have the power, by and with the Advice and Consent of \nthe Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators \npresent concur.'' Substantive changes to treaties also require the \nadvice and consent of the Senate. John Jay made one of the most \npersuasive arguments about this point, noting that, ``of course, \ntreaties could be amended, but let us not forget that treaties are made \nnot by only one of the contracting parties, but by both, and \nconsequently that as the consent of both was essential to their \nformation at first, so must it ever afterwards be to alter . . . \nthem.''\n  Condition 9 of the resolution of ratification for the CFE Flank \nAgreement protects the Senate's constitutional role by requiring that \nany agreement to multilateralize the 1972 ABM Treaty be submitted to \nthe Senate for advice and consent, since any such agreement would \nsubstantively alter the rights and obligations of the United States and \nothers under the treaty. This condition is not the first expression of \nthe Senate's view on this issue, and would merely be the latest \naddition to a clear legislative history.\n  Section 232 of the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1995 \nclearly states that any agreement that substantively modifies the ABM \ntreaty must be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent.\n  The conference report accompanying the fiscal year 1997 Defense \nAuthorization Act built on the language in the 1995 Authorization Act \nstating that, ``the accord on ABM Treaty succession, tentatively agreed \nto by the administration would constitute a substantive change to the \nABM Treaty, which may only be entered into pursuant to the treaty \nmaking power of the President under the Constitution.''\n  The conversion of the ABM Treaty from a bilateral to a multilateral \nagreement represents a substantive modification of the treaty. First of \nall, multilateralization changes the agreement by altering the \ndefinition of territory, which is at the heart of the treaty. Article I \nof the 1972 ABM Treaty states, ``Each Party undertakes not to deploy \nABM systems for a defense of the territory of its country.''\n  Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding on Succession to \nthe ABM Treaty, territory would now be defined as the ``combined \nnational territories of the U.S.S.R. Successor States that have become \nParties to the Treaty.'' The term periphery would also be changed to \nmean the combined periphery of all the former Soviet states party to \nthe treaty. Thus, instead of the treaty applying to the territory of a \nsingle nation, in the case of the former Soviet Union, it would apply \nto a number of nations.\n  Multilateralization would also be a substantive change since it would \ncreate a system of unequal rights under the treaty, wherein the New \nIndependent States of the former Soviet Union would be treated as \nsecond class citizens. The ABM Treaty that the Senate agreed to 25 \nyears ago created identical rights and obligations for each party. \nUnder the memorandum of Uunderstanding on succession, however, only two \nof the potential parties to the treaty--the United States and Russia--\nwould be permitted to field an ABM system. Other nations, while \nresponsible for regulating ABM activities on their territory, would not \nbe allowed to deploy such a system. For example, Ukraine could locate \nnew early warning radars on the periphery of its territory, oriented \noutward, but would not be permitted to protect its capital with an ABM \nsystem.\n\n  The multilateralization of the ABM Treaty also undermines U.S. \nefforts to promote the independence of the former Soviet republics. The \nmemorandum of understanding on succession states that the term capital \nof the U.S.S.R. will continue to mean the city of Moscow. This \ndesignation, in addition to granting the New Independent States \ninferior rights under the treaty, and defining territory and periphery \nas the combined total of the former Soviet states sends the wrong \nmessage. It tells the New Independent States that they remain linked to \nRussia, without equal rights.\n  Finally, multilateralization represents a substantive change to the \nagreement since it would diminish U.S. rights and influence under the \ntreaty. New parties will surely be given a seat at the Standing \nConsultative Commission [SCC], which interprets, amends, and \nadministers the ABM treaty. Under the 1972 ABM Treaty, the United \nStates could take actions through bilateral agreements with the Soviet \nUnion. By expanding the number of nations in the treaty, it will now be \nnecessary to reach multilateral consensus to interpret or amend the \ntreaty. One country, such as Belarus, could effectively block United \nStates actions or demand concessions, even if Russia and the other \nparties to the treaty agreed with the United States. Negotiating \nchanges or common interpretations of treaty obligations with Russia is \na difficult task. Adding up to 11 new parties to the treaty will make \nthis process much more difficult.\n  In addition to the reasons I have cited as to why multilateralization \nwould substantively modify the ABM Treaty, and the legislative history \ncompelling the administration to submit the agreement to the Senate for \nadvice and consent, the way the Senate has considered succession \nagreements for the various arms control treaties concluded between the \nUnited States and the Soviet Union further supports the case for Senate \nconsideration of any ABM successorship document.\n  Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the only arms control treaty \nwhich was not re-submitted to the Senate for advice and consent due to \nchanges in countries covered, was the INF Treaty. This treaty carried a \nnegative obligation, namely not to possess intermediate-range nuclear \nmissiles. Since no treaty terms were altered and U.S. rights and \nobligations remained unchanged, advice and consent was not necessary.\n  The resolution of ratification for the START I Treaty was accompanied \nby a separate protocol multilateralizing the treaty, which was \nsubmitted to the Senate for advice and consent.\n  This same protocol determined successorship questions for the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty [NPT].\n  Finally, the Senate specifically considered the question of \nmultilateralization of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe [CFE] \ntreaty under condition #5 of its resolution of ratification.\n  As I have discussed today, the addition of parties to the ABM Treaty \nclearly represents a substantive modification of the treaty. The \nDefense Authorization Acts passed by the Senate in 1995 and 1997, and \nthe history of how this body has considered succession agreements to \nprevious arms control accords with the Soviet Union strongly support \nthe submission of any ABM multilateralization agreement to the Senate. \nVoting to require the administration to submit the ABM \nmultilateralization agreement for advice and consent, simply protects \nthe Senate's constitutional role in treaty making. Reasonable people \nmay differ over the merits of the ABM Treaty or the addition of one or \nmore countries to the agreement, but I believe all my colleagues can \nagree that before this new treaty is implemented, the Senate needs to \nfulfill its constitutional duty by considering whether to give its \nadvice and consent to this new agreement.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of condition 9 of the \nresolution of ratification of the CFE Flank Agreement.\n  Condition 9 simply confirms the Senate's role in treatymaking, as \nestablished in the U.S. Constitution and reaffirmed in existing law.\n  Specifically, condition 9 restates the requirement, enacted as \nsection 232 of\n\n[[Page S4468]]\n\nthe National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1995, Public Law \n103-337, that:\n\n       The United States shall not be bound by any international \n     agreement entered into by the President that would \n     substantially modify the ABM Treaty unless the agreement is \n     entered pursuant to the treaty making power of the President \n     under the Constitution.\n\n  Thus, this body is already on record supporting the preservation of \nthe Senate's constitutional prerogatives in this area.\n  In other words, the President may not unilaterally negotiate \nsubstantive changes to the ABM Treaty without the advice and consent of \nthe Senate.\n  Frankly, I am surprised some of my colleagues, who in the past have \nbeen strong supporters of this body's constitutional prerogatives with \nrespect to treaties in general, and the ABM Treaty in particular, are \narguing to strike condition 9.\n  Not only do the Constitution and U.S. law require Senate advice and \nconsent, but submission to the Senate is also consistent with recent \npractice on the multilateralization of arms agreements with the Soviet \nUnion to include successor states.\n  Both the multilateralization of START I and the multilateralization \nof the CFE Treaty were considered by the Senate when it acted on the \nLisbon protocol and the CFE Treaty itself.\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues argue that the \nmultilateralization of the ABM Treaty is not a substantive change.\n  Consider the following:\n  The proposed changes would alter the basic rights and obligations of \nthe parties--the central issue in any contract or treaty.\n  Second, the proposed changes would modify the geographic scope and \ncoverage of the Treaty, and would do so by taking the extraordinary \nstep of defining Russia's national territory to include the combined \nterritory of other independent states of the former Soviet Union.\n  Third, the role and function of the Standing Consultative Commission \n[SCC], in particular the ability of the United States to negotiate \namendments to the treaty to protect our national interests, would be \ndramatically changed by the accession of new parties to the treaty with \neffective veto power over treaty amendments.\n  Lastly, some of my colleagues have cited a Congressional Research \nService legal analysis that seems to suggest that the Senate has no \nrole in the process.\n  In response, I would like to point out that:\n  The CRS analysis concludes that an apportionment of the rights and \nobligations of the U.S.S.R. under the ABM Treaty to its successor \nstates would not, in itself, seem to require Senate participation.\n  The CRS analysis goes on to say, however, ``arguably, a \nmultilateralization agreement could include matters that would alter \nthe substance of the ABM Treaty and require Senate advice and \nconsent.''\n  The administration's proposal clearly falls into the latter category.\n  It does much more than merely apportion the rights and obligations of \nthe U.S.S.R.\n  It apportions some rights to some successor parties--but denies them \nto others, in effect creating two classes of parties. This asymmetry \nand lack of reciprocity represents a clear departure from both the \nlegal and strategic assumptions embodied in the initial treaty.\n  It specifically permits Russia to establish ABM facilities on the \nterritory of other independent states. This is not an apportionment; \nthis creates a new right under the treaty.\n  The administration proposal admits to the treaty states which neither \nhave nor intend to have offensive or defensive strategic weapons, while \ngiving them virtual veto rights over the strategic posture of other \nparties.\n  This brings me to the most important point: The administration's \nproposal affects the rights of the United States to provide for our own \ndefense as we see fit.\n  It was to protect those rights that the Senate was given its advice \nand consent role in the first place. The Senate must not abdicate its \nrole, now.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this provision.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the past success \nof the CFE Treaty and to stress that, in order to continue that \nsuccess, this body must now offer its advice and consent for the CFE \nTreaty's Flank Document.\n  Since the CFE Treaty entered into force in 1992 it has made Europe a \nsafer place; not just because it has resulted in the removal or \ndestruction of over 53,000 items of major military equipment; not just \nbecause it has enabled international inspectors to undertake nearly \n3,000 on-site international inspections; but, above all, because it has \nfostered a sense of trust between NATO and Russia.\n  Now, as we move to build on that sense of trust and deal with Russia \nas a new democratic state rather than an old arch-enemy, it is only \nfair and proper that we address Russia's concerns with respect to some \nof the arcane provisions of this treaty. The CFE Treaty, as written, \nestablishes zones on an old cold war map, a map drawn before the \nbreakup of the former Soviet Union. The pending revised Flank Document \nupdates alters some of the provisions of this treaty to reflect the \nfact that we're now dealing with a new map.\n  Clearly the Flank Document does not address all the issues that we \nmust face in adapting the CFE Treaty to the new situation in Europe, \nbut it is a fine first step.\n  The conditions in the resolution of ratification are, for the most \npart, thoughtful and necessary. I also support the amendment, offered \nby Senators Kerry and Sarbanes, clarifying condition 5 as it relates to \nArmenia.\n  Without this amendment, section F of condition No. 5 would have \nrequired the President to submit a special report to Congress regarding \nwhether or not Armenia has been in compliance with the CFE Treaty, and, \nif not, what actions the President has taken to implement sanctions.\n  Why should we single out Armenia? Without the amendment, the language \nassumed that Armenia and only Armenia violated the CFE Treaty and \nshould suffer sanctions.\n  This amendment was added in the interest of fairness and simply asks \nthe President to examine compliance of all States Parties located in \nthe Caucasus region rather than singling out Armenia for special \ntreatment.\n  While the amendment ameliorates one problem with the resolution of \nratification, I have another misgiving about another condition that was \nadopted by the Committee on Foreign Relations during consideration of \nthe treaty last week. Condition No. 9 would require the President to \ncertify that he will submit to the Senate, for its advice and consent, \nthe agreement to multilateralize the 1971 Anti-Ballistic Missile \nTreaty.\n  I am of the same mind as my distinguished colleague, Senator Biden, \non this issue. While the Senate does not prohibit itself from attaching \nunrelated conditions to resolutions of ratification, the Senate should \nexercise some self-restraint in such important matters. The Founding \nFathers clearly distinguished the question of treaty ratification by \nrequiring a supermajority in such cases. This is not every day \nlegislation we're dealing with here. We're debating whether or not to \nratify a treaty, and this attached, unrelated condition really has no \nplace in today's debate.\n  In short, condition No. 9 links ratification of the Flank Document \nwith the unrelated, but controversial 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile \nTreaty debate. There are merits to both sides of that issue and that \ndebate will surely have its time. This is the wrong way to move that \ndebate forward.\n  Let us be certain of one thing: The Senate, with condition 9, \ninterferes with what has long been a function of the executive branch. \nIn the breakups of the U.S.S.R., Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and \nEthiopia, when the new States took on the treaty rights and obligations \nof their predecessors, no request for Senate advice and consent was \nsought. I ask my colleagues: Why are we treating the ABM Treaty \ndifferently?\n  In spite of my objection to condition 9, this treaty and its \nresolution of ratification are too important to be bogged down today \nover a debate on the ABM Treaty. I believe that the appropriate course \nof action is to ratify the pending Flank Document this is a reasonable \ninitial adjustment to the CFE\n\n[[Page S4469]]\n\nTreaty. In doing so, we will also show Russia that we are willing to \nwork with Russian officials in facing legitimate concerns, and, most \nimportantly, we will maintain the viability of this valuable 30-nation \nagreement.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise in appreciation for the \nleadership of the chairman, the Senator from North Carolina, on this \nissue and as member of his committee I rise in support of the \nratification of the CFE Flank Agreement.\n  The CFE Treaty has been remarkably successful in reducing the cold \nwar arsenals of conventional weapons in Europe. To date well over \n50,000 tanks, artillery pieces and aircraft have been destroyed or \nremoved from Europe. This treaty serves as an important mechanism to \ncontinue balanced force reductions in Europe, to build confidence among \nEuropean States, and to provide assurances that NATO expansion will in \nno way threaten Russia.\n  In addition to the Europe-wide national ceilings on specific \ncategories of military equipment, the CFE Treaty established a system \nof four zones inside the map of Europe with separate subceilings. The \nthree central zones are nested and overlapping, the fourth zone is the \nflank zone. The flank zones include Russia's northern and southern \nmilitary districts that, during the cold war, were areas of heightened \ntension with NATO. NATO has corresponding limits on its Northern and \nSouthern Flanks.\n  The CFE flank zones limit the amount of equipment a country is \npermitted to deploy in certain areas of its own territory. The outbreak \nof armed ethnic conflicts in and around the Caucasus in 1993 and 1994, \nmost notably the large scale offensive launched by the Russian \nGovernment in Chechnya, led to Russian claims for the need to deploy \nequipment in excess of treaty limits in that zone.\n  Under the CFE Treaty, mechanisms exist that would allow parties the \nflexibility to make temporary adjustments in the size or location of \ntheir military equipment holdings with proper notification. However, in \n1994 the Government of Russia signaled its intention to violate the \ntreaty if such restrictions were not permanently relaxed.\n  In early 1995, Clinton administration officials adamantly insisted \nthat Russia must meet its obligations under the CFE Treaty on schedule. \nBy May of that same year, those rigid statements demanding compliance \nsoon collapsed into a frenzied effort to renegotiate the treaty on \nterms that would be acceptable to Russia.\n  Aside from the embarrassing spectacle of Western concessions in the \nface of Russian arms control violations, the NATO alliance was further \nundermined by a United States-Russian side deal that failed to gain the \nsupport of our allies. A key element of the final compromise on this \ntreaty is a confidential side statement which U.S. negotiators provided \nto the Russian delegation in order to win their approval of the Flank \nDocument. An interim United States-Russian proposal--known as the \nPerry-Grachev understanding--led to yet another embarrassing retreat, \nthis time from our own NATO allies. Finally, after 11th hour \nnegotiations, the agreement before us today was accepted by all 30 \nparties to the CFE Treaty.\n  In order to understand the process through which this treaty was \napproved, I strongly recommend that any interested Senator review that \nshort document, which is available in the Office of Senate Security on \nthe fourth floor of the Capitol. After reading that document, the \npurpose of the numerous restrictions contained in the resolution of \nratification--particularly paragraphs 3 and 6--should be abundantly \nclear.\n  The committee resolution reverses the affects of this side agreement \nby prohibiting United States participation in any negotiations which \nwould allow Russia to violate the sovereignty of its neighbors. As \nfurther assurance, the resolution requires the President to certify, \nprior to deposit of the instrument of ratification, that he will \nvigorously reject any other side agreements sought by the Russians or \nany other country.\n  I believe that the proper approach for the United States would have \nbeen to insist on Russian compliance 18 months ago. However, the 30 \nparties to the treaty were willing to reach a compromise consisting of \nthe document before the Senate today. In all likelihood, if this treaty \nis rejected, it will be renegotiated on less favorable terms. With that \nin mind, and because of the 14 conditions included in the committee's \nresolution of ratification, I am willing to recommend support for this \ntreaty.\n  The treaty is an acceptable first step in resolving the difficult \nchallenge of adapting a cold war era treaty to post-cold-war realities. \nIt is one part in a series of efforts underway to redesign the security \narchitecture of Europe, and as such it is an important step toward the \nlarger goal of NATO enlargement.\n  The CFE Treaty and the Vienna-based organization that oversees its \nimplementation are important pieces of the geopolitical landscape of \nEurope and the former Soviet Union. With the end of the cold war, \ndecisions made in the context of the CFE Treaty affect U.S. security on \nthe margins. But for countries such as the Baltic States, Ukraine, \nGeorgia, and Azerbaijan, such decisions can affect the very sovereignty \nof these newly independent countries.\n  Russia--still the largest military power in Europe--has used its \narmed forces in recent years in both Georgia and Azerbaijan. Russia \nuses its military presence in Ukraine and Moldova to influence the \nsovereign governments of those states. Russian Government officials \nhave made open threats of military invasion against the Baltics. \nFinally, less than a year ago, a bloody war in Chechnya was brought to \nan end. That war was characterized by wide scale Russian atrocities, \nthe intentional targeting of civilians, and casualties possibly in \nexcess of 100,000 people--mostly innocent men, women, and children. It \nis against this back drop that the countries on Russia's periphery \nwatch any revisions to the security guarantees contained in the CFE \nTreaty.\n  Mr. President, I understand my time is up.\n  On this basis, this treaty has been negotiated. Again, with the \nleadership of the chairman, I urge support from the Senate and thank \nyou for this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I want to pay my respects to the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith]. He is the chairman of \nthe Europe subcommittee, and he has devoted an enormous amount of time \nand effort to bringing this treaty forward. So he thanks me, but I \nthank him. I am glad he is in the Senate. I am glad he is a member of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I have been asked to advise Senators that the coming vote, after the \nable Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, completes his \npresentation, the ensuing vote will be the last vote of the day.\n  I yield the floor and yield back such time as I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time remains before the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3\\1/2\\ minutes for Senator Biden. You \nhave 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend the managers of the agreement for \nthe expeditious manner in which they have moved this agreement through \nthe committee and to the floor in time for the deadline of May 15 in \norder that it not be subject to further action by the review conference \nin Vienna. As I understand it, the agreement was not submitted to the \nSenate by the Secretary of State until April 3, 1997. So I commend the \ncommittee. But I also wish to express my concern over the rushed manner \nin which the Senate has been forced to deal with this important treaty. \nAll of us in this Chamber know that treaties are not considered by the \nHouse of Representatives, but they still have the effect and status of \nbeing the law of the land of our Nation. They have as much or even more \nimportance, in some respects, and certainly as far as the Senate is \nconcerned, than any bill that is passed by both Houses and has been \nsubjected to the scrutiny of a conference committee.\n\n[[Page S4470]]\n\n  In the case of treaties, the Senate considers them and, assuming that \nthe President exchanges the instruments of ratification, they become \nthe law of the land according to article 6 of the United States \nConstitution. Therefore, the Senate has a special responsibility, in \nthe case of treaties, to exercise due caution and great care in dealing \nwith treaties, since there is no review or check by the other body. \nAdditionally, the Senate provides the only forum for the debate of the \nprovisions of treaties, and for informing the American people about \ntheir content. Because of those realities, I am very concerned about \nthe increasing tendency in this body, as has been evidenced by the \nChemical Weapons Treaty that we recently passed, and now by this \ntreaty, to enter into time agreements that inadequately protect the \nrights of all Senators to debate and amend treaties, but which also \nfail to defend the rights of the American people to know what is in the \ntreaties. I think it is a bad trend. I think it should be curtailed, \nbecause it does not allow Members to thoroughly study and debate these \ncomplicate and important matters.\n  This committee report bears the date of May 9, 1997, when it was \nordered to be printed. That was last Friday. As I understand it, it was \nmade available to my staff on Monday of this week, and, so, I have had \nbetween Monday and now to consider the contents of the committee \nreport. The committee report is where we naturally turn to understand \nthe content of the treaty or content of the bill or resolution, as it \nwere. Also, the courts turn to the phraseology of a committee report to \nbetter understand the intent of the legislature when it passes on a \nbill or resolution, or approves the resolution of ratification of a \ntreaty. So it is important that Members have an adequate opportunity to \nstudy a committee report.\n  It is important that they have adequate opportunity to study the \nhearings. It is likewise important that they have an adequate \nopportunity to fully debate a treaty. Let me say, again, that according \nto article 6 of the United States Constitution--the Constitution, this \nConstitution--and the laws that are made in pursuance of this \nConstitution and the treaties that are made under the authority of the \nUnited States shall be the supreme law of the land--the supreme law of \nthe land.\n  Now, that is a very heavy burden to place upon the U.S. Senate, as it \nis given the sole responsibility with respect to the Congress. As far \nas the Congress is concerned, the Senate has the sole responsibility, a \nvery heavy responsibility, to study treaties, to conduct hearings \nthereon, to mark up the treaties, to approve of conditions or \nreservations, amendments, whatever, to those treaties. There is no \nother body that scrutinizes the treaty. The Senate of the United \nStates--and that is one of the reasons why the Senate is the unique \nbody that it is--unique body, the premier upper body in the world \ntoday, more so than the House of Lords in our mother country. And so it \nplaces upon us as Senators a responsibility that is very, very heavy, \nand we have a duty to know what is in a treaty before we vote on it. We \nget these requests, and here we are backed up against a date of the \n15th.\n  We had the same problem, in a way, I think, with respect to the \nchemical weapons treaty. We are handed a unanimous consent request, and \nit is a bit intimidating for one Senator to be faced with the prospect \nthat he will be holding up the business of the Senate if he holds up \nthe unanimous consent request. But that is our responsibility; that is \nour duty.\n  So, I am increasingly concerned by the trend, as I have said, that we \nare finding ourselves being subjected to. It did not just begin \nyesterday or the day before, and I am not attempting to place any blame \nfor that. I am simply calling attention to the fact that we have the \nresponsibility as Senators under the Constitution, to which we swear an \noath to uphold to support and defend, we have a duty to know what is in \nthis treaty.\n  I am not on the committee, but I am a Senator, and I have as heavy a \nduty as does the Senator from North Carolina or the Senator from \nDelaware. That is the way I see it. I have as heavy a duty to know what \nI am voting on, because this is the law of the land. It is not an \nordinary bill or resolution which can be vetoed by the President and \nwhich, if signed into law by the President, can be repealed next week \nor the following week or the next month. It is not that easy to negate \nthe effects of a treaty if we find we made a mistake.\n  Well, so much for that. Here we are debating the treaty. We have one, \ntwo, three, four Senators on the floor debating an important treaty, \nand we are confined within a 2\\1/2\\-hour time limit, I believe. Four \nSenators. The law of the land. We should be debating the treaty without \na time limit, at least in the beginning.\n  I have been majority leader of the Senate twice during the years when \nPresident Carter was President. I did not serve under Mr. Carter, I \nserved with him. Senators don't serve under Presidents, we serve with \nPresidents. But I was majority leader during those 4 years. I was \nmajority leader in the 100th Congress. I was minority leader in all of \nthe Congresses in between 1981 and 1986.\n  We had some important treaties: INF Treaty, we had the Panama Canal \nTreaties, and we did not bring treaties like this to the floor and ask \nthey be debated, no amendments thereon, and in a time limitation of 2 \nhours. And there was a request to cut that to 1 hour. We did not do \nthat.\n  When I came here, we debated treaties, and we took our time. At some \npoint, it is all right to try to get a time limitation after things \nhave been aired; it is all right to try to bring it to closure. But I \nam somewhat disturbed and concerned by this trend that we find \nourselves being subjected to.\n\n  As to the substance of the treaty, I want to note that condition No. \n8 dealing with treaty interpretation provides sound guidance on the \nmeaning of ``condition,'' which was authored by the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, now the ranking Democrat on the \nForeign Relations Committee, myself and former Senator Sam Nunn, the \nformer chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and agreed to \non the Treaty on Intermediate Nuclear Forces in Europe of 1988. That is \nthe INF Treaty.\n  In that instance, I was under great pressure from my friends on the \nRepublican side of the aisle and great pressure from my friends on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle to bring up the treaty. As majority \nleader, I thought it was my duty to wait until we had resolved some \ncritical problems that were estimated to be critical problems by the \nArmed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee before I \nbrought it up. We spent considerable time on the treaty.\n  Condition (8) states that ``nothing in [the so-called Biden-Byrd] \ncondition shall be construed as authorizing the President to obtain \nlegislative approval for modifications or amendments to treaties \nthrough a majority approval of both Houses.''\n  Why was it necessary--I would like to ask this question of either the \nmanager or the ranking manager of the resolution--why was it necessary \nfor us to include condition (8), which certainly is a condition that I \nstrongly support? Why was it necessary for us to include condition (8)?\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, would the Senator like me to respond?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield, Madam President.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator makes a valid observation. The truth is, it \nwas not necessary, but I would like to give the explanation why it was \nincluded, and the majority can speak even more clearly to it.\n  The concern on the part of the majority was that the Clinton \nadministration would use the Biden-Byrd language to justify sending a \nmodification of a treaty for a two-House approval by majority vote \nrather than to the Senate for a supermajority vote when, in fact, it \nwas a modification that constituted an amendment to the treaty.\n  You never intended it for that purpose; I never intended it for that \npurpose. The concern was, I think it is fair to say on the part of the \nmajority, that the Clinton administration might have attempted to read \nit to allow them to avoid submission to the Senate for a supermajority \nvote under the Constitution and just go to each House for a majority \nvote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does the manager wish to add anything?\n  Mr. HELMS. No, except to say Senator Biden has said it correctly.\n\n[[Page S4471]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I am pleased that we have not done that. In other words, as \nI understand the distinguished ranking manager, the administration \noriginally wanted the approval of disagreements through normal \nlegislative action by both bodies of the Congress which would, of \ncourse, require only majority approval in both bodies. Was that the \nconcern?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes, it is. If I may say, Madam President, to the \ndistinguished leader, that in a November 25, 1996, memorandum for Alan \nJ. Kreczko, Special Assistant to the President and Legal Adviser to the \nNational Security Council, from Christopher Schroeder, Acting Assistant \nAttorney General, there is this phrase on page 14 of that memorandum. \nIt says:\n\n       Because the Senate took the view that such ``common \n     understandings'' of a treaty had the same binding effect as \n     express provisions of the treaty for the purposes of U.S. \n     law, the Biden condition logically supports the proposition \n     that the President may be authorized to accept changes in \n     treaty obligations either by further Senate advice and \n     consent or by statutory enactment.\n  The next paragraph:\n\n       In light of these judicial and historical precedents, we \n     conclude the Congress may authorize the President, through an \n     executive agreement, substantially to modify the United \n     States' international obligations under an arms control (or \n     other political-military) treaty.\n\n  So the purpose, again, was to make it clear what you and I, as we \nunderstood at the time that condition was added--I might add, I get \ncredit for it being called the Biden-Byrd condition, of which I am very \nproud, but the truth of the matter is, after having suggested such a \ncondition early in the ratification process, I spent the next 7 months \nin the hospital during the remainder of the whole ratification process, \nand it was the distinguished leader, the Senator from West Virginia--it \nreally should be the Byrd-Biden condition. Nonetheless, that is the \nreason. You and I never thought a majority vote in both Houses as a \nsimple piece of legislation would be sufficient to approve an amendment \nto a treaty, and that was the concern expressed by the majority that it \nbe memorialized, if you will, in condition (8).\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the very able ranking manager, and I compliment him \nagain and compliment the manager. I am glad that condition has been \nmade clear.\n  Secondly, I would like to ask the managers of the agreement their \nreasoning behind their view of the collective impact of conditions (1), \n(2) and (3). Let me preface what I have just said by reading excerpts \nfrom these conditions.\n\n\n                Condition 1: Policy of the United States\n\n  I read from the committee report, page 20:\n\n       Condition (1) simply restates United States policy that no \n     Russian troops should be deployed on another country's \n     territory without the freely-given consent of that country. \n     Unfortunately, Russia continues to station troops in several \n     sovereign countries of the former Soviet Union--in several \n     cases against the express wishes of the host country.\n\n\n              Condition 2: Violations of state sovereignty\n\n       Condition (2) states the view of the Senate that Russian \n     troops are deployed abroad against the will of some countries \n     (namely, Moldova). It further states the Secretary of State \n     should undertake priority discussions to secure the removal \n     of Russian troops from any country that wishes them \n     withdrawn. Further, it requires the Administration to issue a \n     joint statement with the other fifteen members of the NATO \n     alliance reaffirming the principles that this treaty \n     modification does not give any country: (1) The right to \n     station forces abroad against the will of the recipient \n     country; or (2) the right to demand reallocation of military \n     equipment quotas under the CFE Treaty and the Tashkant \n     Agreement. This joint statement was issued, in fact, on May \n     8, 1997 in Vienna.\n\n\n               Condition 3: Facilitation of negotiations\n\n  Now, I am particularly interested in this condition.\n\n       Condition (3) ensures that the United States will not be \n     party to any efforts by Russia to intimidate or otherwise \n     extract CFE Treaty concessions from its smaller neighbors.\n\n  Let me interpolate right there for the moment with a rhetorical \nquestion.\n  Why should we have to have a condition to ensure that the United \nStates will not be party to any efforts by Russia to intimidate or \notherwise extract CFE Treaty concessions from its smaller neighbors? It \nwould seem to me that would be a given.\n  Let me continue, and then I will yield to the distinguished ranking \nmember.\n\n       Indeed, this condition, along with much of the rest of the \n     resolution, is specifically designed to require the United \n     States to safeguard the sovereign rights of other countries \n     (such as Ukraine, Moldova, Azerbaijan, and Georgia) in their \n     dealings with the Russian Federation.\n\n  Listen to this:\n\n       The committee became alarmed, over the course of its \n     consideration of the CFE Flank Document, with several aspects \n     of the United States negotiating record. This condition \n     [condition No. 3] will ensure that the United States will \n     adhere to the highest principles in the conduct of \n     negotiations undertaken pursuant to the treaty, the CFE Flank \n     Document, and any side statements that have already been \n     issued or which may be issued in the future.\n\n  Now, there are several questions that jump out at anyone who reads \nthat paragraph.\n  It makes reference to ``side statements.'' It uses the word \n``alarmed.'' There is a condition there that ensures that the United \nStates will not be a party to any efforts by Russia to intimidate or \notherwise extract CFE Treaty concessions from a smaller neighbor.\n  Why do we have to have a condition to that effect? Is there some \nconfusion about what the right position is that the United States \nshould take? Is it not a given that the United States would not be a \nparty to any efforts by Russia to intimidate concessions from its \nsmaller neighbors?\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me say, this all came about--and they are, obviously, \nas usual, very good, incisive and insightful questions.\n  I think it is unnecessary because I think it is a given. But let me \nexplain, in fairness, why we got to this point and why I thought it \nwas--speaking only for myself--a clarification, although in some sense \nI thought it was a demeaning clarification. Let me explain.\n  During the negotiations on the flank agreement, there was concern \nabout what became referred to as a ``side agreement.'' That was, there \nwas an issue that came up during the negotiations where a diplomatic \nnote was passed, which is classified--I am not able to give you, but I \ncan tell you from the committee testimony what it said--a note that was \npassed to the Russian representative dealing with the issue of the \nstationing of Russian troops on the soil of the countries you named.\n  The Under Secretary of State, Lynn Davis, who appeared before the \ncommittee on April 29, was asked to explain. He went on to explain why \na statement was made to the Russians. The statement made was that we \nwould--this is the quote, in part--``the United States is prepared to \nfacilitate or act as an intermediary for a successful outcome in \ndiscussions that could take place under the flank agreement and the CFE \nTreaty between Russia and other Newly Independent States.''\n  The worry expressed by my friends in the Republican Party was that \nthis reflected a possible inclination to try to mollify Russia and put \nAmerican pressure on Moldova or Georgia or other states to accept \nRussian deployment of Russian forces on their soil.\n\n  The concern was that the assertion made by the U.S. negotiators was a \nway of saying, do not worry, we are going to help you to get Russian \ntroops placed in those regions.\n  Lynn Davis, the Under Secretary said, no, that was never the \nintention of that ``side agreement,'' as it became referred to.\n  I will quote what he said at the hearing to my friend from West \nVirginia. He said:\n\n       We see this particular statement of our intentions as part \n     of the reassurance that we can make so that those countries \n     will feel that this is an agreement that continues to be in \n     their security interests. This statement of our intentions \n     makes clear that the commitment is predicated on an \n     understanding that any agreements between Russia and the \n     Newly Independent States must be done on a voluntary basis \n     with due respect for the sovereignty of the countries \n     involved, and our role here is indeed to reinforce that and \n     ensure that it is carried out.\n\n  This was the concern that was expressed by my friends on the \nRepublican side, that the United States intention to level the playing \nfield between Russia and other Newly Independent States had not been \nseen that way by all concerned.\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\n  So what was done--and the administration signed on to the condition--\nwas to make it crystal clear that this offer of an intermediary role \nwas not for the purpose of using our influence or power to coerce them \ninto accepting a demand or a suggestion from their Russian brethren.\n  That is the context, I say to my friend, in which it came up. You \nused the phrase ``the committee became alarmed.'' Some in the committee \nwere alarmed because of the wording of the ``side agreement.'' This was \ndone to clarify what the administration says was their intent from the \nbeginning but now locks in the stated interpretation by the \nadministration of what that whole thing was all about.\n  I hope I have answered the question, and I hope I have done it \ncorrectly.\n  Mr. HELMS. You have done it correctly, I say to the Senator.\n  Conditions 1, 2, and 3 of the resolution on ratification require the \nPresident to observe reasonable limits in the conduct of certain \nnegotiations facilitated by the United States in support of the CFE \nTreaty. Specifically, this entails an obligation for the President to \nconduct his diplomacy in a manner that respects the sovereignty and \nfree will of countries on the periphery of Russia that are under \npressure by Russia to allow the establishment of military bases.\n  In fact, I do not believe that the United States should be party to \nany negotiation which could result in allowing Russia to deploy its \ntroops into the territory occupied by the Soviet Union for nearly 70 \nyears. Yet this is exactly the result contemplated by the Clinton \nadministration if this resolution of ratification is not clear on this \npoint. Conditions 1, 2, and 3 are clear on this matter.\n  It is clear from this document that the Clinton administration has \ndemonstrated a willingness to participate in negotiations that could \nactually result in the establishment of Russian military bases on the \nterritory of other States with the endorsement--and even with the \nactive assistance--of the United States. Is there anyone in the \nadministration who is prepared to state that it would be in the United \nStates' interest for Russia to establish military bases outside of its \nterritory?\n  The Clinton administration offers hollow assertions that Russian \ntroops will not be deployed in other States without the freely given \nconsent of the relevant government. Russia--still the largest military \npower in Europe--has used its armed forces in recent years in both \nGeorgia and Azerbaijan with virtually no complaint from the Clinton \nadministration.\n  Russia uses its military presence in Ukraine and Moldova to influence \nthe sovereign governments of those States while the Clinton \nadministration remains silent. Russian Government officials have made \nopen threats of military invasion against the Baltic States. Finally, \nless than 1 year ago, a bloody war in Chechnya was brought to an end. \nThat war was characterized by wide scale Russian atrocities, the \nintentional targeting of civilians, and casualties possibly in excess \nof 100,000 people--mostly innocent men, women, and children. Do the \nadministration's lawyers find that these incidents were with the freely \ngiven consent of the affected governments?\n  Conditions 1, 2, and 3 set reasonable limits specifically tied to \nactivities cited in paragraph IV (2) and (3) of the CFE Flank Document.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President--Madam President, I made the mistake of \nreferring to the Presiding Officer as ``Mr. President\" before I turned \naround. And I also made the mistake of referring to Under Secretary \nDavis as ``he.'' It is ``she.'' I knew that, and I apologize on both \nscores.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, Madam President, I came up, I suppose, at a time when \npolitical correctness did not make any difference. As far as I am \nconcerned, it does not make any difference yet. And the pronoun ``he'' \nis inclusive. It was inclusive when I was a boy; it was inclusive when \nI became a man. It still is inclusive of the female. So I would not \nworry too much about that.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, as the distinguished former majority \nleader knows, another former majority leader, Senator Baker, used an \nexpression all the time. He would come to the floor, and he would say, \n``I ain't got no dog in that fight.''\n  Mr. BYRD. I commend the committee for including that condition.\n  I can understand how the committee would become alarmed. I think that \nit would have been well if all Senators could have been notified that \nthere was--and maybe they were, I do not know, but I do not remember \nbeing notified except through my own staff that there was such a paper \nup in room 407 so that they could have gone up and examined it. I heard \nabout it this afternoon, and I went up and looked at it.\n  So I think the committee had a right to be alarmed. I congratulate \nthe committee on including the condition which, as Mr. Biden has just \nsaid, locks it in, locks the administration in, so there will be no \ndoubt that the United States will not be party to any efforts by Russia \nto intimidate or otherwise extract CFE Treaty concessions from its \nsmaller neighbors.\n  I would dare say, if the people in Azerbaijan or Armenia or Georgia \nshould see that language, they would be alarmed also--they would be \nalarmed also. They would wonder, where does the United States stand? \nBut the condition is there. And I again commend the committee on \nincluding it.\n  Do the managers feel that U.S. policy is now clearly to protect the \ninterests and rights of the newly sovereign nations of the Caucasus \nagainst intimidation and pressure tactics by the Russians regarding \nequipment that is covered by the flank agreement that we are \nconsidering here today?\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would say yes, as well, Madam President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank all Senators. Especially I thank \nthe manager and ranking manager on the committee.\n  I shall vote for the treaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Will the Senator yield me 1 minute?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 1 minute to the Senator.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator.\n  During the past 4 years, the Clinton administration has remained \nsilent while Russia has encroached upon the territory and sovereignty \nof its neighbors. It was the lack of a foreign policy--not a lack of \ntools--that allowed this to happen.\n  I have confidence that the new Secretary of State will correct the \ncourse of our policies toward Russia, and I gladly support this treaty \nto aid the Honorable Madeleine Albright in that endeavor. The collapse \nof the Soviet Union was one of the finest moments of the 20th century. \nTo allow even a partial restoration of the Soviet Union before the turn \nof the century would be a failure of an even greater magnitude.\n  Senator Lott, I believe, is standing by.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, before the distinguished leader takes the \nfloor, if I could just take 60 seconds of the 3 minutes I have \nremaining to comment on something the Senator from West Virginia said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, the Senate has always been served well by \nthe talent of the Senator from West Virginia and, most importantly, in \nmaking sure that we do our job responsibly.\n  I would make only one 20-second explanation of why I think this \ntreaty got less of a cover than any others.\n  One was the way in which it was delayed and being presented and the \ntimeframe. But a second reason is that people who followed this, which \nis a mistake to assume everyone should, people who follow this have \nbeen aware of what the terms of the agreement were since May of last \nyear.\n  I think many of us fell into the routine on Foreign Relations and \nArmed Services of thinking that its terms were well known. And it was \nwidely accepted, the broad outlines of the treaty. But I think the \nSenator makes a very valid point and I, too, as ranking member of this \ncommittee, do not want\n\n[[Page S4473]]\n\nto be party to these expedited efforts to deal with very significant \nsecurity issues relating to the United States.\n  Mr. HELMS. Let us make a pact.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We make a pact.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank both Senators.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I reserve the remainder of my time, if I have any.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, could I inquire how much time is remaining \nfor debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 5 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Delaware has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Then I will yield myself time off my leader's time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Do you need more time?\n  Mr. LOTT. No. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I am glad I was able to come to the floor, Madam President, and \nlisten to this exchange. I always enjoy learning from the exchanges \ninvolving the senior Senators, like the Senators from West Virginia and \nNorth Carolina and Delaware. I wish all Members had been here for the \nlast hour and heard this debate.\n  I do want to take just a few minutes, as we get to the close of \ndebate, to speak on the Chemical Forces in Europe flank agreement or \nresolution of ratification because I think it is very important. I wish \nwe did have more time to talk about all of its ramifications, but I \nknow the chairman and the ranking member have gone over the importance \nof this treaty earlier today.\n  Madam President, we have an important treaty before us today \nmodifying the 1990 Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Agreement [CFE]. \nThe Flank Document adjusts the CFE boundaries to reflect the collapse \nof the Soviet Empire, adds reporting requirements, and increases \ninspection provisions.\n  Negotiations to modify the CFE Treaty began in 1995, because Russia \nthreatened to violate the flank limits in the original treaty. The \nprecedent of modifying a treaty to accommodate violations by a major \nsignatory concerned many of us. We have also been concerned about how \nRussia intends to use the Flank Agreement to pressure countries on its \nborders--former Republics of the Soviet Union. Our concerns were \ndramatically heightened by the classified side agreement the \nadministration reached to further accommodate Russian demands. This \nside agreement is available for all Senators to review in room S-407 of \nthe Capitol.\n  The concerns about the CFE Flank Agreement are shared by a number of \nstates which have been subjected to Russian intimidation, pressure and \nsubversion. States with Russian troops on their soil without their \nconsent--Moldova, Ukraine, and Georgia--have rightly expressed concern \nthat the Flank Agreement must not undermine their sovereign right to \ndemand withdrawal of those Russian forces. A fourth country, \nAzerbaijan, has been subject to Russian-sponsored coups and \nassassination attempts. They have been reluctant to approve the Flank \nAgreement without adequate assurances.\n  The resolution of ratification before the Senate today addresses \nthese concerns. The resolution includes a number of binding conditions \nwhich make clear to all CFE parties that no additional rights for \nRussian military deployments outside Russian borders are granted. The \nresolution ensures that United States diplomacy will not be engaged on \nthe side of Russia but on the side of the victims of Russian policies. \nIn addition, the 16 members of NATO issued a statement last week \naffirming that no additional rights are granted to Russia by the Flank \nAgreement. This statement was a direct result of the concerns expressed \nby other CFE parties and by the Senate.\n  The resolution directly addresses the administration's side agreement \nin condition 3 which limits United States diplomatic activities to \nensuring the rights of the smaller countries on Russia's borders. This \nresolution ensures the United States will not tacitly support Russian \npolicies that have undermined the independence of Ukraine, Georgia, \nMoldova, and Azerbaijan. Finally, the resolution requires detailed \ncompliance reports and lays out a road map for dealing with \nnoncompliance in the future.\n  The resolution of ratification also addresses important issues of \nSenate prerogatives. It clarifies that the Byrd-Biden condition, added \nto the INF Treaty in 1988, does not allow the administration to avoid \nSenate advice and consent on treaty modifications or amendments. The \nresolution addresses the issue of multilateralizing the 1972 ABM Treaty \nin condition 9. The administration has raised objections to this \nprovision as they have to many previous efforts to assert Senate \nprerogatives on this point. This should be an institutional position--\nnot a partisan issue.\n  For more than 3 years, Congress has been on the record expressing \nserious misgivings about the administration plan to alter the ABM \nTreaty by adding new signatories. Section 232 of the 1994 defense \nauthorization bill states the issue clearly: ``The United States shall \nnot be bound by any international agreement entered into by the \nPresident that would substantively modify the ABM Treaty unless the \nagreement is entered pursuant to the treaty making power of the \nPresident under the Constitution.''\n\n  Efforts to address the multi- lateralization issue since then have \nresulted in filibusters and veto threats. It should not surprise anyone \nthat the Senate selected this resolution of ratification to address the \nissue--just as Senators Byrd and Biden selected the resolution of \nratification for the INF Treaty to address an ABM Treaty issue 9 years \nago.\n  Many of my colleagues are familiar with the issue of ABM multi- \nlateralization. Despite the often arcane legal arguments, the issue is \nnot complicated. The Senate gave its advice and consent to the 1972 ABM \nTreaty as a bilateral agreement between the United States and the \nSoviet Union. The administration has proposed adding as many as four \nnew signatories to the treaty and has negotiated limited treaty rights \nfor those new signatories. The administration's proposal would define \nRussia's national territory to include these countries for purposes of \nthe ABM Treaty. The administration's proposal would essentially define \nmilitary equipment of these countries as belonging to Russia for \npurposes of the ABM Treaty. The administration's proposal would add new \ncountries to the ABM Treaty but not grant them rights allowed the \noriginal signatories. This would mean that countries would have the \npower to block future U.S. amendments to the ABM Treaty--even though \nthe new signatories would not have the same rights and obligations as \nthe United States. The administration's proposed multilateralization \nwould only address some of the military equipment covered under the \noriginal ABM Treaty--leaving a radar in Latvia, for example, outside \nthe scope of the new treaty. Under the administration's proposal, the \nvast majority of states independent which succeeded the Soviet Union \nwould be free to develop and deploy unlimited missile defenses--a \ndramatic change from the situation in 1972 when the deployment of \nmissile defenses on these territories was strictly limited by the ABM \nTreaty.\n  In part and in total, these are clearly substantive modifications \nwhich require--under U.S. law--Senate advice and consent. \nMultilateralization would alter the object and purpose of the ABM \nTreaty as approved by the Senate in 1972. Multilateralization, \ntherefore, must be subject to the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  The administration argues that it has the sole power to determine \nquestions of succession. But that is not true. The Congressional \nResearch Service opinion, quoted widely in this debate, recognizes that \n``International law regarding successor States and their treaty \nobligations * * * remains unsettled.'' It also notes that \n``international law does not provide certain guidance on the question \nof whether the republics formed on the territory of the former U.S.S.R. \nhave succeeded to the rights and obligations of the ABM Treaty'' and \nthat ``a multi- lateralization agreement could include matters that \nwould alter the substance of the ABM Treaty and require Senate advice \nand consent.'' It is my understanding that this opinion was prepared a \nyear ago by a lawyer who has not even seen the text of the proposed \nagreement.\n  The administration's position does not recognize the arms control \nprecedents followed in the last decade. Arms control treaties are \ndifferent from\n\n[[Page S4474]]\n\ntreaties on fisheries, taxes, or cultural affairs. START I was \nconcluded with the Soviet Union but entered into force only after the \nSenate gave its advice and consent to the Lisbon Protocol apportioning \nthe nuclear forces of the former Soviet Union among successor States. \nThe Bush administration did not argue that Ukrainian SS-19 missiles \nwere the property of Russia. Yet, the Clinton administration \nis essentially arguing that Ukrainian phased-array radars are Russian \nunder the proposed ABM multilateralization agreement. The question of \nsuccessor state obligations under the CFE Treaty was explicitly \nrecognized by the Senate when we gave our advice and consent to that \ntreaty. During our consideration, a condition was included in the \nresolution of ratification which specified procedures for the accession \nof new States Parties to the CFE Treaty. On the issue of ABM \nmultilateralization, Congress has specifically legislated on our right \nto review the agreement. To my knowledge, that has not happened on any \nother succession issue. Clearly, ABM multilateralization is very \ndifferent from routine succession questions which have been decided by \nthe executive branch alone.\n\n  Madam President, I agree with the administration on one important \npoint. This is a constitutional issue. The White House has taken one \nposition until today, and now the Senate has definitively taken \nanother. Last January, I asked President Clinton to agree to submit \nthree treaties for our consideration. the President has agreed to \nsubmit the ABM Demarcation agreement and the CFE Flank Agreement, which \nis before the Senate today. After he refused to submit ABM \nmultilateralization, I said publicly that I would continue to press for \nthe Senate prerogatives--because the Constitution, the precedents and \nthe law are on our side. We do not prejudge the outcome of our \nconsideration of ABM multilateralization. All we require is that the \nadministration submit the agreement to the Senate. Yes, that requires \nbuilding a consensus that may not exist today but such a consensus is \nnecessary for a truly bipartisan national security policy. That is the \nissue before the Senate today.\n  Late last week, the administration recognized the Senate's desire to \nreview ABM multilateralization. They proposed replacing the \ncertification in condition 9 with nonbinding ``sense of the Senate'' \nlanguage. In exchange, Secretary Albright offered to send a letter \nassuring us that we could address multilateralization in an indirect \nway--as part of a reference in the ABM demarcation agreement. But this \noffer was logically inconsistent. It asked the Senate to simply express \nour view about a right to provide advice and consent to \nmultilateralization--and then accept a letter that explicitly denied \nthat right. Adding new parties to the ABM Treaty is a fundamentally \ndifferent issue from the proposed demarcation limits on theater defense \nsystems. The administration's offer would allow multilateralization \nregardless of Senate action on the demarcation agreement. Our position \nis simple: We want to review multilateralization through the ``front \ndoor'' on its own merits--not through the ``back door'' as a reference \nin a substantively different agreement.\n  When the administration agreed to submit the CFE Flank Agreement for \nour advice and consent, we were asked to act by the entry into force \ndeadline of May 15. We will act today even though the treaty was not \nsubmitted to the Senate until April 7--3 months after my request. We \nwill act today even though we have a very full agenda--including comp \ntime/flex time, IDEA, partial birth abortion and the budget resolution. \nWe will fulfill our constitutional duty, we will address our concerns \nabout policy toward Russia, and we will address the important issue of \nSenate prerogatives.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the entire resolution of ratification \nreported by the Foreign Relations Committee--including condition 9 on \nABM multilateralization.\n  Madam President, I want to thank many Senators who have worked very \nhard and for quite some time on this treaty and on the ABM condition.\n  I particularly would like to thank Chairman Helms, Senator Biden, \nSenator Gordon Smith, and their staffs for all the work they did to get \nthis resolution before the Senate today. Also, I would like to thank \nSenators who helped in insisting on Senate prerogatives--Senator Warner \nand Senator McCain, Senator Smith, Senator Kyl, Senator Shelby, Senator \nLugar, and Senator Hagel. A number of Senators on the committee and \nsome not on the committee have been very much involved in this process. \nI commend them all.\n  Senators have had concerns about how and why this agreement was \nnegotiated, and we had concerns about a side deal the administration \nmade with the Russians concerning the allocation of equipment under the \ntreaty.\n  The Senate has addressed these concerns decisively in this resolution \nof ratification. The resolution places strict limits on the \nadministration's flank policy. It ensures that we will be on the side \nof the victims of Russian intimidation and that the United States will \nstand up for the independence of States on Russia's borders.\n  Most important, this resolution addresses a critical issue of Senate \nprerogative, our right to review the proposed modifications to the 1972 \nABM Treaty. It was a decade ago that another ABM Treaty issue was \nbrought in this body. That debate over interpretations of the ABM \nTreaty was finally resolved in the resolution of ratification for the \nINF Treaty in 1988.\n  Today, we are resolving the debate over multilateralization of the \nABM Treaty in this resolution of ratification. For more than 3 years \nnow Congress and the executive branch have discussed back and forth the \nappropriate Senate rule in reviewing the administration's plan to add \nnew countries to the ABM Treaty.\n  Condition 9 requires the President to submit any multilateralization \nagreement to the Senate for our advice and consent. It does not force \naction here. It just says we should have that opportunity. We should be \nable to exercise that prerogative to review these changes. It ensures \nwe will have a full opportunity to look at the merits of \nmultilateralization in the future. I believe the Constitution and legal \nprecedence are in our favor.\n  Today, the Senate will act on the Conventional Forces in the Europe \n[CFE] Flank Agreement in time to meet the May 15 deadline. In spite of \nthe limited time we had to consider the agreement and the very full \nschedule that we have had on the floor, we are meeting that deadline.\n  I did have the opportunity to discuss this issue with our very \ndistinguished Secretary of State yesterday, and we discussed the \nimportance of this CFE Flank Agreement. Also, we talked about how we \ncould properly and appropriately address our concerns about \nmultilaterilization. I suspect that she probably had something to do \nwith the decision to go forward with it in this form, and I thank her \nfor that, and the members of the committee for allowing it to go \nforward in this form.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would like to publicly comment and compliment the \nSenator from Mississippi. The truth of the matter is that this treaty \nwould not be before the Senate today as a treaty without the efforts of \nthe majority leader. The executive believed that they can do this by \nexecutive agreement. They did not think they needed to submit this to \nthe Senate, although I had been for several months explaining that I \nthought it should be treated as a treaty. It was not until the \ndistinguished leader from Mississippi said, if it is not treated as a \ntreaty, we have a problem.\n  The truth of the matter is the reason it is here is because of the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi. I thank him for that.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for those comments. I did write to the \nPresident expressing my concerns in this area in January of this year, \nand other issues.\n  When I had the opportunity to visit with Secretary Madeleine Albright \nbefore she was confirmed by the Senate, I had the temerity to read to \nher from the Constitution about our rights in the Senate in advice and \nconsent, and she said, ``You know, I agree with you. I taught that at \nGeorgetown University,'' and I believe she meant that.\n  I think we are seeing some results of that, and I appreciate the fact \nthat our prerogatives are being protected. We\n\n[[Page S4475]]\n\nhave had this opportunity to review it, debate it, and we will be able \nto take up other issues later on this year that are very important for \nSenate consideration. I think the process has worked. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution of ratification.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will take 30 seconds. I want to thank the majority \nleader, and I associate myself with the remarks of Senator Biden. I \nthank the majority leader in insisting that this come to the Hill as a \ntreaty, which requires a supermajority in the Senate. I very much \nappreciate that.\n  Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time to Mr. Biden \nand Mr. Helms. They can yield it back or they can use it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I have nothing more to say, which will \nsurprise my colleagues, except that the distinguished Democratic \nleader, I am told, may wish to speak on leader's time for a few moments \non this issue. Give me a minute to check on whether or not the \ndistinguished leader, Mr. Daschle, wishes to speak.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, the Senate today is being presented \nwith an opportunity that is as rare as it is important. For the second \ntime in less than 3 weeks, the Senate is being asked to give its advice \nand consent on a major arms control treaty: the flank agreement to the \nConventional Forces in Europe treaty.\n  Late last month, the Senate had placed before it the Chemical Weapons \nConvention [CWC]. After much debate, the Senate resoundingly rebuffed \nseveral attempts by the treaty's opponents to scuttle it, and \neventually passed CWC with the support of 74 Senators.\n  Now many have questioned the length to which CWC opponents went in \ntheir efforts to kill or delay Senate consideration of this treaty. I \nshare some of those concerns. However, in the end, when the Senate was \nfinally allowed to take up the CWC treaty, I would argue that the \nensuing floor debate on the CWC treaty represented the Senate at its \nbest. Senators discussed honest disagreements on issues directly \nrelated to the CWC treaty, carefully weighed those discussions, and \nfinally voted up or down on those issues and, ultimately, the treaty \nitself. In short, during the actual floor debate of the CWC treaty, we \nsaw the Senate acting in a responsible and exemplary fashion.\n  I am confident that if we had this same kind of debate on the CFE \ntreaty, we would see the same result. In fact, the margin would \nprobably be significantly greater for CFE than for CWC. I have listened \ncarefully to the comments of my fellow Senators on for their views on \nthis important agreement and have yet to hear a single Senator voice \nhis or her opposition to the CFE treaty. This was true before the \nForeign Relations Committee attached 13 CWC-related conditions and it \nis especially true after. As a result, Senate support for the CFE \nagreement itself probably exceeds the 74 who voted for the CWC.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate is being prevented from considering the CFE \ntreaty in the same fashion we considered the CWC. We are not being \nallowed to look at just the CFE treaty and issues directly related to \nit. Instead, the time for Senate consideration of the CFE treaty is \nlikely to be spent largely on a wholly unrelated issue--the ABM treaty \nand opponents efforts to undermine it.\n  Now, I understand this is an important issue to many members on the \nother side of the aisle. And, I know that Senators are well within \ntheir rights to attach unrelated matters to most types of legislation \nwe consider\n  However, I disagree with the proponents of the ABM condition on the \nmerits and I especially disagree with them on their methods. On the \nmerits, the administration's lawyers argue persuasively that the \nConstitution assigns the exclusive responsibility to the President to \ndetermine the successor states to any treaty when an original party \ndissolves, to make whatever adjustments might be required to accomplish \nsuch succession, and to enter into agreements for this purpose. \nIncreasing the number of states participating in a treaty due to the \ndissolution of an original party does not itself constitute a \nsubstantive modification of obligations assumed. This is the view of \nthe administration's lawyers. This is also the view of the nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service in a legal review they conducted last \nyear.\n  As for their methods, I think it is both unfortunate and short-\nsighted to use a treaty that is in our national security interests as a \nvehicle for advancing a totally unrelated political agenda. The \nprincipal sponsors of this condition have previously made no secret of \nthe fact that they would like to see the United States walk away from \nthe entire ABM treaty and immediately begin spending tens of billions \nof dollars to build a star wars type missile defense. With this act, \nthey have now revealed the lengths they are willing to go to force \ntheir views on this Senate and this administration.\n  Nevertheless, that is what has been done. Senators are now faced with \na difficult choice: vote for this treaty in spite of the unacceptable \nABM condition or against it because of the ABM language. This is an \nextremely close call for many of us.\n  In the end, Madam President, we must support this treaty. We must do \nso for two reasons. First, the treaty is still fundamentally in our \nstrategic interest. Failure to pass this treaty now could unravel both \nthe CFE agreement as well as any future efforts to enhance security \narrangements in Europe. Second, the administration, which must \nultimately decide how to deal with the objectionable ABM condition, has \nindicated that we should vote for this treaty now and let them work out \nwhat to do about this provision later. It is for these reasons that I \ncast my vote in support of this treaty and urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, depending on the disposition of the \nchairman of the committee, I am prepared to yield back whatever time we \nhave left and am ready to vote. The distinguished minority leader does \nnot wish to speak on this at this moment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT.

CONDITIONS.\n\n       The Senate's advice and consent to the ratification of the \n     CFE Flank Document is subject to the following conditions, \n     which shall be binding upon the President:\n       (1) Policy of the united states.--Nothing in the CFE Flank \n     Document shall be construed as altering the policy of the \n     United States to achieve the immediate and complete \n     withdrawal of any armed forces and military equipment under \n     the control of the Russian Federation that are deployed on \n     the territories of the independent states of the former \n     Soviet Union (as defined in section 3 of the FREEDOM Support \n     Act) without the full and complete agreement of those states.\n       (2) Violations of state sovereignty.--\n       (A) Finding.--The Senate finds that armed forces and \n     military equipment under the control of the Russian \n     Federation are currently deployed on the territories of \n     States Parties without the full and complete agreement of \n     those States Parties.\n       (B) Initiation of discussions.--The Secretary of State \n     should, as a priority matter, initiate discussions with the \n     relevant States Parties with the objective of securing the \n     immediate withdrawal of all armed forces and military \n     equipment under the control of the Russian Federation \n     deployed on the territory of any State Party without the full \n     and complete agreement of that State Party.\n       (C) Statement of policy.--Prior to the deposit of the \n     United States instrument of ratification, the President shall \n     certify to the Senate that the United States and the \n     governments of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, \n     Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, \n     Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom have issued a \n     joint statement affirming that--\n       (i) the CFE Flank Document does not give any State Party \n     the right to station (under Article IV, paragraph 5 of the \n     Treaty) or temporarily deploy (under Article V, paragraphs 1 \n     (B) and C) of the Treaty) conventional armaments and \n     equipment limited by the Treaty or the territory of other \n     States Parties to the Treaty without the freely expressed \n     consent of the receiving State Party;\n       (ii) the CFE Flank Document does not alter or abridge the \n     right of any State Party under the Treaty to utilize fully \n     its declared maximum levels for conventional armaments and \n     equipment limited by the Treaty notified pursuant to Article \n     VII of the Treaty; and\n       (iii)the CFE Flank Document does not alter in any way the \n     requirement for the freely expressed consent of all States \n     Parties concerned in the exercise of any reallocations \n     envisioned under Article IV, paragraph 3 of the CFE Flank \n     Document.\n       (3) Facilitation of negotiations.--\n       (A) United States Action.--\n       (i) In general.--The United States, in entering into any \n     negotiation described in clause (ii) involving the government \n     of Moldova, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, or Georgia, including the \n     support of United States intermediaries in the negotiation, \n     will limit its diplomatic activities to--\n       (I) achieving the equal and unreserved application by all \n     States Parties of the principles of the Helsinki Final Act, \n     including, in particular, the principle that ``States will \n     respect each other's sovereign equality and individuality as \n     well as all the rights inherent in and concompassed by its \n     sovereignty, including a particular, the right of every State \n     to juridical equality, to territorial integrity, and to \n     freedom and political independence.'';\n       (II) ensuring that Moldova, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and \n     Georgia retain the right under the Treaty to reject, or \n     accept conditionally, any request by another State Party to \n     temporarily deploy conventional armaments and equipment \n     limited by the Treaty on its territory; and\n       (III) ensuring the right of Moldova, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, \n     and Georgia to reject, or to accept conditionally, any \n     request by another State Party to reallocate the current \n     quotas of Moldova, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, as the \n     case may be, applicable to conventional armaments and \n     equipment limited by the Treaty and as established under the \n     Tashkent Agreement.\n       (ii) Negotiations covered.--A negotiation described in this \n     clause is any negotiation conducted pursuant to paragraph (2) \n     or (3) of Section IV of the CFE Flank Document or pursuant to \n     any side statement or agreement related to the CFE Flank \n     Document concluded between the United States and the Russian \n     Federation.\n       (B) Other agreements.--Nothing in the CFR Flank Document \n     shall be construed as providing additional rights to any \n     State Party to temporarily deploy forces or to reallocate \n     quotas for conventional armaments and equipment limited by \n     the Treaty beyond the rights accorded to all States Parties \n     under the original Treaty and as established under the \n     Tashkent Agreement.\n       (4) Noncompliance.--\n       (A) In general.--If the President determines that \n     persuasive information exists that a State Party is in \n     violation of the Treaty or the CFE Flank Document in a manner \n     which threatens the national security interests of the United \n     States, then the President shall--\n       (i) consult with the Senate and promptly submit to the \n     Senate a report detailing the effect of such actions;\n       (ii) seek on an urgent basis an inspection of the relevant \n     State Party in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty \n     or the CFE Flank Document with the objective of demonstrating \n     to the international community the act of noncompliance;\n       (iii) seek, or encourage, on an urgent basis, a meeting at \n     the highest diplomatic level with the relevant State Party \n     with the objective of bringing the noncompliant State Party \n     into compliance;\n       (iv) implement prohibitions and sanctions against the \n     relevant State Party as required by law;\n       (v) if noncompliance has been determined, seek on an urgent \n     basis the multilateral imposition of sanctions against the \n     noncompliant State Party for the purposes of bringing the \n     noncompliant State Party into compliance; and\n       (vi) in the event that noncompliance persists for a period \n     longer than one year after the date of the determination made \n     pursuant to this subparagraph, promptly consult with the \n     Senate for the purposes of obtaining a resolution of support \n     for continued adherence to the Treaty, notwithstanding the \n     changed circumstances affecting the object and purpose of the \n     Treaty.\n       (B) Authority of director of central intelligence.--Nothing \n     in this section may be construed to impair or otherwise \n     affect the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence \n     to protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized \n     disclosure pursuant to section 103(c)(5) of the National \n     Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 403-3(c)(5)).\n       (C) Presidential determinations.--If the President \n     determines that an action otherwise required under \n     subparagraph (A) would impair or otherwise affect the \n     authority of the Director of Central Intelligence to protect \n     intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized \n     disclosure, the President shall report that determination, \n     together with a detailed written explanation of the basis for \n     that determination, to the chairmen of the Select Committee \n     on Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives not \n     later than 15 days after making such determination.\n       (5) Monitoring and verification of compliance.--\n       (A) Declaration.--The Senate declares that--\n       (i) the Treaty is in the interests of the United States \n     only if all parties to the Treaty are in strict compliance \n     with the terms of the Treaty as submitted to the Senate for \n     its advice and consent to ratification, such compliance being \n     measured by performance and not by efforts, intentions, or \n     commitments to comply; and\n       (ii) the Senate expects all parties to the Treaty, \n     including the Russian Federation, to be in strict compliance \n     with their obligations under the terms of the Treaty, as \n     submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent to \n     ratification.\n       (B) Briefings on Compliance.--Given its concern about \n     ongoing violations of the Treaty by the Russian Federation \n     and other States Parties, the Senate expects the executive \n     branch of Government to offer briefings not less than four \n     times a year to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives on \n     compliance issues related to the Treaty.

and\n       (iii) any determination by the President that a State Party \n     is in noncompliance with or is otherwise acting in a manner \n     inconsistent with the object or purpose of the Treaty, within \n     30 days of such a determination.\n       (C) Annual reports on compliance.--Beginning January 1, \n     1998, and annually thereafter, the President shall submit to \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives a full and complete \n     classified and unclassified report setting forth--\n       (i) certification of those States Parties that are \n     determined to be in compliance with the Treaty, on a country-\n     by-country basis;\n       (ii) for those countries not certified pursuant to clause \n     (i), an identification and assessment of all compliance \n     issues arising with regard to the adherence of the country to \n     its obligations under the Treaty;\n       (iii) for those countries not certified pursuant to clause \n     (i), the steps the United States has taken, either \n     unilaterally or in conjunction with another State Party--\n       (I) to initiate inspections of the noncompliant State Party \n     with the objective of demonstrating to the international \n     community the act of noncompliance;\n\n[[Page S4477]]\n\n       (II) to call attention publicly to the activity in \n     question;

\n     or\n       (ii) to justify military deployments without the full and \n     complete agreement of the State Party upon whose territory \n     the armed forces or military equipment of another State Party \n     are to be deployed.\n       (12) Military acts of intimidation.--It is the policy of \n     the United States to treat with the utmost seriousness all \n     acts of intimidation carried out against any State Party by \n     any other State Party using any conventional armament or \n     equipment limited by the Treaty.\n       (13) Supplementary inspections.--The Senate understands \n     that additional supplementary declared site inspections may \n     be conducted in the Russian Federation in accordance with \n     Section V of the CFE Flank Document at any object of \n     verification under paragraph 3(A) or paragraph 3(B) of \n     Section V of the CFE Flank Document, without regard to \n     whether a declared site passive quota inspection pursuant to \n     paragraph 10(D) of Section II of the Protocol on Inspection \n     has been specifically conducted at such object of \n     verification in the course of the same year.\n       (14) Designated permanent storage sites.--\n       (A) Finding.--The Senate finds that removal of the \n     constraints of the Treaty on designated permanent storage \n     sites pursuant to paragraph 1 of Section IV of the CFE Flank \n     Document could introduce into active military units within \n     the Treaty's area of application as many as 7,000 additional \n     battle tanks, 3,400 armored combat vehicles, and 6,000 pieces \n     of artillery, which would constitute a significant change in \n     the conventional capabilities of States Parties within the \n     Treaty's area of application.\n       (B) Specific report.--Prior to the agreement or acceptance \n     by the United States of any proposal to alter the constraints \n     of the Treaty on designated permanent storage sites, but not \n     later than January 1, 1998, the President shall submit to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives a full and complete \n     classified and unclassified report setting forth--\n       (i) a detailed explanation of how additional Treaty-limited \n     equipment will be allocated among States Parties;\n       (ii) a detailed assessment of the location and uses to \n     which the Russian Federation will put additional Treaty-\n     limited equipment; and\n       (iii) a detailed and comprehensive justification of the \n     means by which introduction of additional battle tanks, \n     armored combat vehicles, and pieces of artillery into the \n     Treaty's area of application furthers United States national \n     security interests.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, on May 14 the Senate approved vitally \nimportant legislation to provide sorely needed aid to victims of the \nrecent weather-related disasters throughout the country, including \nSouth Dakota. It is critical that this legislation be enacted as soon \nas possible so that residents of disaster-stricken States can get on \nwith the process of recovering from the loss of property and livestock.\n  I am concerned that controversial riders on this bill, including the \nautomatic continuing resolution and the provision related to the \nimplementation of R.S. 2477 by the Interior Department, could, if \nincluded in the final conference report, make enactment of the bill \nimpossible and thus delay needed aid to disaster victims.\n  The controversial Interior provision, over which Secretary Babbitt \nhas said he will recommend a veto, blocks recent efforts by the \nadministration to close a loophole in the mining laws that allow roads \nto be constructed in national parks and other sensitive Federal lands. \nMany Senators have gone on record that the administration should have \nthe ability to protect our public lands from unnecessary and \nenvironmentally destructive road construction, and an amendment offered \nby Senator Bumpers to strip the R.S. 2477 provision from the \nsupplemental lost by a vote of only 49-51, drawing considerable \nbipartisan support. I urge the conferees to drop this and other \ncontroversial provisions from the bill during the House-Senate \nconference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/14/senate-section/article/S4478-4", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S4479]]\n\n\n\n              INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to commend my colleagues, \nSenators Jeffords, Frist, Harkin, and Kennedy, and all the others that \nworked so long and hard to develop this bipartisan legislation. This is \na carefully crafted compromise to balance the rights and concerns of \nschool administrators and teachers as well as students and parents.\n  Because of attending a family memorial service in New York City, I \ncould not be here for the final votes. Had I been in Washington, I \nwould have supported the leadership and voted for final passage of the \nreauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, \nIDEA.\n  Our country should be proud of our efforts to provide education and \nopportunities to individuals with disabilities. Thanks to the IDEA, we \nopened schools to disabled children over 20 years ago and everyone in \nour society benefits from such inclusion and education.\n  In forging this legislation, leaders had to deal with difficult \nissues, including discipline problems sometimes involving weapons or \ndrugs. Groups worked long and hard to develop an approach that would \nensure that our schools are safe but that a disabled student's rights \nand education are are also protected. Classroom teachers will now be \nincluded in the planning and process which is a major change and \nimportant improvement.\n  Federal funding and leadership on IDEA is crucial, but this program \nis a partnership with States and local schools. West Virginia, like \nother States, assumes the lion share of education funding but Federal \nfunding provides incentives and leadership. As always with a \ncomprehensive reauthorization package, there are some lingering issues \nand questions. On balance, this legislation is a tremendous achievement \nthat continues our Federal commitment to help disabled students in West \nVirginia and every State in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/14/senate-section/article/S4479-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          U.S. FOREIGN OIL CONSUMPTION FOR WEEK ENDING MAY 9TH\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending May 9, the United States imported 7,566,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 1,057,000 barrels less than the 8,623,000 \nimported during the same week a year ago.\n  While this is one of the few weeks that Americans imported less oil \nthan the same week a year ago, Americans still relied on foreign oil \nfor 53.9 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that \nthe upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United \nStates obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign \ncountries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil \naccounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by \nU.S. producers using American workers?

A bill to reform the statutes relating to Amtrak, to \nauthorize appropriations for Amtrak, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n              AMTRAK REFORM AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think it is very important in this \ncountry that we have a national rail passenger system. Rail is a viable \nalternative transportation. We now have a bus system that is feeding \ninto Amtrak stations so people can come from small communities on the \nbus, into the Amtrak station, and go anywhere in the country as long as \nwe keep our national system. You can go from Marshall, TX, to Chicago, \nIL, or to San Antonio and then to Los Angeles or all the way to \nFlorida. It is really an exciting opportunity.\n  However, Mr. President, the national rail passenger service that we \nhave now is really just an experiment. It really does not work very \nwell, through no fault of the people who run it. Tom Downs is actually \ndoing a terrific job. But we in Congress have put so many constraints \nand mandates on him that he cannot possibly compete to survive.\n  So, in fact, it is time to get the railroad back on track. It is time \nto get\n\n[[Page S4480]]\n\nthis railroad right. We can do it if Congress will correct some of the \nproblems that we have put on this rail passenger train and let them \ncompete. We have told them, ``Run a good railroad,'' but we have tied \none arm behind their back. So now it is time to let them compete, with \nthe help of the bill I am introducing, most of which passed out of the \nCommerce Committee last year.\n  I am chairman of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee. It is in my \npurview to reauthorize Amtrak, and I want to reauthorize it and reform \nit so that it can compete and, hopefully, by the year 2002, there will \nnot have to be operational subsidies from the taxpayers of America. But \nthere is no question this will fail unless we have these reforms that \nwill allow Amtrak to operate more like a business.\n  So, what are we trying to do? We are trying to have a system that is \nup and going without operational subsidies by the year 2002. Many of my \nfriends say, ``I do not know why we should help Amtrak. Why should we \nhave taxpayer subsidies of Amtrak when all the other transportation \nmodes do not need taxpayer subsidies?'' Every transportation mode has \ntaxpayer subsidies. Part of the reason we have mobility in our country \nis because we subsidize highways, we subsidize airports, we now also \nsubsidize trains, and it does provide mobility.\n  I want to try to get Amtrak back on track, get it to run right, and \nsee if we can have a passenger rail system that is dependable, that \nprovides good service and viable transportation options to all the \npeople of our country, whether they are elderly and do not want to \ndrive, whether they just cannot drive, whether they do not like to fly, \nwhether they live in a small community that does not have any kind of \npassenger service. We want people to have this mobility.\n  How are we going to do it? The Amtrak reform bill, first, will repeal \ntwo laws that have been very expensive. One is the 6-year termination \nprovisions for anyone who is employed at Amtrak, if a line is shut \ndown. Now, I am sure there are a lot of people in America that would \nlike to have a 6-year termination agreement that says if you lose your \njob, you get 6 years full pay. That would be nice, but it is not \nrealistic, and it certainly does not meet today's standards. Even many \nAmtrak employees tell me that they realize this is out of line. It is a \ncongressional mandate that they have a 6-year termination agreement, \nbut they know that Amtrak cannot compete with that kind of agreement in \nplace. It is just much too expensive. They would rather keep their \njobs. They love what they are doing. They want to keep their jobs \nrather than have a 6-year termination agreement.\n  So we want to require Amtrak to have free and open bargaining with \nits unions in the absence of a Government mandate of a 6-year \ntermination agreement. In fact, it would be free and open like every \nother union negotiation is in this country. That is fair, and I think \nmost Amtrak employees agree that is fair. Let them sit at the \nbargaining table with open and fair negotiations, and they will be able \nto get the best that the market can bear while still having a good job, \na viable job, and doing a service for the people of our country.\n\n  This bill will also extinguish the prohibition on contracting out. \nOne of the things that Tom Downs tells me they need is the ability to \nmake the decision if they want to contract out in order to save costs, \nbecause if we are going to tell Mr. Downs that he has to run a tight \nship, we cannot put mandates on him that are not anywhere else in any \nother competitive system in our country and expect him to do a good \njob. We have to take the shackles off.\n  We also must give him the ability to have some liability reform. He \nsays one of the most expensive things he has to deal with is liability \nand not being able to have the right of indemnification with the people \nthat own the tracks Amtrak uses. We need to have liability reform, and, \nin fact, this was passed out of the Commerce Committee last year. Like \nlast year's bill, the liability reform in my bill would have caps on \npunitive damages for two times compensatory damages or $250,000, \nwhichever is greater.\n  In fact, these kinds of liability limits, I think, are quite \nreasonable. Many States are enacting these kinds of liability limits, \nin particular for publicly assisted transportation services. It allows \na person who has been wrongly injured to have compensation for that, \nbut it puts some limitation so there will be a budget on it, so that \nthere will be some reliability about how much you have to put in the \nbudget for that kind of occurrence. It also confirms the right of \npassenger rail operators and owners of rights-of-way to contractually \nindemnify each other for liability arising out of an accident.\n  In addition to the reforms, we have accountability. We have an \nindependent audit of Amtrak that will commence as soon as the bill is \npassed and signed by the President that will provide a basis upon which \nto judge what we can do better in Amtrak.\n  Like last year's bill, we also have an Amtrak reform council that is \ndesigned to monitor Amtrak's progress and viability and to make \nindependent recommendations. We want overseers who are saying to \nAmtrak, is what you are doing what's best, and also to tell Congress \nthat if we are not going to be able to make this work, we are not going \nto keep throwing money at Amtrak if it does not have a chance to \nsurvive.\n  So we have told this independent council if you make a determination \nthat Amtrak just cannot make it, even with the reforms that we are \ngiving them, then tell us. We will pull the plug and we will say it was \na great effort but it just did not work.\n  Mr. President, what we are trying to do is give Amtrak a chance. We \nare trying to get it right. It is time to get this railroad right. In \nfact, it is time to get it back on track. We have had 26 years of \nexperiments. We have not gotten it right yet. Most of that is at the \nfeet of Congress. We have to give them a chance to compete if, in fact, \nwe are going to have by the year 2002 a national rail passenger train \nopportunity--real mobility for people that live in small towns, people \nwho are elderly, people who do not want to fly, and who can't fly or \nsimply want more transportation options. We want mobility in our \ncountry. And we have made huge investments in infrastructure in our \ncountry in highways and airports. I think rail is a component part of \nthat system.\n\n  We want a passenger rail opportunity in this country. But we don't \nwant taxpayers subsidizing the operations of trains for the passengers \nwho do not choose to use this route.\n  So we believe that this is the fairest way--reauthorize, reform, tell \nthem to get their act together, and give them the tools to do it. That \nis the mandate of this bill.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank you and ask unanimous consent that this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 738\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide a 1-year delay in the imposition of \npenalties on small businesses failing to make electronic fund transfers \nof business taxes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n the electronic funds transfer tax payments by small businesses act of \n                                  1997\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould waive for 1 year penalties on small businesses that fail to pay \ntheir taxes to the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] electronically.\n  Last July, millions of small business owners received a letter from \nthe IRS announcing that, beginning January 1, 1997, business tax \npayments would have to be made via electronic funds transfer. This \nletter sent shock waves through the small business community in South \nDakota. The letter was vague and provided little information on how the \nnew deposit requirement would work.\n  In meetings, letters, and phone calls, South Dakotans posed many \nquestions to me that the IRS letter did not answer: ``How much will \nthis cost my business?''; ``Will I have to purchase new equipment to \nmake these electronic transfers?''; and ``Will the IRS be taking the \nmoney directly out of my account?''\n  As you may recall, this new requirement was adopted as part of a \npackage of revenue offsets for the North American Free-Trade Agreement. \nThe Treasury Department was directed to draw up regulations phasing in \nthe requirement, which will raise money by eliminating the float banks \naccrue on the delay between the time they receive tax deposits from \nbusinesses and the time they transfer this money to the Treasury.\n  All businesses with $47 million or more in annual payroll taxes are \nalready required to pay by electronic funds transfer. The new, lower \nthreshold is estimated to bring 1.3 million small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses into the program for the first time.\n  As a result of protests registered by many small businesses, the IRS \ndecided to delay for 6 months the 10-percent penalty on firms failing \nto begin making deposits electronically by January 1, 1997. Not \nsatisfied with this step, Congress recently passed an outright 6-month \ndelay in the electronic filing requirement as part of the Small \nBusiness Job Protection Act of 1996.\n  I strongly supported this amendment. However, I believe that these \n1.3 million businesses should be given further time to comply without \nthe threat of financial penalties. Electronic funds transfer may well \nprove to be the most efficient system of payment for all concerned, \nincluding small businesses. Once they learn the advantages of the new \nsystem, these firms may well come to prefer it to the existing one, \nwhich requires a special kind of coupon and a lot of paperwork. But \nthis is a new procedure, and many small employers are not sure what it \nwill entail. A recent hearing in the House of Representatives \ndocumented a series of uncertainties and potential problems \naccompanying an extension of the electronic funds transfer mandate to \nsmaller firms.\n  The bill I am introducing today would suspend penalties for \nnoncompliance for 1 year, until July 1, 1998. I believe this step is \nnecessary to provide time for small businesses to be properly educated \nabout the easiest, least burdensome, and most cost-efficient way to \ncomply. In my view, whenever possible, the IRS should avoid taking an \nadversarial approach toward the small business community or, for that \nmatter, any taxpayer. At every opportunity, the IRS should seek to help \ntaxpayers comply with their obligations. I believe that, by removing \nthe threat of penalties for a short while longer, my bill will help the \nIRS fulfill this important part of its mission.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 740\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. WAIVER OF PENALTY ON SMALL BUSINESSES FAILING TO \n                   MAKE ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFERS OF TAXES.\n\n       No penalty shall be imposed under the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 solely by reason of a failure by a person to use the \n     electronic fund transfer system established under section \n     6302(h) of such Code if--\n       (1) such person is a member of a class of taxpayers first \n     required to use such system on or after July 1, 1997, and\n       (2) such failure occurs during the 1-year period beginning \n     on July 1, 1997.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX:\n  S. 741. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to enable the \nFederal Communications Commission to enhance its spectrum management \nprogram capabilities through the collection of lease fees for new \nspectrum for radio services that are statutorily excluded from \ncompetitive bidding, and to enhance law enforcement and public safety \nradio communications; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n             THE PRIVATE WIRELESS SPECTRUM AVAILABILITY ACT\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I introduce the Private Wireless \nSpectrum Availability Act of 1997. This legislation will help the more \nthan 300,000 U.S. companies, both large and small, that have invested \n$25 billion in internally owned and operated wireless communications \nsystems. It will provide these companies with critically needed \nspectrum and will do so through an equitable lease fee system.\n  The private wireless communications community includes industrial, \nland transportation, business, educational, and philanthropic \norganizations that own and operate communications systems for their \ninternal use. The top 10 U.S. industrial companies have more than 6,000 \nprivate wireless licenses. Private wireless systems also serve \nAmerica's small businesses in the utility, contracting, taxi, and \nlivery industries.\n  These internal-use communications facilities greatly enhance public \nsafety and the quality of American life. They also support global \ncompetitiveness for American firms. For example, private wireless \nsystems support: the efficient production of goods and services; the \nsafe transportation of passengers and products by land and air; the \nexploration, production, and distribution of energy; agricultural \nenhancement and production; the maintenance and development of \nAmerica's infrastructure;\n\n[[Page S4486]]\n\nand compliance with various local, State, and Federal operational \ngovernment statutes.\n  Current regulatory policy inadequately recognizes the public interest \nbenefits that private wireless licensees provide to the American \npublic. Consequently, allocations of spectrum to these private wireless \nusers has been deficient. Private wireless entities received spectrum \nin 1974 and 1986 when the FCC allocated channels in the 800 megahertz \nand 900 megahertz bands. Over time, however, the FCC has significantly \nreduced the number of channels available to industrial and business \nentities in those allocations. Private wireless entities now have \naccess to only 299 channels, or 32 percent of the channels of the \noriginal allocation.\n  Spectrum auctions have done a great job of speeding up the licensing \nof interpersonal communications services and have generated significant \nrevenues for the U.S. Treasury. They have also unfortunately skewed the \nspectrum allocation process toward subscriber-based services and away \nfrom critical radio services such as private wireless which are \nexempted from auctions. Nearly 200 megahertz of spectrum has been \nallocated for the provision of commercial telecommunications services, \nvirtually all of which has been assigned by the FCC through competitive \nbidding.\n\n  Competitive bidding is not the proper assignment methodology for \nprivate wireless telecommunications users. Private wireless operations \nare site-specific systems which vary in size based on that user's \nparticular needs, and are seldom mutually exclusive from other private \nwireless applicants. Auctions, which depend on mutually exclusive \napplications and use market areas based on population, simply cannot be \ndesigned for private wireless systems.\n  This legislation mandates that the FCC allocate no less than 12 \nmegahertz of new spectrum for private wireless use as a measure to \nmaintain our industrial and business competitiveness in the global \narena, as well as to protect the welfare of the employees in the \nAmerican workplace. Research indicates that private wireless companies \nare willing to pay a reasonable fee in return for use of spectrum. They \nrecognize that their access to spectrum increases with their \nwillingness to pay fair value for the use of this national asset.\n  My bill grants the FCC legislative authority to charge efficiency-\nbased spectrum lease fees in this new spectrum allocation. These lease \nfees should encourage the efficient use of spectrum by the private \nwireless industry, generate recurring annual revenues as compensation \nfor the use of spectrum, and retain spectrum ownership by the public. \nFurthermore, the fees should be easy for private frequency advisory \ncommittees to calculate and collect.\n  Mr. President, I am mindful that some peripheral concerns expressed \nby small businesses that service private wireless users are not \naddressed in this bill. I assure these companies that I will work with \nthem through the legislative process to address these issues. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this bill and ask unanimous consent \nthat the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 741\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Private Wireless Spectrum \n     Availability Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act--\n       (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Federal \n     Communications Commission.\n       (2) Public safety.--The term ``public safety'' means fire, \n     police, or emergency medical service including critical care \n     medical telemetry, and such other services related to public \n     safety as the Commission may include within the definition of \n     public safety for purposes of this Act.\n       (3) Private wireless.--The term ``private wireless'' \n     encompasses all land mobile telecommunications systems \n     operated by or through industrial, business, transportation, \n     educational, philanthropic or ecclesiastical organizations \n     where these systems, the operation of which may be shared, \n     are for the licensees' internal use, rather than subscriber-\n     based Commercial Mobile Radio Services (CMRS) systems.\n       (4) Spectrum lease fee.--The term ``spectrum lease fee'' \n     means a periodic payment for the use of a given amount of \n     electromagnetic spectrum in a given area in consideration of \n     which the user is granted a license for such use.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that:\n       (1) Private wireless communications systems enhance the \n     competitiveness of American industry and business in \n     international commerce, promote the development of national \n     infrastructure, improve the delivery of products and services \n     to consumers in the United States and abroad, and contribute \n     to the economic and social welfare of citizens of the United \n     States.\n       (2) The highly specialized telecommunications requirements \n     of licensees in the private wireless services would be \n     served, and a more favorable climate would be created for the \n     allocation of additional electromagnetic spectrum for those \n     services if an alternative license administration \n     methodology, in addition to the existing competitive bidding \n     process, were made available to the Commission.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, nowhere is the middle ground in American \npolitics harder to find than in the debate over abortion. It is clear \nthat the apparent inability of pro-choice and pro-life members to find \ncommon ground is one of the most divisive issues we face today. In \ndebate after debate, it often appears that there is no middle ground. \nWell, I am extremely pleased that my colleague from Nevada, Senator \nReid, is joining me today to introduce legislation that will prove this \nstatement untrue.\n  Too often, pro-choice leaders do too little to convey that they are \nnot pro-abortion. Likewise, abortion opponents too often fail to work \nconstructively toward reducing the need for abortion. The failure of \npro-choice and pro-life members to stake out common ground weakens our \nNation immeasurably.\n  Today that's going to change. The cosponsors of this bill come from \ndifferent parties, and have very different views on abortion. Our \nvoting records are clear: I am firmly pro-choice; Senators Reid is \nfirmly pro-life. Yet, despite these fundamental differences, we agree \nthat something can and must be done to reduce the rates of unintended \npregnancy and abortion in this country. That is why we are joining \nforces and introducing bipartisan, landmark legislation to make \ncontraceptives more affordable for Americans. And I am pleased that a \nnumber of my colleagues, including Senators Warner, Mikulski, Chafee, \nDurbin, Collins, Murray, and Jeffords are joining us as original \ncosponsors.\n  The need is clear. This year, there will be 3.6 million unintended \npregnancies--over 56 percent of all pregnancies in America--and half \nwill end in abortion. These are staggering statistics. But what's even \nmore staggering is that it doesn't have to be this way. If prescription \ncontraceptives were covered like other prescription drugs, a lot more \nAmericans could afford to use safe, effective means to prevent \nunintended pregnancies.\n  The fact is, under many of today's health insurance plans, a woman \ncan afford a prescription to alleviate allergy symptoms but not a \nprescription to prevent an unintended and life-altering pregnancy. It \nis simply not right that while the vast majority of insurers cover \nprescription drugs, half of large group plans exclude coverage of \nprescription contraceptives. And only one-third cover oral \ncontraceptives--the most popular form of birth control.\n  Is it any wonder that women spend 68 percent more than men in out-of-\npocket health care costs--68 percent. It does not make sense that, at a \ntime when we want to reduce unintended pregnancies, so many otherwise \ninsured woman can't afford access to the most effective contraceptives \nbecause of the disparity in coverage.\n  The lack of contraceptive coverage in health insurance is not news to \nmost women. Countless American women have been shocked to learn that \ntheir insurance does not cover contraceptives, one of their most basic \nhealth care needs, even though other prescriptions drugs which are \nequally valuable to their lives are routinely covered. But until today, \nwomen could do little more than feel silent outrage at a practice that \ndisadvantages both their health and their pocketbook.\n  Now, the Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage \nAct gives voice to that outrage. EPICC sends a message that we can no \nlonger tolerate policies that disadvantage women and disadvantage our \nnation. When our bill is passed, women will finally be assured of \nequity in prescription drug coverage and health care services. And \nAmerica's unacceptably high rates of unintended pregnancies and \nabortions will be reduced in the process.\n  This EPICC approach is simple. It says that if insurers already cover \nprescription drugs and devices, they must also cover FDA-approved \nprescription contraceptives. And it takes the commonsense approach of \nrequiring health plans which already cover basic health care services \nto also cover medical and counseling services to promote the effective \nuse of those contraceptives. The bill does not require insurance \ncompanies to cover prescription drugs--it simply says that if insurers \ncover prescription drugs, they cannot treat prescription contraceptives \nany differently. Similarly, it says that insurers which cover \noutpatient health care services cannot limit or exclude coverage of the \nmedical and counseling services necessary for effective contraceptive \nuse in order to prevent unintended pregnancies.\n  This bill is not only good policy, it also makes good economic sense. \nWe know that contraceptives are cost-effective: in the public sector, \nfor every\n\n[[Page S4488]]\n\ndollar invested in family planning, $4 to $14 is saved in health care \nand related costs. And we also know that by helping families to \nadequately space their pregnancies, contraceptives contribute to \nhealthy pregnancies and healthy births, reducing rates of maternal \ncomplications, and low-birth weight.\n  Time and time again Americans have expressed the desire for their \nleaders to come together to work on the problems that face us. This \nbill exemplifies that spirit of cooperation. It crosses some very wide \ngulfs and makes some very meaningful changes in policy that will \nbenefit countless Americans.\n  As someone who is pro-choice, I firmly believe that abortions should \nbe safe, legal, and rare. Through this bill, I invite both my pro-\nchoice and pro-life colleagues to join with me in emphasizing the rare. \nAnd I invite all who believe in sound public policy to join our \nalliance. Because we as a nation must be truly committed to reducing \nrates of unintended pregnancy and abortion. We must come together \ndespite our differences. We must pass this EPICC bill into law.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today, with Senator \nSnowe, the Equity in Prescription and Contraception Coverage Act of \n1997. I have said time and time again that if men suffered from the \nsame illnesses as women, the biomedical research community would be \nmuch closer to eliminating diseases that strike women. I believe this \nis a similar type of issue. If men had to pay for contraceptive drugs \nand devices, the insurance industry would cover them.\n  The health industry has done a poor job of responding to women's \nhealth needs. Women spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket costs for \nhealth care than men. Reproductive health care services account for \nmuch of this difference. According to a study done by the Alan \nGuttmacher Institute, 49 percent of all large-group health care plans \ndo not routinely cover any contraceptive method at all, and only 15 \npercent cover all five of the most common contraceptive methods. Women \nare forced to use disposable income to pay for family planning services \nnot covered by their health insurance--the pill--one of the most common \nbirth control methods, can cost cover $300 a year. Therefore, women who \nlack disposable income are forced to use less reliable methods of \ncontraception and risk an unintended pregnancy.\n  The legislation we introduce today would require insurers, HMO's, and \nemployee health benefit plans that offer prescription drug benefits to \ncover contraceptive drugs and devices approved by the FDA. Further, it \nwould require these insurers to cover outpatient contraceptive services \nif a plan covers other outpatient services. Lastly, it would prohibit \nthe imposition of copays and deductibles for prescription \ncontraceptives or outpatient services that are greater than those for \nother prescription drugs.\n  Each year approximately 3,600,000 pregnancies, or 60 percent of all \npregnancies, in this country are unintended. Of these unintended \npregnancies, 44 percent end in abortion. Reliable family planning \nmethods must be made available if we wish to reduce this disturbing \nnumber. Further, a reduction in unintended pregnancies will also lead \nto a reduction in infant mortality, low-birth weight, and maternal \nmorbidity. In fact, the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality \ndetermined that ``infant mortality could be reduced by 10 percent if \nall women not desiring pregnancy used contraception.''\n  Ironically, abortion is routinely covered by 66 percent of indemnity \nplans, 67 percent of preferred provider organizations, and 70 percent \nof HMO's. Sterilization and tubal ligation are also routinely covered. \nIt does not make sense financially for insurance companies to cover \nthese more expensive services, rather than contraception. Studies \nindicate that for every dollar of public funds invested in family \nplanning, $4 to $14 of public funds is saved in pregnancy and health \ncare-related costs. According to one recent study in the American \nJournal of Public Health, by increasing the number of women who use \noral contraceptives by 15 percent, health plans would accrue enough \nsavings in pregnancy care costs to cover oral contraceptives for all \nusers under the plan.\n  It is vitally important to the health of our country that quality \ncontraception is not beyond the financial reach of women. Providing \naccess to contraception will bring down the unintended pregnancy rate, \ninsure good reproductive health for women, and reduce the number of \nabortions.\n  It is a significant step, in my opinion, to have support from both \npro-life and pro-choice Senators for this bill. Prevention is the \ncommon ground on which we can all stand. Let's begin to attack the \nproblem of unintended pregnancies at its root.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 744. A bill to authorize the construction of the Fall River Water \nUsers District Rural Water System and authorize financial assistance to \nthe Fall River Water Users District, a nonprofit corporation, in the \nplanning and construction of the water supply system, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n   THE FALL RIVER WATER USERS DISTRICT RURAL WATER SYSTEM ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce \nlegislation to authorize a critically important rural water system in \nSouth Dakota, the Fall River Water Users District Rural Water System \nAct of 1997. This legislation is strongly supported by local project \nsponsors who have demonstrated that support by agreeing to substantial \nfinancial contributions from the local level. I am pleased to introduce \nthis legislation today, along with my colleague from South Dakota, \nSenate Minority Leader Tom Daschle. Both Senator Daschle and I were \nsponsors of similar legislation in the 104th Congress, and we will work \ntogether to enact this necessary rural water legislation in the 105th \nCongress.\n  Like many parts of South Dakota, Fall River County has insufficient \nwater supplies of reasonable quality available, and the water supplies \nthat are available do not meet the minimum health and safety standards. \nIn addition to improving the health of residents in the region, I \nstrongly believe that these rural drinking water delivery projects will \nhelp to stabilize the rural economy in both regions. Water is a basic \ncommodity and is essential if we are to foster rural development in \nmany parts of rural South Dakota, including the Fall River County area.\n  Past cycles of severe drought in the southeastern area of Fall River \nCounty have left local residents without a satisfactory water supply \nand during 1990, many homeowners and ranchers were forced to haul water \nto sustain their water needs.\n  Currently, many residents are either using bottled water for human \nconsumption or they are using distillers due to the poor quality of the \nwater supplies available. After conducting a feasibility study and \npreliminary engineering report, the best available, reliable, and safe \nrural and municipal water supply to serve the needs of the Fall River \nWater Users District consists of a Madison Aquifer well, three separate \nwater storage reservoirs, three pumping stations, and approximately 200 \nmiles of pipeline. The legislation I am introducing today authorizes \nthe Bureau of Reclamation to construct a rural water system in Fall \nRiver County as described above. The Fall River system will serve rural \nresidents, as well as the community of Oelrichs and the Angostura State \nRecreation Area.\n  Mr. President, South Dakota is plagued by water of exceedingly poor \nquality, and the Fall River County rural water project is an effort to \nhelp provide clean water--a commodity most of us take for granted--to \nthe people of South Dakota. I am a strong believer in the role of the \nFederal Government to help in the delivery of rural water, and I hope \nto continue to advance that agenda both in South Dakota and around the \ncountry. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee to move forward on enactment as quickly as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4489]]\n\n                                 S. 744\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (J) existing federal and state legislation does not \n     expressly authorize battered women to take leave from work to \n     seek legal assistance and redress, counseling, or assistance \n     with safety planning and activities.\n       (2) Purposes.--Pursuant to the affirmative power of \n     congress to enact this section under section 5 of the \n     Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, as well as under \n     clause 1 of section 8 of article I of the Constitution and \n     clause 3 of section 8 of article I of the Constitution, the \n     purposes of this section are--\n       (A) to promote the national interest in reducing domestic \n     violence by enabling victims of domestic violence to maintain \n     the financial independence necessary to leave abusive \n     situations, to achieve safety and minimize the physical and \n     emotional injuries from domestic violence, and to reduce the \n     devastating economic consequences of domestic violence to \n     employers and employees, by entitling employed victims of \n     domestic violence to take reasonable leave under the Family \n     and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) to \n     seek medical help, legal assistance, counseling, and safety \n     planning and assistance without penalty from their employer;\n       (B) to promote the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment by \n     protecting the civil and economic rights of victims of \n     domestic violence and by furthering the equal opportunity of \n     women to employment and economic self-sufficiency;\n       (C) to minimize the negative impact on interstate commerce \n     from dislocations of employees and harmful effects on \n     productivity, health care costs, and employer costs from \n     domestic violence; and\n       (D) to accomplish the purposes described in subparagraphs \n     (A) , (B) and (C) in a manner that accommodates the \n     legitimate interests of employers.\n       (c) Entitlement to Leave for Domestic Violence.--\n       (1) Authority for leave.--Section 102(a)(1) (29 U.S.C. \n     2612(a)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n[[Page S4493]]\n\n       ``(A) In order to care for the child or parent of the \n     employee, if such child or parent is addressing domestic \n     violence and its effects.\n       ``(B) Because the employee is addressing domestic violence \n     and its effects, the employee is unable to perform any of the \n     functions of the position of such employee.''.\n       (2) Definition.--section 101 (29 U.S.C. 2611) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(14) Addressing domestic violence and its effects.--The \n     term `addressing domestic violence and its effects' means--\n       ``(A) experiencing domestic violence;\n       ``(B) seeking medical attention for or recovering from \n     injuries caused by domestic violence;\n       ``(C) seeking legal assistance or remedies, including \n     communicating with the police or an attorney, or \n     participating in any legal proceeding related to domestic \n     violence;\n       ``(D) attending support groups for victims of domestic \n     violence;\n       ``(E) obtaining psychological counseling related to \n     experiences of domestic violence;\n       ``(F) participating in safety planning and other actions to \n     increase safety from future domestic violence, including \n     temporary or permanent relocation;

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to those \nlaw enforcement officers who have given their lives while protecting \nthe lives of so many others. When I was the Governor, with command of \nthe Highway Patrol of the State of Missouri, the hardest part of my job \nwas, without question, dealing with the loss of a law enforcement \nofficer. Not only did these men and women faithfully serve their \ncommunities in life, they imparted the greatest sacrifice of all: they \ngave their lives.\n  In 1996, 117 law enforcement officers lost their lives in the line of \nduty, and 13,692 officers in total have been killed while protecting \ntheir communities. Every year 1 in 9 officers is attacked, 1 in 25 is \ninjured, and 1 in 4,000 is killed while trying to preserve the peace \nand safety of the United States.\n  My sincerest condolences go out to the families of these men and \nwomen who have died in the line of duty. I can only be thankful that \norganizations such as Missouri Concerns of Police Survivors [MOCOP] \nexist to help in the aftermath of such tragedy. Every year, this \nnonprofit support group honors those men and women who have laid down \ntheir lives for Missouri. According to MOCOP any local, State, or \nFederal peace officer serving Missouri as an elected, appointed, \ndeputized, temporary, or permanent officer who was killed or died of \nwounds or injuries received while performing an act to enforce the law \nand/or keep the peace from 1820 to the present is eligible to have his \nor her name inscribed on a monument in Jefferson City, MO.\n  Two men whose names will be added to the monument this year, \nDetective Willie Neal, Jr.--January 29, 1997--and Deputy Sheriff \nChristopher Lee Castetter--November 28, 1996--sacrificed their lives \nwithin the past 6 months. It saddens me to hear of these officers in \nthe prime of their lives killed needlessly as they attempted to do \ntheir jobs. I can only hope that it is of some comfort to their \nfamilies that they will forever be remembered as heroes by being etched \ninto this historic monument.\n  The other six being honored this year include: B.H. Williamson, May \n26, 1867; Horace E. Petts, August 3, 1868; Jasper Mitchell, August 3, \n1868; George C. Walters, March 3, 1873; J. Milton Phillips, September \n20, 1873; Ed Daniels, March 17, 1874; Anderson Coffman, February 14, \n1878; and Hardin Harvey Vickery, March 8, 1879.\n  As Abraham Lincoln once said, ``It is rather for us to be here \ndedicated to the great task remaining before us * * * that from these \nhonored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they \ngave their last full measure of devotion; that we were highly resolved \nthat these dead shall not have died in vain.'' It is important that we \nremember why these men and women gave their lives and that we work to \nensure that their sacrifice was not in vain. Law enforcement men and \nwomen risk their lives every day in order to protect ours. Each day we \nwalk down the street safely or get a good night's sleep without fear of \nrobbery or assault, we should thank those officers who protect us every \nday and remember the ones who lost their lives in the process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/14/senate-section/article/S4497-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4497-S4498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION'S ``RECALL ROUND-UP'' STATEMENT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend the Consumer Product Safety Commission for the kick off of its \nRecall Round-up campaign. The Recall Roundup is a national effort to \nretrieve all hazardous products that have been recalled, but may still \nbe in people's homes.\n  Each year the Commission coordinates approximately 300 recalls of \ndefective or dangerous products. The task of getting these products out \nof American homes has been a difficult one.\n  The existence of faulty products has been the cause of serious injury \nand even death to children in the United States. This is unacceptable. \nThat's why I am pleased to report that in my own State, Maryland Lt. \nGovernor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend on April 16 announced the State's \nplans to join the Commission in the Recall Roundup.\n\n[[Page S4498]]\n\n  Mr. President, as one of the Senators for Maryland, I would like to \nsubmit Lt. Governor Townsend's remarks for the Record. I commend the \nCommission and the State of Maryland on their partnership to protect \nAmerican children from hazardous products.\n  The remarks of the Lt. Governor follow:\n\n          [Consumer Product Press Conference, April 16, 1997]\n\n                      Remarks of the Lt. Governor\n\n       Good Morning. This is a very exciting day and it's great to \n     be here with you. I want to thank Chairman Ann Brown for her \n     leadership and hard work, as well as all of the men and women \n     of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n       Everyday, you make our homes and communities safer for \n     children. You are doing a tremendous job of identifying \n     hazardous products and getting them off the market and out of \n     our homes. I am grateful, not just as the Lt. Governor of \n     Maryland, but as the mother of four daughters. Thank you.\n       You know that we need to do more than just identify \n     dangerous items. Every year, scores of children die because \n     of products that the Consumer Product Safety Commission has \n     already recalled. But for one reason or another, they were \n     never replaced with safer products. These children did not \n     have to die. And if we do the job we know we must, and make \n     sure these products are taken out of homes, we can save many, \n     many lives in the future.\n       Governor Glendening and I are extremely proud that Maryland \n     and the Commission are working so closely together to make \n     this happen. The Recall Roundup is the quintessential example \n     of how federal and state governments can work together for \n     our shared goals.\n       The Commission's information about what products pose \n     threats to children is vital to parents, and we're going to \n     make sure that they get it. We will distribute a list of \n     these products to local health departments, community \n     organizations, local publications, to second-hand stores. At \n     the State's Child Care Conference, at the State Fair, and \n     training seminars for child care providers. We are going to \n     blanket the State, and in case some parents cannot get to the \n     information, we'll be coming to them.\n       Maryland's high school student volunteers will be helping \n     to perform Recall Roundup Home Inspections to point out \n     potential hazards to families. Parents have enough to worry \n     about. The world today is already dangerous for children. But \n     we can make a difference. With hard work and cooperation, we \n     can make sure that every child's home is child-safe. Thank \n     you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/14/senate-section/article/S4497-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO ``UGA V'' AMERICA'S NO. 1 MASCOT\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to UGA V, the \nmascot for the University of Georgia, who, this month, was honored by \nSports Illustrated magazine as ``America's No. 1 college mascot.'' The \nEnglish Bulldog carries almost 100 years of tradition as the mascot for \nthe university's athletic program and is one of the most recognizable \nfigures in all of college sports. The current line of bulldogs can be \ntraced back over 50 years to when the first UGA's grandfather guarded \nthe sidelines for the football team during the 1943 Rose Bowl in \nPasadena, CA. UGA V and his forefathers have helped lead the University \nof Georgia to build one of the most respected and successful athletic \nprograms in the country. The UGA line has witnessed national \nchampionships in football, baseball, and gymnastics; final fours in \nmen's and women's basketball; and countless Southeastern Conference \nchampionships in a variety of sports. UGA IV was even invited to be the \nfirst mascot to attend the presentation of the Heisman trophy to \nHershel Walker in 1982.\n  I would also like to recognize the outstanding efforts and dedication \nof the Seiler family of Savannah, GA. Since 1956, Frank (Sonny) Seiler \nand his family have raised UGA and his descendants. They have also \ntraveled across the country attending all of the University of Georgia \nfootball games. Their hard work has molded a tradition like no other in \nthis country.\n  As did the mascots before him, UGA V gives frequently of his time to \ncharitable organizations. UGA has appeared and raised money for such \ngroups as the Humane Society, March of Dimes, Easter Seals, and the \nHeart Fund. In 1984 UGA IV was named ``Honorary Chairman for the Great \nAmerican Smokeout'' campaign on behalf of the American Cancer Society. \nWhen not appearing in his official capacity as mascot, UGA has \nrepresented the State of Georgia at a number of State functions.\n  It is with great pride that I congratulate the University of Georgia \nfor all of its academic and athletic accomplishments, and UGA, \n``America's No. 1 mascot.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/14/senate-section/article/S4498-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING DR. ALLAN E. STRAND\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to honor Dr. Allan \nStrand, who is retiring after 18 years of distinguished service as \nheadmaster of Newark Academy in New Jersey.\n  During his tenure, Dr. Strand's scholarship and leadership set a \nmagnificent example for his students, including two of my own children. \nAlthough all four of my children received an outstanding education at \nNewark Academy, my two youngest had the added good fortune of attending \nwhile Dr. Strand was headmaster. He was an educator, mentor, and \nfriend.\n  Mr. President, I know that my children benefited from Dr. Strand's \nvision, integrity, energy, and academic excellence. But more than that, \nthe entire Newark Academy community benefited from his presence. His \nlist of accomplishments while headmaster is impressive.\n  During his tenure, the academy's educational mission was affirmed. \nThe traditional college preparatory course was continued, but the \nprogram was enhanced by bold developments in computer science and the \narts. Dr. Strand also worked to revitalize the board of trustees and to \nstrengthen an already superb faculty. Committed to the principles of \nrespect and integrity, he introduced the Honor Code and Honor Council. \nEven the physical plant was not neglected; it was so expanded that only \nthe front foyer remains unchanged. The McGraw Arts Center was added to \naccommodate the burgeoning arts program, and the Morris Interactive \nLearning Center brought the latest in technology to the school's \ninstructional program.\n  But through all the changes, one thing remained unchanged, Dr. \nStrand's commitment to his students and their education. It has been \nsaid that the only lasting legacy that any of us can have is to make a \ndifference in the life of a child. If that is true, than Dr. Strand's \nlegacy is definitely assured.\n  Mr. President, when Thomas Jefferson presented his credentials as \nUnited States minister to France, the French premier remarked, ``I see \nthat you have come to replace Benjamin Franklin.'' Jefferson corrected \nhim. ``No one can replace Dr. Franklin. I am only succeeding him.'' In \nmuch the same way, Allan Strand is also irreplaceable. Others may fill \nhis position at Newark Academy, but no one will ever be able to fill \nhis shoes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/14/senate-section/article/S4498-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4498-S4499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GEORGE HEARN\n\nMr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nGeorge Hearn. George Hearn is an old and trusted friend who has \nrendered distinguished service to our country in peace and war. He has \nannounced that he will soon be trimming his sails, and cutting back on \nhis day to day activities on behalf of U.S. flag international \nshipping. I hasten to reassure his countless friends and those who rely \non his good counsel and advice, George Hearn is not retiring completely \nfrom the world of international shipping.\n  For over 50 years George has been part of our Nation's maritime \neffort. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy, and served in the Pacific Theater \naboard the U.S.S. Iowa from 1945 to 1946. Honorably discharged from the \nNavy, George practiced maritime law in New York City. During that time \nhe was also elected to the New York City Council, and served from 1957 \nuntil his resignation in 1961. He resigned to join the Kennedy \nadministration in Washington, DC, where he served in a senior staff \nposition at the Civil Aeronautics Board, until President Johnson \nnominated him to the Federal Maritime Commission in 1964. George was \nreappointed to the Commission, once by President Johnson, and once by \nPresident Nixon. He resigned as Vice-Chairman of the Commission in \n1975, to practice maritime law in New York City. In 1982 he joined \nWaterman Steamship Corp. as the executive vice-president. George will \ncontinue to serve Waterman as a consultant.\n  Mr. President, that in brief is the distinguished public career of my \nfriend, George Hearn. Proud as he should be of\n\n[[Page S4499]]\n\nall he has accomplished, I know he is proudest of his family, his wife \nof 45 years, Anne, and their adult children, Annemarie, Peggy, and \nGeorge, Jr.\n  George is the son of an immigrant Irish father. George has \ncapitalized to the fullest the bounty which our great country has \noffered to us all. But what makes me proudest to call George my friend, \nis the way he has used his opportunity to help preserve and increase \nthat bounty for the generations of Americans to come. So, I wish to say \nwell done good friend, and you deserve the chance to take time to smell \nthe roses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/14/senate-section/article/S4498-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4499-S4500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO THE LATE IGNAZIO M. ``CARLO'' CARLUCCIO\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the late Ignazio M. ``Carlo'' Carluccio who passed away on \nApril 22, 1997, 3 months to the day after celebrating his 100th \nbirthday in Hampton, NH, with his entire family and his close friends.\n  I had the great honor and privilege to meet Mr. Carluccio on October \n29, 1996, at his home in North Salisbury Beach, MA, just across the \nborder from Seabrook, NH. I was attending a function at a lobster pound \nowned by Bruce Brown, a long-time mutual friend of both Mr. Carluccio \nand myself. While in the area, I wanted to pay my respects to Mr. \nCarluccio, especially since his grandson Dino has worked in my office \nfor the last decade.\n  When I met Mr. Carluccio in his home, he was in excellent health, \nwitty, and sharp as a tack. Indeed, it was hard to believe at the time \nthat he would shortly be celebrating his 100th birthday. During my \nvisit with him, I was fascinated to learn many details of his truly \nremarkable life, some of which I would like to share with my colleagues \nand the American people today.\n  Ignazio Carluccio was born in the small town of Benevento, Italy, in \n1897. He was the son of Antonio Carluccio, and the grandson of Ignazio \nCarluccio. He had one brother and four sisters, three of whom still \nreside in southern Italy. His grandfather was the proprietor of the \nGran Caffe dell'Unione, the most popular gathering place in the center \nof Benevento with regular outdoor musical entertainment. It was this \nexperience as a young boy, growing up around his grandfather's cafe, \nthat would eventually shape and inspire Mr. Carluccio's future in \nAmerica as a talented musician and a proprietor of his own small \nbusiness in a similar small community far away from his homeland.\n  Before leaving Italy in 1921 for America, young Ignazio Carluccio \nlearned to play the violin at a conservatory in Milan, and would often \nperform his own solo concerts in the beautiful parks along the bay of \nNaples. At that point, Ignazio's family had moved from Benevento to \nNaples, where his father now operated his own local cafe. I am told \nthat there are still a few people in Naples who remember his violin \nperformances.\n  Ignazio Carluccio loved the challenges that life presented, and he \nknew a lot about taking risks. Whether it was simply entering the local \nbicycle races along the treacherous, yet scenic Amalfi Coast between \nNaples and Sorrento, or his service during World War I in an Italian \naviation division, Mr. Carluccio was not deterred by the physical harm \nhe encountered. He recovered only to take an even greater risk--the \nmonumental adventure of leaving everything behind except for his violin \nand a few family mementos and heading for America, never turning back \nin the eight decades that followed.\n  Earlier this year, Mr. Carluccio reflected on those first few years \nfollowing his arrival in Boston on a passenger ship from Naples. He \nsaid, ``Early on, I could not speak English, but I made it. It was a \nheckuva time.''\n  Mr. Carluccio was persistent and determined following his arrival in \nAmerica--he worked as a haberdasher and became the first concert \nviolinist for the People's Symphony in Boston. He selected a middle \nname for himself, something uncommon in his native Italy, but not in \nhis new country. He chose ``Mario'' because he wanted to be known as \n``I.M. Carluccio'' which sounded like ``I am Carluccio.'' How clever \nfor someone trying to master the English language, Mr. President.\n  He met his wife, Alphonsine Giguere, backstage during one of his \nperformances, and married her in 1928. In 1934, following the passing \nof his father-in-law, he took over the drugstore his father-in-law had \noperated in Leominster, MA, since 1903, earned a degree in pharmacy, \nand practiced pharmacy for the next six decades until his retirement in \n1985. At its peak, Giguere Drug Stores encompassed three shops and \nrepresented the largest prescription business in Worcester County, MA. \nWhen you were sick and needed medicine, everyone knew that you needed \nto go see Mr. Carluccio at Giguere's.\n  The original corner store was also complete with soda fountains, \nbooths, and peanut machines, and even had musical entertainment \nperformed on the store's roof at one point. It was the local hangout \nfor everyone from school children to local politicians to State police \nofficials. Mr. Carluccio surely must have been proud of the tradition \nhe had carried on from his own grandfather's popular cafe in Benevento, \nItaly.\n  Mr. President, I.M. Carluccio lived the American dream to the \nfullest. He worked hard, starting at 5 a.m. in his store each morning, \nfinishing late at night, teaching violin on the side to students in the \ncommunity, putting his five children through college, and \nsimultaneously sending money on a regular basis back to his siblings in \nItaly. And if that was not enough, Mr. President, he even reminded me \nlast fall that, although he was approaching age 50 during World War II, \nhe wrote a letter at the time to the Secretary of what was then known \nas our War Department offering his services. What devotion, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I.M. Carluccio cherished his family and his close friends, and he \nenjoyed his classic cars, his homemade spaghetti sauce, his violin \nmusic, and his favorite cigars--the simple things for a man who lived \nsuch a rich, enduring, and multifaceted life. He was a true gentleman \nto all who knew him. He accomplished so much that we can only hope \nthat, perhaps, he was able to reflect back with pride, in his own \nquiet, dignified way, as he puffed his final cigars earlier this year. \nHe has left a wonderful legacy which continues to inspire all those who \nhave known him.\n  When I met him last fall I, too, was inspired, not only by his \nlongevity, but by his selfless devotion through the years to his \nNation, the communities in which he made his home, and to his entire \nfamily--three sons, two daughters, nine grandchildren, seven great-\ngrandchildren, nephews, and nieces. Let me say also say here that I am \nproud that Mr. Carluccio's three grandchildren who carry the Carluccio \nname--Carlo, Dino, and Mario--are all constituents of mine from New \nHampshire. I am honored to represent them in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I hope Mr. Carluccio's legacy will inspire all those \nwho hear of it today. I am proud to do my part through this statement \nto ensure that the life of Mr. Carluccio is properly recognized as part \nof our American history. The story of this great Italian-American \ncentenarian has already been recognized on many occasions at the State \nand local level, and through the countless birthday greetings Mr. \nCarluccio received through the years from Presidents, Senators, \nCongressmen, and State and local politicians. But it is appropriate and \ndeserving that today, we make Mr. Carluccio's life story part of the \nofficial, permanent Record of the U.S. Congress. God bless Mr. \nCarluccio and his entire family.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a proclamation by Massachusetts Gov. \nWilliam F. Weld issued earlier this year in honor of Mr. Carluccio's \n100th birthday and a statement submitted to Fitchburg State College \nhonoring Mr. Carluccio as one of ``100 Who Made a Difference'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The proclamation and statement follows:\n\n    A Proclamation By His Excellency Governor William F. Weld--1997\n\n       Whereas, Ignazio M. Carluccio was born on January 22, 1897, \n     in Benevento, Italy; and\n       Whereas, after moving to the United States in 1921, Mr. \n     Carluccio found a new home in the Commonwealth and married \n     Alphonsine Giguere in 1928; and\n       Whereas, a talented violinist, Ignazio Carluccio has shared \n     his musical inspiration with many through performance and \n     instruction; and\n\n[[Page S4500]]\n\n       Whereas, in 1934, Ignazio Carluccio succeeded his father-\n     in-law as owner and operator of the family business, \n     Giguere's Drug Store, in Leominster, Massachusetts; and\n       Whereas, having earned the tremendous respect of his \n     community, Ignazio Carluccio received an award from the Eli \n     Lilly Pharmaceutical Company in 1976, in recognition of the \n     outstanding community health service provided by Gigurere's \n     Drug Store; and\n       Whereas, as Ignazio Carluccio celebrates his One Hundredth \n     Birthday, it is fitting to pay tribute to this fine \n     individual who has touched the lives of many throughout the \n     Commonwealth; now, therefore, I, William F. Weld, Governor of \n     the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, do hereby proclaim January \n     22nd, 1997, to be Ignazio Carluccio Day and urge all the \n     citizens of the Commonwealth to take cognizance of this event \n     and participate fittingly in its observance.\n\n                       100 Who Made A Difference\n\n\n                          ignazio m. carluccio\n\n       Mr. Carluccio has been an integral part of this community \n     since 1928 when he married Alphonsine A. Giguere. He was a \n     concert violinist and teacher of the violin in this and the \n     surrounding area, but he later became a pharmacist and took \n     over the operation and ownership of Giguere Drug to continue \n     the family business that his father-in-law started in 1903. \n     He dedicated his life to his family and business and to \n     serving the public.\n       In the 1950's and 60's his corner drugstore was known as \n     the most complete prescription department in Worcester \n     County. In 1976, the Eli Lilly Pharmaceutical Company \n     presented Mr. Carluccio and his company an award in \n     recognition of outstanding Community Health Service.\n       In 1983, Giguere Drug Stores was recognized for 80 years of \n     service, and I.M. Carluccio was still managing and serving \n     the public from his corner drugstore. At this point, his \n     original business had expanded into a small 3-store chain.\n       Mr. Carluccio had a special recipe of old-fashioned \n     customer service and modern health care products. Customers \n     idolized him. Today, he is still a celebrity for anyone who \n     knows him, sees him, and remembers the days of yesteryear. \n     This man is a tribute to his community!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/14/senate-section/article/S4499-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A TRIBUTE TO TWO FRIENDS\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the recent \nloss of two constituents and good friends. Mrs. Frances Chapman and Mr. \nBill Kelly were more than just constituents and good friends from my \nhome town of Lithonia, GA.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Bob \nDevaney, the former athletic director and head football coach of the \nUniversity of Nebraska, who passed away last Friday.\n  It is impossible to overstate the impact that Bob Devaney had on the \npeople of our State. And although he was born and raised in Saginaw, \nMI, he was the pride of all Nebraska.\n  In 1962, he came from Wyoming and took the helm of a football team \nthat finished 3-6-1 the year before. In his first year as head coach, \nhe turned them into a 9-1 winner--the best record at Nebraska since \n1905.\n  By the time he left the head coaching job to become athletic director \nin 1972, he had won two national championships, boasted the winningest \nrecord in college football at the time, and built the third-largest \ncity in the State--Memorial Stadium on a fall Saturday. He won eight \nBig Eight championships, six bowl games, and in 1982, a place in the \nCollege Football Hall of Fame.\n  Numbers alone cannot measure Bob Devaney's achievement. He brought \npride to Nebraska and taught us what it took and what it felt like to \nbe No. 1. He taught our children how to dream beyond the boundaries of \nthe rural communities and urban neighborhoods in which they live, and \nhe taught us all that with commitment and determination, our dreams \ncould become realities.\n  But his most important legacy was that of sportsmanship. One of the \nmany tributes to Bob Devaney in the wake of his death shared this \nstory, and captures the greatness of the man:\n\n       In one game in 1970, after Nebraska trailed Kansas by 20-\n     10, the Cornhuskers rallied for a 41-20 victory. ``You \n     learned something today,'' Mr. Devaney told his players after \n     the game. ``You learned you can come back. Remember that. \n     That's the lesson of life.''\n\n  Bob Devaney taught all of us about the lessons of life. Bob was a \nsource of inspiration, a great Nebraskan, and a friend to us all. \nBecause of Bob Devaney, there is no place like Nebraska. He will be \nbadly missed.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Bob Reeves' tribute from the May 10 Lincoln \nJournal-Star and an editorial from the May 11 Omaha World-Herald be \nprinted into the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n             [From the Lincoln Journal-Star, May 10, 1997]\n\n                   Devaney an `Inspiration' to State\n\n                            (By Bob Reeves)\n\n       Nebraska lost more than a great football coach when Bob \n     Devaney died Friday. The state lost a born motivational \n     expert who helped give the state a real sense of self-esteem, \n     current and former state and university leaders said Friday.\n       ``Bob Devaney was an inspiration to Nebraska,'' Gov. Ben \n     Nelson said. ``He made pride in football and pride in \n     Nebraska the same. He helped Nebraskans believe that we could \n     be No. 1 in football and in anything we did. He will be \n     missed personally, and by the people who knew and loved \n     him.''\n       ``All of us who knew and worked for Bob Devaney feel a \n     great sense of loss,'' said University of Nebraska-Lincoln \n     head football coach Tom Osborne. ``It's an end of an era, so \n     to speak. Bob always had great joy for the people who worked \n     for him and was very supportive.''\n       James Moeser, UNL chancellor, said Devaney ``helped make \n     the University of Nebraska synonymous with strength, a solid \n     work ethic and people who strive to do their very best.''\n       Former Gov. Norbert Tiemann, who served from 1967 to 1971, \n     described Devaney as ``a tremendous leader.''\n       Devaney ``turned the whole athletic program around (and) \n     gave the state a sense of pride in itself,'' said Tiemann, \n     who now lives in Dallas. ``I've got the greatest admiration \n     for him, both from a professional and personal standpoint. It \n     was a tremendous boost to the state's ego to have a winning \n     football team.''\n       Those comments were echoed by former Gov. Frank Morrison, \n     who served from 1961 through 1967. He was governor at the \n     time then-chancellor Clifford Hardin hired Devaney to take \n     over the football program.\n       ``In many ways, he changed the psychological attitude of \n     the state,'' Morrison said. ``The majority of people had an \n     inferiority complex. It (Devaney's enthusiasm) was pervasive. \n     He helped unify the state and improve our pride in \n     Nebraska.''\n       Both Morrison and Tiemann talked about the positive \n     impression Devaney made when he first arrived in the state \n     from neighboring Wyoming. Tiemann was a banker in Wausa at \n     the time and traveled throughout the state with a group \n     introducing Devaney to various communities.\n       ``Wherever we went, we didn't have to do much selling,'' \n     because of Devaney's winning personality, Tiemann said. ``He \n     made a great impression. He was a wonderful person to be \n     around.''\n       He added that Devaney had such a likable personality that \n     ``he could tell the dirtiest jokes in mixed company and get \n     away with it. I could never do that.''\n       He also forged an intense loyalty from his players, said \n     Morrison, who remained a close friend of Devaney's over the \n     years. ``Johnny Rodgers (1972 Heisman Trophy winner) told me \n     one time, `I would have died for Bob Devaney.' ''\n\n[[Page S4501]]\n\n       Woody Varner, who was president of the university from \n     1970-77, during Nebraska's first two national championships, \n     said he knew Devaney when he was an assistant coach at \n     Michigan State.\n       ``He came (here) with real devotion to Nebraska,'' Varner \n     said.\n       ``He was always a fighter for Nebraska. He never swallowed \n     the story that Nebraska was second-class in any respect. He \n     wanted Nebraskans to feel proud of themselves and of the \n     state.''\n       Varner added that what Devaney did for athletics helped \n     build the reputation of the university.\n       ``It was easier to recruit students and faculty,'' he said. \n     ``The state of Nebraska held its head high, thanks to Bob \n     Devaney.''\n       Don Bryant, UNL associate athletic director and former \n     longtime sports information director, said, ``I have lost a \n     dear, personal friend and it results in a feeling of numbness \n     and shock to realize that Bob Devaney no longer is a force in \n     Nebraska and intercollegiate athletics.''\n       Bryant said Devaney's coaching ability and administrative \n     leadership ``raised the standards of excellence and the \n     visions of highest expectations for all Nebraskans.''\n       Osborne said that besides being a great coach, Devaney was \n     ``a great friend.''\n       ``He was the one who gave me a chance to be a graduate \n     assistant, an assistant coach and a head coach at Nebraska,'' \n     Osborne said. ``Most everything I know about coaching I \n     learned from him. He was exceptional at handling players, \n     always had a great sense of humor, and the players enjoyed \n     playing for him because of the type of person he was. We will \n     all miss him dearly.''\n       UNL Athletic Director Bill Byrne described Devaney as ``a \n     giant in the world of college football, a dear friend and \n     national leader.'' Devaney's leadership ``created a football \n     dynasty and athletic program that is the best in America,'' \n     he said. ``Our goal at Nebraska will be to continue the \n     legacy created by Bob. We all will miss him very much.''\n       UNL sports historian Ben Rader described Devancy as ``a \n     modern icon of success, in as much as his victories \n     represented success for the entire state . . . He was also an \n     example of a self-made man, who came from modest origins. \n     Success is very difficult to measure in the world of \n     bureaucracies, but an athletics or sports, it's very clear-\n     cut.''\n       UNL volleyball coach Terry Pettit recalled that when \n     Devancy came to Nebraska, he had two missions.\n       ``First, he turned around an average football program and \n     made it into the best in the nation. Then, as athletic \n     director, he (took) a mediocre athletic department and built \n     it into one of the best all-around athletic programs in the \n     country.''\n       Petit credited Devaney with helping make Nebraska \n     competitive in women's athletics.\n       ``He gave me the resources and opportunity to succeed,'' \n     Petiti said.\n       ``He did have, and he will continue to have a lasting \n     impact on the Nebraska athletic department and the entire \n     state of Nebraska. His energy, enthusiasm and drive shaped \n     our athletic department. For a lot of people, especially the \n     coaches under him, he was a sort of father figure. We looked \n     to him for guidance and support, and he always showed great \n     loyalty to his staff.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Omaha World Herald, May 11, 1997]\n\n                     Bob Devaney, Builder of Pride\n\n       Bob Devaney.\n       The name unleashes a flood of symbols and memories.\n       Johnnie the Jet.\n       Gotham Bowl.\n       The Game of the Century.\n       Tagge-Brownson.\n       Back-to-back national football championships.\n       Tom Osborne.\n       Expansion after expansion of Memorial Stadium.\n       A sea of helium-filled red balloons, released by thousands \n     of football fans on Nebraska's first touchdown of the game, \n     hanging in the air above Lincoln on a brilliant fall day.\n       Even before Devaney's death on Friday, it has been an \n     often-repeated cliche that Devaney's impact on Nebraska went \n     far beyond football, that he brought Nebraskans together, \n     east and west.\n       But like most other cliches, this one is backed by solid \n     evidence.\n       A stumbling athletic program wasn't the only negative that \n     greeted Devaney when he accepted the head coaching job in \n     1962. The state's spirit in general had been bruised by \n     events of the previous five years. The Starkweather mass \n     murders were still fresh in people's memories. A governor had \n     recently died in office. Angry debates over tax policy and \n     school financing, gathering steam since the 1940s, were \n     dividing urban and rural Nebraska interests.\n       Nebraskans were ready for a little good news. Devaney gave \n     it to them.\n       Under him, the Cornhuskers played with noticeably greater \n     verve.\n       They won games that they would have lost in earlier years.\n       They began appearing in the national ratings. Then the Top \n     10.\n       Finally, in 1970 and 1971, they were national champions.\n       Interstate 80 was pushing westward across Nebraska in those \n     days.\n       Westerners sometimes asked what good it was.\n       Devaney's success gave people in Hyannis, Kimball and \n     Scottsbluff a reason to use the new superhighway.\n       Cowboy boots and Stetsons, often bright red, became a \n     familiar sight in Lincoln on autumm Saturdays.\n       Lincoln's economy benefited.\n       East-west friendships grew stronger. The financial success \n     of the football team made it possible for Nebraska to have a \n     high-caliber women's athletic program. The classy Devaney \n     football teams gave the university national visibility.\n       Some people say that too much is made of college athletics, \n     and they're right. Devaney knew that. Remember, he told fans \n     before a game in 1965, there are 800 million people in China \n     ``who don't give a damn whether Nebraska wins or loses.'' \n     There are bigger things in life than whether the team wins.\n       Devaney never seemed driven or angry. He respected his \n     opponents. His spirit of good sportsmanship lives on in the \n     Memorial Stadium fans who traditionally applaud Nebraska's \n     opponents at the end of each game, even when Nebraska loses.\n       Devaney never set out to transform Nebraska. He would have \n     laughed if someone in 1962 said he was responsible for \n     propping up the self-esteem of an entire state. He was just a \n     man with something he could do very, very well. But \n     excellence on the football field inspired excellence in other \n     walks of life.\n       Devaney's success, and the positive influence his \n     accomplishments had on his adopted state, constitutes a \n     memorial that will long bring honor to his name.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/14/senate-section/article/S4500-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WEI JINGSHENG\n\n   Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues who have so \neloquently praised China's most prominent dissident and advocate of \ndemocracy, Wei Jingsheng, and who have called for his immediate release \nfrom prison. Yesterday marked the publication of Mr. Wei's remarkable \nbook, ``The Courage to Stand Alone.'' The book is a compilation of his \nvaliant prison letters to the Chinese leadership.\n  As a result of Mr. Wei's outspoken and articulate views on human \nrights and democracy the Government of China has imprisoned him--mostly \nin solitary confinement--for the greatest part of two decades. His \npersonal sacrifices in the name of fundamental freedoms are a testament \nto his heroic spirit.\n  As one who has always supported commercial engagement with Beijing to \nencourage greater openness and freedom in China, I find China's \nrepression of Wei's views and cruel treatment of Wei himself offensive.\n  As we are about to embark on our annual debate on renewing normal \ntrade relations with China, Beijing must realize that its treatment of \nMr. Wei in particular, and its repressive human rights policies in \ngeneral, trouble all of the Members of this body, especially those of \nus who favor renewal.\n  While Mr. Wei has been outspoken in his own support of continuing \nChina's MFN trade status--noting at his trial that the direct victims \nof MFN revocation ``would be the already poverty-stricken Chinese \npeople'' rather than the authorities in Beijing--China would do its \npeople and its position in the world well by heeding this brave man's \ncalls for greater freedom and democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/14/senate-section/article/S4501-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4501-S4502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to cosponsor the \nEarly Childhood Development Act and I commend Senator Kerry for \nintroducing this important legislation.\n  Recent research has clearly demonstrated what parents and others have \nintuitively known for generations: that experiences in the early \nchildhood years lay the foundation for much of later development. \nChildren thrive and grow on positive interactions with their parents \nand other adults. Quality child care, quality nutrition, and quality \nhealth care can make all the difference in enabling infants and \nchildren to reach their full potential and become contributing members \nof society. Ensuring that children have these experiences early in \ndevelopment is much easier and less expensive than coping with later \ncrisis problems such as substance abuse, school dropout, and criminal \nbehavior.\n  The Early Childhood Development Act is a significant step toward \nhelping children obtain the multiple supports they need to grow and \nthrive. It builds effectively on the White House summit in April that \nemphasized the very great\n\n[[Page S4502]]\n\nimportance of this issue. It will help State and local jurisdictions \nexpand their efforts to assist young children and their families. It \nwill strengthen Early Head Start, and increase resources for child care \nand nutrition.\n  This initiative is extremely important for the Nation's children. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with Senator Kerry and others to \nprovide children with the opportunities they need and deserve and must \nhave in order to help our country for the generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/14/senate-section/article/S4501-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4502-S4503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SENATE QUARTERLY MAIL COSTS--SECOND QUARTER\n\n Mr. WARNER.

Madam President, I rise to speak about something of \ngreat sadness in our Nation. Tomorrow we will take a vote on partial-\nbirth abortion. I want to speak about that particular issue if I could \nthis evening from a particular perspective that I think might be \nsomewhat different from folks who might look at this as a sterile \nprocedure, a procedure that we may consider banning. I would like to \ntalk about what it says of our culture, what this procedure that is \nbeing used today says about us. Is the loss of love in our culture \nactually so great that we could actually kill a child and explain it \naway? I think this is actually how we ought to look at this debate on \nthis issue.\n  I oppose the partial-birth abortion procedure being conducted in \nUnited States other than in cases of loss of life of the mother, and \nthen I think we need to clearly say that this is available in cases of \nloss of life of the mother. My wife and I have three children, and I \nwould hate to think that she would be put in a spot where she could not \nhave access to a medical procedure that she desperately needed for her \nown life. But that is taken care of in this bill and there is an \nallowance for it. In the case where the life of the mother is at risk, \nthis procedure is allowed, and that is proper and as it should be. We \nallow that to take place.\n  What I want to talk about more is that we have so many of these \nabortions happening in this country. What does it say about the culture \nand our own loss of care and our own loss of love? What does it say \nabout us that this procedure is even allowed.\n  I want to point out to this body some of the things that have \nhappened to American culture over the past 30 years that I think point \nout we have lost the care for other individuals and we have lost the \ncompassion for others and even for babies.\n  Let us look at this chart, if I could share it with you. We are \nlooking at child abuse and neglect reports in America, and this is 1976 \nto 1995. We are looking at numbers of reports in the millions. We are \nlooking at about 600,000 in 1976, which is wholly too much, we are \nlooking at 3 million, over 3 million in 1995.\n  The growth that has taken place during that period of time, what does \nthat say about a loss of care and a loss of compassion in our society \nand in our culture?\n  I want to look at this next chart, violent crime offenses in our \nsociety. Look where we were in 1960. This is\n\n[[Page S4505]]\n\nrate per 100,000 individuals. For every 100,000 individuals in America, \nwe had about 160 violent crime offenses in 1960.\n  Where are we today? In 1993, the latest we have numbers for, we are \nat 746 per 100,000 people. From 160 to 746 during that period of time \nof roughly about 30, 33 years.\n  I only point these out to ask, what is it today about our culture? I \nthink our culture is in a great depression, that we are violent, we are \nnot caring for our children, we are not doing the right things for \nthem, and we are not doing the right things to try to correct it. We \nhave to rebuild the culture, and I think we rebuild it by loving and \ncaring for each other, and we will.\n  To me, that is what this debate is about. It is about banning a \nparticular procedure used on babies, and it is about saying we should \nnot, in a civilized society, allow this. We should not, in looking at \nthis sort of violence and lack of caring and lack of respect in this \nsociety, let something like this go on. It is about those who are \ninvolved and it is about our conscience being pricked by this.\n\n  We see these charts--Senator Santorum has pointed to them --about the \nchild being born, and we get uncomfortable; we don't like that because \nit is striking our conscience and it is saying it is not civilized for \nus to be doing and continuing this procedure. We see it and we do not \nlike it. If we saw it happening to an animal, we would not like it, and \nwe certainly feel that way towards a child.\n  That is why I urge my colleagues and the American people, let us \nreject this procedure as part of rebuilding our culture, as part of \nrestaking this ground. We need to have is compassion and care and love \nfor the most defenseless in our culture.\n  This is a child we are talking about. We must start turning these \ntrends around and start caring for the most defenseless in this \nsituation.\n  I think it is clear that we are going to pass this bill in the \nSenate. I hope we will pass it by an overwhelming majority and that we \nbuild on this from this point forward, saying let us change this \nculture. Let us bring it back to caring. Let us bring it back to \ncompassion and love for everybody, especially the most defenseless.\n  With that, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).
