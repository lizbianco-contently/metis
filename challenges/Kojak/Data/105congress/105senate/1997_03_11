The able majority leader, Senator Lott, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Today, the Senate will resume consideration of Senator \nGlenn's amendment to Senate Resolution 39, the Governmental Affairs \nfunding resolution reported by the Rules Committee. I hope the Senate \nwill continue and hopefully complete debate on the Glenn amendment so \nthat we may vote sometime this afternoon on or in relation to the \namendment. Of course, I want to notify the Senate that we, as always is \nthe case, reserve our right to offer second-degree amendments to \namendments that may be offered. I understand that additional amendments \nmay be offered to Senate Resolution 39, and I presume that there will \nbe a substitute that will be included among those to replace the \nresolution that is before us.\n  I am sure we will have full debate on all the amendments that may be \noffered as well as a possible substitute and the underlying funding \nresolution. Therefore, Senators can expect rollcall votes throughout \nthe day.\n  I hope we will be able to conclude action on this measure today or \nearly tomorrow. I talked with the Democratic leader last night. He \nindicated that he hoped that would be possible. And when we do finish \nthis, then there are some nominations we hope to take up and get a vote \non, including the nomination of Federico Pena to be Secretary of \nEnergy. We would do that hopefully in the morning or tomorrow \nafternoon.\n  After that, after consultation with the Democratic leadership, we \nwould expect to go to the Hollings constitutional amendment concerning \nfree speech. So that could take the balance of the week, maybe even \ngoing over into Friday with some debate, with votes likely occurring--\nand, again, we will have to work this out--maybe on final passage late \nMonday afternoon. But we will notify Senators as we go along exactly \nwhen the votes will occur on Wednesday and Thursday and if any on \nFriday.\n\n  We will recess between the hours of 12:30 to 2:15 for the weekly \npolicy conference and the caucus to meet. I also remind our colleagues \nthat this week we may have to go late into the night one night, which \nwill probably be Thursday night, but we will work with the leadership \nagain and notify the Members exactly what they can expect in that \nregard.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I thank our colleagues for \nthe debate yesterday. I thought it went well. I want to commend and \ncongratulate the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee. I think \nhe is being very positive in his remarks. He is trying to get this to a \nconclusion, and I think we need to do that. I thank the ranking member \nfrom Ohio for the way he has handled himself.\n  There are big problems in this city; it is sort of like the city is \nburning, and we do not want to appear to be fiddling any longer with \ngetting a resolution that would allow this committee to go forward and \ndo its work with a reasonable amount of money and a reasonable amount \nof time and with the emphasis on illegal activities as it might apply \nto the Presidential candidates or Members of Congress.\n  I want to emphasize again that anything that might come out with \nregard to Senators doing something inappropriate or unethical, that, as \nhas always been the case, would go to the Ethics Committee under the \nresolution that we are considering.\n  Also, I want to assure my colleagues that it is my intent that we \nlook into the question of campaign reform. The Rules Committee has the \nauthority, has the jurisdiction and under this resolution has \nadditional money, $450,000 additional funds, to look into how the \ncampaigns were conducted last year, how legal activities were handled \nand whether or not changes need to be made.\n  It is my intent in due time after proper hearings and after a lot of \nconsultation that we will take up this\n\n[[Page S2096]]\n\nissue. The inference continues to be that our goal is just to block it. \nWe do not intend to set a magic date, whether that date is May 1, April \n15, or Labor Day, for that matter. That may be a good time to set up a \nmagic date. But we should not get locked in on dates certain. Let us \njust do our job.\n  That is what I hope the Senate will do on this resolution. That is \nwhat we intend to do in the committee of the distinguished chairman \nfrom Virginia, to have hearings on campaign finance reform and look at \nall these questions in regard to how soft money is used, independent \nexpenditures, and how labor union dues are used without labor union \nmembers' permission.\n  What is the situation with illegal foreign contributions? Do we, in \nfact, have in this case, as has been suggested, the possibility of even \nespionage? This is serious. What we need is for a committee of \ncredibility and jurisdiction to get started with their work, and I hope \nthat we can do that with as little rancor today as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, a question of the majority leader, if I \nmight. With the debate proceeding this morning on my amendment and the \npossibility that we may be able to complete that debate this morning \nand move on to discussion of another amendment and knowing the \nschedules of all the other Senators are very tight, too, and letting \nthem plan their activities here in the Chamber as well as other places, \nwould it be agreeable to put the vote off until after the caucus?\n  Mr. LOTT. It is our intent, and I believe the minority leader has no \nobjection--I have not discussed that with him--to have our first votes \nat 2:15 after the conference and caucus.\n  Mr. GLENN. That would be fine. I would make that as a unanimous-\nconsent agreement, that any votes that might normally occur this \nmorning following debate on my amendment and other amendments that \nmight be brought up at least be stacked until--the vote on my amendment \nbe delayed until after the caucus this afternoon.\n  Mr. LOTT. I reserve the right to object, Mr. President. I would like, \nif I could, to ask the ranking member to defer in that request for a \nmoment and allow us to have a chance to discuss it with him and with \nthe Democratic leader. I think that is probably what we want to do, but \nI just want to make sure everybody is in tune with what we are doing \nhere.\n  Mr. GLENN. I would be glad to do that. I withdraw the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2095-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2096-S2108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 39) authorizing expenditures by the \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the resolution.\n       Pending:\n       Glenn amendment No. 21, to clarify the scope of the \n     investigation.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 22 to Amendment No. 21\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk to the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], for himself and \n     Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment numbered 22 to amendment \n     No. 21.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the pending amendment, strike all after ``(b)'' and \n     insert the following:\n       ``(b) Purpose of Additional Funds.--The additional funds \n     authorized by this section are for the sole purpose of \n     conducting an investigation of illegal activities in \n     connection with 1996 Federal election campaigns.\n       ``(c) Referral to Committee on Rules and Administration.--\n     Because the Committee on Rules and Administration, not the \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs, has jurisdiction rule 25 \n     over all proposed legislation and other matters relating to--\n       ``(1) Federal elections generally, including the election \n     of the President, the Vice President, and Members of the \n     Congress, and\n       ``(2) corrupt practices,\n\n     the Committee on Governmental Affairs shall refer to the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration any evidence of \n     activities in connection with 1996 Federal election campaigns \n     which activities are not illegal but which may require \n     investigation by a committee of the Senate revealed pursuant \n     to the investigation authorized by subsection (b).''\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we will be working with the Democratic \nleadership to get a time agreement on the vote that will occur at 2:15, \nI presume, on this amendment. But we want to work through that and make \nsure we understand exactly what the voting sequence will be.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to reconfirm and beef up our \ncommitment to the public and to our colleagues here in the Senate to \ninsure that funds are authorized by this section for the sole purpose \nof conducting an investigation of illegal activities in connection with \nthe 1996 Federal election campaigns. It is also to make sure that the \nRules Committee has the full authority, with the support of the Senate, \nto get into matters relating to Federal elections generally, including \nthe President, the Vice President and Members of Congress, and corrupt \npractices.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee, under this amendment, shall refer \nto the Committee on Rules and Administration any evidence of activities \nin connection with the 1996 Federal election campaigns which activities \nare not illegal but which require investigation of a committee of the \nSenate revealed pursuant to the investigation authorized under \nsubsection (b).\n  The Rules Committee is going to be an active committee. The Rules \nCommittee will look into any allegations of problems with existing \ncampaign laws or campaign finance laws. They will have hearings, and \nthey have the jurisdiction and the authority to move legislatively.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee has a budget of $4.53 million for \nits investigation, and it has very broad authority to conduct hearings \non the 1996 Federal election campaigns. But it is the Rules Committee \nthat has the jurisdiction to act legislatively on campaign reform.\n  So I emphasize, again, as I did earlier, it is our intent for the \nRules Committee to act in this area. We have provided additional \nfunding and, once again, rather than getting into a great big argument \nabout scope, it is clear what should happen here.\n  First of all, there are lots of allegations of illegal activities, \nforeign contributions that may have come into campaigns--Presidential \nor congressional--the indications that maybe even a foreign government \nmay have had an organized plan to be involved in campaigns. We know if \nthese activities occurred, they would be illegal, but we don't know \nwhat happened. We need a process to look into these things. We need a \nfocused investigation into these allegations.\n  Yet, there are those who say we need to broaden the scope widely, \nnarrow the money, and limit the time. It is a prescription for not \ngetting the job done. This investigation, with the additional authority \nthat is being provided of $4.53 million, is for illegal activities, and \nthey are rampant in this city. As I said earlier, the city seems to be \nburning while we are fiddling around with the process.\n  The Rules Committee has jurisdiction that it will take advantage of. \nThe Governmental Affairs Committee is getting additional authority to \nlook into illegal activities. Ethics has its responsibilities. There is \nattempt to cover up or avoid our responsibilities. We are going to do \nthat.\n  I think this amendment that we have offered here further clarifies \nour intent to look into illegal activities by the special committee \ninvestigation and then to have the Rules Committee look\n\n[[Page S2097]]\n\ninto corrupt practices that may be involved that may not be necessarily \nillegal but may need to be looked at for the possibility of changing \nthe current practices.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 22, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with that, I send a modification to the \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 22), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       In the pending amendment, strike all after ``(b)'' and \n     insert the following:\n       ``(b) Purpose of Additional Funds.--The additional funds \n     authorized by this section are for the sole purpose of \n     conducting an investigation of illegal activities in \n     connection with 1996 Federal election campaigns.\n       ``(c) Referral to Committee on Rules and Administration.--\n     Because the Committee on Rules and Administration, not the \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs, has jurisdiction under \n     rule 25 over all proposed legislation and other matters \n     relating to--\n       ``(1) Federal elections generally, including the election \n     of the President, the Vice President, and Members of \n     Congress, and\n       ``(2) corrupt practices,\n\n     the Committee on Governmental Affairs shall refer to the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration any evidence of \n     activities in connection with 1996 Federal election campaigns \n     which activities are not illegal but which may require \n     investigation by a Committee of the Senate revealed pursuant \n     to the investigation authorized by subsection (b).''\n\n  Mr. LOTT. We added only one word, I say to the distinguished ranking \nmember. In section C ``Referral to Committee on Rules and \nAdministration,'' we add the word ``under rule 25.'' We only added one \nword to make it grammatically correct--``under rule 25.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I think it is good to review how we got to \nthe current situation we are in, because this was not our doing on \nGovernmental Affairs. It was not our suggestion that we be given the \nduty of investigating campaign finance reform. It was not our \nsuggestion that the jurisdictions of other committees that might have \nan interest in this be given to us.\n  What happened--and I am recounting this mainly from press reports of \nwhat happened, and I presume they are accurate--was that there were \nseveral committees who saw themselves as wanting part of this \ninvestigation into campaign finance reform.\n  You had the Commerce Committee because there were trade matters \ninvolved that there had been some allegations about. Senator McCain, \nwho has a big interest in campaign finance reform, chairs that \ncommittee and could take an active role in what might happen with \ncampaign finance reform.\n  The Judiciary Committee was concerned about some of the legal matters \nregarding elections, and they had some things they were going to look \ninto.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee certainly had an interest in this \nbecause foreign money supposedly came back in to our election campaigns \nhere. So they wanted to find out what happened to foreign relations and \nforeign policy and were any of those things altered as a result of \nmoney coming back in.\n  The Rules Committee, which has a jurisdiction over election law, \ncertainly had an interest in this particular area.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee, of which I am the ranking member, \nalso had their own interest in this in that we are basically the \ninvestigative committee of the Senate. We have investigated such things \nas drugs and drugs coming into the country and organized crime and \nfraudulent health programs and nonproliferation around the world of \nnuclear weapons and terrorism and a whole host of things that we have a \nbroad experience investigating. Our mandate to do investigations is the \nbroadest on Capitol Hill. We have been accustomed to doing this through \nmany, many decades.\n  The suggestion was not made from the Democratic side that all these \nconflicting jurisdictions be combined into the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. This was a suggestion that was made by the Republican \nleadership. In fact, it was not only a suggestion, it was decided by \nthe Republican leadership on their side of the aisle that these other \njurisdictions would not be exercised and that this investigation would \nbe focused in the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  This was not a suggestion made from the Democratic side. It was \nRepublican leadership that decided this. And so to act now as though we \nwere somehow usurping authority of another committee by proposing a \nbroad investigation on the Governmental Affairs Committee just is not \nthe case. That is just not the way it happened.\n  I can tell you exactly what happened. And once again, this has all \nbeen out in public print. This is not something I know from being in \nmeetings because I have not been in meetings that were involved with \nany of these decisions to assign it to the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee.\n  But what happened, when it got to the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nwas this: Senator Thompson had an interest in a broad investigation. I \nhad an interest in a broad investigation. We had some ideas on scope. \nWe sat down in a couple of meetings, and we worked out an agreement \nthat was broad in scope, as it should be, because this whole \ninvestigation into campaign finance reform does not involve only \nillegalities, those things that are against the law. It involves much \nmore than that.\n  Any fair observer of the campaign finance system agrees that in \naddition to illegalities, there are many, many things out there that \nare legal but probably should not be. All the abuses of soft money, as \nit is called, that came up in this last election, all those abuses were \nso onerous to most people across this country that they just want us to \nget into campaign finance reform.\n  Every single poll that has been done across this country shows that \npeople want campaign finance reform. They also see that polling has \nbeen interesting in that it has indicated that they think both parties, \nboth campaigns this last election cycle--the fault that can be pointed \nat one direction or another is not all one direction, it is bipartisan. \nWe have a bipartisan problem here, and we need a bipartisan solution.\n  Part of it is looking into illegalities where the existing law was \nviolated. There is no doubt that that has to be done. The other part of \nthis problem is looking into the soft money in particular and \nindependent expenditures that were so vile, so onerous in this last \nelection.\n\n  So when Republican leadership assigned this overall investigation of \ncampaign finance to the Governmental Affairs Committee, it was not at \nour request, but at his suggestion, at his direction, so that the \nresponsibilities would not be in quite a number of different committees \nbut would be centered in the basic investigative committee of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Now what happened?\n  Senator Thompson and I, in the two meetings I mentioned, sat down and \nwe drew out a broad scope in which we planned to look into not only \nillegalities but also into the equally disturbing areas of where \ncampaign finance reform is needed that involve soft money and \nindependent expenditures.\n  In this last election I remember reading a newspaper account of a \nCongressman who, after the election, said he wound up feeling like a \nping pong ball in the middle of this and he had no control over it \nbecause there were so many outside influences coming in and putting ads \non that he did not even know anything about that he felt like a ping \npong ball in his own election and completely out of control of the \nsituation.\n  Now, if we are going to take any fair look at campaign finance \nreform, it is going to have to involve illegalities, of course. We plan \nto look into those. But we got to have soft money. Our scope, as we had \noutlined it on that committee, was put out. It disturbed some people.\n  Let me say, when Senator Thompson and I agreed to the scope, it was \nthen taken to the committee. The committee has three members on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee that are also members of the Rules \nCommittee. When this was brought before them, after considerable \ndebate, the committee agreed upon the scope of our investigation. They \nvoted on that and approved it. It was agreed upon.\n  What happened when that got to the Rules Committee? The fact is that \non\n\n[[Page S2098]]\n\nthe Rules Committee some of the people that are the most adamant \nagainst any campaign reform consideration at all disagreed strongly \nwith what was being done and that any look be taken into the soft money \narea. When it got to the Rules Committee with the request for the \nadditional funding of the $6.5 million that had gone over, that \ndisturbed them very much.\n  So what happened? They delayed funding in the Rules Committee because \nof their objection to us looking into soft money and some of the things \nthat are legal but probably should not be what we were going to look \ninto. They wanted to protect their ability to raise soft money because \nthey outdo the Democrats about two to one in soft money raising.\n  Obviously, it is a factor in not only having gained control of the \nSenate but in maintaining control of the Senate. They objected over on \nthe Rules Committee to the funding that had to be approved by the Rules \nCommittee for additional funding for investigations.\n  Now, at that point things were stymied. They dug in their heels over \nthere and were not going to approve any money, as I understand it, for \ninvestigation unless our jurisdiction on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee was reduced and those jurisdictions involving things we were \ngoing to look into with regard to soft money were brought over to the \nRules Committee where they obviously would have much more say in what \nhappened to that than they would if the jurisdiction stayed with the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n  That is how we got to where we are. So a reduced amount was agreed \nupon over in the Rules Committee but with the proviso that the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee could investigate only illegal \nactivities. Only illegal. That took out any investigation, any \ninvestigation whatever of soft money, unless it proved to be illegal, \nonly illegal. But most of the soft money problem is legal. I do not \nthink it should be. Our investigations in that area were going to, I \nthink, lay out a good case of why we need campaign finance reform \nchanges.\n  That is how we got to where we are. It was at least implied here on \nthe floor yesterday and even this morning I think it could be implied \nthat we somehow had overextended our jurisdiction on the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. It was leadership on the Republican side that \ncombined all these other committees' interest and assigned to the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee the task of looking into all of this \nwhole campaign finance reform area.\n  Now, what about the substitute amendment that is before the Senate \nnow, the substitute to my amendment? What it does, as I see it, and I \njust got it a few minutes ago so I have not had a chance to look into \nit in that much detail, but what it does basically is say that we are \ntaking back the authority of the Governmental Affairs Committee that we \nwere asked to do. We did not ask to do it, we were assigned that task. \nThey are now taking back our authority to look into any of these \nmatters, any of the matters relating to Federal elections generally, \nincluding the election of the President, the Vice President, Members of \nthe Congress, and corrupt practices, as I understand it.\n  Let me read this through. It is a short amendment.\n\n       Strike all after ``(b)'' and insert the following:\n       ``The additional funds authorized by this section are for \n     the sole purpose of conducting an investigation of illegal \n     activities in connection with 1996 Federal election \n     campaigns.''\n\n  Now, my amendment would change that and change the scope back to what \nit was originally in the Governmental Affairs Committee. So that refers \nback to what we were assigned to do.\n  It goes on with subsection (c):\n\n       Referral to Committee on Rules and Administration.--Because \n     the Committee on Rules and Administration, not the Committee \n     on Governmental Affairs, has jurisdiction under rule 25 over \n     all proposed legislation and other matters relating to--\n       (1) Federal elections generally, including the election of \n     the President, the Vice President, and Members of the \n     Congress, and\n       (2) corrupt practices,\n\n     the Committee on Governmental Affairs shall refer to the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration any evidence of \n     activities in connection with the 1996 Federal election \n     campaigns which activities are not illegal but which may \n     require investigation by a Committee of the Senate revealed \n     pursuant to the investigation authorized by subsection (b).\n\n  What we are being told then is we have to refer back, because the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration has jurisdiction in these \nmatters, which we never quarreled with. That was there going in. It was \nRepublican leadership that wanted us to take the jurisdiction and run \nwith it on campaign finance reform.\n  Now, because it has become objectionable to some Members on their \nside and they see we are going to get into soft money, what happens? \nThey are proposing to take that authority back from us. It was at least \nimplied yesterday afternoon on the floor and again this morning that we \nsomehow were in error, I guess, in what we were doing, even though we \nhad been asked to do it by leadership. I do not quarrel with the fact \nthat Federal elections generally are looked at by the Rules Committee. \nThat is in their jurisdiction. I do not disagree that they can look \ninto corrupt practices. I think maybe this could be interpreted to say \nthat the Governmental Affairs Committee is not permitted to look into \ncorrupt practices, whatever the definition of that is. We will have to \ndiscuss that a little, I guess.\n\n  In any event, here we are with the situation where on our side of the \naisle we have been pushing for campaign finance reform this whole year. \nIt has been brought up time and time and time again. We wanted to bring \nup the McCain-Feingold bill and get it voted on. There has been very \nlittle support for that on the other side of the aisle. In fact, none, \npractically. Senator McCain and Senator Thompson probably are the only \nsponsors of that bill on the Republican side.\n  So the intent here is obvious. The intent is to squelch the broad-\nbased investigation that we were going to have on the Governmental \nAffairs Committee and put it back in the Rules Committee where some of \nthe Members that are most adamantly opposed to campaign finance reform \nare members.\n  So it is not a very pretty picture this morning. I was going to have \na speech on the scope of my amendment this morning, and it might be \ngood, still, to run through some of that. I hope people would see \nthrough what a subterfuge this is in trying to change the amendment \nthat I had before us. I had not been given the opportunity yet this \nmorning to make some comments on my amendment, the underlying amendment \nto this second degree. I believe I will make those comments now and \nthen see what discussion we want to have beyond that.\n  The amendment I offered last evening, or laid down last evening, \ncorrected what I saw as the legislation in Senate Resolution 39 where \nit is most deficient, and that is in the scope of our investigation. \nLet me first address Senate Resolution 39 as approved by the Rules \nCommittee and is on the floor now as the underlying resolution to be \nconsidered.\n  Where campaign finance reform is concerned, the proposed legislation, \nas far as I am concerned, could be called coverup for Congress, coverup \nfor Congress' legislation. I think that is what it is. It does not do \nthis incidentally or accidentally. It is not a coverup that is \nincidental or accidental. It is deliberate, intentional, and I think \ncynical. It is specifically defined and worded to thwart and curtail \nmuch of the campaign finance investigation that was planned by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee this year. After much discussion with \nthe belief that the proposed investigation and hearings could set the \ninformational basis for much needed campaign finance reform, Chairman \nThompson and I had agreed upon the scope of the investigation, all \nfully within Governmental Affairs Committee jurisdiction, I might add. \nWe were given additional guidelines by the majority leader and on his \npart they would see that other committees were not delving into their \nindividual interest areas. That scope was to include investigating \nallegations wherever they might lead and with nothing off limits with \nregard to Federal elections.\n  I want to point out that the agreement was approved unanimously by \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee,\n\n[[Page S2099]]\n\nthree members of which are also on the Rules Committee.\n  That greatly disturbed some Members of the Senate who do not favor us \nlooking at campaign finance practices on Capitol Hill and, more \nspecifically, in the Senate. They had to find a way to control the \nprocess. Why? Why would anyone want to interfere with investigating \nevery facet of campaign finance? So we can correct the abuses that have \nplagued recent elections and nearly made a mockery out of election \n1996, and will be even worse next time around, unless we act to correct \nsome of these practices.\n  The resolution stands good Government on its head. The amendment I \nproposed would change that. Let me stress that this is the very first \ntime in my 22 years in the Senate, and on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, that I have ever seen any committee approve and bring to the \nfloor a resolution prohibiting another committee from investigating \nimproper, unethical, or wrongful behavior in any area, whether it was \nspecial investigative funding or not. That is what is involved here. \nThey keep pointing out that this is only the additional money. We still \ncould use basic funds out of our committee's normal yearly basic funds \nto do this kind of investigating. But that would mean we would have to \nlay down all the other jurisdictional oversight matters that normally \ncome before that committee. So it is deadly serious for those of us who \nare interested in fairness in elections and stamping out the growing \nabuses that have grown apace around the body politic.\n  What I am saying the resolution would do is prohibit another \ncommittee from investigating improper, unethical, or wrongful behavior \nin any area, where it was special investigative funding. Granted, that \nwas going to be the source of how we were going to do this \ninvestigation.\n  The proposed resolution says that with the money provided for the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee investigation, it may look at illegal \nactions and illegal actions only. Now, that is a far tougher test of \nwhat we can put on the table to be looked at. Some of those campaign \nactivities involving both parties in Federal campaigns has smelled to \nhigh heaven, in the eyes of most citizens, and they cry out for \ncorrection, but are legal under current law. It may be legal now, but \nshould not be if we are going to clean out the political stables.\n  One example of such a subject, as I mentioned, is soft money--money \nwhich, due to loopholes in the law, can be given in unlimited amounts \nby wealthy individuals, corporations, and unions. That is legal. Soft \nmoney was obtained and used in the 1996 Federal election in ways that \nturned fairness upside down and corrupted our whole political system. \nFew political scientists would disagree that, if left unchecked to grow \nin the future at the same rate as it has in the past, soft money can \nbecome an even more destructive and virulent cancer in the body \npolitic.\n  I was reading a booklet yesterday entitled ``A Bag of Tricks; \nLoopholes in the Campaign Finance System.'' The first sentence of \nchapter one reads:\n\n       The biggest loophole by far in our campaign finance laws is \n     soft money.\n\n  They are right--but it's legal. And now, by S. 39, we are to be \nprohibited from investigating soft money abuses, unless we come across \nsome that are definitely illegal. We could look at them. But if an area \nis improper, if it is unethical or just flat common sense that it is \nwrong, we cannot look at it, even though it may be crucial to real \ncampaign finance reform, and even though the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee has the jurisdiction and experience to investigate.\n  Why, then, are we being cut back in scope to the point where only \nillegalities will be on the Governmental Affairs table? Why is our \ninvestigation being limited to 1996 only? Why cause such a drastic \nchange in addressing what is properly viewed as an expanding national \nscandal? The basic question, I guess, is: Who is afraid of what?\n  The answer is not very pleasant, but it is obvious. Why the change? \nBecause bad as the money chase may be, correcting it would upset the \napple cart for those in the Senate who have learned how to work the \nsystem for their own personal or party political benefit.\n  Under present law, does one party have an advantage over the other in \nfundraising, in particular, with regard to soft money? Yes. There is a \nsubstantial difference in the usual supporting donor bases. Both \nDemocrats and Republicans have some wealthy individual donors. But the \npreponderance in that area is tilted heavily in favor of wealthy \nRepublicans. Both parties have some support from corporations and \nlabor. Again, the tilt from labor is on the Democratic side. But, \nagain, balancing the Democratic labor support against the Republican \ncorporate or wealthy individual support comes out heavily in favor of \nthe Republicans.\n  Let me read a few figures reported by the Federal Election Commission \nregarding the 1996 elections. Of the total spent on the elections--\neverything, not just the Senate, but across the board in the last \nelection--the Democrats are estimated to have spent $332 million. \nRepublicans spent $548 million. Just in the Senate campaign committees, \nlet's look at that. In hard dollars, Democrats raised $30 million; \nRepublicans raised $62 million. In soft money, Democrats raised $14 \nmillion; Republicans raised $27 million. That comes down just with \nregard to the Senate as over a 2-to-1 advantage, with Democrats having \nbeen able to raise $44 million and Republicans $89 million. So, in \nsummary, under current law, Republicans are able to raise at least \ndouble what Democrats raised to help fund Senate races.\n\n  Now, we all know that money is certainly ahead of whatever is in \nsecond place with regard to winning an election these days. Two-thirds \nof the money goes to TV and other things, and so on. But with money \nbeing the biggest single factor in political control, it is no wonder \nRepublicans in the Senate do not want to change the system. It is the \n``goose laying golden eggs'' that was crucial to gaining, and now to \nretaining, their majority control in the Senate.\n  So we need to change S. 39. That is what my amendment would have \ndone. In deciding whether to change it, the choice is plain and simple: \nParty and personal interests of the moment versus cleaning up the \nsystem, making it proper and fair for all Americans, not just a special \nfew, for the long-term future.\n  Initially, those who were adamantly opposed to campaign finance \nreform on the Republican side--on the Republican side of the Rules \nCommittee, which must approve Governmental Affairs Committee \ninvestigative funding above the normal committee budget--were able to \nprevent funding to the Governmental Affairs Committee for the \ninvestigations. Had that position prevailed, it would have entirely \nscheduled the hearings, and because the tarnished Republican public \nimage which that would evoke was unacceptable to Republican leadership, \nthe proposed resolution--S. 39--deal was cut, whereby the Governmental \nAffairs Committee was stripped of its authority to use money provided \ndirectly for the investigation to look into improper, unethical, or \nwrongful matters, unless they met the far more difficult standard of \nbeing illegal. And those jurisdictions were specifically given to the \nRules Committee.\n  Now, I have the utmost confidence in Senator Warner, chairman of the \nRules Committee. I think he will do his best to fulfill the \nresponsibilities given to his committee with this resolution. But \ntherein lies a problem. Several of the most vocal Republican opponents \nof campaign finance reform are on the Rules Committee. They are \nopponents, in particular, of including Congress in investigations of \nwhat may, at the same time, be legal, but also improper, unethical, or \nwrong by any fair standard. These are the same people who refuse to \ngive the Governmental Affairs investigative funding to begin with.\n  Now, they will be the investigators of what they so adamantly oppose. \nThey will be the investigators of what they so adamantly oppose. Foxes \nguarding hen houses is indeed a good analogy. They got their way. To \nme, it is a high price.\n  The amendment I had proposed would change all this. Very simple. All \nit does is restore the original Governmental Affairs Committee scope of \nthis investigation. It restores the scope the committee voted on \nunanimously, with not one dissenting vote on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, including\n\n[[Page S2100]]\n\nthree members that are also members of the Rules Committee. The \namendment would allow the committee to look into all sorts of campaign \nbehavior, whether illegal, legal, improper or unethical. That is what \nthe American people want, a complete look at this whole problem. \nRestoring this scope to our investigation would allow us to conduct a \nbroad, far-reaching inquiry into our current campaign system.\n  I think it is a high price that Republican leadership has paid to \nassuage a few Members and to place them in what will probably turn out \nto be a controlling position of any investigation into other than just \nstrict illegalities. The Rules Committee would be permitted to look at \nissues surrounding soft money and independent expenditures. Our \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs would be permitted to look at issues \nsurrounding soft money and independent expenditures, which are two of \nour biggest problems today, but in most cases our committee would only \nbe able to look at those which are illegal, we believe are illegal \ngoing in. And the Rules Committee would have everything else except \nthose matters which are completely illegal.\n  If we followed my resolution, we would restore the scope, allow us to \nfollow the money trail, and let the chips fall where they may.\n  Mr. President, I am fully aware there are serious differences of \nopinion surrounding how this resolution, S. 39, came to the floor, and \nthere are differences of opinion surrounding what is going to happen to \nit. But there are probably few minds undecided as to how they will vote \non these amendments and, in particular, on my amendment before it was \namended here by the majority leader. But before any votes are cast, I \nhope all Senators will take a long, hard look at what has been proposed \nby the Rules Committee in S. 39. I would ask you to look ahead, look \nahead about 20 years when your kids have grown up. The majority \nleadership in the Senate may well have changed. It may be in different \nhands by that time. I am sure we would all hope that when our children \nand grandchildren have reached their adult years, the political system \nwill have been improved and political fundraising will not be in the \nmess it is today.\n  One way to gain that end is to assure that investigations are carried \nout now without fear or favor and spotlighting the dark corners, \nwhether illegal, legal, wrong, improper or unethical. The amendment I \nwas proposing to S. 39 would take us in that direction. If the shoe is \non the foot 20 years from now, would that change any Republican votes \ntoday? I don't know. Think about it. They have an advantage today; it \nis about a 2 to 1 advantage, and they are preventing us from really \nlooking into any of these matters on a meaningful basis.\n  Mr. President, the substitute that was submitted by the majority \nleader would once again stand on its head what I think to be fairness \nand what the American people want. It would restrict us on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee as to what we can do. And I repeat what \nI said going in. This was not something we asked for. It was something \nthat the Republican leadership decided to give to that committee, and \nthen, when it turns out that some of their own members do not want us \nlooking into some of these dark corners, they say, OK, we are going to \ntake that assignment back. And because we have the members who are most \nobjecting to any campaign reform on the Rules Committee, they are now \ngoing to look into some of these other areas.\n  I am sure the chairman of that committee, Senator Warner, my good \nfriend across the aisle, will do everything he can, but knowing what \nthe membership of the committee is and knowing the views of the \nmembership on the Rules Committee with regard to campaign finance \nreform, he is going to have a herculean job to try and get out \nmeaningful legislation, legislation that is going to do anything \nmeaningful for campaign finance reform. I do not ever go around saying \nI feel sorry for other Senators, but as far as getting anything out of \nthat committee that is going to have a title of campaign finance reform \non it, it is going to be a very difficult job for him. He is being a \ngood soldier in taking this thing on.\n  Senator Thompson has said, well, OK, I guess something is better than \nnothing, and so he has not been involved with the debate over on the \nfloor, so far at least, but I just think this is wrong. I think what \nthey are trying to do with this substitute amendment to my amendment \nthis morning is wrong. It spells out that the Rules Committee will be \neven more direct in denying us what we thought our investigative scope \nwas on the Governmental Affairs Committee, a task, I repeat for the \nthird time, we did not ask to have. It was assigned to the committee.\n  I want to make one other statement, too, and then I will turn this \nover to other people who are waiting to make their statements.\n  Mr. President, yesterday the big thrust by the Republican Party by \nany observation was we have problems with China and we have problems \nwith campaign financing coming in from China and whether it occurred, \nwhether it was against the law, who did it, were there any favors \ngiven, and so on. And that was being used yesterday almost as if, \nalthough it wasn't so stated, they are for investigating that and we \nsomehow are not just as much in full agreement of investigating that \nbecause it somehow involves the Democratic administration.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. I am committed to looking \ninto anything that happened in that area. The President has said he \nwants to look into that area. And I do not doubt his sincerity in that. \nIt is a blot on the whole body politic. Republican, Democrat, Senate, \nHouse, everybody else knows that has to be looked into.\n  So all the charts that were out on the floor yesterday showing Huang \nand Trie and all this and the subcategories and the fine print down \nhere that implied there has to be some new look into that area as \nthough we were opposing that on our side, they were for it and we were \nagainst it, that is wrong. I will borrow their charts and I will use \nthem on the floor myself on the Democratic side if that is needed, and \nI am sure the President would like to have them down at the White House \nto show what has been dug out so far that is wrong, and he wants to \ncorrect it. So that is not one there is any difference on. Let us just \nmake certain of that.\n  So for all those reasons I rise to oppose the proposal by the \nmajority leader, the substitute amendment to the amendment that I had \nproposed. I will have other questions about some of the items in S. 39 \nas we go along.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I first wish to thank my distinguished colleague for his \nreferences to the Senator from Virginia. And I wish to give him and all \nMembers of the Senate my personal assurance that in my capacity as \nchairman, I will exercise due diligence, the fairest, most aggressive \naction by our committee in the areas delineated by the amendment that \nwas sent to the desk here momentarily by the distinguished majority \nleader and joined in by myself.\n  We have clearly through the years--the Rules Committee--had \njurisdiction in this area, and we will pursue it. I hasten to point out \nthat the three members of the Rules Committee are members of the \ndistinguished ranking member's committee, the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. Indeed, the past chairman, Senator Stevens, has joined in \nsupporting the amendment in the Rules Committee by the Senator from \nVirginia, which is now the underlying amendment here in the ardent \ndebate this morning. To suggest that just one or two or three, or \nwhatever it is, members of the Rules Committee can stop either the \ncommittee or the Senate from, at this juncture, a full and thorough \ninvestigation of all aspects of soft money, all aspects of other \nalleged areas of campaign finance or campaign reform that need to be \naddressed by the Senate I think is not a wise step to take at this \npoint in time.\n  Mr. President, echoing, again, the very important message that the \nmajority leader stated earlier today, we have to get on. This committee \nis ready to go to work. Reports are coming in that possible sources of \nevidence might be disappearing. I will leave that to others to discuss. \nBut I do know that we are tied up here on process, and\n\n[[Page S2101]]\n\nI hope we can move at the earliest possible time to vote on the \namendment of the Senator from Ohio, and the underlying amendment, and \nof course the amendment by the distinguished majority leader. That will \nbe decided upon by the leadership.\n  But I urge all Senators to come to the floor now. Now is the \nopportunity to give your thoughts on this important matter. Let us get \non with it so the committees as allocated under the resolutions here \ncan get on with their business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I have the honor of serving on both \nthe Rules Committee, under the able leadership of the Senator from \nVirginia, and the honor and distinction of serving on Governmental \nAffairs Committee, under the leadership of Senator Thompson.\n  I witnessed, a month ago, a rare moment of bipartisanship. Democrats \nand Republicans came together in the Governmental Affairs Committee. We \nwere apart from the glare of the television lights or the pressure of \npartisan leadership, and we reached what I think was a sound and a good \njudgment. Senator Thompson offered honest leadership, and he came to us \nwith a proposed scope of investigation. Senator Glenn responded by not \nonly accepting his scope of an investigation, but he expanded it. For \nseveral weeks, while we differed on the timing and the expense, we \noperated in a general belief that we had defined the parameters of a \nreview of the 1996 Federal elections in the United States. That scope \noffered us a chance to not only look at specific misdeeds, but to \ninform this institution and to educate the American people generally \nabout the need for general campaign finance reform and how individual \nparts of the system were now broken.\n  Our concern was that we learn, not only about the 1996 Presidential \ncampaign, but that campaign be put in perspective in how previous \nPresidential campaigns operated so we could learn if there was a \nchange, and if there was a change why it happened--both to find those \nwho may have committed wrongful acts, but also how to improve the \nfuture process.\n  We also reflected, I think, the reality that Presidential campaigns \ndo not take place in a vacuum. Indeed, there is no distinguishing line \nbetween where a Presidential campaign's financing operations stop and \nthe congressional campaigns begin. The money, the advertising, the \nactivities, are coordinated and intertwined. So our scope included both \nthe Presidential campaigns and congressional campaign committees and \nthose of individual Members. Our scope also reflected two other \nspecific areas that probably represent the greatest change in electoral \npolitics in the United States in 1996, the use of nonprofit \norganizations, often as surrogates for partisan political activity, and \nthe use of independent expenditures, where soft money is used to \ninfluence Federal campaigns.\n  This scope was broad, it was comprehensive, it is what this \ninstitution and the country requires. And only a month after reaching \nthis agreement, before the first hearing is held, the first witness \nnotified, the first lesson learned, it is being put to a premature \ndeath. There is enough cynicism in America about our electoral system. \nThe system has already convinced enough Americans that it does not \noperate and it does not reflect their needs or provide room for their \nconcerns. We risk, today, adding one more pile of dirt on this mountain \nof doubt. The resolution that now comes before the Senate is an \nextraordinary departure from the bipartisan scope that Senator Glenn \nand Senator Thompson reached previously. It has become, in my judgment, \na proxy fight in the larger battle for campaign finance reform, a \ncynical effort that the Nation, and the Senate as an institution, can \nbe focused on a few narrow problems so the underlying deterioration of \nthe Nation's system of campaign finance laws will not be noticed or \nexposed, the pressure building in the Nation to change the laws \ngenerally will be avoided.\n  So, in place of this bipartisan scope for what hopefully could have \nbeen meaningful hearings, the Senate, instead, is given a new scope of \nactivities for the Governmental Affairs Committee. It differs in \nseveral important ways, but none more significant than that it \nidentifies the scope of these hearings not as the Presidential campaign \nof the last two cycles generally, the operations of congressional \ncampaign finance or nonprofits or independent expenditures--the new \nstandard is illegal activities.\n  If illegal activities are to operate as the scope of the Governmental \nAffairs hearings, we are then establishing a committee with sufficient \nmoney, enough time, but no purpose. Illegal activities in our system \nwould have to be defined by the standards as a people we have come to \nrecognize would constitute an illegal act. Illegal acts in our country \nare defined by a system of justice. They require a burden of proof and \na requisite state of mind. Indeed, in our system of justice, we have \nthe highest levels of establishing illegal activity, perhaps, of any \nnation on Earth.\n  During the hearings in the Rules Committee last week, I asked Senator \nThompson whether illegal activities in his mind were synonymous with a \ncriminal act. Indeed, we were assured that this was the purpose and \nillegal activity was, by definition, it appeared, a criminal act. The \nSenate needs to consider this definition before it accepts this scope, \nbecause a violation of the campaign finance laws by the President of \nthe United States, or Senator Dole, or any Member of the House or \nSenate is not a criminal act unless there was a willful intent. Indeed, \nvirtually none of the allegations raised in the popular press regarding \nthe financing of congressional and Presidential campaigns would appear \nwillful or potentially to meet the standard required to even be the \nsubject of these hearings.\n  In the other body there were serious questions raised about the \noperation of tax-exempt foundations; whether or not the tax laws had \nbeen violated in order to engage in influencing political activity.\n  The operations of a tax-exempt foundation are not a criminal act \nunless there was a willful intent, which appears to be missing in the \nallegations made to date with regard to tax-exempt organizations.\n  Finally, there is the question of the operation of independent \nexpenditures generally. The most significant change in the political \nculture in the United States in 1996 has been the operation of \nindependent expenditures by philosophical or issue-oriented or partisan \norganizations to use soft money to enter the system. And yet, both that \nsoft money and the operation of these independent expenditures would \nnot rightfully be within the jurisdiction of this committee if we \nmaintain the standard of illegal or criminal act.\n  The Senate, therefore, Mr. President, is left with a broad question \nof policy as we approach these hearings. If it is our intention to find \nspecific criminal activity in the 1996 Federal campaign system, then I \nbelieve Members can rest assured that the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation and the Justice Department will find those acts and \npeople will be brought to justice.\n  But Democrats and Republicans in the Governmental Affairs Committee \nbegan these discussions and the planning of this investigation with a \ndifferent purpose. It was our goal to assure the American people that \nwe would find not only those acts that were illegal but those that were \nimproper. We would disclose to the American people those activities \nwhich do not belong in our system of electoral politics, expose them to \nthe light of day in the hope that the net result would be a change of \nthe law and a rising standard for operating political campaigns in the \nUnited States, while reassuring the American public of the integrity of \nthe system.\n  That, Mr. President, is the question before the Senate: a narrow \nhearing, cynically designed to focus attention on one campaign of the \nPresident of the United States, or an honest conversation about the \nstate of electoral politics in the United States today and what we can \ndo to change it and be part of a rising standard. The vote on this \nresolution, on the amendments that follow, is a vote on that question.\n  Mr. President, there is, finally, the additional issue of the date \nfor concluding the committee's work that needs to be part of this \ndiscussion and fully explained. While Democrats and Republicans in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee had generally agreed\n\n[[Page S2102]]\n\nto a scope, there was always disagreement about a concluding date. I \nbelieve that Senator Thompson came to the Senate with the best of \nintentions and good purpose in his belief that there should be no \nconcluding date for the fear that witnesses would withhold information \nif they knew they could wait until the committee concluded its work. \nBut there is another competing purpose, I believe, that requires the \nSenate to establish a concluding date, which I now believe both \nDemocrats and Republicans accept.\n  These hearings are about educating the American people and ourselves \nabout our system of campaign finance. These hearings are about finding \nspecific misdeeds or illegalities, but they are also about something \nmuch more practical and immediate.\n  Within a year, the United States will begin a system of a general \nFederal election. With all that we now know about the breakdown of the \ncampaign finance laws in the United States in 1996, it is inexcusable \nand inexplicable if the U.S. Senate were to allow this country to \nproceed to another general election in 1998 without a change in how \nthis Nation governs its laws, governs these campaigns and finances this \nelectoral system. It is imperative that the Senate retain a concluding \ndate for these hearings so that the U.S. Congress and the American \npeople have the benefit of everything that is learned to proceed to \nreform.\n  It is also, I believe, Mr. President, necessary to note that while \nspecific changes in the law may follow the conclusions of these \nhearings, it is generally not necessary to wait for these hearings to \nconclude or, indeed, even to begin to proceed generally with campaign \nfinance reform.\n  The hearings by the Governmental Affairs Committee may teach us a \ngreat deal about specific misdeeds or problems in the system, but every \nMember of this Senate already knows enough about the breakdown of the \ncampaign finance laws in this country to proceed immediately for a \nreview and a change in comprehensive campaign finance reform.\n  And so, Mr. President, I conclude with the hope that partisanship for \na moment could be set aside for a review of the 1996 elections and our \ncampaign finance system; that this country, through the voices of this \nSenate, could have an honest conversation about the health of our \ndemocracy and the operations of our democratic elections. That will \nrequire a standard far different than illegal activities. It will have \nto be far more general in focus than the Presidential campaign of 1996. \nIt will require a conclusion at a date certain so that we can proceed \nto changes in the law, and it will require that, through the exercise \nof honest leadership, we begin the process of campaign finance reform, \neven as we learn new and troubling problems about the operation of the \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder, while my good friend from \nVirginia is on the floor, if he would comment on a statement which he \nmade yesterday and which the Senator from New Jersey made reference to \nindirectly, and that is the question as to whether or not the word \n``illegal'' is broader than the word ``criminal.''\n  Yesterday, the good chairman of the Rules Committee said the \nfollowing, and I am wondering if the Senator from New Jersey might also \nlisten to this, because it gets to the very critical point which was \nraised by his comments. The chairman of the Rules Committee said \nyesterday that the Rules Committee gave ``the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee a scope of the investigation and illegal,'' he said, \n``illegal is a very broad scope.'' He added, ``It goes beyond. And I \nwill at a later time today put in the Record the definitions of \nillegal.''\n  But this is now the key sentence from my good friend from Virginia: \n``But it goes beyond just criminal assertions of allegations of \ncriminal violations. It goes beyond that.''\n  That is at the bottom of page 2057.\n  The chairman of the Rules Committee is assuring the Senate that the \ndefinition of ``illegal'' goes beyond ``criminal,'' and that is in \nkeeping with, I think, a common understanding of the word ``illegal.''\n  I don't know whether the chairman put the definitions of ``illegal'' \ninto the Record. We were unable to find them.\n  So my first question of the chairman of the Rules Committee would be \nwhether or not those definitions have now been put into the Record.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we did discuss this in our hearing. We \ndiscussed it yesterday and essentially this is a matter that is going \nto be placed directly before the chairman, the distinguished ranking \nmember, my good friend from Ohio, Mr. Glenn, and the members of the \ncommittee.\n  I hope, in the context of their deliberations on what they define as \n``illegal,'' they will refer to traditional sources. I have here the \ndictionary definition of ``illegal,'' which I will read. We, of course, \nrecognize it as being an adjective. It means, ``not legal, contrary to \nexisting statutes, regulations, et cetera, unauthorized.''\n  Then I went to Black's Law Dictionary, which all of us had in law \nschool--at least I did. That is the first book I bought. As a matter of \nfact, I still have it. I really have coveted that little personal item. \nSo I went back and read in that, and I cite that. ``Illegal,'' \n``against or not authorized by law.'' ``Illegal contract,'' ``A \ncontract is illegal where its formation of performance is expressly \nforbidden by civil or criminal statute or where penalty is imposed for \ndoing an act agreed upon.''\n  So I say to my colleagues, there seems to be not what I would call a \ngreat wealth of debate. It is interesting we went back to examine court \nopinions. I would have thought in the history of our country someone \nwould have argued that, but I am not sure that anything we found in the \ncourse of our research shed a great deal of light. Perhaps my \ndistinguished colleague from Michigan, who is a student in many areas, \ncould refer to some source that he has broader than what the Senator \nfrom Virginia has provided this morning.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No. I am happy with that assurance from the Senator.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. In just a minute.\n  I am very glad to hear that assurance from the Senator, that the \nintention of this resolution which he offered, that ``illegal'' \nincludes violations of law, including civil law or other law, and goes \nbeyond violations of criminal law. That gets us a little bit further \ntowards what this committee ought to be doing. But nonetheless, it is \nan important clarification for the committee.\n  I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might just reply to my good friend.\n  There is documentation. I examined both of those precedents at the \ntime that I drafted the resolution.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is now working its will on the resolution \nthat was proposed by the Rules Committee. This body eventually will \nvote and decide the issue. But I suggest, with all due respect to my \ncolleague from Michigan and the distinguished chairman of the Committee \non Governmental Affairs, the ranking member, and others, that we are \nmaking sort of legislative history as to what we think is the meaning \nof the term ``illegal'' and what we think this committee should do.\n  I hope that that legislative history that we are making for ourselves \nas a body will be the guidepost for that committee and that they will \nnot continually be searching as to how to get around or evade what is \nthe will of the Senate. That will be expressed eventually through a \nseries of votes and the passage of some document in the form of a \nresolution. It is my hope that the resolution of the Rules Committee \nremains intact, but that is yet to be seen. So that will be the \nguidepost, the beacon.\n  I am confident that the chairman and the ranking member and the other \nmembers of that committee will in turn be guided by this very important \ndebate on the scope of the jurisdiction.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I want to thank the Senator from Michigan for raising \nthis issue because it appears to me we have come to the heart of the \nmatter.\n  The Senate has given conflicting interpretations that make all the \ndifference in the scope of these hearings\n\n[[Page S2103]]\n\npotentially. Senator Warner's views, as the author of the legislation, \nshould be controlling. But it is important to note that they are in \ndirect contradiction with testimony given to the Rules Committee by \nSenator Thompson.\n\n  Senator Thompson's interpretation of ``illegal'' is that they had to \nconstitute a criminal act. I am very reassured by Chairman Warner's \ninterpretation that ``illegal act'' would include a violation of a \ncivil code. I assume, therefore, that the Senate could conclude that a \nviolation of the campaign finance laws, even if it did not include a \ncriminal penalty, is included in Senator Warner's definition.\n  I am also seeking his reassurance, through the Senator from Michigan, \nthat a violation of the Tax Code, though perhaps not sufficiently \nwillful to involve a criminal penalty, would be an illegal act and, \ntherefore, part of the investigation.\n  Indeed, I am hoping that we can be reassured that any violation of \nthe regulations of the U.S. Government or any of its departments or \nagencies, any violation of the civil or criminal law, of which there is \nspecific information that is sufficiently credible to warrant the \nattention of the committee, would be the subject of these \ninvestigations--meaning, that it does not require that a member of the \ncommittee have definitive proof to establish a criminal level of \nculpability and it does not have to relate specifically to a criminal \npenalty for violation.\n  I was hoping to receive his assurance, as a member of both the Rules \nCommittee and the Governmental Affairs Committee, that if I come before \nthis committee with a specific act, based on a broad but credible \nallegation, for violation of code or regulation, that will be \nsufficient for the scope of this investigation.\n  Through the Senator from Michigan, that is the assurance that I am \nseeking.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at the present time I have stated my views \nas to the word ``illegal'' and its interpretation and its breadth. I \npredicated that interpretation carefully upon a dictionary definition \nas well as one citation from Black's Law Dictionary, which is somewhat \nbroader.\n  But I want to make certain that my distinguished colleague from New \nJersey pauses for a moment to go back and look at the Record as to \nexactly what Chairman Thompson said. And, if it is agreeable--I do not \nwant to interrupt the distinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. I read from page 74 of the transcript of the hearing of \nthe Rules Committee on March 6.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Jersey was speaking.\n\n       Senator Torricelli. Mr. Chairman, if I could just for a \n     moment--I do not want to delay the committee, but when the \n     hearing began, I expressed concern, Senator Thompson, that \n     the standard was being set extraordinarily high in order to \n     address any campaign abuses because of the ``illegal'' \n     language that is used.\n       Do I understand that when I was absent from the room for a \n     moment, in answer to Senator Ford's question, you have \n     equated ``illegal'' with ``criminal'' and that in your mind \n     they are relatively indistinguishable as the standard you are \n     going to use in deciding which campaign activities are within \n     our jurisdiction?\n\n  I will digress to go back to the colloquy with Senator Ford. I now \nread from page 65.\n\n       Senator Ford. Understand that. And we are used to that. But \n     am I correct that violations of Federal campaign laws are not \n     criminal?\n       Senator Thompson. Senator, I would rather not try to give \n     you a legal opinion off the top of my head.\n\n  Then the colloquy went on, in which Senator Thompson further said:\n\n       Well, my idea, campaign finance reform does not have much \n     to do with the statutory regulatory framework that you are \n     referring to.\n\n  So at that point it seems to me that Senator Thompson was not \ndefinitive on this issue.\n  Now I return to page 74 where the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey had posed the question, and I shall read Senator Thompson's \nreply:\n\n       Senator Thompson: Senator, I cannot say that in all \n     respects, in every situation, that they are exactly the same, \n     and I would rather not try to give you a precise legal \n     opinion that will stay with me for the rest of the year. I \n     think you are entitled to look into that if you want to do \n     that, certainly. The illegal standard has been used time and \n     time again with regard to other investigations. You allude to \n     the high standard. It just goes to show whose ox is being \n     gored, I suppose, in these matters, because I have been \n     spending a lot of time answering some of my colleagues' \n     questions about how can you subpoena somebody just on public \n     information. You are tying up their lives. They are having to \n     hire attorneys and all of that, and now others have a concern \n     that we are not, it is not easy enough to get to them. In \n     other words, the standard is too high. So those are all the \n     things that we are going to have to balance out, but I am not \n     sure that my top of the head legal opinion on the intricacies \n     on the difference between illegal and criminal are as good as \n     what you might be able to get from somebody who has got the \n     books in front of him and can look it up.\n\n  I believe that is somewhat different from what my distinguished \ncolleague said in his earlier comments as to the position taken by \nChairman Thompson.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. If the Senator from Michigan would yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. The discussion comes down to the phrase of Senator \nThompson, saying that criminal and illegal may not in every situation \nbe exactly the same.\n  For purposes of these hearings, if we were to do justice to what we \nwant to achieve, it needs to be established that they specifically are \nnot the same. It is not sufficient for the Senate to know that there \nmay be some circumstances where illegal does not mean criminal. The \npoint is illegal is not criminal. We seek civil jurisdiction, we seek \nviolations of regulations, and we seek here on the floor to \ndisassociate the two words.\n  I believe, for the record, the Senator from Virginia has done a great \ndeal in allaying my fears, and I think we have separated permanently, \nirrevocably the two words. For purposes of this investigation they are \nunrelated, they are unconnected and never the two shall meet again.\n  I think, therefore, this discussion has been helpful.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask the indulgence of my colleagues to \npose on behalf of the majority leader a unanimous consent.\n  On behalf of Leader Lott I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween now and 12:30 be equally divided for debate between Senator \nWarner and Senator Glenn, and further when the Senate reconvenes today \nat 2:15 there be an additional 15 minutes of debate equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees, and immediately following \nthat debate the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Lott \nAmendment No. 22, and no amendments be in order prior to the vote in \nrelation to amendment 22.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, are we under control time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Between now and 12:30 the time will be equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are under control starting now.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Can I ask the Senator from Ohio to yield 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the question that I put to the Senator from \nVirginia is very important in terms of the future of this \ninvestigation, and his answer reasserting today what he said yesterday, \nwhich is that the jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nwill go beyond criminal assertions and goes to civil violations of law \nas well as criminal violations of law, will help clarify a very \nimportant question for the committee down the road. I thank him for \nthat.\n\n  It leaves open a huge question as to whether we ought to be able to \nlook into improper practices, corrupt practices that are not \ntechnically violations of law, but nonetheless it is helpful, and I \nwant to thank my friend from Virginia for that. I want to get to this \nquestion next.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield on my time, I was very careful \nto say I was speaking for myself, and I used precise language from the \ndictionary and one legal reference. That decision as to the experience \nof illegal, again, is to be left to the combined judgment, hopefully, \nof all members of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and using as a \nprecedent that document that will be finally agreed upon by the U.S. \nSenate today or tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S2104]]\n\n  Now, that is the response that I gave very carefully.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator for that response, and I also point \nout that response comes from the chairman of the Rules Committee, who \nis a sponsor of the pending resolution. This Senate, I think, has a \nright to traditionally place great stock in the sponsors' \ninterpretation of his own resolution. That is precisely what I believe \nthe Senate will be doing when we vote, because even though we differ as \nto whether or not the scope should get to practices which should be \nmade illegal, practices which are offensive, or practices which violate \nwhat the public wants us to be doing, nonetheless the fact that the \nchairman of the Rules Committee is asserting to the Senate that the \nword illegal in his judgment and his intention as the drafter of this \nresolution goes to both--goes to any violation of law, not just a \ncriminal violation, is a very important statement for the Senate and \nfor the future of this investigation.\n  Following that statement, I ask my good friend from Virginia the \nfollowing: That under his interpretation, therefore, would the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee be able to investigate violations of the \nFederal Elections Campaign Act?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time I reserve the timing of my \nresponse to that question. I have very carefully laid down what I \nbelieve is the definition of illegal but I am not prepared at this time \nto give you a response to that question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would that be true with other specific questions?\n  So that what we will have when we vote will be the assurance of the \nchairman of the Rules Committee as to what his interpretation of the \nword illegal is in a general way but not a specific application.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  I hasten to point out while I am privileged to be the chairman, I am \nnot so sure the total weight of this debate would shift to what this \nSenator has to say.\n  I come back again, the Senate will work its will. This resolution \nthat I offered which is the underlying matter before the Senate could \nwell be amended. I hope not, but it could be. So I want to await the \nfinal decision of the Senate before I make any further comment as to \nwhat my response will be to the question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend.\n  I have a parliamentary inquiry. Under the pending amendment to the \namendment, the language in subsection (c) says that ``the Committee on \nRules and Administration, not the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \nhas jurisdiction under rule 25 over all proposed legislation and other \nmatters relating to--''\n  And then No. 2 is ``corrupt practices.''\n  Now, my parliamentary inquiry is this: Under Senate Resolution 54, \ndoes the Governmental Affairs Committee have jurisdiction as of this \nmoment to study and investigate corruption or unethical practices and \nimproper practices between Government personnel and corporations, \nindividuals, companies, et cetera?\n  As of this moment, my parliamentary inquiry is, under Senate \nResolution 54, does the Governmental Affairs Committee have \njurisdiction to investigate corruption, unethical practices, and any \nand all improper practices, as I previously read?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jurisdiction of a committee is set out by \nrule XXV. Neither this resolution or rule XXV can explicitly change or \nalter without an explicit change in language.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Governmental Affairs Committee, as of this \nmoment, have jurisdiction, as set forth in Senate Resolution 54, to \ninvestigate corruption, unethical practices, and any and all improper \npractices between Government personnel and corporations, individuals, \ncompanies, or persons affiliated therewith, doing business with the \nGovernment, et cetera? That is my parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Committees, historically, have investigated \nareas within their jurisdiction under rule XXV. The jurisdiction of a \ncommittee is normally based on what is referred to that committee and \nits jurisdiction.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My parliamentary inquiry is, Does Senate Resolution 54 \nrefer that subject to this Governmental Affairs Committee? That is my \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Matters are not referred by resolution. \nMatters are referred by the Presiding Officer of the Senate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, what we have here is, I believe, the first \ntime that the U.S. Senate is going to remove from a committee of \njurisdiction its right to investigate something that has been within \nits jurisdiction traditionally, as has corruption and improper \npractices. They have been looked into by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee over the decades. They are specifically referred, in Senate \nResolution 54, to the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  I don't think there is any doubt in anybody's mind--and I will ask \nthe question again--that the Governmental Affairs Committee has \njurisdiction to investigate improper practices. Now, that doesn't mean \nthe Rules Committee doesn't have jurisdiction to legislate. It does. \nBut it means that the committee of jurisdiction--this is one of the \ngreat investigatory committees of this body, traditionally, which has \nlooked into illegal practices, and legal practices which should be made \nillegal--is being taken off the case, is being told that what is within \nits jurisdiction cannot be investigated, even though the unanimous vote \nof the Governmental Affairs Committee was to investigate improper \npractices.\n  There is no doubt, I don't think, in anybody's mind that we have that \njurisdiction, which is the reason why this amendment is before us, \nwhich is to remove the jurisdiction of the committee into improper and \ncorrupt practices with respect to the 1996 Federal elections. That is \nwhat we will be voting on today--whether or not the U.S. Senate wants \nto take that power away from a committee that has jurisdiction to look \ninto and investigate improper and corrupt practices. It is \nunprecedented.\n  Now, does the Rules Committee have legislative jurisdiction? Yes. But \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee has investigative jurisdiction. I \ndon't think anybody doubts that we have investigative jurisdiction, \nshould we seek to exercise it and look into improper and corrupt \npractices. I haven't heard anybody allege that. As a matter of fact, \nthe reason the amendment is pending before us is to remove that \njurisdiction from us when it comes to campaign finance reform. I wonder \nif the Senator from Ohio would yield 3 additional minutes to me.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield such time as the Senator from Michigan may desire.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This is an unprecedented removal of jurisdiction from a \nSenate committee that is seeking to exercise what is within its \njurisdiction by Senate rule, by Senate resolution--Senate Resolution \n54--which specifically refers to improper and corrupt practices, and by \nprecedent.\n\n  Now, why are we doing this? Why is the majority about to tell a \ncommittee that has jurisdiction to investigate that it may not do so? \nThe answer is, the fear that there will be momentum given to campaign \nfinance reform. That is the issue. It is that fear that so terrorizes, \napparently, some in the majority of this body that if there is an \ninvestigation carried out by the Governmental Affairs Committee, which \nit now has jurisdiction to carry out, it will somehow or other give \nmomentum to something which, apparently, a majority of the majority \ndoes not want.\n  But this is unprecedented, and we are skating now out on a pond which \nthis Senate, I don't believe, has done before. I have heard my good \nfriend from Virginia say, ``Well, there is no legislative authority in \nGovernmental Affairs in the area of campaign finance reform.'' That's \ntrue. But we have investigative authority. There is no authority in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to get involved in recommending changes \nin the criminal law. We don't have jurisdiction to legislate in the \narea of the criminal law, generally. That is in the area of the \nJudiciary Committee. Yet, we are left with the jurisdiction here to \ninvestigate illegal activities, even though we don't have legislative \njurisdiction, for the most part, in the area of criminal law.\n  Where is the logic here? We are told you can't legislate in the area \nof campaign finance reform. Therefore, we are not going to let you \ninvestigate, even\n\n[[Page S2105]]\n\nthough you otherwise would have jurisdiction to do so.\n  (Mr. INHOFE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will entertain a comment, \nwhich I hope is constructive and helpful to my good friend and \ncolleague, you are talking about the actual Rules Committee as if we \njust took everything away from them. Let's go back and take a moment to \nsee exactly what happened, because I know, having worked these 18 years \nwith my good friend--this is on my time--that he deals in precision. We \nhave served together side by side these many years on the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  Now, let me walk my colleague through exactly what happened. First, \nwe have the Standing Rules of the Senate, which defines the basic \nparameters of the authority of the Governmental Affairs Committee. Each \nyear, Mr. President--and it is rather interesting--the chairman of \nGovernmental Affairs comes to the Rules Committee with a twofold \nrequest: first, for a sum of money to operate the committee for the \ncoming fiscal year, and then a request to enlarge the jurisdiction as \nset forth in the Standing Rules of the Senate. That was done this year. \nI hasten to point out to my good friend----\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, can I get into this for a minute? I don't \nthink we accepted the enlargement of it. It was more to carry it out \nthan to enlarge it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I disagree with my distinguished colleague \nand ranking member. I would like to engage him in the colloquy at the \nproper time. I want to refer to Senate Resolution 54, which was passed \nby this body upon the recommendation of the chairman and ranking member \nof the Rules Committee. All I have to say to my good friend from \nKentucky--and we welcome him back this morning----\n  Mr. FORD. You went back to the rules.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Rules Committee issued Senate Resolution 54, which \nwas voted on by the Senate.\n  Any reading of Senate Resolution 54 shows a considerable broadening \nand enlargement beyond the scope of the authority vested in that \ncommittee under the Standing Rules of the Senate. That is my point. And \nit is, I say to my friend from Kentucky and my friend from Michigan, an \nenlargement. Let me read the language as recommended by the chairman \nand presumably the ranking member and the Rules Committee accepted it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator would tell us what he is reading \nfrom.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. I am reading from Senate Resolution 54 which is that \ndocument voted on in the Senate to give $4.53 million to the committee \nto conduct its affairs, and this is the language of the charter.\n  Mr. LEVIN. On page 16?\n  Mr. WARNER. Page 18 of Senate Resolution 54. I will pause for a \nmoment until my colleague has it. Section (d)(1).\n\n       The committee or any duly authorized subcommittee thereof \n     is authorized to study or investigate--\n       (A) The efficiency and economy of operations of all \n     branches of the Government including the possible existence \n     of fraud, misfeasance, malfeasance, collusion, mismanagement, \n     incompetence, corruption, or unethical practices, waste, \n     extravagance, conflicts of interest, and the improper \n     expenditure of Government funds in transactions, contracts, \n     and activities of the Government or of Government officials \n     and employees and any and all such improper practices between \n     Government personnel and corporations, individuals, \n     companies, or persons affiliated therewith, doing business \n     with the Government; and the compliance or noncompliance of \n     such corporations, companies, or individuals or other \n     entities with the rules, regulations, and laws governing the \n     various governmental agencies and its relationships with the \n     public.\n\n  That is your language. It is broad. It includes the word \n``corruption,'' which is not in the standing rules for the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, which is, Mr. President, of course, in the standing \nrules for the Rules Committee.\n  So the Senator made the statement that we had taken it all away.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senate Resolution 54 now is governing.\n  Mr. WARNER. Senate Resolution 54 governs the expenditure of $4.53 \nmillion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator agrees with me.\n  Mr. WARNER. Beg pardon?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senate Resolution 54 is what is currently in effect.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. What is in effect gives the Governmental Affairs Committee \nthe power to look at corrupt practices, just as I read--I read from the \nexact same Senate Resolution that the good Senator from Virginia read \nthat we have jurisdiction in Governmental Affairs to look at \ncorruption, unethical practices, and improper practices. That is what \nis in effect now and that is what would be changed by the pending \nresolution before us.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, what the Senator said, as I understood him \nto say, we took away all your jurisdiction. That is not correct. As to \nthe $4.53 million, it is there. As to the second allocation of funds in \nthe nature of a supplemental, it is quite true the Rules Committee laid \ndown in the resolution a more precise definition as to what you do with \nthe second allocation of funding and that is restricted to illegal \nactivities in the 1996 campaigns, Presidential and congressional. But \nthe Senator made the statement that it took it all away. I am pointing \nout the distinction. No, no, it relates to the second allocation of \nfunding.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the Senator from Virginia saying today that relative to \nthe allocation of funds in Senate Resolution 54, the committee is then \nfree to look at improper practices in the area of campaign financing? \nIs that what the Senator is saying today? Because I thought I heard \nsomething different.\n  Mr. WARNER. What I am saying is the language sets forth the \ndefinition, and it is up to the chairman and ranking member and the \nGovernmental Affairs members to decide for themselves.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My question--\n  Mr. WARNER. What I am saying for great clarity, for the second \nallocation, supplemental funding, the Rules Committee exercised what I \nregard as its authority to restrict the use of those funds to the \nclause ``illegal'' for 1996.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is my friend, however, saying as to the original \nallocation of funds that the committee may exercise jurisdiction to \nlook into improper practices or practices which should be made illegal? \nIs that what my friend from Virginia is saying?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my response to that question is that the \nuse of the first allocation of funds pursuant to this resolution is \nlimited to this, and it is up to the Members to interpret it. And, \nsecond, it would be my hope that the members would interpret this \nlanguage in accordance with whatever resolution is finally passed by \nthe Senate today because I view that as an expression by the Senate as \nto what the scope should be of activities of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee with regard to both the underlying $4.53 million and the \nadditional funds.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to be real clear at this point. What the Senator, \nthe chairman of the Rules Committee, is telling us is that technically \nwe can spend the first pot of money as we determine to do so within our \njurisdiction and within Senate Resolution 54, but as to the \nsupplemental funds, that would be governed by the pending amendment, if \nit passes. Is that correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. Not necessarily the pending amendment. The ultimate \nresolution passed by the Senate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Ultimate resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. I simply say, going back to the underlying rules of the \nSenate, it was enlarged in Senate Resolution 54. You can decide for \nyourself, but I hope you will decide within the framework of this \ndebate and the ultimate resolution, which resolution applies to the \nsecond allocation of funds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, then if I could conclude, let me reiterate \nwhat I said as I think it is still accurate. If we adopt this \nresolution today, we will be removing from the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee a jurisdiction which it now has to investigate corrupt \npractices, improper practices, practices which should be made illegal, \npractices which we could investigate within the Senate Resolution 54 \njurisdiction of our committee--the current jurisdiction of our \ncommittee would allow us to look at improper practices, but what the \npending resolution tells us, if it is adopted and becomes the final \nexpression of this body's will, what the pending resolution tells us is \nGovernmental Affairs, with this special fund which we are providing you \nto look into the 1996\n\n[[Page S2106]]\n\nelection, you may not do what you otherwise can. You may not look into \nimproper practices with this fund, although you could normally look \ninto improper practices with the funds that we provide to you.\n  Now, why the difference? Why are we told when it comes to look at the \n1996 election that we cannot exercise the same jurisdiction, look into \nthe same type of practices, corrupt, improper practices that have an \nodor, why are we being told we cannot do that with the funds that are \ngiven to us specially to look into the 1996 election?\n  The answer is very obvious. The answer is that there is a fear on the \npart of a majority of the majority that such an investigation will get \ninto the area of soft money, which is legal--part of it we believe is \nillegal, but most of it is probably legal. And so we are being told \nthat with this sum of money being given specially to look at the 1996 \nelection, we cannot look at what is legal in the area of soft money, \neven though it has an odor to it, even though its purpose is to evade \nthe current law, even though it allows corporations to give millions of \ndollars to campaigns when the clear purpose of current law is that \ncorporations not give money to candidates in elections.\n  That is the purpose of the pending amendment from the Rules \nCommittee. We should have no doubt about what its purpose is. It is to \nrestrict the investigation so that the Governmental Affairs Committee \ncannot do with this money that is given to us to look into the 1996 \nelections, cannot do what we have traditionally done with all other \nfunds given to the Governmental Affairs Committee, which is to look \ninto improper practices or unethical practices or practices which \nshould be made illegal.\n  We are told that with this funding that we are being given to look \ninto the 1996 election, that we cannot do what we could do with the \nfunds that were given to us under Senate Resolution 54, and which have \ntraditionally been part of the jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee.\n  I am going to close by reading this resolution language again because \nit is so important. Senate Resolution 54 is what gives the Governmental \nAffairs Committee its mandate. It is now the law. It is what is in \nplace. It is what we are operating under in Governmental Affairs. And \nSenate Resolution 54 says, on page 16 and 17 that:\n\n       The committee, or any duly authorized subcommittee thereof, \n     is authorized to * * * investigate--* * * corruption * * * \n     unethical practices * * * and any and all such improper \n     practices between Government personnel and corporations, \n     individuals, companies, or persons affiliated therewith, \n     doing business with the Government* * *.\n  That authority given to us in Senate Resolution 54 to look into \ncorruption and unethical practices and improper practices, we will not \nbe allowed to exercise when it comes to the use of this special fund \nthat is given to us for the purpose of looking into the 1996 elections.\n  The argument technically is: But you don't have legislative authority \nin campaign finance reform. That is true. We don't have legislative \nauthority to amend the criminal laws either, but we are allowed to look \ninto illegal practices. There is utterly no logic in this.\n  The argument which was used to restrict this funding to illegal \npractices was: Governmental Affairs doesn't have legislative \nauthority--which is true--to legislate in the area of campaign finance \nreform. But we do not have legislative authority to legislate relative \nto illegal practices either, but we are allowed, in fact we are \nrestricted, in terms of our investigation, to the area of illegal \npractices. So the logic for this restriction is not there. What is \nthere, and I think a number of Members of the majority have been very \nopen about this, is that they do not want us to give any momentum to \nthe reform movement in the area of campaign finance. And the fear is \nthere, that if the Governmental Affairs Committee investigates within \nthe area of its traditional jurisdiction, improper practices, unethical \npractices, and corruption as we have in Senate Resolution 54--if we do \nthat, the fear is that we will somehow or other give a boost to \ncampaign finance reform. And to that I say: Amen, it is long overdue.\n  And what is unprecedented, unprecedented, is the restriction of a \nfund to prevent a committee from looking into an area which it has \ntraditionally looked into. That is what is unprecedented. It is \nsomething which the public, I believe, will totally disagree with. I \nbelieve this institution will regret doing it, because it sets a \nprecedent for this institution which is not a wise precedent. And I do \nnot think it will withstand the scrutiny, either of the public or of \nthe media.\n  What we are left with will be this. If this resolution passes in the \nform that it is now in from the Rules Committee, or something like it, \nwe will then be limited to illegal, which I am happy to hear, at least \nin the opinion of the chairman of the Rules Committee, includes both \ncivil as well as criminal illegality. And I presume we will do the best \nthat we can with that. But we all ought to realize that what is off the \ntable, as far as this investigation is concerned, by Governmental \nAffairs Committee--what has been removed, taken away from us, \nrestricted, is the bright light of day into what is currently legal but \nwhich should be, at least arguably, made illegal.\n\n  I thank the Chair and I also thank my friend from Virginia. As \nalways, he has shown great courtesy in terms of attempting to respond \nto inquiries on the floor, and to helping this institution work its way \nthrough some very difficult issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. But just before he \ndeparts, I hope he would recognize that, while he uses the phrase \n``taken it off the table,'' it is the jurisdiction of the Rules \nCommittee. And I hope that you, as a colleague, will give us the \nbenefit of the doubt, that the Rules Committee will diligently--\ncertainly speaking for myself, and I think for many members of that \ncommittee, if not all--will diligently pursue the issues that are of \ngreat importance. I share your concern over the importance of both \nindependent expenditures and soft money. The phrase ``soft money'' must \nbe terribly complex to the American public. What is soft money? I guess \nwe are going to get a tight definition of that at some point. But we \nwill pursue it with diligence. And I hope you acknowledge that fact.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank him for that. Soft money is most of the money that \nis out there. It is the unregulated money. It is the millions.\n  As it turns out, under the current definition, if I could just ask my \ngood friend to yield for 1 more minute, under the current definition by \nthe Attorney General and Boyden Gray--who was the counsel for President \nBush, they both agree on this--I cannot use my phone, even a cell \nphone, at my own expense in my office, to solicit a contribution to my \ncampaign for $100. I cannot do that, even using my own cell phone in my \noffice. But I can use my Government phone to solicit $1 million for the \nDemocratic National Committee, right from my office. That is the \ncurrent state of the law. That is the soft money ``exception,'' which \nis really the rule, because it is most of the money which is now \nreceived.\n  But to answer my friend's question, I was very careful saying what is \noff the table, as far as the Governmental Affairs Committee \ninvestigation is concerned, if this resolution is adopted in its \ncurrent form, will be the investigation into what is currently legal in \nthe area of soft money, independent expenditures. I did not comment on \nwhat the Rules Committee might or might not do, and that is going to be \nin the good judgment of the Rules Committee and its chairman and \nranking member.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I hope the Senator will give us the \nbenefit of the doubt that we as Senators will pursue that with equal \nvigor.\n  I thank my colleague. It was a very profitable exchange.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee, I am naturally interested in this debate over Senate \nResolution 39--a funding resolution for the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee special investigation, as amended by the Senate Rules \nCommittee. I object to the action taken by the Rules Committee on \nThursday that forces the Governmental Affairs Committee to limit its \ninvestigation solely to illegal activities related to the 1996 \nelections.\n  I object because the Governmental Affairs Committee had a bipartisan \nagreement on a broad scope for this fundraising investigation. However, \nin\n\n[[Page S2107]]\n\nan effort to appease those opposed to reforming our campaign finance \nlaws, the Rules Committee overrode the agreement unanimously adopted by \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee on January 30, 1997. The scope of \nthe investigation is now so narrow that we are being forced to operate \nwith blinders. If a fundraising activity is improper--we cannot look at \nit. If the activity occurred prior to 1996--we cannot look at it. If \nthe activity involves soft money or questionable use of tax-exempt \norganizations--we cannot look at that, unless it is clearly illegal.\n  The Rules Committee resolution narrows the definition of illegal so \nthat the Governmental Affairs Committee would have to show evidence of \ncriminal activity beyond a reasonable doubt before an activity or \nindividual can be investigated. Is there anyone who does not believe \nthat there are some serious allegations that are improper rather than \nillegal? How can we legislate changes in our campaign finance laws if \nwe cannot look into activities that are not currently illegal, but \nshould be illegal?\n  Mr. President, I am proud to be a member of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee because it is one committee that continually operates in a \nbipartisan and fair manner. We hammered out the scope of our \ninvestigation over a period of several days and it received support \nfrom Democrats and Republicans alike.\n  Last Friday, I participated in a press conference called by the \nranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Mr. Glenn, to \nexpress concern with the newly amended funding resolution that came out \nof the Rules Committee. At that news conference, I said that the \ncommittee had taken the high ground by unanimously agreeing to a \nresolution setting forth the scope of its investigation.\n  Back on January 30, 1997, the committee agreed on a number of issues \nrelating to illegal or improper fundraising and spending practices \nwhich would lead to a consensus of how to best consider the issues at \nhand. Regretfully, since the adoption of that agreement, there has been \ndiscord, insinuations, accusations, and other obstacles to resolving \nthe impasse over the committee's special investigatory funding.\n  I object to the revision of the scope previously agreed upon by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee because past investigations into \nallegations of misconduct examined improper and unethical conduct as \nwell as illegal conduct. Moreover, if the funding resolution before us \ntoday is adopted, we will limit the scope of the investigation to only \nthe 1996 election cycle, thereby eliminating the possibility of looking \ninto the issue of soft money, issue advocacy, and possible illegal use \nof tax-exempt organizations.\n  Under the amended resolution, the Governmental Affairs Committee \ninvestigation would be precluded from investigating allegations that \nmay be embarrassing to Congress, and potential problems related to \nindividual members would be referred to the Senate Ethics Committee. I \nknow that most Members of Congress are honest; however, if our \ncitizenry believes that money buys access, then we must look into \nallegations that point to improper use of office.\n  The statement of purpose of the Governmental Affairs special \ninvestigation, as amended by the Rules Committee last Thursday, \nauthorizes funds for ``the sole purpose of conducting an investigation \nof illegal activities in connection with 1996 Federal election \ncampaigns.'' We have been told that the scope agreed to in the \nresolution before us was patterned after the Watergate resolution. \nHowever, the omission of two key words from that original Watergate \nresolution--unethical and improper--will undermine any investigation \ninto the influence of money on Federal elections.\n  Mr. President, I shall not belabor this issue as I know there are \nother Members who wish to speak. I want to reiterate, however, that the \nscope agreed to on January 30, 1997, was very inclusive--it would \nprovide for an investigation into the business of fundraising by both \nparties. The purpose of our inquiry was to examine all aspects of \ncampaign fundraising--both Presidential and congressional--with the \neventual outcome to be substantive and effective campaign finance \nreform legislation. I fear that without ensuring that improper \nfundraising practices are included in the investigation that this may \nnever come about. We cannot deny the public a full and thorough inquiry \ninto allegations that may eventually lead to tough campaign finance \nlaws.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Chair kindly advise the Senator \nfrom Virginia and the Senator from Ohio as to the remainder of the \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 10 minutes, 14 \nseconds; the Senator from Ohio, 3 minutes and 17 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bond pertaining to the introduction of S. 419 are \nlocated in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I offer my sincere appreciation to my \ndistinguished friend, the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am happy to do it. It is a very \nimportant matter, and I was quite interested in what the Senator from \nMissouri had to say.\n  The Senator from Virginia yields back such time as he has remaining, \nand I understand my colleague from Ohio will have further remarks, at \nthe conclusion of which we will stand in recess until the reconvening \nhour of 2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, this debate comes down to a simple choice: \nYou are in favor of campaign finance reform or you are opposed to \ncampaign finance reform, and that is what the argument is all about. I \nbelieve both sides of the aisle want to correct things as far as \nillegalities are concerned, I don't have any question of that. But the \nother area that is so big is the area of independent expenditures, soft \nmoney and all the other practices that grew up and came to a peak in \nthe 1996 election.\n  There was no doubt that the public was demanding that we look into \nthis, and there were various committees that wanted a part of that \nactivity. There was the Commerce Committee, Judiciary Committee, \nForeign Relations Committee, Rules Committee, and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. The Republican leadership decided to talk the other \ncommittees into not exercising their jurisdictions they normally would \nhave in this area and assign that to the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, which has the broadest investigative authority on Capitol \nHill.\n  My friend, the Senator from Virginia, read into the Record a little \nwhile ago the Governmental Affairs Committee's jurisdiction out of \nSenate Resolution 54, which details what we are to look into with the \nmoney that comes out and we are given each year. It involves the whole \ngamut of anything to do with the Federal Government in any way, shape, \nor form, any type of corruption, anything we want to look into on that. \nWe have exercised that jurisdiction through the years.\n  It was assigned to the committee. Senator Thompson, chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, and I worked out an agreement on what \nthe scope of this investigation would be. We didn't have agreement on \nthe money yet or some other things like that, but we at least had the \n$1.8 million we agreed to. Today, we are going up to the $4.5 million \nthat was stated, but we object strongly to cutting back on our normal \njurisdiction of what we can look into.\n  Why is this being cut back? Because a few members on the Rules \nCommittee that has to pass on our additional money for investigative \nactivity over and above our normal committee budget dug in their heels, \nthe people who are publicly outspoken against any campaign finance \nreform, and they are the ones who, on the Rules Committee, were able to \nstop that type funding, unless they got an agreement, unless a deal was \ncut.\n  So a deal was cut that we would not be able to look into any of the \nthings involved that we wanted to look into with regard to soft money \nand independent expenditures with regard to Capitol Hill, with regard \nto congressional campaigns, Senate or the House. They were dead set \nagainst that. They didn't want that looked into. The reason, I guess, \nis because Republicans\n\n[[Page S2108]]\n\noutdo the Democrats about 2 to 1 in this fundraising area and \nparticularly in the area of soft money. It was crucial, as we see it, a \ncouple of years ago in changing the majority in the Senate, because \nmoney is the mother's milk of politics. It is really what has more \nimpact than anything else. So they objected to any changes or to any \ninvestigation in those areas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GLENN. I ask unanimous consent to finish my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, they wanted to cut out any investigation of \nCapitol Hill. That is the reason we came to this situation. It was not \nthat most Members don't want to correct campaign finance reform on our \nside. We asked for campaign finance reform legislation to be brought to \nthe floor all this year. We would like to see the McCain-Feingold \nproposal voted on.\n  But regardless of that, we think that an airing of everything to do \nwith what happened in campaign financing over the past several \nelections, really, as this has built up to a crescendo that just \ninundated us in 1996, we think that should be looked into to lay the \nbase for real campaign finance reform and give us that kind of \neducational base.\n  What happened? Those who were against this got a deal cut, and \ninstead, all the things we were going to look into which was submitted \nas the original part of Senate Resolution 39 from the Governmental \nAffairs Committee to the Rules Committee for approval were all struck, \nthe total language, and the additional funds in the last part of this \nthat are operable in Senate Resolution 39 as brought to the floor state \nthat funds can only be used for the sole purpose of conducting an \ninvestigation of illegal activities. That takes out all those other \nareas of soft money that we wanted to look into.\n  The amendment I proposed would restore the scope of the \ninvestigation, as the chairman and I and as all members of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, including those who are on the Rules \nCommittee, voted out of committee. They voted for these things to go \ninto this type of scope. They did not disagree with it then. But as \npart of the deal that was cut then, that kind of scope was taken away \nfrom us. Now I would propose, with my amendment, to restore that.\n\n  What has happened this morning is now the majority leader has \nproposed an amendment to my amendment, a second-degree amendment in the \nnature of a substitute, that would again say that ``the Committee on \nRules and Administration, not the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \nhas jurisdiction under rule 25 over all proposed legislation and other \nmatters relating to--(1) Federal elections generally * * * [and] (2) \ncorrupt practices * * * [and] the Committee on Governmental Affairs \nshall refer to the Committee on Rules and Administration any evidence \nof activities * * * [that] are not illegal but which may require \ninvestigation * * *'' In other words, this takes us back where we were. \nIt second-degrees my amendment and takes us back to the intent of \nSenate Resolution 39, which cut back the authority on the committee.\n  There has been a good discussion of this this morning. But to my way \nof thinking, this boils down, very, very simply, to one area. And one \nthing that is correct is, it is a choice. Do we want campaign finance \nreform or do we not?\n  We want the broadest possible investigation so we can come out with \ngood campaign finance reform that I think will be follow on to McCain-\nFeingold if we are ever able to get it to a vote. On the other side, \nthey do not want any investigation in this area and are opposed to \ncampaign finance reform. That is the bottom-line choice we are talking \nabout here.\n  I will end with that because my good friend from Virginia has been \nvery kind in granting me extra time here. I have run over several \nminutes, I know. I thank him very much.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  I would have to say to my good friend and colleague, we will have \nmore debate on this as the day goes on and perhaps tomorrow. Hopefully, \nwe can finish tonight, but I will be ready to take the floor tomorrow \nagain.\n  Mr. President, he misstates the case. This Senator is for campaign \nfinance reform of some measure. I am not able to give the parameters in \ntotality now. The distinguished majority leader sat here and opened \nthis debate this morning indicating what is taking place. He, together \nwith Senator Nickles, is conducting a task force on this side of the \naisle which meets on a regular basis to examine those provisions, \nwhich, hopefully, we will insert at some point in time in a bill which \nis clearly campaign finance reform. So, I have to strongly disagree \nwith my good friend and colleague on that point.\n  Now, Mr. President, we shall stand in recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2096-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the absence of anyone on this side of \nthe aisle, I suggest a quorum be reinstated and that the time not be \ncounted against either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreements\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have a unanimous consent process that we \nwill go through here that would allow for the withdrawal of the pending \nsecond-degree amendment and the offering of a new amendment. We are \nvery close to an agreement on not only this procedure, but a number of \nother aspects of how we will deal with this pending resolution this \nafternoon.\n  We would like to get this consent agreed to, and then we will take a \nfew minutes more to make sure everybody understands exactly what we are \nproposing to agree to, and we will come back and go through that \nprocess. It could lead to our having perhaps just one more recorded \nvote and final passage. But we want to make sure everybody understands \nand is comfortable with what we are doing to the maximum degree \npossible.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, notwithstanding the consent \nagreement, that it be in order for me to withdraw amendment No. 22 in \norder to offer a separate amendment, and the amendment be in order \nnotwithstanding the fact that it hits the resolution in more than one \nplace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nGlenn amendment be laid aside in order for me to offer an amendment, \nand no further amendments be in order prior to the vote on or in \nrelation to my amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nwhether that is intended to preclude any further amendments on the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. At this point it is just no further amendments in order to \nmy amendment. We are discussing the possibility of an agreement that \nwould not provide for additional amendments, but we have not reached a \nfinal agreement on that at this point. So we would have to just talk \nthat through with you and\n\n[[Page S2109]]\n\nother Senators and make sure everybody understands and agrees before we \nenter that next request. But it is not applicable here.\n  Mr. SPECTER. As long as this unanimous consent request is not \nprecluding further amendments to the resolution, I do not object.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I only do so for purposes \nof clarification.\n  I think what the majority leader is proposing here goes a long way to \nresolving one of the issues that divided Democrats and Republicans. \nFirst, I commend him and commend those responsible for offering this \namendment.\n  What this would do is to add the word ``improper'' at the appropriate \nplaces within the authorization to allow us to look at both improper \nand illegal activity. So, as I say, this goes a long way to resolving \nthe conflict that we have discussed now for some time and that was the \nsubject of debate this morning. So this moves this process along. I \nwould certainly urge all of my colleagues to agree to this unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments. I \nmight say, just for further clarification, it would add to ``illegal'' \nthe words ``and improper.'' The Glenn amendment of course has a number \nof descriptions. We are working on a discussion here of how that might \nbe handled in a colloquy here today. But this would just add the words \n``and improper'' at the appropriate places in the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further objection in regard to this \nrequest? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask unanimous consent that following the \ndisposition of the Lott amendment, the Senate resume the Glenn \namendment No. 21, and no amendments be in order prior to the vote on or \nin relation to the Glenn amendment No. 21 and he be permitted to \nwithdraw his amendment if he chooses after our discussions take place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 23\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I now send my amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], for himself, Mr. \n     Thompson, and Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment numbered 23.\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, when the 94th Congress convened in January \n1975, I was 93d in Senate seniority. When the 105th Congress convened \nthis past January, I was 12th. What a difference 22 years make.\n  My 22 years of service to the people of Kentucky, as their U.S. \nSenator, has been during a remarkable period in history. We have \nwitnessed the end of the cold war and the fall of the Berlin Wall. We \nhave witnessed a technological boom that was unthinkable 22 years ago \nand we've witnessed the growth of democracy in practically every \nunderdeveloped nation in the world.\n  We have also seen the cost of a college education skyrocket. We have \nseen the cost of medical care skyrocket. And last but not least, we've \nseen the cost of a political campaign skyrocket.\n  The average cost of a U.S. Senate race in 1974, the first year I ran, \nwas less than $450,000. In fact, $437,482. The average cost of a Senate \nrace last year was approximately $4.5 million. There is no job, \nespecially the job of public servant, that is worth or deserves the \neffort necessary to raise and spend that much money.\n  The job of being a U.S. Senator today has unfortunately become a job \nof raising money to be reelected instead of a job doing the people's \nbusiness. Traveling to New York, California, Texas, or basically any \nState in the country, weekend after weekend, for the next 2 years is \nwhat candidates must do if they hope to raise the money necessary to \ncompete in a senatorial election.\n  Democracy as we know it will be lost if we continue to allow \ngovernment to become one bought by the highest bidder, for the highest \nbidder. Candidates will simply become bit players and pawns in a \ncampaign managed and manipulated by paid consultants and hired guns.\n  Because of the political money chase, Washington, DC is fast becoming \nthe center of our lives, not our people back home. The money chase has \ngot to stop. We must reform the system so that ordinary, everyday \npeople, who want to run for political office and make our country a \nbetter place are able to do so.\n  I have spent a good part of my Senate career and political life \nworking to nudge and, occasionally shove our party back toward the \ncenter of the political road. I came to Washington as a moderate \nDemocrat, believing then as I still do, that the will of the people \ncomes first. I've tried to be a moderate voice and will continue to do \nso. I love our country too much to let the extremists ram their agenda \ndown our throats.\n  There are many challenges facing the Senate and our party as we march \ninto the next millennium. More than ever, I want to be involved in \naddressing some of them.\n  I am not in the business to get my name in lights or to appear on the \nnational TV talk shows or make headlines in the national newspapers. My \nphilosophy has always been and will continue to be keep a low profile, \nwork behind the scenes with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nand come up with a solution that benefits everyone. Compromise is not a \ndirty word. I plan on working this way in the months ahead.\n  Now of a more immediate and personal concern. Do I run again for \nanother term in 1998? My health is good, my mind is sharp, and I enjoy \nwhat I do as much as life itself. However, because my mind is sharp, it \nis quick to remind me that I am 72 years old and I will be 74 in \nNovember of 1998. The good Lord has a plan for every one of us, even \nme. My heart says that my love affair with the people of Kentucky is \nnot over. My head says it has been a long ride and a good ride but now \nit is time to pass the reins on to a younger generation.\n  Today I will lead with my head and not my heart. So the time has come \nfor me to announce that I will not be a candidate for reelection in \n1998.\n  As you try to understand my decision, let me ask you to do something \nfor me, if you will. Don't say that I'm ready to go because I'm not \nand, frankly, I never will be. I still get goose bumps every time I \nlook up at the Capitol dome on my way to and from work.\n  You can say that my reelection campaign would be my most expensive \nrace\n\n[[Page S2110]]\n\never. I do not relish--in fact, I detest--the idea of having to raise \n$5 million for a job that pays $133,000 a year. To reach that mark, I \nwould have to raise $100,000 a week, starting today, for the next year.\n  Please don't say that my time has passed and I should be put out to \npasture, because I don't believe that it has. The political philosophy \nthat I embrace is just as relevant today as it was when I first entered \npublic life 30 years ago. It is a philosophy centered on the fact that \nmost Kentuckians cherish personal freedom more than either a liberal \nagenda or a competing conservative agenda that just uses Government in \na different way to promote its goals.\n  I thank the people of Kentucky from the bottom of my heart for giving \nme the chance to be their voice for these four-plus terms here in the \nU.S. Senate. I have been blessed with good friends and dedicated \nsupporters all around my State, who have been there time and time again \nwhen I have called for their help.\n  No one serves the people alone. He or she must have a good, bright, \nhard-working staff for support. I have been blessed with an abundance \nof such a staff. They have proven themselves more than capable of \nhandling any situation thrown at them. Their unequaled loyalty and \ntotal devotion to their work, especially in handling constituent \nservices, both in my district offices and here in Washington, is proven \ntime and time again. My staff is simply the best, as the thousands of \nconstituents who have used them will attest.\n  In announcing last month that he would not run again, my good friend \nand colleague, John Glenn, put it in perspective when he said, ``There \nstill is no cure for the common birthday.'' I believe that 100 percent, \nand I want to leave here knowing that I have a lot more birthdays to \ncelebrate with my family.\n  Now, speaking of family, no one--and I repeat, no one--could ask for \na more supportive and loving family than mine. My wife, Jean, has been \nmy anchor for over 50 years. My children, Shirley and Steve, have had \nto grow up with an absentee father a lot of the time. But they know in \ntheir hearts how much I love them. I plan on helping them in the years \nto come the way they have been there for me all these many years. As \nfor my grandchildren, I can't wait to spend more time with them and, \nhopefully, learn a thing or two from them. I'll finally have the time \nto dote on them and spoil them the way a grandfather is supposed to do.\n  Mr. President, let me close by reading the last paragraph from a poem \nentitled ``A Year,'' which I have carried with me for many, many years. \nMy son had it right when he wrote this back during his sophomore year \nat Frankfort High School. He is now married and has three lovely sons \nand, still, he had it right much earlier than I thought he did. This is \nthe last of four paragraphs, referring to the seasons:\n\n       Another year has passed,\n       the days not slow or fast,\n       Burned deep within our brain,\n       its memories will ever remain,\n       And although you look back and stood,\n       wishing there had been more good,\n       No one can change the seasons,\n       'cept God, and he's had no reason.\n\n  I thank the Chair for giving me this time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for \nabout 4 minutes in reference to the speech we just heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to my good friend from \nKentucky, who has been my good friend from the time we first met as \nnewly elected Members of the class of 1974. We came here together, and \nI can honestly say, Mr. President, that I have looked to Senator Ford \nfor guidance on every issue since then. I came from a small county \noffice, and he came from being Governor of a State much larger than \nVermont ever has been or ever will be.\n  I remember debates we had when we were in the majority and in the \nminority, and back to the majority and then back to the minority. \nWendell Ford's was one of the voices we would listen to as we tried to \nfind the answers that made sense for the country and for each other.\n  Wendell Ford also had a quality that was very much the quality of all \nSenators, Republican and Democrat, when he first came here--a quality \nthat, perhaps, some today should remind themselves of, because it \nexisted universally then, and that is the quality of when a Senator \ngives his word, his word is gold. There is not one single person who \nhas served here in the 22 years that Wendell Ford has been here who has \never questioned his word. There is not one single Senator here who \nfound him to be someone who did not keep totally to his commitments.\n  What I have enjoyed in our personal relationship is that he is a man \nI have been able to go to for counsel and guidance and know that I \ncould discuss anything with him without it ever being given out, if I \ntold him it was in confidence.\n  Marcelle and I have been privileged to be here with Jean and Wendell \nFord. They are the kind of people that future generations of the Senate \nshould look to for the best, not just for Kentucky, but for the \ncountry. Ultimately, what is most important in this body is not whether \nyou are liberal, moderate, or conservative, but whether you serve with \nintegrity for the best interests of the country. I have served with \nmany, many people who fit that description, but I have been fortunate \nthat, for 22 years, I have served here with a man who epitomizes that--\nWendell Ford of Kentucky.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, when I came here as a freshman, I \nremember the first parliamentary situation I got snarled up in, and the \nman who stepped up to help me unsnarl it and begin to understand the \nway the Senate worked was the senior Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford]. \nHe sits on the other side of the center aisle from the side I sit on. \nWe have not cast very many votes in the same way. But he has been an \nunfailing source of good humor and good fellowship, and he has become a \nclose friend.\n  I remember, as I contemplate this occasion, one night when I was \ncalled upon for late service in the Chair. As things happened that \nnight, the two leaders, for one reason or another, could not seem to \nget together, and the hour went on and on and on, and they could not \ncall anybody to relieve me in the Chair. I was there until almost \nmidnight. Absolutely nothing was happening on the floor; indeed, nobody \nwas on the floor--except the Senator from Kentucky, who had duty \nhimself that night on behalf of his party. I remember asking him, as a \nfreshman seeking wisdom, as I was looking up in the gallery, ``Why are \nthey here at 11 o'clock at night or 11:30 at night, with nothing going \non?'' They sat there patiently in the gallery. Senator Ford said, \n``Because the zoo is closed.''\n  He has been a delight to be around. I serve now on a task force with \nhim, and I appreciate his candor, his directness, his clear honesty, \nand his great respect for this institution. This is the kind of Senator \nwe need in terms of this respect.\n  There are many who come here who do not recognize the great honor it \nis to be here and sometimes bring a degree of dishonor to this body and \nthe work it does on behalf of the people. Senator Ford is not in that \ncategory. He is in the other category of those who will be missed on \nboth sides of the aisle, a good friend whom we shall look forward to \nseeing for many years to come even after his service here has ended \nbecause we find him such good company and such a fine, fine friend.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join those in expressing our good wishes \nto both the senior Senator from Kentucky and, indeed, his wife and \nfamily for their next chapter.\n  Yesterday afternoon, I say to my good friend from Kentucky, I \ninterrupted the proceedings in relation to the underlying amendment to \nspeak briefly on behalf of our good friend and colleague, who at that \ntime was necessarily detained in that State he loves most, Kentucky. \nBut I have been privileged now to serve as chairman of the Rules \nCommittee with my distinguished colleague as the ranking member, and I \nhave been a member of this\n\n[[Page S2111]]\n\ncommittee for many, many years. We have all come to know and respect \nWendell Ford. And I think within the institution of the Senate, \ncertainly as it relates to all the employees, no matter whether they \nare in the cafeteria, no matter whether they are here on the dais, \nwherever they are, he feels a very keen sense of responsibility for \ntheir welfare and their safety and for their ability to achieve their \ngoals and care for themselves and their families.\n  He has done a remarkable job on the Rules Committee over these years, \nand I look forward to working with him the balance of this \ndistinguished Senator's term. The Rules Committee is often thought of \nas housekeeping. Fine, call it housekeeping if you wish. We saw an \nexample today where it occasionally is a little more than housekeeping. \nBut whether it is the complicated issue like today or caring for any \nemployees in this institution of the Senate and working with the House \non the overall protection of the Capitol of the United States, where \nthe two bodies share joint jurisdiction, Senator Ford is always there, \nkeeping in mind what is in the best interests of the Congress and of \nthe Senate and of those people who serve the Senate. I salute my good \nfriend and wish him well.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to address the \nSenate as if in morning business for up to 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2109-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2111-S2113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NUCLEAR WASTE STORAGE\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as the Senate further deliberates on the \nnomination of Federico Pena to become the next Secretary of Energy, I \nrise again to discuss an issue of paramount importance to our Nation's \nratepayers and taxpayers: nuclear waste storage.\n  While I have already discussed on this floor the long history of this \ndebate, I believe a brief review of this history is warranted.\n  Since 1982, energy consumers have been required to pay almost $13 \nbillion into a trust fund created to facilitate the disposal of our \nNation's commercial nuclear waste.\n  In return for such payments, nuclear utilities and their ratepayers \nwere assured that the Department of Energy would begin transporting and \nstoring nuclear waste in a centralized Federal repository by January \n31, 1998.\n  This deadline is less than a year away. Over $6 billion of the \nratepayer's money has been spent by the Department of Energy, with very \nlittle progress being made by the Department in living up to the \nFederal law which requires the DOE to accept commercial nuclear waste. \nIn fact, late last year, the DOE politically punted their problem by \nnotifying utilities and States that it would not meet the deadline, \ndespite a Federal court's ruling that it must do so or be liable for \nsubstantial damages.\n  Since then, the Department has failed to set forth a single, \nconstructive proposal to meet its legal obligations, thereby \nthreatening the interests of ratepayers and ultimately the taxpayers.\n  Who will be most affected by the lack of DOE action? Obviously, \nratepayers come to mind. As I have stated before, our Nation's energy \ncustomers have already paid almost $13 billion into the Nuclear Waste \nFund. At the same time, since the DOE has not met its obligations to \naccept nuclear waste, utilities and ratepayers have paid and will \ncontinue to pay for onsite storage at over 70 commercial nuclear \npowerplants. In other words, ratepayers are being hit twice because the \nDepartment of Energy has failed to meet its legal obligations to the \nAmerican people.\n\n  In addition, the Energy Department's failure to move nuclear waste \nout of the States affects not just our Nation's consumers; it \ncompromises our taxpayers as well.\n  Last year, the Federal courts ruled that the DOE will be liable if it \ndoes not accept commercial nuclear waste by January 31, 1998. But under \ncurrent law, no one at the DOE itself will have to pay the damages--\nthat bill will go to the American taxpayers at an estimated cost of 40 \nto 80 billion taxpayer dollars. This staggering and irresponsible \npotential damage liability and the DOE's reluctance to provide specific \nanswers to resolve this situation should be an affront to the \nPresident, the Vice President, the Congress and more importantly, the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  To make matters worse, DOE officials under the Clinton-Gore \nadministration have not only avoided specific responses to this fiasco, \nbut have openly indicated that the States--not the Department--have the \nresponsibility to address the problem in the absence of action by the \nFederal Government. In other words, in the last hours, the DOE is \nsaying that it will not meet its responsibility and is tossing the ball \nto the States and the ratepayers to handle the DOE's mistake.\n  For example, in a recent hearing before the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, DOE Under Secretary Thomas Grumbly argued that \nnuclear waste storage problems facing States like Minnesota are not the \nFederal Government's responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I find that attitude completely arrogant, devoid of \nthe facts, and a threat to the viability of long-term energy resources \nfor the American public. In 1982, States, utilities and through them, \nratepayers, signed a contract with the Federal Government to dispose of \ncommercial nuclear waste, a contract upheld by the courts last year.\n  With that understanding, States planned for limited onsite temporary \nstorage capacity, relying upon the Federal Government's fulfillment of \nits contractual obligation.\n  Yet, as the years passed, it became apparent that the Federal \nGovernment would not keep its word, prompting threats of potential \nenergy crises in States with limited storage space.\n  For example, the depletion of storage space in my home State of \nMinnesota will mean that one of our utilities will lose its operating \ncapacity by 2002 if the Federal Government does not act soon. This \nplainly means that consumers in Minnesota would not only lose 30 \npercent of their energy resources but would also have to pay higher \nenergy prices--estimated as much as 17 percent more--as a result of \nFederal inaction.\n  Therefore, ratepayers will not get hit just once or twice, but \npotentially three times, if a resolution is not found on a national \nlevel.\n  The crisis facing both our ratepayers and taxpayers is simply \nunacceptable. The American people do not deserve excuses and inaction; \nthey need real answers from the Clinton-Gore administration. They need \nleadership on this issue--not a crass political debate arising out of \nPresidential politics.\n  With that in mind, I took the opportunity to ask Secretary-designate \nFederico Pena of his specific and definitive views to resolve this \nissue.\n  Since I believe the American people deserve answers from their \nleaders, I sent a letter to Mr. Pena asking for a detailed response \noutlining the specific steps he would urge to meet the January 31, \n1998, deadline.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks an exchange of letters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAMS. After this exchange of letters, I still felt troubled by \nMr. Pena's inability to provide specific answers about how he and the \nClinton-Gore administration intend to resolve our Nation's nuclear \nwaste storage problem.\n  Because I have not received a sufficient response to date, I objected \nto an effort to expedite full consideration of Mr. Pena's nomination \nlate last week.\n  Since that time, however, I had a telephone conversation with the \nSecretary-designate over the nuclear waste issue. While I am still \nconcerned with his continued lack of specific answers, I was pleased to \nhear Mr. Pena agree with me and the Federal courts that any resolution \nof this issue ultimately involves Federal responsibility. Contradicting \nwhat DOE Under Secretary Grumbly stated before the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee\n\n[[Page S2112]]\n\nlast month, Mr. Pena provided verbal assurances of his commitment that \nour nuclear waste storage situation is a Federal problem worthy of a \nFederal solution. But what that means is taxpayers will still be asked \nto pay extra for the DOE's failure to do its job, and it creates the \npossibility of taxpayer liability high enough to make the public \nbailout of the savings and loan collapse seem small in comparison.\n  While I am not completely satisfied with Mr. Pena's overall \nincomplete response to this quickly approaching crisis and will vote \nagainst his nomination based on his inability to provide specific \nanswers, I will not object to moving his nomination forward for the \nsake of advancing this debate.\n  For this reason, I hope that as the new DOE Secretary, Mr. Pena will \nplay an active role in pulling the administration's head out of the \nsand and becoming a constructive player in this debate.\n  Specifically, it is my hope that Mr. Pena will show the necessary \nleadership and push the administration to support the common-sense \nsolution crafted by Senate Energy Chairman Frank Murkowski, Senator \nLarry Craig and myself. We will mark up this bill in the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee tomorrow, and I believe the chairman will \ndeliver a bipartisan resolution.\n  With the January 31, 1998 deadline fast approaching, the \nadministration and Congress owe the States, ratepayers, and the \ntaxpayers nothing less than the assurance that promises made by the \nFederal Government will be promises kept.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 4, 1997.\n     Mr. Federico Pena,\n     Secretary-designate, Department of Energy, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Pena. As the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \n     Committee further deliberates on your nomination as Secretary \n     of the Department of Energy (DOE), I'm writing to solicit \n     your views on recent comments made concerning our nation's \n     failed commercial nuclear waste disposal program.\n       As you know, the DOE has announced that it will be unable \n     to meet its legal deadline of January 31, 1998 to begin \n     accepting commercial nuclear waste despite a mandate by a \n     federal court and the collection of over $12 billion in \n     ratepayer's funds. As a result of this failure, the Court of \n     Appeals will decide the appropriate amount of liability owed \n     by the DOE to certain utilities, possibly putting taxpayers \n     at risk because of the Department's lack of measurable \n     action. Meanwhile, the federal government continues to \n     collect and transport foreign-generated spent fuel for \n     interim storage without any apparent technical or \n     environmental risks.\n       In light of these activities, it was no surprise that \n     former DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary recently contradicted the \n     Clinton Administration's longstanding objection to resolving \n     the centralized interim-storage impasse for our ratepayers \n     and, ultimately, our taxpayers. Her comments on the need to \n     move forward with a temporary waste storage site upon \n     completion of the viability assessment at Yucca Mountain \n     reflect the bipartisan, common-sense reforms contained in S. \n     104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. Unfortunately, the \n     Clinton Administration has ignored this reality by failing to \n     become a constructive player in this process.\n       Although I am disappointed that Mrs. O'Leary's comments \n     came after her tenure as Secretary, I applaud her courage in \n     expressing her views honestly and thoroughly. I strongly \n     believe that the next DOE Secretary must provide the \n     committed leadership necessary to resolve this critical \n     situation while in office. With this in mind, I want to know \n     your specific thoughts on Mrs. O'Leary's comments that the \n     DOE should move forward on a temporary nuclear waste storage \n     site next year at Yucca Mountain if a viability assessment is \n     completed at the permanent site. If you disagree with Mrs. \n     O'Leary, I want to know what specific alternatives you would \n     propose to meet the federal government's legal obligation to \n     accept nuclear waste by January 31, 1998.\n       For too long, our nation's ratepayers and taxpayers have \n     been held hostage to what has become a political debate. They \n     deserve better and, more importantly, deserve an immediate \n     solution to this issue. For that reason, I expect a specific, \n     constructive response to my questions before the Senate votes \n     to confirm your nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Rod Grams,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    March 5, 1997.\n     Hon. Rod Grams,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grams: Thank you for your letter of March 4, \n     1997 concerning the Department of Energy's civilian nuclear \n     waste disposal program and the comments made recently by \n     former Secretary Hazel O'Leary. I have not spoken with \n     Secretary O'Leary about her remarks and, therefore, am not in \n     a position to comment on them.\n       As I stated when I appeared before the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources, I am committed to working with the \n     Committee and the Congress toward resolving the complex and \n     important issue of nuclear waste storage and disposal in a \n     timely and sensible manner, consistent with the President's \n     policy, which is based upon sound science and the protection \n     of public health, safety, and the environment.\n       I am very cognizant of the Department's contractual \n     obligation with the utilities concerning the disposal of \n     commercial spent fuel, and, after confirmation, I also expect \n     to meet with representatives of the nuclear industry and \n     other stakeholders to discuss the Department's response to \n     the recent court decision and the consequences of the delay \n     in meeting that contractual obligation.\n       As Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles emphasized in his February \n     27 letter to Chairman Murkowski, the Administration believes \n     that the Federal government's long-standing commitment to \n     permanent, geologic disposal should remain the basic goal of \n     high-level radioactive waste policy. Accordingly, the \n     Administration believes that a decision on the siting of an \n     interim storage facility should be based on objective, \n     science-based criteria and should be informed by the \n     viability assessment of Yucca Mountain, expected in 1998. \n     Therefore, as the President has stated, he would veto any \n     legislation that would designate an interim storage facility \n     at a specific site before the viability of the Yucca Mountain \n     site has been determined.\n       In conclusion, I want to strongly emphasize again that I am \n     committed to working with you and other members of the \n     Committee and the Congress on these difficult issues.\n           Sincerely,\n     Federico Pena.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 1997.\n     Mr. Federico Pena,\n     Secretary-designate, U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Pena: I received your letter, dated today, in \n     response to my most recent questions on our nation's nuclear \n     waste policy. Although I appreciate the timeliness of your \n     response, I am still concerned about the absence of specific \n     proposals from you on how best to resolve this important \n     issue.\n       In your letter, you wrote that the Clinton Administration \n     ``believes that a decision on the siting of a storage \n     facility should be based on objective, science-based criteria \n     and should be informed by the viability assessment of Yucca \n     Mountain, expected in 1998.'' Frankly, this response states \n     nothing more than the position you have taken in the past, \n     leaving questions about whether the viability study can be \n     completed in time for the DOE to realistically accept waste \n     by the legal deadline on January, 31, 1998 and what can be \n     done to meet the deadline if the permanent site at Yucca \n     Mountain is not determined to be viable.\n       I certainly hope you can understand my concerns, given that \n     you yourself have publicly admitted that following this track \n     would make it impossible for the DOE to meet the January 31, \n     1998 deadline.\n       More importantly, you did not answer my central question \n     regarding what specific, constructive alternatives you would \n     propose in order for the DOE to begin accepting waste from \n     states by January 31, 1998, as outlined in statute and \n     ordered by the courts.\n       With that in mind, I would again request a specific \n     response from you--prior to the Senate vote on your \n     confirmation--to the following question: given that the \n     current Administration position would result in the failure \n     of the DOE to accept waste from states by January 31, 1998, \n     what specific, constructive alternatives would you propose to \n     guarantee that the DOE will meet this legal, court-imposed \n     deadline?\n       I look forward to your response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Rod Grams,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    March 6, 1997.\n     Hon. Rod Grams,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grams: Your letter of March 5, 1997 asks me to \n     outline the specific, constructive steps that may be taken to \n     guarantee the Department of Energy will meet its contractual \n     commitments to begin taking nuclear waste discharged from \n     civilian nuclear reactors on January 31, 1998.\n       Let me say again that I am committed to carrying out a \n     responsible strategy for disposing of nuclear waste. I will \n     work with you and your colleagues toward that end, consistent \n     with sound science and the protection of public health, \n     safety, and the environment. I cannot, however, outline for \n     you specific steps for meeting the January 31, 1998 date. The \n     Department of Energy has indicated to the court and in \n     responses to the Congress that there is no set of actions or \n     activities that could be taken under the Nuclear Waste Policy \n     Act to enable the Department to begin receiving spent fuel at \n     an interim storage facility or a repository on that date. The \n     Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has itself \n     recognized that compliance with the January 31, 1998 date is \n     not possible under the law or even under the Committee's bill \n     reported in the last Congress.\n       In recognition of this state of affairs, I have indicated \n     that following confirmation I intend to meet with \n     representatives of the nuclear utility industry and other \n     stakeholders to address the consequences of delay in\n\n[[Page S2113]]\n\n     DOE's meeting its contractual obligations and the \n     Department's response to the recent court action.\n       Again, I wish to emphasize my pledge to work with the \n     Congress in addressing this matter, consistent with the \n     President's policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Federico Pena.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to speak until the \nbeginning of the vote. As soon as that is called and they are ready, I \nwould ask to be interrupted. But I want to speak briefly on the \nnomination of Federico Pena for Secretary of Energy. This is a very \nimportant position, and one that I think will certainly have an impact \non the energy policy of our country in the future. Knowing how \nimportant having a healthy energy policy and a strong industry that can \nproduce our own energy domestically is to this country, I think this \nnomination and the support for Federico Pena is important to all of the \nSenate.\n  I am cochair, along with Senator Breaux, of the oil and gas caucus. \nWe are going to work this year to make sure that we eliminate redundant \nand unnecessary regulations on the energy industry so we will be able \nto go out and drill in our country for our natural resources. We want \ntax incentives which encourage oil and gas drilling, especially \nmarginal wells and formations which are difficult to develop. These are \nimportant because we want to have energy sufficiency in our country. \nNot only does it create jobs, but it creates security.\n  A country that is dependent on foreign oil and gas is not going to be \na strong country. It is not going to be a superpower. So, having a \nhealthy energy policy in our country will be most important for us to \nbe able to strengthen the ability to get oil and gas on our own shores.\n  I see, Mr. President, that our leaders are ready to start a vote. I \nwill stop and then hope to be able to speak on behalf of Secretary \nPena's nomination at a later time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleague [Mr. \nGlenn], is in the Chamber. So, at this time, on behalf of both leaders, \nI ask unanimous consent that there be 5 minutes for debate equally \ndivided on amendment No. 23; following the debate, the Senate proceed \nto vote on amendment No. 23 without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I do not object to this proposal for 5 \nminutes for debate equally divided on the amendment, and following \ndebate, we proceed to vote. There has been a lot of negotiating going \non here, as has been obvious to everyone. I think we have some \nsatisfactory procedures worked out that will be generally far more \nacceptable than what we had prior to that. I look forward to the vote. \nI think that most people on both sides will probably be happy to vote \nfor this because this is a way we get to a final solution out of the \ndisagreements we have had here. I look forward to the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I congratulate my distinguished colleague, \nbecause I doubt that we would be where we are right now had we not had \nthe debate yesterday and the debate this morning. I think the Senator \nfrom Ohio would concur in that.\n  Mr. GLENN. I would, indeed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Therefore, Mr. President, I express my appreciation to \nthe distinguished Republican leader, the Republican whip and others who \nworked on this resolution. The amendment, which was reported out from \nthe Rules Committee, will be amended by the distinguished majority \nleader, and I will be a cosponsor, whereby we add the word \n``improper.'' That reflects on the original document that I drew from, \nnamely the Watergate amendment which we referred to several times on \nthe floor. That contained that particular word, and it has been \nthroughout the various expressions by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee as to their desire. But that does not in any way infringe on \nthe continuing role of the Rules Committee or the continuing role of \nthe Ethics Committee.\n  Again, there is a clear division under the underlying resolution from \nthe Rules Committee that these three committees will work together as a \nteam and, hopefully, resolve many problems relating to campaign reform \nand campaign finance and otherwise. I certainly will say to my \ndistinguished colleague, and I see on the floor the distinguished \nchairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, with whom I have had a \ndialog just about every day, their main focus will be on the question \nof allegations of illegality and the presence, or lack thereof, of \nillegality in the generic subject of campaign finance and campaign \nreform.\n  Mr. President, unless the distinguished Senator from Ohio has further \nremarks, I yield back the time and we can proceed with the vote.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I don't want to get into another debate \nbefore we even get around to this vote, but I think the focus on where \nthe wrongdoing is can be either on illegalities or on improprieties \nwith the change that has been proposed by the leaders. I would not want \nto let it be said right now or let it be indicated that the main \nfocus--what the main focus will be, I think, is up to the committee \nchairman and the ranking minority member to work out. I think we have \nlanguage in here that will do that. It might be inappropriate at \nsometime to take up an illegality if it was looked at as fairly minor, \nor a giant impropriety over that, in our judgment, needed to be looked \nat first. I would not agree at this point that this vote we are about \nto take specifies exactly which direction we would go. I hope that my \ncolleague will agree with that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time, I think all time has \nexpired, has it not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining. The \nSenator from Ohio also has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield such time as I have to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if we can ask directly, the \nSenator, with this amendment, is not establishing any priorities \nbetween illegality and impropriety; is that correct? Either one would \nbe within the scope, is that accurate?\n  Mr. WARNER. Very clearly we have drafted the language so that the \nword ``improper'' is added to the underlying resolution of the Rules \nCommittee in two places.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And it is not given any lesser strength than the word \n``illegality,'' is that correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to the Senator, we simply added one word. It speaks \nfor itself.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Except that our good friend from Virginia suggested there \nmight be a greater emphasis on one than the other. Is there anything in \nthis----\n  Mr. WARNER. If I did, I did not wish to infer that. I thank my \ncolleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 23, offered by the Senators from Mississippi, \nTennessee, and Virginia.\n\n[[Page S2114]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nNo. 23 just agreed to be modified so that the word ``and'' is replaced \nwith the word ``or'' each time it appears.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to support the Senate's \nwise decision to amend the scope provision of Senate Resolution 39, the \nfunding resolution for the Governmental Affairs Committee investigation \ninto campaign finance. I had planned to offer this afternoon an \namendment virtually identical to what the Senate has now adopted. This \namendment addresses what most deeply troubled me about that resolution: \nthe restriction in the version that came to the Senate floor of the \nscope of the investigation that previously every member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee unanimously agreed to. Each and every \nmember of our committee--Republican and Democrat alike--had voted to \nauthorize an investigation into both illegal and improper campaign \nfinance activities. Unfortunately, before our funding resolution got to \nthe floor it had been modified in the rules committee to preclude the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee from exercising authority to look into \n``improper'' activities, arguing that it was enough for us to look into \nonly ``illegal'' activities.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the bipartisan decision to reverse that \ndecision and to return the term ``improper'' to the scope of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee's investigation. Without the return of \nthat authority, I was concerned that our committee's hopes of \nconducting a thorough and bipartisan investigation would have been \ndashed. We would have been forced to conduct an investigation that I \nfeared would have failed to expose the ills of our campaign finance \nsystem and would have further undermined the public's confidence in the \nworking of our political institutions.\n  The continuing revelations about the state of our campaign finance \nsystem may not only shake the American people's confidence in the \nintegrity of our political system, but our own confidence and self-\nrespect. It is therefore our obligation in Congress to conduct a \nthorough investigation into the cause and scope of those problems, into \nthe extent of any illegal and improper activities that occurred, and \nthen, on the basis of those inquiries, to decide what action Congress \nmust take to prevent these things from ever happening again and what \nactivities should be illegal. For that reason, and like each and every \none of my colleagues on the Governmental Affairs Committee--Republican \nand Democrat alike--I voted to conduct a broad-based inquiry into the \nproblems that have plagued our campaign finance system. In a unified \nand strong voice, our Committee declared an intention to explore and \nexpose all improper activities taken during recent Federal campaigns. \nIf there were illegal activities taken by anyone, we declared--whether \nthey be in the White House, in the national parties or in the \nCongress--we planned to investigate them. If there were activities \ntaken that some would call illegal, but because of a technicality in \nthe law, may not be--still, we declared, we want to investigate them. \nAnd, if there were activities taken that clearly were not illegal, but \njust as clearly were improper and so threatened to undermine the \nintegrity of our political system, we declared, then we must be able to \ninvestigate those too, so that we could decide what behavior is now \nlegal that we want to make illegal. That is what we mean by campaign \nfinance reform. On January 30, 1997, I joined all of my colleagues on \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee--Republicans and Democrats alike--in \nvoting to authorize an investigation that would do all of those things.\n\n  Unfortunately, some disagreed with the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee's desire to expose all improprieties in our campaign finance \nsystem, not just acts that are illegal. In what I have been told is an \nunprecedented action, there was an effort to deny the Governmental \nAffairs Committee this jurisdiction.\n  Accepting that vote and limiting the scope of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee's investigation to merely ``illegal'' activities \nwould have limited us in investigating what most people agree is wrong \nwith the system; it would have damaged our ability to obtain evidence \nand subpoena witnesses; and it ultimately may have led to a partisan \nbreakdown on the Governmental Affairs Committee over the meaning of the \nterm ``illegal.'' The net effect clearly would have been to make it \nless likely for Congress to adopt campaign finance reform this session.\n  Let me give just a couple of examples of how this restricted scope \nwould have caused problems for the Governmental Affairs Committee \ninvestigation. Most people seem to agree that our committee should look \ninto the influence of so-called foreign money. Those supporting the \nlimitation of our investigatory scope to illegal activities argue that \nthat limitation has no impact on our ability to investigate foreign \nmoney. And, it is true that we have a statute, section 441e of title 2 \nof the United States Code that makes it--and I quote--``unlawful for a \nforeign national * * * to make any contribution * * * in connection \nwith an election to any political office * * * or for any person to \nsolicit, accept, or receive any such contribution from a foreign \nnational.'' This provision has been cited for the proposition that any \nand all contributions by non-U.S. citizens or greencard holders to \npolitical parties is a criminal offense.\n  But as is often true with the law, not everything is as it seems. \nInstead, under the election law's own definition of the term \n``contribution'' and the Supreme Court's previous interpretations of \nelection law terms similar to ``in connection with an election,''--\nprovisions, I might add, that those seeking to limit our investigation \nseem not to want to change--under those laws it is highly likely that \nthe Court would find that section 441e does not criminalize so-called \nsoft money contributions to national parties by foreigners. Let me say \nthat again: soft money donations\n\n[[Page S2115]]\n\nfrom non-U.S. citizens likely are not ``illegal.'' That is because \nunder the way our campaign laws now are drafted, soft money \ncontributions are, by definition, not made in connection with an \nelection, and only contributions made in connection with an election \nare illegal. Instead, ``soft money'' contributions go to fund party \nbuilding and grassroots activities, as well as to help pursue issues \nadvocacy, and apparently no statute says that foreign money cannot go \nto that. In fact, it is a similar statutory term that allows \ncorporations and unions to give millions of dollars to the national \nparties, despite the fact that our Federal election laws make it \nillegal for those entities to make contributions in connection with \nelections for Federal office.\n\n  In short, under a strict reading of the statute, if foreign money \ngoes for issues advocacy or for grassroots activity or for practically \nanything else but to fund a particular candidate's direct campaign, it \nis likely not illegal, and therefore the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, absent this amendment, would not have been able to \ninvestigate it.\n  Now I know that some will say that I am splitting legal hairs, and I \nwould agree with you. It is splitting legal hairs. But, as a former \nState Attorney General, I can tell you that the splitting of legal \nhairs is precisely what often goes into making a determination of what \nis legal and what is illegal. For as long as our Bill of Rights has \nbeen in place, the enforcement of our laws--and particularly of our \ncriminal laws--has not rested on what we think a criminal statute \nshould have said or what we wish it did say. Instead, it rests with \nwhat Congress actually did say, regardless of whether you or I in \nhindsight wish we had said something different. And the reason for this \nis a very good one. Our Constitution requires that everyone of us have \nclear notice of what is and is not legal, and consequently requires us \nin Congress to say in precise and clear terms what is criminal and what \nis not. Whenever there is any doubt about whether a statute makes \nconduct criminal or not, the Supreme Court has told us on innumerable \noccasions, the law requires a finding against criminality. And I can \nsay with confidence that that is precisely the finding our courts would \nmake if asked whether foreign contributions for issues advocacy and \ngrassroots activities violate our laws. So again, we would not have \nbeen able to investigate a critically important issue.\n  Let me give you another example of what would not have been within \nour investigation's scope had we not expanded it to cover improper as \nwell as illegal activities. There has been a lot of criticism about \nsoliciting or receiving contributions in the White House. Some have \nclaimed that there was a violation of the criminal law based on a \nstatute that says that ``it shall be unlawful for any person to solicit \nor receive any contribution within the meaning of section 301(8) of the \nFederal Election Campaign Act of 1971 in any room or building occupied \nin the discharge of official duties * * *.'' But, as Attorney General \nReno declared the other day, and for reasons similar to the ones I just \ncited, that provision does not make it unlawful to receive all \ncontributions in the White House. Instead, it only applies to what the \ncampaign laws define as a contribution--what we usually call ``hard \nmoney.''\n\n  This, of course, does not mean that it is proper for anyone to \nsolicit or receive any contributions in the White House. And, even more \nimportantly, it clearly does not mean that foreigners should be able to \ncontribute to the DNC or the RNC--I think that neither is proper and \nthat we need to fully investigate whether our elections were in any way \nwrongly influenced by people who have no business being involved in our \npolitical system. What it does, of course, mean is that we need to \nreflect upon the fact that our laws don't make these things illegal and \nto change our laws to make sure it doesn't happen again.\n  Now, none of this matters so long as the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee can investigate both illegal and improper activities, because \nI can tell you for sure that foreign contributions--regardless of their \nlegality--are improper and should be investigated and exposed. But had \nwe not amended the Rules Committee's scope provision, we likely would \nnot have been able to investigate these things because they are not \nillegal.\n  The problems with limiting our committee's scope to just illegal \nactivities would not have ended with being forced to exclude critical \nissues from our investigation. No--there were many more problems with \nthis definition of our scope. For one, it would have seriously \njeopardized our committee's ability to obtain evidence and get \nwitnesses to testify, and it therefore would have threatened the very \nability of our committee to proceed with its investigation. After all, \nour committee has authority to subpoena only those documents that are \nrelated to the legitimate scope of its inquiry. If the scope of our \ncommittee's investigation were limited to illegal activities alone, \nthen I would suggest that any attorney representing a client whose \ndocuments have been subpoenaed would have responded by saying ``my \nclient did nothing illegal and therefore you have no rights to these \ndocuments.'' Our investigation would have been stopped dead in its \ntracks right there.\n  In sum, it would have been wrong on every level to limit our \ninvestigation to just illegal activities. It would have prevented us \nfrom investigating things that should be investigated, it would have \nled us to prolonged battles with witnesses who otherwise would be \nobliged to come forward and cooperate and it would have made it likely \nthat the partisan rift we have thus far been seeing on the committee \nwould grow wider rather than undergo the seriously needed repair we \nbegan making today. But the worst of it could have been the harm our \ninstitution will suffer in the minds of the public. Had we not expanded \nthe scope of this investigation, the U.S. Senate would have gone on \nrecord, in full public view, opposing the investigation of unethical \nand improper campaign activities of Members of Congress. If that would \nnot have been perceived as a stonewall and a coverup, I don't know what \nwould be.\n\n  Finally, let me say just a few words about one other issue: That the \nRules Committee could have separately investigated the improprieties I \nwish to see exposed by our committee. With all due respect to the \nmembers of the Rules Committee, for whom I have tremendous respect, \nthat simply is not a viable--or a rational--option. As the examples I \ngave above demonstrate, although some of what is now under scrutiny may \nbe illegal, most of it probably is just improper. The task of \ninvestigating the massive universe of improper activities is therefore \nan enormous one, as is deciding what should be illegal. In light of the \nfacts that many of the same people will have committed both improper \nand illegal activities and that much of the conduct under investigation \narguably would fall into both categories, it just would not have made \nsense for the Rules Committee to conduct an investigation that will, in \nmany ways, duplicate what our committee will be doing. In fact, it was \nthis precise insight--that it did not make sense from a resource \nallocation standpoint to spend taxpayer funds on duplicative \ninvestigations--that led the majority at the beginning of this Congress \nto wisely decide to consolidate all investigations in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee.\n  Mr. President, let me just close with a few thoughts on what the goal \nof this investigation should be. We're about to enter a long, dark \ntunnel, and the question of whether that tunnel has a dead end, or \nthere is light at the other end, hinges entirely on whether we get \nserious about this campaign finance investigation and about campaign \nfinance reform. The public didn't send us here to bicker; that's \nessentially what President's Bush and Clinton had to say in their \ninaugural addresses. They also didn't send us here to dicker endlessly, \nespecially on matters of importance to them like investigating and \nstraightening out our campaign finance laws. I hope that the showing of \nbipartisanship we made today in agreeing to return a broader scope to \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee's investigation can continue through \nthe rest of our investigation and, I hope just as strongly, can bring \nus together to enact the reforms that our campaign finance system so \nsorely needs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2113-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S2116]]\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, at the beginning, I thank all concerned for \nthe efforts that have been put into coming to this agreement, \nespecially the Democratic leader. There has been a lot of discussion \ninvolving Senators on both sides of the aisle and all the different \ncommittees involved. I think this is the right thing to do and we can \nmove on, then, with the proper investigation, in a bipartisan way.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Glenn \namendment No. 21 be withdrawn, and the committee substitute, as \namended, be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 21) was withdrawn.\n  The committee substitute, as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask unanimous consent that there be 1 hour \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees, with an \nadditional 10 minutes under the control of Senator Specter--I want to \nemphasize that I presume that time will be 30 minutes on our side, \nunder the control of Senator Thompson, and 30 minutes on the other \nside, under the control of Senator Glenn--and following the conclusion \nor yielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to vote on adoption of \nSenate Resolution 39, as amended, without further action or debate, and \nthat the vote occur at 6:30 p.m. this evening.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, let me just use this \nopportunity to thank the majority leader and all of his senior \nleadership on the committees, as well as the leadership on our side, \nSenator Glenn, Senator Levin, and certainly Senator Ford, and all of \nthose responsible for bringing us to this point. This has not been \neasy. This has been a matter that has divided us for too long a period \nof time.\n  For us now to be able to come together on this matter, I think, is a \ngood omen. I am very appreciative of the contribution made by so many \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I hope that with unanimity \nwe can support this request this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me add, Mr. President, I had intended to offer an \namendment this afternoon to the resolution calling for the appointment \nof an independent counsel. However, I had agreed earlier with the \nDemocratic leader to withhold that until at least this Thursday to \nallow the Judiciary Committee to discuss the issue of appointment of \nindependent counsel and see if there is some way that a bipartisan \nagreement could be reached there, also.\n  In view of that commitment that I believe we basically entered into a \nweek ago, I felt it was important that I keep that commitment, and \ntherefore we will withhold action until we see what comes out of the \nJudiciary Committee on the independent counsel issue.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could, Mr. President, indicate that we had intended \nto offer an amendment dealing with a date certain for taking up \ncampaign finance reform, and obviously because we have made so much \nprogress on this issue and because the majority leader has indicated \nhis desire to work with us on the issue of an independent counsel, as \nwell, we will defer that until another time and another circumstance. \nWe are not intending at this point to offer legislation which would \ndirect the Senate in that regard.\n  I appreciate, again, the cooperation and consensus that we have been \nable to work out on both sides on both these matters.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I think that we have made substantial \nprogress. In fact, I think remarkable progress. I cannot express the \nextent of my delight in the cooperation we have seen here in the last \nfew hours in the U.S. Senate.\n  The minority leader is absolutely correct in that we have tended to \nget off track and we have done a little too much disagreeing and not \nenough coming together. What we have done now is, really, I think for \nthe first time, focused on some of these issues. I think that many of \nour Members have not had the opportunity to really focus on the legal \nand procedural issues and what some of these things will mean to us as \nwe go down the road in trying to conduct an investigation. I think \nMembers on both sides, when you come right down to it, and they stop \nand think about it and focus on these issues, really have a whole lot \nmore in agreement than in disagreement.\n  I think we all want to see this investigation done in a fair manner, \nin a thorough manner, and as expeditiously as possible. That is what we \ntried to set out in January when I took the floor and tried to set out \nwhat I thought should be the scope of the investigation and where I \nthought we\n\n[[Page S2117]]\n\nwere going and how we were going to do it. We have not always, every \nday, been able to adhere to that.\n  Today, I think that we really are back on track again. I want to \ncompliment the majority leader. There have been strong feelings on all \nsides of these issues, a lot of misunderstandings, and a lack of focus \nin terms of really what was involved and at stake here. He has brought \nus all together, I think, and required us to do that, along with the \nminority leader. The two of them working together, with Senator Glenn \nand others, has resulted in something that I think is very, very good \ntoday.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee, on the scope issue, came with \nwhat we felt was a good, broad scope of things we should look at. The \nRules Committee came back with what many felt was too narrow a scope. \nAnd now we are somewhere in the middle of that, with the ability to \nlook at not only illegal activities, but improper activities. That is \nwhere we ought to be, there is no question about that. It's not that we \ngain so much by having it in our mandate, it is what we lose if we \ndon't have it in our mandate. We could not be in a position of not \nlooking at improper activities, and Members on both sides came to that \nconclusion once they focused in on it.\n  We have had a good debate. I watched most of the debate yesterday \nthat we had. Members were heard on both sides. Many of the Republican \nMembers pointed out the serious accusations and reports that are out \nthere--some of the most grievous things that this country has seen, if \nthey prove to be true, having to do with foreign influence in our \ncountry and what they were trying to obtain with regard to foreign \ncontributions and things of that nature. Of course, they were right in \nthat. Other Members, from the Democratic side, pointed out the fact \nthat we needed to make sure that our scope was not so narrow as to look \nlike we were either trying to protect ourselves or trying to keep from \nlooking at things that might prove embarrassing to one side or another. \nThey were correct, also. What today represents is a coming together of \nboth of those approaches that we saw in the debate yesterday.\n  The scope we have now of looking at illegal and improper activities \nis in the tradition of the Governmental Affairs Committee. As Senator \nGlenn pointed out yesterday, this is the McClellan committee, the \nKefauver committee, the Truman committee; this is the primary \ninvestigative committee of this body. So, therefore, it's certainly now \nmore in the traditional range of what the jurisdiction and scope of \nGovernmental Affairs' activity has been in times past. Does it mean \nthat we have solved all of our problems? Certainly not.\n  We are going to have to be judges. The committee is going to have to \nmake determinations right along as to what is illegal or improper \nallegations that might lead to illegalities, or might lead to evidence \nof improprieties, or what is the threshold. Is there a credible report, \nor is there credible evidence that there might be illegalities? Or are \nthey illegalities or improprieties? Those are things that people, in \ngood faith, can have different views of. I am convinced that we, as a \ncommittee, as we consider these matters, will come to the right \nconclusion. Whether it is merely illegalities, as the jurisdiction was \nbefore this compromise, or whether its illegalities and improprieties, \nas it is now, we are in the same position that we were in and Senator \nInouye was in during the Watergate investigation. Determinations had to \nbe made at that time as to what was allegedly illegal or improper. So \nwe are really in no different position, in terms of that, than we have \nbeen in in times past. It will not always be pleasant for the members \nof the committee to have to make these determinations. But that is a \npart of our job, and we can do that job.\n  I think now, with this broader scope, it makes it more clear in some \nareas that things can be appropriately looked at and looked into, which \nperhaps were murky before we reached this agreement. I do not think \nthat it is wise for me or anyone else to prejudge an individual, or an \nactivity, or anything of that nature before you know what the facts \nare. But I think it's fair to say that some of these activities that we \nhave heard about are more clear now in terms of whether or not we have \nthe jurisdiction to look at them. Some of them are still not clear.\n  We will just have to sit down again, in good faith, and work out with \neach other what activities merit our attention, what activities merit \nour investigation. I should say that not everyone who receives a \nsubpoena, for example, or not everyone who is asked to appear as a \nwitness is being accused of an illegality or an impropriety. Sometimes \npeople have evidence of illegalities or improprieties, or information \nthat could be helpful, and they themselves have no problems at all. So \nthat issue has been raised in some form, and I think we need to put \npeople's minds at ease about that.\n  I think it is also clear that--as I have said many times before--we \nwill have to set priorities. I do not think we ought to say that \nanything in terms of illegal or improper is off the table. It is all \nthere for us to look at. You can have what some people might refer to \nas a minor illegality or technicality on a very serious impropriety, \nand you would have to take that into consideration. But I think it is \nfair to say that we should look at the more serious matters first.\n\n  What are the more serious matters? We will have to make those \ndeterminations. In my own estimation, certainly matters that have to do \nwith national security, matters that have to do with the security of \nthis country, clearly illegal matters that we would not have any good-\nfaith disagreement on, matters that are clearly illegal, matters of \nthat category would certainly have to be at the top of the list, not \nonly because of obvious reasons, but because of very practical reasons, \nand that is that people in a clearly criminal category tend to be the \nones who leave the country, the ones who make determinations to take \nthe fifth amendment, the ones to get together with other people in that \ncategory and reach agreements of silence, and things of that nature. \nThey tend to be the ones to destroy documents that might incriminate \nthem. We have had some evidence of that. It has been in the public \ndomain. So by their very nature they have to be ranked pretty high.\n  So we will have to constantly prioritize. That does not mean we have \nto wait months and months to get into some matters that do not fit into \nthat category I have just mentioned. It just means we operate in good \nfaith, with common sense, prioritize, keep our eyes on the ball, make \nsure that we as Republicans are mindful that procedural safeguards have \nto be instituted. It is important not only that we be fair, but that we \nperceive to be fair, as we proceed.\n  It's important that the Democrats understand that we in the majority \nalways have the responsibility of carrying the ball forward and pushing \nit forward and getting into these serious matters that affect all of us \nas citizens, whether we are Democrats or Republicans. There is no \nreason we can't do that, Mr. President.\n  I think this is an opportunity here to start a new day. I know that \nin the little battles we have had back and forth here on these issues, \nsome procedural issues and subpoenas, and so forth, that if I had \ndecisions to make over again, I would make them in a different way than \nI have in times past. I have tried to adhere to what I said from the \nfirst day, and that is to walk that tightrope between toughness and \nthoroughness on the one hand, and fairness and bipartisanship on the \nother. That is not always an easy tightrope to walk. I haven't always \nwalked it as well as I would liked to have walked it, but I am \ncommitted to starting forward from today and making sure that we get \nback on track.\n  The Watergate committee was mentioned several times in the last \ncouple days, and I was just thinking about the fact that the Watergate \ncommittee, I believe, was created by a vote of this body 99 to nothing, \nthe creation of the committee. I do not believe, in its entire \nexistence, and it was about a year and a half--I am not sure what the \nofficial time was, but it took about a year and a half for the report \nto be filed--that there was ever any battle over jurisdiction; there \nwas never any partisan fight over money; there was never any fight over \nscope; and there was never any fight over duration because they worked \ntogether through those tough problems.\n\n[[Page S2118]]\n\n  There is no reason why we cannot do that either. There is no reason \nwhy we cannot do the same thing either, because at the end of the day, \nif we have conducted ourselves well, gone through these tough times, \nhad our disagreements--and we will have our disagreements, but if we \nhave done it in a fair way and everybody has tried to do their best and \nis willing to go forward with an investigation that a lot of people are \nnot going to like, at the end of the day these procedural matters and \nthese fights that we have, skirmishes that we have had are not going to \nmean very much. Where we come out on these things that we are resolving \ntoday is not going to mean very much if we do the right thing and have \na good investigation, a good set of hearings promptly and make a report \nback to the American people as to what we found.\n  So, again, I want to commend the majority leader especially and also \nthe minority leader, Senator Glenn, and others who have worked this \nscope problem out. I think we can go forward now. That has been my \nprimary concern here for the last several days. There were some times \nthere when I wondered if it was going to go forward. But I believe that \nour better selves were shown today, and we refocused on this matter. \nAnd hopefully now we are back on the right road.\n  I understand that my colleagues will have some questions concerning \nmy own views on some of what we have done, and I stand ready to respond \nto any questions my colleagues might have.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I welcome the remarks by Senator Thompson. \nI think his statement is excellent. I think it does provide a new basis \nfor starting ahead with these investigations, a better basis than where \nwe were before, I am sure he would agree. It is a new day, and we can \nmake a fresh start. We can set priorities, and those priorities can be \nset as a matter of judgment between us on not only just what is \nillegal, you would have something that is barely illegal but some giant \nthing that is improper that we now can look at on a priority basis, and \nwe can make those judgments. And that is fine. I agree with that.\n  I think what we have called scope, or whether you want to call it \njurisdiction, we are on a much better basis than we were before, and I \nthink we are now prepared to move ahead. I will have some other remarks \nin the colloquy that is to be provided in this half hour. I know that \nSenator Dorgan had a couple of particular things he wanted to mention. \nHe has another commitment. And I ask if he might be able to do that \nnow. How much time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might just ask the Senator from Ohio \nto yield for a question that I could then perhaps direct to the Senator \nfrom Tennessee as well.\n  Mr. GLENN. Go ahead and address your questions. Five minutes?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That would be sufficient.\n  Mr. GLENN. Fine.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my question was on the procedure with \nrespect to subpoenas. I listened to the Senator from Tennessee--I have \ngreat respect for the Senator from Tennessee --and the discussions on \nthe work of this committee dealing with very serious questions and \nsensitive issues. I trust that that work will be carried out in a way \nthat will make the American people confident and proud that Congress \ndid its job.\n  On the question of subpoenas, the question that I was wanting to ask \nwas about procedure. The select committee on the Watergate issue, for \nexample, had a procedure which seems to me to make a lot of sense. And \nthe procedure was, if the chairman or the vice chairman of a committee \nwere proposing a subpoena, for example, a vice chairman of that \ncommittee, the procedure was if that vice chairman proposed a subpoena \nthat the chair might have objected to, the vice chair had a right to go \nto the committee to get a vote of the committee on that subpoena \nquestion.\n  It seems to me to be the right kind of procedure in order to protect \nboth the chairman and also the ranking member of a committee like this, \nespecially with respect to the subpoena power. And I was wanting to \nunderstand whether there has been any agreement on that kind of \nprocedure as between the chairman of the committee and the ranking \nmember.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. There has been no agreement with regard to that, but I \nthink that is a sound procedure. I have not revisited that in several \nyears, as you might imagine. I do recall now that the Senator mentions \nit that that was the procedure during the Watergate committee hearings, \nand that gives the minority an opportunity to make their views known to \nthe majority that they might not otherwise have. I tend to view that \nfavorably. I would bring that to the attention of the committee, I say \nto the Senator. For myself, I would tend to view that favorably.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might, I had noticed an amendment \nthat I would have intended to offer on this. The unanimous consent \nprecludes me from doing that. I accepted that judgment on the basis of \nthe discussion I had had previously with Senator Levin, Senator Glenn, \nSenator Thompson, and others.\n  I am heartened by the Senator's answer. My expectation would be then \nthat when you have had an opportunity to present this to the committee, \nthe committee would probably want to adopt this procedure.\n  This procedure seems to me to be sound and fair and the right kind of \napproach to deal with these very difficult issues. And certainly \nsubpoena powers represent one of the most difficult issues.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. It does. It has already proven to be a delicate \nsituation. We got off on a bit of a wrong foot with regard to \nsubpoenas. I take my share of blame for that. I do not think Senator \nGlenn was fully aware of all of the work that went into preparing our \nfirst subpoena list. But on the other hand, I did nothing personally to \nmake him aware of that. I was depending on a lot of staff work. But \nwhat happened was that we came forth with several subpoenas that some \npeople categorized as Republican subpoenas on Democrats and only a \ncouple of Democrat subpoenas on Republicans.\n  I did not look at it that way. They were subpoenas which basically \nultimately Senator Glenn, I do not think, really had any problem with. \nI thought they were more or less basic documents that we could get into \nbusiness with.\n  But it is a delicate matter. It is a very powerful tool and can be a \npowerful weapon in the wrong hands. I appreciate that. We need to make \nsure that we work a little closer together as we prepare these subpoena \nlists because there is nothing--if you want to divide up into sides--\nthere is nothing that one side cannot do to the other side. You might \nnot have the ultimate authority to get the subpoenas out, but you can \nobstruct and do other things that Senator Glenn knows better than \nanybody, the tools that a minority has to protect them. I know them, \ntoo. But we do not want to get bogged down into that. We want to try to \nget on past that, and I think we can. I think the Senator's suggestion \nhas a lot of merit to it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me point out that my suggestion and my \ninclination to offer an amendment was not prejudging whether one might \nor might not have misused subpoena power at all. It seemed to me this \nrepresented a procedure that made a great deal of sense. My \nunderstanding is that the Senator will be presenting this and let the \ncommittee make a judgment on it, and I am confident that the committee \nwould reach the right conclusion.\n  I, again, appreciate the answer of the Senator from Tennessee and the \nSenator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, the colloquy we had proposed earlier, I, in my part of \nthis, can be rather brief, and I would allot myself such time as I may \nrequire. I feel very certain that the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee, my chairman, will agree with this. But let me just put this \nforward as a colloquy so we can help clarify some of the understanding \nthat has gone into this today.\n\n  With the addition of the term ``improper,'' to expand the scope of \nthe investigation to be conducted by our committee, the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, it is my understanding that the committee's \njurisdiction to investigate now includes activities which\n\n[[Page S2119]]\n\nare improper, even though they may not be in violation of any law or \nregulation. The term ``improper'' means not conforming to appropriate \nstandards, and that is a broad term. I believe that the scope of the \ncommittee's investigation would cover--and this is the important part \nhere--would cover the areas set forth in the prior unanimously approved \nscope of the committee's investigation that was voted out unanimously \nby the committee.\n  I would also assume that allegations of illegality or impropriety by \na reputable source, such as the sources previously used by the \ncommittee to issue the subpoenas, shall be sufficient for us to \ninitiate investigative action if necessary.\n  Would that be basically the Senator's understanding of what we have \ndone here today?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. As I look over the original scope that the Senator \nreferred to that came out of the Governmental Affairs Committee, a few \nthings jump out at me that I think clearly come within our \njurisdiction, or in the scope as we now have it. Foreign contributions \nare clearly illegal, not only improper; conflicts of interest resulting \nin misuse of Government offices, failure by Federal Government \nemployees to maintain or observe legal barriers between fundraising and \nofficial business, certainly are within the scope of illegal or \nimproper.\n  I think there are others here that fit that category. Frankly, I \nthink there are some other categories where it is not so clear. We are \ndealing with categories of activities here. It is very difficult for me \nto, with great precision, say what category in any given set of \ncircumstances might or might not fall within our scope. Many times the \nanswer depends upon the facts of the case. You might have a certain \nactivity that may or may not be improper, depending on facts that we do \nnot know yet.\n  So, while, in summary, and in answer to the Senator's question, I \nthink that certainly there is a good deal here of the delineation of \nthe scope that came out of Governmental Affairs that certainly is \npicked up by this expanded scope that we have here today, but I would \nnot want to pass judgment on, as one individual member of the committee \nwhen the committee itself will have to make the determinations on \nindividual situations--I would not, as one member, want to pass \njudgment on any particular activity or group of people or anything like \nthat, without knowing more about the facts.\n  Mr. GLENN. I understand that. I appreciate that answer. I guess a \ndifferent way to state it would be: Are there any parts of that \noriginal proposal that the chairman would specifically rule out as for \nany consideration under impropriety?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. You are asking me to be pretty specific. Again, we are \ntalking about categories of activities and situations that depend on \nthe facts. I will say that the prelude to the specific areas that we \nare talking about now, foreign contributions, misuse of Government \noffices, et cetera, says that we should look into illegal or improper \nactivities or practices in the 1996 campaigns, ``including but not \nlimited to * * * .'' So I think the original scope kind of speaks for \nitself there. There is a further delineation, but it still has to be \nimproper or illegal.\n  You have to understand, now, I am just one member talking, as far as \nmy own views are concerned on this. But I would assume that there would \nstill be, for example, some soft money activity that would not either \nbe illegal or improper. If the rules and regulations permit it, it was \ndone in a correct way, there was no collusion involved, it was not done \nfrom a Federal building--which of course in and of itself is \nproblematic, depending upon your legal interpretation. If someone gave \na $20,000 soft money contribution, I am not prepared, today, to say \nthat that is improper.\n  These are the kinds of things that the committee will have to decide. \nI can assure you that we will have an opportunity for full discussion \non any area the Senator brings up.\n  Mr. GLENN. OK. I will certainly accept that answer now. I think the \nindication of what has happened here today with regard to the \ncompromise in this particular area and on this bill is something that I \nthink, with all the discussion, both on the floor here and privately \nwith the different groups that have met today, shows we have made a lot \nof progress. It is our view that I am not going to try and pin the \nSenator down on every single one of these points and go through them \none by one. I don't think that is necessary. I think what he has \nindicated is in general we are going to look into these things where \nthere is impropriety involved, in addition to illegality, and we will \nmake judgments on what is most important.\n  We have broadened the scope tremendously from what it was before and \nit certainly fits more into the line of what was unanimously approved \nas the scope by the Governmental Affairs Committee by a unanimous vote. \nThat has been the trend of this today, and I think this gives us a \nwhole new broadened level of investigation and one that we welcome, \nbecause I think it will lay a better base for campaign finance reform \nover the long term. That is going to be very good, something that \npeople of this country certainly need. I think, had this been just \nrestricted just to straight violations of law, to illegalities, we \nwould not have had that kind of scope.\n  I know, with the time limits we have here today, I would like to move \non. I certainly accept the Senator's view of these things as he has \nexpressed them. I know Senator Levin had some concerns he was going to \nexpress about the processes, and have a colloquy in that particular \narea to try and delineate some of these things a little better and I \nyield him such time as he may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that we have been able to \nmake significant progress this afternoon on this resolution. Adding \nback the term ``improper'' has brought this investigation, basically, \nback to where members of the Governmental Affairs Committee unanimously \nintended it to be. We returned to a broader investigation: both ends of \nPennsylvania Avenue, both parties. It is only through this kind of a \nbipartisan investigation will this investigation, indeed, bear fruit. \nIt is a positive conclusion to what was turning out to be an \nunfortunate development in the history of the Senate in its power to \ninvestigate.\n  On the other hand, on the procedures questions, I was going to offer \nan amendment to attempt to establish procedures for how we conduct this \ninvestigation on a bipartisan basis. Based on the progress that we made \nin restoring the breadth of the investigation, and based on private \nconversations that we have had with Senator Thompson and Senators \nGlenn, Daschle, Lott and others, I became sufficiently optimistic about \nthe conduct of this investigation that I was able to waive my right to \noffer an amendment as others have waived their rights to offer \namendments relative to this resolution.\n  I have looked at 10 prior resolutions, which initiated major \ncongressional investigations, and in all 10 cases, bipartisan \nprocedures were adopted either in the resolution creating the \ninvestigation or by the committee shortly thereafter. So I would like \nto engage the chairman of the committee, the distinguished chairman, in \na colloquy and ask a few questions about procedures. One of them is a \ngeneral question.\n  I am wondering whether or not my friend, the chairman, would agree \nthat one of the first orders of business for the committee following \napproval of this resolution would be to attempt to establish \nprocedures, bipartisan procedures, for the conduct of the \ninvestigation?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes, I would agree with that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it the chairman's hope and intention that the \ncommittee's depositions be conducted jointly?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes. I think that without any question it is important \nthat we attempt to have joint participation in the depositions. I think \nthat whichever side notices the deposition, there should be a certain \nperiod of time when the other side is notified and given the \nopportunity to attend the deposition. There might be instances where \nthat's impossible, in terms of someone participating, but the notice \nshould always go. The notice should always be there.\n  And we need to have a firm procedure as to who has notices given, so \nthere is\n\n[[Page S2120]]\n\nno question about the fact that notice has been given. And we need to \nexercise a little good faith and leeway. If the time that is agreed \nupon is not fully needed, for example, the side not taking the \ndeposition should not insist on it. If a little more time is needed for \nscheduling purposes, the side scheduling the deposition should be \nreasonable there. But I think it is very important, to maintain the \ncredibility of what we are doing, that if at all possible we have both \nsides at the depositions unless there is an agreement that it is not \nsignificant enough a deposition for both sides to be there. So, those \nare the goals that I would work toward.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the chairman for that. Is it also the chairman's \nhope, or intention, that, where feasible, and I emphasize the words, \n``where feasible,'' investigative interviews be conducted--I ask this \nquestion knowing that there will be occasions when it is impossible to \nnotify the other side of a telephone conversation or some other \nconversation--but that there would be a good-faith effort, where \nfeasible, to have investigative interviews be conducted jointly?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes. I think we need to use our best efforts to ensure \nthat by providing reasonable notice under those circumstances, at least \nof all significant interviews. As you say, as these things go, there \nare going to be people scattered out in various places, and I think on \nmany occasions they can go in teams. I think that will be good. But \nmany times they are not going to be able to do that.\n  As the Senator knows, we have been talking about procedures a lot \nhere for the last couple of months. Now we have to get down to the \nheavy lifting. We have people to interview all across this country and \npeople in other parts of the world. We are not going to always be able \nto do it side by side. But best efforts should be made to provide \nreasonable notice for all significant interviews, whether taken by the \nmajority or the minority, so that the other side will have the \nopportunity to be there.\n  I think the other important part of that is that regardless of \nwhether or not there is participation or presence, that there is access \nto the information that comes from that interview. Although the \nopportunity to question might be lost if the person is not present, \nthey still should have access to that information. That should be a \npart of the agreement also.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the chairman for that, and that was, indeed, my \nnext question relative to access to information, documents, and, \nthrough a number of discussions, I think it is safe for me to say it is \nthe chairman's intention that both the majority and minority would have \nequal and contemporaneous access to all documents and be given adequate \nnotice of the filing of those documents?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The chairman, in his conversation with Senator Dorgan, \naddressed one very important issue and did so in a way which was very \nreassuring to the minority, and that was relative to the calling of a \ncommittee meeting relative to a request to issue a subpoena on the part \nof the minority in the event that the committee chair does not think \nthat subpoena should issue, and I will not go further into that subject \nother than to say I welcome the chairman's assurance on that.\n  Finally, on a related subject, we have had some problem relative to \nsubpoenas because we haven't had the sufficient consultation in advance \nof a decision to issue them and the presentation of those subpoenas to \nthe minority. I think the chairman has addressed this issue, too, in a \nway which is satisfactory when he said, I believe, a few moments ago \nthat he looks forward to a process where we would work together \npreparing a subpoena list. I assume from that comment that that would \nbe in advance of the formal presentation of subpoenas, which trigger \nthat 72-hour rule. I think when that is done, we are going to find \nourselves agreeing on a lot more of these subpoenas than would \notherwise be the case.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I think the Senator is probably right. But let's talk \nabout what we are really concerned about here. I think the Senator is \nwanting to be included in the front end of the consideration, \nbasically. I think that is reasonable. It is not required by the rules. \nNone of this is required by the rules of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. This is my attempt to go beyond the rules in order to do \nsomething that I think is right and the fair thing to do.\n  Let me not mislead you here. I think these are things that I always \nfelt were best worked out at the staff level, but I think we are going \nto have to address them now. I do not think it is ever practical to \nhave Senators sit down around the table for the very first conversation \nabout who we are going to subpoena. I think we have to let the staff do \ntheir work. They have to come to us individually and as a group. They \nhave to come to me as chairman and Senator Glenn with their ideas. \nThere has to be opportunity to have free discussion back and forth, and \nif somebody writes a list of names or companies down that they feel \nshould have top priority, they should not have to be apologetic about \nthat. It has to start somewhere.\n  So we need to let the staff do their work, then we need to have the \nstaff submit that to the members, and then the members need to talk to \neach other. That is my idea of proceeding.\n  Now, if you want to do it otherwise, if you really think that it is \ngood for us to involve ourselves that much on the front end, I will \nconsider something else. But I think you want to consider that very, \nvery carefully, because I don't think that is the highest and best use \nof our time.\n  Prior to now, in the 54 subpoenas that were issued, I believe, if \nSenators will check, they will find that the staff did work together. \nThere was considerable time; there was a requirement to give 72-hour \nnotice. We gave more than that, all on the staff level. But there was \nlots of discussion. Whether or not somebody came up with a list before \nthey started talking or they made the list in the presence of each \nother, I don't really care, and I don't think we should care.\n\n  But what happened was, I think where we broke down was, I didn't call \nSenator Glenn and tell him, basically, what was going on at the staff \nlevel, and I think that was a mistake on my part.\n  So I hear what you are saying. You want to be included on the front \nend of the discussion. But we are going to get into some busy activity \naround here. We all are going to be challenged tremendously, not only \nwith regard to this investigation, but with regard to our regular \nbusiness. It is going to be fast and furious for a long time, and I \ndon't want to be accused anymore of being unfair to anybody.\n  So I want to lay it on the table on the front end. If you want more \nthan I think right now is reasonable, I will be willing to discuss \nthat. What I think is reasonable is to let the staff do their job, then \nreport to the members, then the members sit down. The crucial part is \nnot what is written down on a piece of paper; the crucial part is what \ncomes out the other end.\n  The rules require 72-hour notice. We will try our best to have \nconsultation over and above what the rules require. I don't see any \nreason why we can't learn from past experience and be able to have a \nprocedure where both sides are satisfied on the subpoena issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think the chairman is correct when he says we shouldn't \nbe involved in the front end of every subpoena discussion. I couldn't \nagree with you more on that issue. But my question was whether or not, \nprior to a presentation of a decision to the ranking member, it would \nbe agreeable that there be some kind of a working-together, informal \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will strive toward that end. I think that is what I \nshould have done last time and didn't. Although it is not required, it \nis something I should have done in retrospect, because I think it sent \na signal that I didn't mean to send. There are going to be times when I \nmay not be able to do that, but I will make my best efforts along those \nlines.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am sorry, the Chair apparently indicated my time has \nexpired. I wonder if the Senator from Ohio will yield 1 additional \nminute to me. Apparently, we are under controlled time. I just need 1 \nadditional minute, basically, to thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n[[Page S2121]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. This discussion relative to procedures is helpful. It is \nsomething that we worked on this afternoon as part of this unanimous-\nconsent agreement, and I think it can help put us back on track.\n  It is something with today's action that I think we not only have \nbasically adopted the committee's original scope and resolved the \nfunding issue and an end date, but we also, I think, made some progress \nin terms of taking the next step toward adopting some bipartisan \nprocedures. All of that is going to help this committee have a thorough \nbipartisan investigation which covers, again, both ends of Pennsylvania \nAvenue, both parties, soft money and independent expenditures and \nillegalities and whatever else the committee in its good conscience \nfeels is appropriate for investigation because it is either improper or \nillegal. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, may I ask how much time is remaining on \neach side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes on your side and 15 \nminutes on the other side.\n  Mr. GLENN. How much for the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes on the other side.\n  Mr. GLENN. I will yield to Senator Lieberman. But let me add, Senator \nLieberman and Senator Levin have worked and worked on this particular \nsituation. I certainly appreciate their efforts, as all the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee members have on the Democratic side, and \nI appreciate all their efforts.\n  I yield some time to Senator Lieberman.\n  How much time do you need?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Four minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. Four minutes. We have 5 left. That is fair enough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Perhaps, in the spirit of bipartisanship that is on \nthe floor now, if I use the remaining 4 minutes of Senator Glenn's \ntime, I may turn to Senator Thompson and ask him to yield a few.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank everyone involved in what occurred \nhere today. This is an extraordinarily significant accomplishment, not \nonly on its face but in what it says about the willingness of the U.S. \nSenate to deal directly with the problem of too much money in American \npolitics to deign to do something about it.\n  This is a significant victory which is attributable in large measure \nto the leadership of the Senate, the majority leader, Democratic \nleader, and the leadership of the committee, the Senator from \nTennessee, the chairman, and the Senator from Ohio. But it is, in \ntruth, as has been said on other occasions, not a victory for any \nperson or any party, it is truly a victory for the public interest.\n  Mr. President, over the last couple of weeks there was a strange and \ntroubling discontinuity between the growing avalanche of revelations \nabout the impact of money on American politics and the impression it \ngives that American democracy is for sale, on the one hand, and the \nseeming movement here in the Senate, particularly in the vote in the \nRules Committee last week. I am not saying this was the intention, but \nit certainly gave the impression of going into a kind of bunker of not \nbeing willing to have a full and open investigation of the problem of \nthe way in which campaigns are financed in this country. By limiting \nthe jurisdiction of the investigation to be performed by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to illegal activities in association \nwith the 1996 Federal elections, the impact would have been effectively \nto have crippled the investigation, in my opinion.\n  Who would have decided what was illegal? Could not anyone subpoenaed \nby the committee have claimed that their client had not done anything \nillegal, and therefore the subpoena was improper?\n  Of course, the basic purpose here, if we are serious about campaign \nfinance reform, should be to investigate and reveal and inform, as the \nchairman of the committee said in one of his opening statements in this \ninvestigation, to inform the public about what is legal today but ought \nto be illegal, what is improper or unclear but ought to be illegal. \nThat is what campaign finance reform is all about, taking some of the \nvagaries of the current system, some things that are not vague but are \nclearly improper, not illegal, and making them illegal.\n  And as disappointing as the vote of the Rules Committee was last \nThursday, I believe the vote of the Senate today, bipartisan as it is, \nis heartening. Reason has prevailed. I think Members of the Senate on \nboth sides of the aisle focused in on the impact of this constricting \njurisdiction for the investigative committee and decided it was not \nright. And that resulted in the addition of these simple two words, \n``or improper.'' But there is a world of difference in those.\n  A significant step forward has been taken today on the road to \ncampaign finance reform. What is most important is that we have done it \ntogether, Republicans and Democrats, acting not as Republicans and \nDemocrats, but as Americans facing a very serious challenge to our \ndemocracy.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask the Senator from Tennessee if \nhe would yield me 2 minutes of his time?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I would be happy to yield that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. President, this is serious business. There are some people, I \nthink, who rightly say the American people do not really care about all \nthis campaign finance trouble, maybe because they are numb to these \nkinds of revelations. Some say maybe, ``Oh, they all think it goes on \nanyways, so what's the difference. Everybody does it.''\n  I do not know whether the American people are listening or watching. \nI believe they really are. But I know that history is watching. And I \nknow that we will be judged as to how we respond to this fundamental \nchallenge to our democracy: the basic premise of equal access to \nGovernment, the basic premise of a Government in which one person has \none vote and one person who may have a lot of money to put in politics \ndoes not have any more influence than that one person with one vote.\n  But when people can walk in and give hundreds of thousands of \ndollars, and money moves from committees to committees, when people in \npolitics, as we know because we are there, have to spend as much time \nas they do and feel the relentless pressure that they do to meet the \ncompetition, to raise the money to pay for the advertisements, then the \nstandards of each one of us are tested and the standards of the system \nare challenged.\n  A lot has been made in this debate and in the media about allegations \nthat foreign countries or interests may have attempted to purchase \ninfluence, used campaign contributions. Mr. President, I will tell you \nthat that is despicable behavior. But what we have to say to our \nourselves is, they have done so because they believe, apparently, if \nthese allegations are right, that American democracy is for sale. None \nof us want to leave that impression. And the way to correct it is by \nreforming our campaign finance laws. The way to begin that process is \nto do the kind of full and open investigation that the Senate, by this \namendment, will now authorize. I have great confidence in the chairman \nof the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I have great confidence in our ranking Democrat. And I \nbelieve together we are going to go forward to cleanse and elevate the \nway campaigns are financed in America and to reestablish and rebuild \nthe basic core of our Democratic system.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the chairman of the committee and the \nranking Democrat. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his usual eloquent remarks. \nI think I agree with everything that he said. I am one of those who \nhave thought for a long time that we needed to make some significant \nchanges in our campaign finance reform system. And I still believe that \nway stronger today than ever before.\n\n[[Page S2122]]\n\n  But I want to leave one thought, not in response to what the Senator \nsaid, but from watching the talk shows and some of the comments that \nsome of the people at the White House have made, and so forth, about \nthis. When talking about the issue of the need for campaign finance \nreform, my remarks on the floor on January 28 were referred to earlier. \nSomething rang home with me, so I got them. And here is one of the \nthings I said then. I said:\n\n       But those of us with responsibility in this area, whether \n     it be the President or Members of Congress, cannot let the \n     call for campaign finance reform serve to gloss over serious \n     violations of existing law. If we do that, the reform debate \n     will be cast in a totally partisan context and ensure that \n     once again campaign finance reform will be killed.\n\n  So it occurred to me that once again we must be reminded of the fact \nthat those of us who want campaign finance reform must remember that \nthe best thing we can do for campaign finance reform is to continue to \ntalk about it if we want to, but also make sure we do a good set of \ntough bipartisan hearings that the American people have some confidence \nin.\n  For those who want campaign finance reform, let us get about the \nmoney laundering, the foreign contributions, the allegations of selling \npublic policy, allegations of violations of the Hatch Act, the Ethics \nAct, and the serious matters, that will do more for campaign finance \nreform than anything else.\n\n  I thank the President and yield back the balance of the 2 minutes I \nwas referring to.\n  How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 10 minutes \nof his own right and the Senator from Tennessee continues to have 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. The Senator is welcome to use either 10.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nTennessee for allowing me some of his time, as well as the 10 minutes. \nI will try to be relatively brief to move the process along.\n  Mr. President, this has been a good showing by the U.S. Senate today \nas we have come together on a bipartisan basis, Republicans and \nDemocrats, trying to structure an inquiry and hearings which will help \nreform the American campaign system where virtually everyone agrees \nthere is too much money in it, and it is a very troublesome factor.\n  The vote was 99-0, with one abstention, to broaden the scope of this \ninvestigation to include improper as well as illegal activities. I \nthink we have achieved a very significant broadening of the committee's \ncharge. It really is very close to what the committee did initially on \na unanimous vote, nine Republicans and seven Democrats, saying we would \ninvestigate both illegal and improper activities. It was narrowed by \nthe Rules Committee, and now it has been broadened again, and for very \nimportant reasons.\n  One reason is that we may expect everything our committee does to be \nsubjected to the most microscopic minute examination and legal \nchallenge. Already, there have been two challenges by those under \nsubpoena on subpoenas already issued by the committee. If we had a \ncharter which allowed us to look only at illegal activities, it might \nwell be held by a court someday that such an investigation was beyond \nthe scope of what the Congress or the Senate could do, because our \nfunction is to legislate or our function is to have oversight. Our \nfunction is not to prosecute. Our function is not to go into matters \nthat just are illegal. When we go into matters which are improper, then \nit is with a view to changing the law. This is our legitimate function.\n  Now, it could be said that we could look into illegal matters from a \nnarrower point of view to change the penalty, but that is very \nconstrictive and might well fail. We could have been tied up for a long \nperiod of time if we only had illegal activity with someone mounting a \nchallenge that it was beyond the scope of what Congress could do.\n  Also, if we are dealing only with illegal activity, there are many \ninterpretations that might be made as to what is legal and what is \nillegal, and when those issues are raised they go to court and that can \ntake a very long time. For example, Dick Morris, the President's \ncampaign impresario, wrote in his book that President Clinton was \npersonally involved in editing the commercials which were paid for by \nthe Democratic National Committee with so-called soft money.\n  Now that would appear on its face to be illegal because you may have \nindependent expenditures but you may not have coordinated expenditures \nwhen someone has accepted public financing. But the argument was made \nthat what was done was legal. I am not saying the President did it. \nThis accusation is written in a book and it is inadmissible hearsay. We \nhave to find out about it. Someone could challenge our inquiry if we \nwere limited to illegal activities, although on the face, if true, this \nallegation certainly has all the appearance of illegality.\n  Last Thursday the Attorney General said that it was not a \ncontribution under the statute for someone to give thousands of \ndollars, millions of dollars, in soft money because that is used only \non issue advocacy instead of urging the election or defeat of a \nspecific candidate. So that if someone gave $1,000 where the money is \nused to, say, elect John Jones or defeat Frank Smith, that would be a \ncontribution, but the millions of dollars in soft money would not be a \ncontribution under the statute. In my legal judgment, that is palpably \nincorrect, but someone could raise that kind of a consideration.\n\n  So I think we have taken a very, very significant step forward here \nin expanding the scope to cover improper and illegal activities, and as \nthe distinguished chairman pointed out, that gives us an opportunity to \nserve the American public by having campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. President, I had asked for this special 10 minutes because of \nanother deep concern I have in the resolution that is currently drawn, \nand that is with an ending date of December 31, 1997. When you have a \ncutoff date, it is an open invitation to people who want to avoid the \ninvestigation to engage in legal maneuvers which might well be \nconstrued to be stalling tactics, although they have a right to do so, \nwhich could delay the matter long past the expiration day. For example, \nwhere someone is subpoenaed and the person then pleads the privilege \nagainst self-incrimination under the fifth amendment, which the \nindividual would have a constitutional right to do, it would be up to \nthe committee and the Congress to bring forward a charge of contempt of \nCongress because the Congress cannot impose a penalty but has to go for \nenforcement to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. \nThat all takes time. Then if the individual loses, they have a right to \ntake an appeal to the circuit court of appeals, then appeal for a \npetition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  So one of the important items I think we need to have a discussion on \nhere today is what we will do when we face that situation. The mood of \nthe Senate was not such that we could get into extensive amendments of \nthis resolution and we agreed not to offer amendments. I think we can \ncover this matter reasonably well by having a discussion with the \ndistinguished chairman, the distinguished ranking member. The committee \ncan always come back to Congress and ask for an extension.\n  What I seek to do here today, Mr. President, is to get a sense from \nthe managers as to the circumstances where we would ask for an \nextension. I do not say these are the sole circumstances, but \nillustratively, if someone is subpoenaed and that individual pleads the \nfifth amendment, privilege against self-incrimination, granted \nimmunity, ordered to answer, refuses to answer, and there is a contempt \ncitation, it goes to the district court and the circuit court and then \nthe Supreme Court, I ask my distinguished colleague from Tennessee, the \nchairman of the committee, if that would be an appropriate time for our \ncommittee to ask for an extension, and I will ask the same question of \nthe distinguished ranking member, Senator Glenn, if that would be an \nappropriate circumstance for our committee to seek an extension and \nobtain an extension from the full Senate for whatever time we lost by \nthose legal proceedings to compel an answer to that question, and, \nalso, then to complete whatever leads that may result? We know it is\n\n[[Page S2123]]\n\nnot just the answer that the witness would give but it might lead to \nother evidence, and otherwise if we did not have an extension of time \nwe would be stymied on our legitimate investigation.\n  I ask my colleague from Tennessee if that would be an occasion for us \nto get an extension beyond the December 31st cutoff.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. In response, I think that would be one of the \ncircumstances that might lead us to ask for an extension of time.\n  It would depend, I think, on the totality of the circumstances. We \nwould need to feel that we really needed the additional information \nthat was important to our investigation. With that being the case, that \nwould be one of those circumstances.\n  I might add, the Senator makes a very good and valid point, and one \nthat I raised in January on this floor. It is one that I raised in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee when we were discussing scope and \nduration. I also raised it in the Rules Committee the other day. The \nSenator points out the fact that a good defense can sometimes take you \npast any cutoff date that you might establish out there as a target.\n  I do not know if the Senator will ask about other circumstances, but \nI can certainly think of a couple of other circumstances that would \ncause the same problem. The White House, for example, in times past, \nhas taken positions with regard to questions of executive privilege \nthat were not valid. If you want the documents or the testimony, \nusually documents, then you have to go through a process, and you have \nto wind up in court, if you think the documents are important. So that \nis another situation where it would certainly be appropriate, if you \nneeded that information, to come back before the Senate and ask for an \nextension of time.\n\n  Third, and most obvious circumstance, would be simply where you run \ninto additional leads that are material and substantial and that you \nneed to follow up on to make a credible and complete report back to the \nU.S. Senate. All along the way, I have pointed out this problem, as has \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania. What we have reached here today on that \nissue is a bit troubling to me, quite frankly. I have tried to point \nout that, although we have a so-called cutoff date of December 31, we \nhave said that when those circumstances arise--the three we have \ndiscussed here--or any other circumstances arise where we have just \ncause to come back, that we will be back. I have been assured by \nMembers of both parties, and the Governmental Affairs Committee and the \nRules Committee, that they would be right there with us in attempting \nto get an extension under those circumstances.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for those answers. \nHe has expanded beyond the example I gave of a stalling witness to take \nin other matters. There might be a challenge to our entire \ninvestigation, which is not possible for us to anticipate today, and \nlegal challenges might occur, or other impediments, which may come \nbefore the investigation or may occur to lead us to seek additional \ntime. I am glad to hear the Senator say--and he put it in the Record--\nthat he discussed it with the leadership and members of the Rules \nCommittee, as I have.\n  Frankly, I don't like the cutoff date. But people who might tend to \ndelay or wear us down will be on notice that we are not unaware of \nthat, and that we have anticipated it, to the maximum extent possible.\n  I would like to address a question to the ranking member, the Senator \nfrom Ohio, and ask if he agrees with what the chairman has replied to \nin the colloquy.\n  Mr. GLENN. Basically, yes, Mr. President. I think it is right that \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania brings this up out of his own \nprosecutorial background. He knows how long court cases can be \nextended. He has had more experience, probably, than anybody in the \nSenate Chamber on that. So he sees a pitfall that we will have to deal \nwith. I agree with that.\n  I agree, also, that it is impossible for us at this point to say what \nmight occur in this area and what court cases there might be or other \ndelays or leads that we are having to follow up on that may not be \nwound up or not be brought to conclusion at that exact date. I think \nwhat it points out is that, as members of that committee, and as \nchairman and as a member of that committee, we just have to be aware \nthat if anything like that starts to occur, we bring it back to the \nfloor as fast as possible. That is rather key to this whole thing, \nbecause our authority is only as the Senate gives it to us to go ahead \nwith this.\n  So it is incumbent upon us to bring it back here as fast as possible \nto get an extension every time, or whatever else is necessary to do. I \nhypothesize here as to whether this happens or that happens, but the \npoint the Senator makes is an excellent point and one we are going to \nhave to be aware of through the years.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague for that answer. We do know that \ninvestigations take a very long time, and it is not my preference to \nhave a cutoff date of December 31. I think that is very difficult. But \nthe reality is that we faced obstacles in the Rules Committee which \nlimited the scope, and now we have broadened them and limited the time. \nYou have Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, who has been on an \ninvestigation for 3 years. You have had independent counsel on Iran-\nContra on the investigation for many years. The Senator from Tennessee \nand I, in 1995, were on an investigation of Ruby Ridge. We had 15 days \nof hearings and 70-some witnesses. We filed a 150-plus page report, all \nfrom Labor Day to the end of the year, in 4 months. And the Department \nof Justice has undertaken an investigation involving four FBI agents \nwho may not have told the entire story. They started that inquiry in \nlate 1995, and 15, 16, 17 months have passed.\n  I recently wrote to the Attorney General and asked her when she is \ngoing to finish the investigation so we can conclude, and I got a reply \nthat it is still months away.\n  The Senator from Ohio is correct. When I was district attorney of \nPhiladelphia, I ran lots of grand jury proceedings and investigations. \nI know from experience that we are going to face the most tenacious and \nmicroscopic examinations by the best lawyers in the country coming to \nlook at everything we do. I don't like to see a December 31 date. But \nnow it has been established, as best we can on the floor, as a target \ndate. We are going to respond, and we will extend the time if we have \nto.\n  Let us put people on notice that they cannot gain anything by \ndelaying with frivolous lawsuits. If they take up our time, we are \ngoing to get an extension of the time. I thank my colleagues and yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GLENN. I would like to engage the senior Senator from Virginia \nand the Senator from Tennessee in a colloquy regarding the issue of \nreferrals to the Ethics Committee. The resolution before us, as \namended, states that ``the Committee on Governmental Affairs shall \nrefer any evidence of illegal or improper activities involving any \nMember of the Senate revealed pursuant to the investigation authorized \nby subsection (b) to the Select Committee on Ethics.''\n  In the event the Governmental Affairs Committee develops facts which \nimplicate a Senator or Senators in any illegal or improper activities, \nas those terms are used in this resolution, they shall report such \nfindings promptly to the Ethics Committee; however, such reporting does \nnot preclude the Governmental Affairs Committee from continuing its \ninvestigation, provided it is not for the specific purpose of \ndetermining the culpability, or lack thereof, of such Senator or \nSenators.\n  Do my distinguished colleagues agree?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, I agree with the interpretation of the senior \nSenator from Ohio.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes, I also agree with this interpretation by the \nranking member of the Government Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, shortly after I was elected to this body, \nI made a call on one of my heroes. His office walls were covered with \nphotographs. One of them was an old picture of two men standing next to \nan airplane. I couldn't make out the faces, but there was no mistaking \nthe signature. It read simply, ``To our good\n\n[[Page S2124]]\n\nfriend Claude Pepper, Wilbur and Orville Wright.''\n  Next to that was a picture of an astronaut standing on the surface of \nthe Moon. I couldn't see his face. But again, the signature was clear. \nIt read, ``To my good friend Claude Pepper, Neil Armstrong.''\n  Here was a man who had seen practically the whole scope of the 20th \ncentury. He'd served in both the House and the Senate. I asked him what \nadvice he had for a new Senator from South Dakota.\n  He told me, ``The election's over now. It doesn't matter any more \nwhether you're an `R' or a `D.' What matters now is whether you're a \n`C' or a `D'--a `constructive' or a `destructive.' I've been here a \nlong time. I've seen a lot of people try to tear this country down, and \ntoo few people who have tried to build it up.''\n  ``America needs more constructives,'' he told me.\n  I've thought of that conversation many times during the past few \nweeks as we have debated, on and off this floor, how this investigation \nshould proceed.\n  As the Governmental Affairs Committee has proceeded--hiring lawyers \nand issuing subpoenas--Democrats have raised concerns about how this \ninvestigation was being structured.\n  Our purpose was not to stall this inquiry, but to ensure that it \nserves a constructive purpose, not a destructive one. We have always \nwanted the investigation to go forward. But we also want it to shed \nlight on illegal and improper activities--wherever they may have \noccurred. And, most important, we want this investigation to provide a \nroad map for real reform of our campaign finance laws.\n  How can we make sure this process results in reform, not merely \nrevenge? That's what the debate over these last few weeks has been \nabout.\n  To a large extent, that debate has now been resolved. And Democrats \nare resolved, in turn, to join with Republicans to see that this \ninquiry addresses the significant concerns we all have about the \nproblems that surfaced during the last campaign cycle.\n  I want to thank Senator Glenn for all he has done to get us to this \npoint. He and his staff have been dogged in their determination to make \nsure that this inquiry is truly bipartisan, and that it will lead to \nlegislative solutions.\n  I also want to thank Senator Thompson.\n  We agreed with Senator Thompson when he first said that the \ninvestigation should examine illegal and improper activities in all \nFederal elections, Presidential and congressional. We fought when \nothers tried to narrow that scope.\n  We objected to a budget request that was unprecedented and, in our \nopinion, lacked accountability. At the same time, we proposed a process \nto allow the committee to request additional funds and ensure that this \ninquiry does not lapse prematurely.\n  We insisted that Congress set at least a tentative date by which the \ninquiry would end, just as earlier Congresses did with investigations \ninto the Iran-Contra and Whitewater affairs. Again, we said that \nprocess could be extended, if necessary.\n  We said the Governmental Affairs Committee must produce a public \nreport after it completes its work. If the American people are going to \ninvest $5 million taxpayer dollars in this investigation, they deserve \nto know what we learn. So we fought for accountability.\n  Finally, we believe it's not enough to document the problems in the \nglare of television lights. When the lights are turned off, we have to \nbe serious about the hard work of solving the problems. So we asked for \na commitment from our colleagues that the Senate would debate campaign \nfinance reform this year.\n  These are the issues we raised--that we were obligated to raise.\n  Nearly all of our concerns have been incorporated into the funding \nresolution we will adopt today. Their inclusion is a victory not for \none party or another, but for the integrity of the inquiry itself.\n  It is the strength of our system of government that, when the debate \nhas ended and the real work begins, both parties cooperate where they \ncan to address public concerns. This, I believe and hope, is where we \nnow stand.\n  On the central question, Democrats and Republicans agree: this is an \nimportant investigation.\n  Most critical of all is the question of improper foreign influence in \nU.S. elections, and on U.S. policy. This is an American issue, not a \npartisan issue. Have foreign governments sought to influence the \noutcome of American elections?\n  Democrats support and will join in the most vigorous inquiry into \nthis troubling question. American elections must be decided by American \nvoters and funded by Americans, and only Americans.\n  Another question, perhaps looming over all the others, is how could \nwe get to this point? How could the campaign finance laws break down, \nor appear to break down, so completely that we now must conduct an \ninvestigation of unprecedented scope and size?\n  Many of our Republican colleagues insist that the system is working. \nYet, in asking for nearly $5 million to conduct this investigation, \nthey admit more tellingly than words alone that there is a cancer at \nthe core our election laws and their enforcement.\n  Congress can't convene hearings of this kind after every election to \naddress questions of illegal fundraising. It will have to rely on \nappropriate laws--and effective enforcement. Ensuring sound laws and \nenergetic enforcement is the real test of whether the hearings we are \nabout to begin make a lasting contribution.\n  So, for each of the activities the hearings examine, relevant \nquestions need to be asked:\n  How widespread was illegal or improper questionable activity? Will we \nfind various but discrete episodes, or a pattern to circumvent campaign \nfinance laws?\n  Who was responsible for failing to oversee compliance? Were the \nviolations a result of individual misconduct, or a climate of \nindifference to the law?\n  What was the law at the time? Was it clear or unclear? Where we find \nmisconduct, was it deliberate, reckless, or inadvertent?\n  Where were the lawyers?\n  Where was the FEC? What notice was given to the FEC that these \npractices were occurring? What actions, if any, did the FEC take? Are \nthere still actions the FEC should take?\n  Did the public records, including reports on file with the FEC, \nreflect the misconduct? Or are they inadequate to the task of informing \nthe public that something is seriously amiss in the financing of \ncampaigns?\n  These are critical questions. If we will ask these and other \nquestions--without fear or favor--we can achieve historic reforms.\n  Will we seize this opportunity, or squander it?\n  Will we be ``constructives'' or ``destructives?''\n  The choice is up to us.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Does the Senator from Ohio need additional time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 4 minutes 30 \nseconds. The Senator from Ohio has 1 minute.\n  Mr. GLENN. I think the vote was called for 6:30. I think we have \nabout exhausted everything we need to comment on.\n  I will yield back my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will yield back the balance of my time, also.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, all of us who knew Marty Slate and who \nworked with him over the years were saddened to learn of his recent, \nuntimely death.\n  Marty was an exceptionally dedicated public servant. He worked \neffectively throughout his extraordinary career to improve the quality \nof life for working men and women. He served well in many capacities, \ndirecting the field operations of the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, leading the ERISA Division of the Internal Revenue Service, \nand as Executive Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. \nMarty also worked hard, on a daily basis, to improve the quality of \nlife of those around him, particularly his staff and coworkers.\n  Marty was a brilliant lawyer and a gifted manager who knew how to get \nthings done. He inspired the people who worked for him and helped make \nthem some of the most effective and productive public servants in the \nNation. Everywhere he went, his ability and dedication brought out the \nvery best in his colleagues and his staff.\n  Marty was a superb legislative strategist who understood the role of \nGovernment and the impact that Government could have on working \nAmericans. He was the moving force behind the Retirement Protection \nAct, the pension funding legislation that Congress approved in 1994.\n  Early in the Clinton administration, Marty brought together \nrepresentatives of the PBGC, Treasury, IRS, Labor, Commerce, OMB, and \nother Federal agencies as part of an impressive task force. The task \nforce worked effectively under Marty's leadership to identify the \nproblems that caused pension underfunding, and the best solutions to \nthose problems. As chairman of the task force, Marty's door was always \nopen. No person or group was ever shut out of the process. Needless to \nsay, the task force issued its findings and recommendations in a timely \nmanner.\n  After the task force report was issued, Marty looked to the future, \nand worked closely with Congress on legislation to address the problem \nof pension underfunding. As my Senate colleagues will recall, we \napproved the funding reforms in the Retirement Protection Act, the most \nsignificant pension legislation since the enactment of the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act in 1974. It was an extraordinary \nbipartisan accomplishment, and it was Marty's accomplishment, too. \nMillions of working men and women have pensions that are more secure \ntoday because of Marty Slate.\n  In his years at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Marty \nworked hard to assure that workers did not suffer from discrimination.\n  Under his leadership, the EEOC wiped out case backlogs and vigorously \nprosecuted discrimination complaints. As director of field operations \nfor the agency, he was responsible for the day-to-day activities of 46 \nfield offices. The large numbers of working men and women who were \nprotected from discrimination because of Marty's efforts owe him an \nenormous debt of gratitude.\n  When Marty left the EEOC to work for the Internal Revenue Service, he \nestablished the Georgetown-IRS Masters of Taxation Fellowship \nProgram.'' This program was designed to help those who were not \nhistorically represented in the fields of taxation and pensions because \nof discrimination and lack of opportunity. Under this program, students \napplied for admission to Georgetown's Masters of Taxation Program, \nwhile simultaneously applying for a job at the IRS. The IRS, the \nuniversity, and the student-fellow would share the costs of tuition.\n  When Marty left the IRS in 1993, he created a similar fellowship \nprogram at the PBGC. The fellowship programs that Marty created have \nbeen extremely successful, and have enabled many African-Americans and \nother minority students to break through long-standing barriers and \nfind jobs in the fields of taxation and pensions. One graduate of this \nprogram is now a professor at Catholic University.\n  In ways like these, Marty Slate didn't just talk about fair play and \nequal opportunity. He helped to assure that new opportunities for \nAfrican-Americans and other minorities actually existed, and the \ngraduates of these fellowship programs will carry on Marty's fine work.\n  Marty is warmly remembered by those who worked with him as a person \nwho took genuine personal interest in helping them to advance their \ncareers. With all his myriad of responsibilities, he was never too busy \nto write a letter or place a phone call to help someone develop their \ncareer. He was never too busy to reach out. He was there for the people \nhe led and managed because he cared deeply about them.\n  Marty also loved sports. He was a true Boston Red Sox fan and he had \na great love for sports trivia. A local radio station in this area has \na call-in trivia contest for sports fans, which takes place in the \nmiddle of the night. Marty would regularly set his alarm for 2 o'clock \nor 3 o'clock in the morning and get up and call into the talk show. He \ncalled so often that he was known on the show as ``Marty from \nBethesda.'' Marty almost always knew the answer and would win Baltimore \nOrioles tickets. He would then share the tickets he won with his \nfriends.\n  As a Boston Red Sox fan myself, I am particularly fond of a story \nfrom Marty's childhood. One day, when he was about 6 years old, he \nwanted to go to Fenway Park to watch the Red Sox play. His parents were \nconcerned, because they couldn't go that day, and they didn't want him \nto go alone.\n  Marty found a way to heed his parents' advice. The Red Sox won and he \nhad a wonderful time. But when he came back, police and emergency \nvehicles were parked on his street. They were there because 6-year old \nMarty had, in fact, listened to his parents. He did take someone to the \ngame. The problem was that it was the 3-year-old child of a neighbor. \nAnd the police were looking for the missing child in the neighborhood. \nEven at that young age, Marty was demonstrating his extraordinary sense \nof responsibility.\n  Now that he has left us, all of us who were touched by Marty's \nbrilliance and compassion will work harder to carry on his work. That's \nthe way Marty would have wanted it.\n\n[[Page S2126]]\n\n  My heartfelt condolences go to the Slate family, to Marty's wife, Dr. \nCaroline Poplin, to his parents, Albert and Selma Slate, to his \nbrother, Dr. Jerome Slate, to his sister, Emily Slate, and to all of \nMarty's friends and coworkers. He touched all our lives, and we will \nnever forget him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2125-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2126-S2127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE HARSH IMPACT OF THE WELFARE BILL ON IMMIGRANTS.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last year Congress passed a comprehensive \nwelfare reform bill that drastically restricted the ability of legal \nimmigrants to participate in public assistance programs. It prohibits \nlegal immigrants from receiving food stamps, SSI, and Federal non-\nemergency Medicaid benefits. The bill also gives States the option to \nban legal immigrants from State Medicaid services and temporary \nassistance to needy families (formerly AFDC).\n  In the past 2 months, we have begun to see the harsh impact of this \nbill on legal immigrant families in all parts of the country. Many face \nbeing turned out of nursing homes, and cut off from disability \npayments. These human tragedies will only continue to grow in number \nand severity without congressional action.\n  Last month, President Clinton proposed some changes to the law to \nprevent these harsh effects. I urge Congress to act quickly on these \nproposals, and I ask unanimous consent that recent news stories on this \ncrisis may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsday, Feb. 28, 1997]\n\nOn their Own--Elderly, Ailing Noncitizens Face Loss of Federal Benefits\n\n                          (By Geoffrey Mohan)\n\n       Gladys Boyack will be 106 by the time tough new federal \n     regulations on welfare go in to effect in August.\n       She'll also find herself cut from the rolls of a federal \n     program designed to be a safety net for the elderly, disabled \n     and blind.\n       A British citizen who has lived in the United States for 40 \n     years, working most of those years as a nanny, Boyack never \n     applied for U.S. citizenship. Now, the Islip resident regrets \n     her omission; welfare regulations enacted by Congress are \n     expected to cut nearly 5,000 elderly, blind and disabled \n     immigrants on Long Island from Supplemental Security Income \n     rolls. All of them are legal permanent residents, a status \n     that is a step below citizenship.\n       Among them is Lucrecia Lopez, 75, of Freeport, a Dominican \n     immigrant who has been in Freeport for 17 years and labored \n     for eight years in a local factory assembling artificial \n     Christmas trees.\n       Boyack and Lopez received letters this month saying they \n     will lose their monthly payments--$556 and $570, \n     respectively--because neither became a citizen during their \n     stay in the United States.\n       ``I couldn't believe it when I got that letter,'' said \n     Susan Levin, Boyack's granddaughther, who takes care of \n     Boyack in a first-floor apartment at Levin's house. ``There's \n     nothing we can do. The last check will come in July.''\n       Boyack and Lopez face a difficult choice at a late juncture \n     in life: struggle through the forms, tests and language \n     requirements of naturalization, or enroll in local aid \n     programs.\n       Boyack is household and nearly deaf. Lopez, who speaks only \n     Spanish, would have to learn English at 75.\n       So both will probably apply for less-generous state aid, \n     and depend on their families or charities to make up the \n     difference.\n       ``She's 75 years old,'' said Lopez' son Jose, an import-\n     export businessman from Miami who supports a wife and two \n     children. ``Who's going to take the load? As we say in the \n     Dominican Republic, we have to put more water in the soup.''\n       Boyack and Lopez are just two of 4,929 immigrants on Long \n     Island considered likely to lose their SSI benefits as part \n     of Congress' get-tough welfare policies, adopted in August \n     and scheduled to take effect Aug. 22.\n       The changes, aimed at saving the federal government $9 \n     billion over four years, will cut off all but a narrow sector \n     or noncitizen immigrants from SSI.\n       Similar cuts are looming in the food stamp, Medicaid and \n     Aid to Families With Dependent Children programs.\n       Congress enacted the cutbacks in an effort to slow so-\n     called chain migration, which occurs when immigrants who \n     obtain citizenship petition to bring elderly family members \n     to America from their home country. The elderly relatives \n     often have a few wage-earning and taxpaying years ahead of \n     them and little means of support from their sponsors.\n       ``We are paying for the sinners who abuse the system,'' \n     Jose Lopez said.\n       Congress also made sponsors' pledges of support as legally \n     binding as a contract and increased the period of time in \n     which the sponsors' income can be considered in calculating \n     the new immigrant's need for federal aid.\n       In part, the moves were inspired by statistics showing that \n     the number of immigrants using welfare programs has greatly \n     increased. For example, the number or immigrants receiving \n     SSI quadrupled in a decade ending in 1993, and immigrants \n     rose from 4 percent of all SSI clients to more than 11 \n     percent over that time period, according to the General \n     Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm.\n       ``The SSI system is available to people who come to this \n     country and never pay into the system and didn't work,'' said \n     Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American \n     Immigration Reform, which supported the welfare revisions.\n       But Stein acknowledged that Congress may not have intended \n     to pull the safety net away from unemployable immigrants over \n     age 64 who worked and paid taxes.\n       ``The fact that there are tough cases out there has \n     underscored the need for some grandfathering of hardship \n     cases,'' Stein said. ``But we won't support this if we \n     encourage more chain immigration.''\n       On this point only, Stein agrees with activists like Margie \n     McHugh, executive director of the New York Immigration \n     Coalition. ``We still don't believe the American people \n     really intended to throw elderly people out onto the street \n     in the name of welfare reform,'' she said.\n       ``No one that I know of argues with the idea of people \n     being responsible for the folks they bring into the country, \n     but I think that for immigrants, like everyone else, \n     unforeseen things happen,'' McHugh added.\n       Federal officials have since loosened citizenship rules for \n     the disabled, but have not moved to reinstate benefits to \n     unforeseen hardship cases, McHugh said.\n       Pro-immigration activists like McHugh worry that the \n     philosophical shift from federal to local responsibility \n     implied in welfare overhauls is not accompanied by a shift \n     of money from federal to local coffers.\n       Such may be the case for SSI. Current state budget \n     proposals would provide a maximum of $350 in vouchers to \n     people like Boyack and Lopez, according to Terrance McGarth, \n     spokesman of the State Department of Social Services.\n       So if both qualify for the maximum, their families or \n     charities would have to bridge the $200-plus gap between \n     their SSI benefits and the new state benefits.\n       Not all noncitizens face this peril. Immigrants granted \n     asylum and refugees were excluded, and anyone who can show \n     roughly 10 years of work, even combined with their spouse's \n     work history, can remain on the rolls.\n       SSI benefits are administered by the Social Security \n     Administration, but they come from general tax revenues, not \n     Social Security taxes.\n       Boyack, who worked off the books as a nanny, never paid \n     federal income taxes. Lopez did, but not for the required 10 \n     years. Neither woman's husband ever came to the United \n     States, so they cannot be counted in the work experience \n     minimum; both men are deceased.\n       Activists say women like Lopez and Boyack are victims of \n     flawed reasoning behind welfare cuts for immigrants, a \n     population that frequently works off the books or has not \n     been in the United States long enough to draw meaningful \n     Social Security benefits, SSI becomes their only alternative, \n     by default.\n       That option is about to disappear.\n       ``I feel very worried and sad,'' said Lucrecia Lopez. ``I \n     asked myself, `How am I going to support myself?' And so many \n     people are having the same thing happen.'' SSI and Welfare \n     law.\n       Supplemental Security Income was established in 1974 to \n     provide monthly payments for the aged, blind and disabled. It \n     is run by the Social Security Administration, but draws its \n     resource from general tax revenues. SSI pays out about $2.4 \n     billion per month to nearly 6 million beneficiaries.\n       Nationwide, 12 percent of those recipients are legal \n     immigrants, or were when they applied for SSI benefits. On \n     Long Island, 19.8 percent of recipients are legal immigrants, \n     or were when they applied.\n       Nationwide, 522,000 immigrant SSI recipients could become \n     ineligible under welfare revisions to take effect in August. \n     On Long Island, 4,929 are likely to lose SSI. An additional \n     2,552 will be asked to show evidence of eligibility, but are \n     not considered in jeopardy.\n       According to the Social Security Administration, welfare \n     changes will cut off all noncitizen immigrants from SSI \n     benefits except:\n       Refugees and immigrants granted asylum, who are eligible \n     only for the first five years after arrival.\n       Immigrants whose deportation has been suspended; \n     eligibility is limited to the first five years after arrival.\n       Certain active-duty military personnel, including honorably \n     discharged veterans, their spouses and dependent children.\n       Permanent residents who can document 10 years of work by \n     themselves or in conjunction with a spouse. * * * Immigrants \n     and SSI Percent of SSI recipients who are classified by the \n     Social Security Administration as legal immigrants:\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Welfare Reform Starts Hitting Home\n\n                          (By Kathy Matheson)\n\n       Changes mandated by federal welfare reform are beginning to \n     ripple slowly through Montgomery County, but not slowly \n     enough for Silver Spring resident Marta Medina.\n\n[[Page S2127]]\n\n       Medina, who came to America in 1987 after fleeing civil war \n     and communism back home in Nicaragua, received notice earlier \n     this month that her Supplemental Security Income benefits \n     will end in August unless she becomes an American citizen or \n     meets one of five other narrow criteria.\n       Medina has received SSI checks for three years since \n     breaking her arm and injuring her back while working at a \n     hotel in San Antonio. SSI, which is run by the Social \n     Security Administration, is a federal assistance program for \n     elderly and disabled people with low incomes.\n       Through an interpreter, Medina said she needs the monthly \n     $484 SSI check she receives from the government to buy \n     medication for lingering physical and emotional problems she \n     suffered as a result of the accident. She is currently \n     unemployed.\n       To find out how she may still qualify for disability \n     benefits, Medina and her husband, Luis, met with SSI \n     officials last week at a special office in Wheaton Plaza.\n       ``We want to know what we can do,'' said Luis Medina.\n       The Medinas are not alone. Under the Welfare Reform Act \n     signed by President Clinton last year, most legal immigrants \n     are no longer eligible for SSI.\n       Approximately 4,000 Montgomery County immigrant residents \n     receive SSI checks each month, and they, too, will be getting \n     notification letters soon. About 400 letters are going out \n     each week, and recipients have 90 days to respond and have \n     their eligibility re-evaluated.\n       To meet the anticipated response, officials at the Wheaton \n     Social Security office have leased a former Crestar Bank \n     facility at Wheaton Plaza and staffed it with five new \n     workers to evaluate cases like Medina's.\n       Rich Fenton, manager of the Wheaton office, said the \n     temporary site currently handles about 25 to 30 people per \n     day. But he expects visits from as many as 50 to 60 people \n     each day as more residents are notified.\n       ``I'm expecting that the volume will increase pretty \n     substantially,'' Fenton said.\n       SSA spokesman Tom Margenau said out of 6.5 million SSI \n     recipients nationwide, approximately 900,000 are legal \n     immigrants. Benefit checks will stop flowing to an estimated \n     500,000 of those, according to federal officials, resulting \n     in government savings of $9.9 billion through 2002.\n       The government also will save money by cracking down on SSI \n     fraud, officials said. SSA's Office of the Inspector General \n     closed 833 fraud cases in fiscal 1996, spokesman Dan Devlin \n     said.\n       States also may save money when immigrants lose their SSI \n     benefits. As non-citizen residents are removed from SSI, \n     Margenau said most also will lose Medicaid benefits, which \n     come from a state program administered through the county \n     Department of Health and Human Services.\n       Local officials are unsure how many people may be dropped.\n       ``We don't have a good sense yet of what the numbers are,'' \n     said Corinne Stevens, chief of Montgomery County's Crisis, \n     Income and Victim Services. ``So many people, if they're able \n     to, are really moving toward citizenship.''\n       Marta Medina said she would like to be a U.S. citizen, \n     especially since Helane DiGravio, an interpreter and manager \n     of the temporary SSI site in Wheaton, said it doesn't look \n     like Medina will qualify for SSI any other way.\n       ``She's going to apply for citizenship, but she knows it'll \n     take a while,'' DiGravio said.\n       Medina, who holds a college degree from a university in \n     Guatemala, has lived in the United States for 10 years, twice \n     as long as needed to become a citizen. Her husband, who is \n     unemployed but does not receive SSI, has been here since \n     1989.\n       Marta Medina said she knows education and work are needed \n     to get ahead in America, and she'd like to take training \n     courses for home health care workers offered by the county's \n     Workforce Development Corp., formerly called the Private \n     Industry Council.\n       But Medina said that as a result of her emotional problems \n     and injuries from her hotel job, she hasn't felt well enough \n     to enroll in job training or English classes, or to study for \n     the citizenship test.\n       Some experts argue that the test, which requires knowledge \n     of the English language as well as American government, is \n     not difficult to pass--especially for someone who has been \n     here as long as Medina.\n       ``The language exams are extraordinarily easy,'' said \n     Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative \n     think tank based in Washington. ``The language exam does not \n     pose much of a barrier, partly because you can take it over \n     and over and over.''\n       Rector was a major congressional adviser during the welfare \n     reform debate in 1996. When the law was finally signed, \n     Clinton was criticized for excluding legal residents from SSI \n     benefits, since many have worked and paid taxes for years \n     just like U.S. citizens.\n       Some states, including Maryland, are considering picking up \n     the tab for immigrant residents denied SSI. Margenau said \n     there are 9,645 immigrant SSI recipients in Maryland--about \n     half of whom live in Montgomery County--receiving average \n     monthly benefits of $345.\n       Gov. Parris N. Glendening has said he wants to continue \n     food and medical support for children of legal immigrants who \n     would otherwise be cut off, Glendening spokesman Ray Feldmann \n     said.\n       The governor appointed a Task Force on the Loss of SSI \n     Benefits for Legal Immigrants in Maryland, which issued a \n     draft report Feb. 6. Its findings have not yet been made \n     public.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Nogales International, Feb. 21, 1997]\n\n          Hundreds of Non-Citizens Here Legally Face Aid Loss\n\n                         (By Kathy Vandervoet)\n\n       Hundreds of non-citizens living legally in Nogales or other \n     Santa Cruz County communities will lose their supplemental \n     Social Security income this summer under the new federal \n     welfare reform law.\n       They will no longer be eligible for food stamps, cash \n     welfare, Medicaid and disability.\n       Roberto Mendez, manager of the Nogales Social Security \n     Administration office, said there are 1,300 individuals \n     receiving the supplemental payments.\n       Of those, 475 are legal residents, but not citizens of the \n     United States. All are subject to losing their monthly \n     benefits checks in about four months, he said.\n       ``But there aren't going to be that many. There will be \n     exceptions,'' Mendez said.\n       It's up to the men and women to visit the office, located \n     at 441 No. Grand Ave., to determine if they fit under the \n     exceptions clause.\n       The 475 recipients are being notified by a letter, which \n     are being sent out in weekly batches. Some will receive their \n     letter earlier than others, Mendez said.\n       They then have 90 days to comply if they want to retain \n     their monthly check.\n       Those who will qualify for continued aid have worked and \n     earned 40 quarters of coverage, Mendez said.\n       It can be the individual, a parent, a husband, a wife or \n     the combination of a couple's work to arrive at the 40 \n     quarters total, he said.\n       Mendez said he is urging concerned recipients, some of whom \n     have lived in the United States for 20 or 30 years, to earn \n     their U.S. citizenship.\n       ``I refer a lot of them to the public library for their \n     citizenship program,'' Mendez said. He's been told it takes \n     about eight months from the time a person applies until he or \n     she meets the citizenship requirements.\n       As well, the person must have been a permanent U.S. \n     resident for five years.

Mr. President, with sadness, I rise today to pay \ntribute to a remarkable Member of this body and a very dear friend, the \nsenior Senator from Kentucky, Wendell Ford. Senator Ford has announced \nhis retirement after a third of a century in public service, including \nthe last 22 years in the U.S. Senate. When Wendell Ford leaves the \nSenate at the end of next year to return to his family and his beloved \nKentucky, I will miss his leadership and his friendship tremendously.\n  For the past 3 years, it has been my pleasure to serve with Senator \nFord in the Democratic leadership in my capacity as conference \nsecretary. Since 1990 Senator Ford has served in the leadership as \nDemocratic whip, where he has been an energetic leader and has had a \npositive impact on the Senate's agenda. During the years I have served \nwith him I have appreciated his good advice and his no-nonsense style. \nSenator Ford's insights into the issues and problems we address in the \nSenate, as well as his good word, have made him a valuable and trusted \nleader. Our leadership, the Senate, and most of all the State of \nKentucky have greatly benefited from his service.\n  Throughout his career in public service, Senator Ford has remained \ntrue to his constituents by being a strong advocate for his home State \nof Kentucky. He knows that a Senator's ultimate responsibility is to \nthe people of his State. As a result of his advocacy and his honesty, \nKentucky voters have returned him to Washington three times with \nlandslide election victories.\n  Senator Ford has also served as an advocate for the Senate. As \nchairman of the Rules Committee he has helped ensure the smooth \noperation of the Senate and has been a leader in looking for ways to \nmake the Senate work more efficiently. As a member of the Committees on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation, as well as Energy and Natural \nResources, Senator Ford has been at the center of many of our most \nimportant national debates.\n  I believe that I speak for all of my colleagues when I say that the \ndeparture of Senator Ford will leave a huge\n\n[[Page S2128]]\n\nvoid in this institution. He has been an effective leader, a strong \nlegislator, a fearless defender of his State, and a good friend. As he \napproaches retirement, I want to thank Wendell Ford for his service to \nhis country and congratulate him for his extraordinary career. We will \ntruly miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2127-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE 86TH BIRTHDAY OF ARNOLD ARONSON\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to wish Arnie \nAronson a happy 86th birthday and to commend him on his many \nachievements.\n  Arnie has been working for civil rights for over 50 years. He began \nat a time when help wanted ads openly specified ``Gentile only'' or \n``Irish need not apply.'' In the early 1940's he organized a coalition \nof religious, ethnic, civil rights, social welfare, and labor \norganizations into the Chicago Council Against Religious and Racial \nDiscrimination. By 1950 he was working with Roy Wilkins and many others \nto organize support for President Truman's proposed civil rights effort \nand engineered the combination of national organizations that created \nthe Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.\n  He and the leadership Conference were instrumental in the enactment \nof the first extensive Federal civil rights laws since Reconstruction, \nthe landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act, the fundamental Voting Rights Act \nof 1965, and the pivotal Fair Housing Act of 1968. They have been \ncritical to our civil rights efforts at every turn every since.\n  The statement of purpose he drafted for the Leadership Conference \nsays a great deal about this extraordinary man and his dedication to \nthe rights of all:\n\n       We are committed to an integrated, democratic, plural \n     society in which every individual is accorded equal rights, \n     equal opportunities and equal justice and in which every \n     group is accorded an equal opportunity to enter fully into \n     the general life of the society with mutual acceptance and \n     regard for difference.\n\n  Arnie went on to help organize clergy, churches, and synagogues. He \nwas a founding member of the National Urban Coalition and a charter \nmember of Common Cause. In the last 10 years, while well in his 70's, \nhe assumed the presidency of the Leadership Conference Education Fund \nand helped invigorate its educational and public service activities.\n  While he gave leadership and inspiration to the country he never \nforgot his family. I know the influence he had on his niece and nephew, \nJenette and Si Kahn.\n  Their lives were changed as were ours. I wish him a happy birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2128-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to provide surveillance, research, and services aimed \nat prevention of birth defects, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                THE BIRTH DEFECTS PREVENTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Birth Defects \nPrevention Act of 1997. I introduce this on behalf of myself, Senators \nLott, Daschle, Hollings, Hutchinson of Arkansas, Cochran, Kohl, Inouye, \nMoynihan, Chafee, and Breaux.\n  The March of Dimes and their volunteers are here today to lend \nsupport to an often overlooked, but a very compelling health care \nproblem in the\n\n[[Page S2130]]\n\nUnited States today. Many people do not realize that birth defects are \nthe leading cause of infant deaths in the United States. This year \nalone, an estimated 150,000 babies will be born with a serious birth \ndefect, and one out of every five of these babies will die. Nationally, \nbirth defects affect 3 percent of all births, and among the babies who \nsurvive, birth defects are a significant cause of lifelong disability. \nDepending on the particular type of problem and its severity, special \nmedical treatment, education, rehabilitation and other services may be \nrequired into adulthood, costing billions of dollars each year.\n  A 1995 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report revealed \nthat the lifetime cost for just 18 common birth defects occurring in a \nsingle year is $8 billion. Yet, only about 22 percent of those born \nwith birth defects are included in these figures. And, of course, it is \nimpossible to measure the pain and the heartache that birth defects \ncause.\n  Let me share with you just a couple of experiences I have had in \nMissouri. I have worked for a long time to improve children's health. I \nappropriated money in the early 1970's in Missouri to fund the high-\ncost, but highly effective, neonatal care units at our hospitals. They \ndo a wonderful job of saving very-low-birth-weight babies and babies \nwith severe defects. But that is not enough. We can do some things to \nlower the incidence of birth defects, and birth defects can strike any \nfamily.\n  I know, many people say one of the real problems is we have too many \nyoung women, often unmarried, who do not know that you cannot use \ntobacco or alcohol or drugs during pregnancy without expecting a bad \nbirth outcome.\n  But there are many other things that we have only recently learned \nthat are extremely important. Four hundred milligrams a day of folic \nacid, vitamin B, for women of childbearing years can substantially \nreduce the risk of a child born with spina bifida. A very good friend \nof ours had a child born with spina bifida. He was a wonderful young \nman, but he has had to go through many expensive operations. His \nparents went through much heartache, and he still is not able to move \nas the rest of us can.\n  Birth defects can be dealt with if we have a concerted national \nstrategy to direct the Centers for Disease Control to collect the \ninformation on birth defects, to provide funding and support in \nresearch at the State level and to set up five regional centers to deal \nwith birth defects. A few years ago, the incidence of birth defects \nbecame a very major concern in certain Hispanic communities in \nsouthwest Texas, and, as a result, the Hispanic caucus joined with me \nin past years, in past sessions of Congress, to sponsor this \nlegislation.\n  We were able to appropriate some moneys for the Centers for Disease \nControl, but we have not been able to establish a national strategy, \nmaybe because there are not lobbyists for those who have not yet been \nborn who may be at risk of birth defects, but there are effective \nspokespeople, like the March of Dimes, the American Academy of \nPediatrics, and a long list of distinguished organizations.\n  The time has come to join with them, with the Easter Seals Society, \nthe American Hospital Association, and all of the other organizations, \nin developing and directing the Centers for Disease Control to work \nwith States and local governments to survey birth defects, to bring \ntogether the information on birth defects so that researchers have a \nmeans of dealing with it.\n  Mr. President, birth defects are the leading cause of infant death in \nthe United States. This year alone, an estimated 150,000 babies will be \nborn with a serious birth defect, and 1 out of every 5 of these babies \nwill die.\n  In addition, birth defects affect 3 percent of all births nationally.\n  Among babies who survive, birth defects are a significant cause of \nlifelong disability. Depending on the particular type of problem and \nits severity, special medical treatment, education, rehabilitation, and \nother services may be required into adulthood--costing billions of \ndollars each year.\n  A 1995 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report revealed \nthat the lifetime cost for just 18 common birth defects occurring in a \nsingle year is $8 billion--yet only about 22 percent of those born with \nbirth defects are included in these figures.\n  And, of course, it is impossible to measure the pain and heartache \nthat birth defects cause.\n  It may surprise you to learn that the United States does not have a \ncoordinated strategy for reducing the incidence of birth defects. It is \nboth shocking and disappointing how few Federal resources are devoted \nto prevent this tragic, perhaps even partly preventable public health \nproblem.\n  So today, in an effort to tackle this devastating problem head on, I \nam introducing the Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1997. Congressmen \nSolomon Ortiz and Henry Bonilla are simultaneously introducing this \nbill in the House of Representatives.\n  This bill will prioritize our efforts and make congressional intent \nclear--more resources should be directed to the prevention of the \nleading killer of babies, birth defects.\n  An unfortunate situation in the State of Texas a few years ago \nexemplifies how the lack of a birth defects prevention strategy delayed \nthe response to an outbreak of birth defects and may have needlessly \ncost innocent lives. Health professionals in Texas observed that six \ninfants were born with anencephaly over a 6-week period. Anencephaly is \na fetal birth defect characterized by an absence of brain tissue.\n  The Texas Department of Health conducted a study after this \ninformation was reported. The study revealed that since 1989, at least \n30 infants in south Texas had been born without or with little brain \ntissue. However, because Texas did not have a birth defects \nsurveillance program, the severity of the problem was not recognized \nuntil the incidence of anencephaly was so high that it was difficult to \nmiss.\n  This tragic event in south Texas underscores the need for a \ncoordinated national effort to research the causes of birth defects and \nto prevent such defects from occurring in the first place. A little \nprevention goes a long way in preventing family pain and heartache. It \nis up to our Nation to seize on this excellent opportunity to protect \nour most vulnerable resources--our children.\n  To achieve the goal of protecting our Nation's kids, this legislation \ndoes several things.\n  First, the bill provides Federal grants to State health authorities \nfor the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and reporting birth defects \nstatistics. Today, only about half of the States have some kind of \nbirth defects surveillance system.\n  Second, this legislation calls for the establishment of at least five \nregional centers of birth defects prevention research. These regional \nprograms will collect and analyze information on the number, incidence, \nand causes of birth defects within a region as well as provide \neducation and training for health professionals aimed at the prevention \nof birth defects.\n  At least one of the centers will focus on birth defects among ethnic \nminorities.\n  Third, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] is \ndirected to be the coordinating agency for birth defects prevention \nactivities. The CDC will serve as a clearinghouse for the collection \nand storage of data generated from State and regional birth defects \nmonitoring programs.\n  Finally, grants will be available to State departments of health, \nuniversities, or other private, or nonprofit entities to develop and \nimplement birth defect prevention strategies, such as programs using \nfolic acid vitamin supplements to prevent spina bifida and alcohol \navoidance strategies to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome.\n  Again, when we talk about birth defects, it is important to note that \nmany birth defects are preventable. For instance, we now know that a \nsimple 400 mg dose of the B vitamin folic acid each day could prevent \n50 to 70 percent of all cases of spina bifida and anencephaly--saving \nabout $245 million annually and more importantly, saving some families \nthe heart ache that many of us have witnessed friends and families go \nthrough.\n  We must broaden public and professional awareness of birth defects \nand prevention opportunities, and we must have a coordinated national \nstrategy to achieve this goal.\n  The economic and emotional burden of birth defects on families and \nsociety\n\n[[Page S2131]]\n\nas a whole presents a vivid, human picture of the need for a national \nresearch and prevention strategy.\n  Although infant mortality in the United States has been falling \nsteadily over the past few decades, 25 other countries have lower \ninfant mortality rates than the United States.\n  This bill is an important step in improving the health of our Nation. \nThe tragedy of birth defects compels our Nation to become a stronger \npartner for charitable and medical groups in fulfilling our obligation \nto protect our Nation's most vulnerable population. Let us hope that \nmore tragedies are not necessary to push Congress into action.\n  This legislation has the support of many national organizations, \nincluding: the March of Dimes Foundation, the Spina Bifida Association \nof America, American Academy of Pediatrics, National Association of \nChildren's Hospitals, the National Easter Seals Society, American \nAssociation of Mental Retardation, Association of Maternal and Child \nHealth Programs, and the American Hospital Association.\n  The bill also has broad bipartisan support.\n  Let me conclude by taking special note of the help of the National \nand Missouri March of Dimes, as well as numerous health and child \nadvocate organizations, for their assistance in developing and \nadvocating this legislation. Specifically, I wish to thank Dr. Jennifer \nHowse, Jo Merrill, and Marina Weiss of the March of Dimes for their \npersistence and commitment to this endeavor.\n  Mr. President, I send a copy of the bill to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 419\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Birth \n     Defects Prevention Act of 1997''.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Birth defects are the leading cause of infant \n     mortality, directly responsible for one out of every five \n     infant deaths.\n       (2) Thousands of the 150,000 infants born with a serious \n     birth defect annually face a lifetime of chronic disability \n     and illness.\n       (3) Birth defects threaten the lives of infants of all \n     racial and ethnic backgrounds. However, some conditions pose \n     excess risks for certain populations. For example, compared \n     to all infants born in the United States, Hispanic-American \n     infants are more likely to be born with anencephaly spina \n     bifida and other neural tube defects and African-American \n     infants are more likely to be born with sickle-cell anemia.\n       (4) Birth defects can be caused by exposure to \n     environmental hazards, adverse health conditions during \n     pregnancy, or genetic mutations. Prevention efforts are \n     slowed by lack of information about the number and causes of \n     birth defects.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to phase in \nby the year 2000 a 100 percent deduction for the health insurance costs \nof self-employed individuals; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            The Health Insurance Cost Tax Equity Act of 1997\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nHealth Insurance Cost Tax Equity Act of 1997, which is legislation to \nfinally put our Nation's sole proprietors on par with their larger \ncorporate competitors with respect to the tax treatment of health \ninsurance costs.\n  Last summer in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct, Congress took a great stride in addressing one of urgent tax \nmatters facing our family farmers and ranchers. This act, which was \npassed by Congress and signed into law by the President, included a \nproposal to increase the amount that farmers, ranchers and other sole \nproprietors may deduct for their health insurance costs to 80 percent \nby the year 2006, a significant improvement from its current level of \n40 percent.\n  But we cannot stop at this point. It is indefensible that our tax \nlaws tell some of our biggest corporations that they still can deduct \n100 percent of their health insurance costs, while others, mostly \nsmaller businesses, are told they can deduct only a smaller share of \ntheir health insurance costs.\n  This provision is absolutely critical to the health care concerns of \nfarmers, ranchers and small business owners who conduct their \nbusinesses as sole proprietors. That is why I'm reintroducing \nlegislation this year to ensure complete fairness in the Tax Code for \nsole proprietors who acquire health insurance coverage for themselves \nand their families. My bill will increase the deduction for the health \ninsurance costs of the self-employed to 60 percent and 80 percent in \n1998 and 1999, respectively. After that, Americans who work for \nthemselves could deduct 100 percent of their insurance costs, just as \nlarge corporations do.\n  The health of a farm family or small business owner is no less \nimportant than the health of the president of a large corporation, and \nthe Internal Revenue Code should reflect this simple fact.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation. It promotes tax \njustice and the well-being of our independent producers and the entire \ncountry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 421. A bill to amend title 35, United States Code, to establish \nthe Patent and Trademark Office as a Government corporation, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               THE PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE REFORM ACT\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I reintroduce the Patent \nand Trademark Office Reform Act, a bill to establish the Patent and \nTrademark Office as a Government corporation and to provide needed \nreforms to its operations. The handful of changes I have made from the \nlegislation I sponsored in the last Congress are designed to provide \nassurance to the Office's users that their fees will only be applied \ntoward Patent and Trademark Office purposes and additional protections \nto the Office's employees.\n  Our country's Patent and Trademark Office is one of the finest in the \nworld. It has been and continues to be integral to America's \ncompetitiveness and economic growth. It is no exaggeration to state \nthat tens of millions of jobs have been created as a result of the \nPTO's actions. I have seen first-hand the benefits of this Office in my \nhome State of New Jersey, which although it is the ninth most populated \nState in the Union, receives the third largest number of patents per \ncapita. Despite the comparative quality of work of the current PTO, \nlaws and regulations outside of the control of the PTO's management \nhave prevented it from being as efficient as it should be, and as its \nusers deserve. And unless remedied by legislation, certain \ncircumstances that I will detail below will cause PTO's performance to \ndecrease dramatically.\n  The Patent and Trademark Office is currently subject to the same \nprocurement and personnel requirements, including personnel ceilings, \nas other Federal agencies. While these requirements make sense and, \nindeed, are essential for other Government entities, they hinder the \neffectiveness of the PTO and are not appropriate for a completely user \nfee-funded agency. By converting the PTO into a Government corporation, \nwe would free the Office from most of these laws and regulations, but \nwould keep its inherently governmental function within the Federal \nGovernment and its work would be continued by federal employees.\n  Mr. President, the new PTO will be a wholly owned Government \ncorporation run by a commissioner and two assistants. They will report \nto the Secretary of Commerce on patent and trademark policy matters \nonly. Like my bill from the last Congress, I have inserted a firewall \nto prevent the Commerce Department from interfering with internal \nmanagement decisions of the Office, as opposed to policy decisions. My \nlegislation establishes an Office of the Under Secretary for \nIntellectual Property within the Commerce Department. The Under \nSecretary will ensure both attention to intellectual property issues \nat the Cabinet level and a coordinated Government approach to these \nmatters.\n\n  The new PTO will be able to procure equipment, supplies, even office \nspace without the constraints of the Brooks Act, the Public Buildings \nAct, and the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act. These \nchanges are in response to criticism of undue procurement delays that \nhave resulted in lower quality products at higher costs to the Office. \nMy legislation would also permit PTO to lease, buy, or build office \nspace that is more practical for PTO's needs. Currently, PTO is spread \nthroughout over a dozen buildings, which is not only inconvenient for \nits employees, it's inefficient.\n\n[[Page S2133]]\n\n  Much of the work performed at the PTO requires specialized skills. \nThose skills are the main reason that the PTO's employees are so highly \nsought by the private sector. Limited by the general schedule and an \noverly structured employee classification system, the Office has been \nhindered in its ability to retain a large number of its workers. My \nlegislation will enable the new PTO to provide its employees with \ncompetitive pay so that it might keep and hire top talent. The Office \nwill no longer be subject to personnel ceilings, including those \nestablished in the Federal WorkForce Restructuring Act of 1994. There \nwill also be a one-year carry-over of all PTO employees during the \ntransition from the current PTO to the PTO as a Government corporation.\n  One of the more significant differences between the bill I am \nintroducing today and the one I sponsored last Congress involves \npersonnel issues. Although both bills give the new PTO the flexibility \nto competitively compensate its employees, S. 421 permits collective \nbargaining over pay and other important terms and conditions of \nemployment. This increased employee participation will provide an \nessential balance to needed managerial flexibility. I have also \nestablished a floor on basic pay for current PTO employees so that they \nwill be assured of receiving no less then they do now after PTO becomes \na Government corporation.\n  Mr. President, this bill would give the users, who have fully funded \nthe Office's operations since 1991, an advisory role over such matters \nas PTO's performance, fees, and budget. This advisory board will review \nand recommend changes to promote the Office's patent and trademark \noperations. This board will be comprised of 12 persons selected by the \nPresident and Congress who will serve for 4-year terms and who will \nmeet at least quarterly. The Commissioner is required to consult with \nthe board prior to changing or proposing to change fees or regulations. \nThe board will submit an annual report containing its review of the \nOffice to the President, the Commissioner, and Congress.\n  In addition to the oversight of the Office's operations provided by \nthe advisory board, I have included safeguards to ensure the new PTO \nremains accountable to Congress and its users. The new Office will have \nits own inspector general, who will be appointed by the President, to \ninvestigate waste, fraud, and abuse. The Office's annual financial \nstatements will be audited by either an independent CPA or the \nComptroller General, and the results of such audits shall be provided \nto Congress. Furthermore, the new PTO is required to submit annual \nmanagement reports to Congress and business-like budgets to the \nPresident. These reports and budgets must include statements on cash \nflows, operations, financial position, and internal accounting and \nadministrative control systems.\n  Congress will continue to set the user fees for the new Office, and \nthus, control, to a large extent, the PTO's revenue stream. This should \nprovide comfort to my colleagues and the PTO's users concerned that, \nwith its new-found freedom, the Office will move into plush offices or \npay its employees unwarranted sums. I realize the decision to keep the \nfee-setting authority with Congress is counter to most government \ncorporations. Hopefully we can revisit this issue in a few years after \nwe see how well the new PTO is performing.\n  Mr. President, there is one last difference between S. 421 and the \nbill I introduced 2 years ago that I would like to discuss today and \nthat involves the patent surcharge fee. When Congress created the \npatent surcharge fee in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, \nit was done to make the Office completely user fee funded, and \ntherefore, to reduce the budget deficit. Although the surcharge, which \namounted to an almost 70 percent increase in fees, was intended to be \napplied only to Patent and Trademark Office uses, Congress has diverted \napproximately $140 million over the past 6 fiscal years for unrelated \npurposes. Until this year, the administration has not advocated, nor \neven supported, such action. In the President's proposed budget for \nfiscal year 1998, however, over $90 million of the patent surcharge \naccount will be applied for deficit reduction. In following fiscal \nyears, the administration has proposed diverting all of the patent \nsurcharge fees through 2002.\n  As the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, I understand the \nstrain on the administration and on this body to balance the budget. \nThis is a goal supported by colleagues on both sides of the aisle. \nWhile I share the administration's budget priorities and commend the \nPresident for putting forth a budget that balances in 2002, I \nregretfully disagree with this component of his budget. Should this \nproposed diversion be enacted, the PTO would be prevented from hiring \nover 500 patent examiners this year, and patent pendency rates would \ndouble from the current 21 months to an estimated 42 months by 2003. \nThe PTO projects that this delay will reduce PTO's revenues by \nover $400 million in lost issue and maintenance fees on top of the lost \n$570 million in surcharge fees. Not only will PTO suffer from this \ndiversion, our economy will as well. Doubling the pendency times will \nslow the development of new technologies, hurt our productivity, and \nput us at a competitive disadvantage in the world marketplace.\n\n  Mr. President, the legislation I introduced in the last Congress \nwould have ended the patent surcharge fee in October 1, 1998. However, \nI am now convinced that the PTO needs the fees it should receive from \nthe surcharge to make necessary hires and improvements to the Office's \noperations. Therefore, S. 421 continues the surcharge but reclassifies \nit as an ``offsetting collection'' like all other PTO user fees rather \nthan an ``offsetting receipt.'' This modification to the 1990 OBRA \nwould ensure that these fees are only applied toward PTO uses.\n  Mr. President, although I might disagree with the administration on \nthe surcharge diversion issue, the President and the Vice-President, in \nparticular, deserve commendation for their support of reinventing the \nPatent and Trademark Office. The Vice President has been a tireless \nadvocate on reforming Government and making it more responsive to the \npublic. It is my understanding that the administration will soon send \nits own PTO reform legislation to Capitol Hill. The legislation I am \nintroducing today is merely the starting point for discussion and I \nlook forward to working with the administration to advance the concepts \nI have described above.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the efforts of my colleagues and \nformer colleagues in both Houses for their contributions on this issue. \nUnbeknownst to many Members, we came very close to enacting PTO \ngovernment corporation legislation in the last Congress, largely due to \nthe work of Senator Hatch and former Representatives Moorhead and \nSchroeder. I am pleased to note that Representative Moorhead's \nsuccessor, Representative Coble, has continued the momentum and his \nJudiciary subcommittee favorably reported out a patent bill last week \nthat contained a PTO government corporation section as well as \nprotection against patent surcharge fee diversion.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support this bill, which \nwill provide the means to improve the Patent and Trademark Office's \noperations and which will make the Office more accountable to its \nusers. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 421\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to define the circumstances under which DNA samples \nmay be collected, stored, and analyzed, and genetic information may be \ncollected, stored, analyzed, and disclosed, to define the rights of \nindividuals and persons with respect to genetic information, to define \nthe responsibilities of persons with respect to genetic information, to \nprotect individuals and families from genetic discrimination, to \nestablish uniform rules that protect individual genetic privacy, and to \nestablish effective mechanisms to enforce the rights and \nresponsibilities established under this act; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n     THE GENETIC CONFIDENTIALITY AND NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, I rise today to \nintroduce a measure, the title of which will be the Genetic \nConfidentiality and Nondiscrimination Act of 1997.\n  Let me just suggest, during the last 2 weeks at every turn we have \nseen and heard reports of the latest achievements in the advancement of \ngenetic technologies. Man has been controlling the genetics of domestic \nanimals and plants for many thousands of years, but the latest \nannouncements about the cloning of sheep and monkeys have been \nparticularly dramatic. Most of the drama arises from the media \nspeculation that follows about the possibility of cloning human beings.\n  Such an event is widely viewed as next to impossible because the \nscientific community and officers of Federal funding and oversight \nvigorously reject the concept of creating genetic copies of human \nbeings. But what these new events do bring home to us, and what is of \nsignificance to us, is that genetics is important in our daily lives \nnow.\n  Let me suggest that the time has come to protect information about \nhuman genetics that has been obtained by researchers or otherwise from \nindividual human beings, individual citizens of this country.\n  I have a rather detailed bill, in which Senator Dodd is joining me, \nas is Senator Jeffords, the chairman of the Labor, Health and Human \nResources Committee. This will actually say that what we are going to \nhave to get is the consent of the person whose genetic information we \nintend to use in almost any way. We know that genetic information is \njust as significant as fingerprints of the past in terms of identifying \npeople.\n  Much can be determined about a person's life, about a person's \nfuture, from genetic information. Now is the time to have a serious \ndebate in the U.S. Congress about how that information should be \nprotected. The bill which I introduce will begin that dialogue in the \nappropriate committee.\n  I send to the desk the bill. For those who have been giving us \nconstructive information about it, this is the very last draft after \nmany people in industry, in the biotechnology community, and in the \ncommunity of genetics have given us information. I have a side by side \non this bill and a detailed statement explaining it. I send them all to \nthe desk and ask that the bill be referred to the appropriate \ncommittee.\n  Now I yield to my good friend, Senator Dodd, from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. Let me \nbegin my brief remarks by commending our colleague from New Mexico for, \nonce again, taking leadership on a significant health issue. I have had \nthe privilege, Mr. President, of working with my colleague from New \nMexico, Senator Domenici, on numerous issues, most recently things like \nfrivolous lawsuits and mental health. I am delighted to join him as a \nprincipal cosponsor of this proposal of the Genetic Confidentiality and \nNondiscrimination Act of 1997.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is critically important. It deals \nwith basic concerns that people have today. It is of critical \nimportance to our country, important to individuals and to researchers. \nWe are not claiming here this is perfect, but the kind of work that \nSenator Domenici has done already, in communication with those who \nwould be most directly interested in the legislation, I think has taken \nus a long way.\n  We are fortunate, Mr. President, to live in an extraordinary--an \nextraordinary--crossroads in the history of our Nation and, indeed, of \nour species. I can only compare it, Mr. President, to the dawn of the \nnuclear age. Then, by the elemental act of splitting an atom, we became \nable to generate seemingly unlimited energy but, also, as we all know, \nthe ability to destroy all forms of human life.\n  Today, Mr. President, we stand at the dawn of the genetic age and \nonce again confront heretofore unknown power over our destiny on this \nsmall planet. The recent reports of the cloning of mammals places this \npower in sharp relief. Within a few short years, Mr. President, the \nhuman genome project will decipher the entire human genetic code. The \nentire genetic human code will be deciphered in our lifetime, providing \na blueprint of a human being's most personal and potent information.\n  This blueprint, Mr. President, will hopefully allow us to understand \nand remedy illnesses in all its forms. We are already reaping some of \nthe benefits of this newfound knowledge of our genetic makeup. Genetic \ntesting, as many are already aware, is available for several serious \ndiseases and illnesses, including breast cancer and colon cancer. Armed \nwith this genetic information, individuals can take additional steps to \nsafeguard their health. For instance, more frequent screenings and \ncheckups.\n\n  However, Mr. President, it will allow the exploitation of the human \nfrailty to which one might be genetically predisposed, and concerns \nhave been raised about the privacy of this information. Many Americans \nare concerned that dissemination of this information could lead to job \ndiscrimination and difficulty in getting or maintaining health \ninsurance or life insurance. These are important issues.\n  Clearly, in this area of increasing medical technology, we must be \nable to ensure a balance between scientific advancement and the privacy \nrights of individuals. This bill that my colleague from New Mexico has \noffered begins that critical process. It requires strict informed \nconsent procedures while allowing genetic scientific research to \ncontinue. Specifically, this legislation provides protections against \nunwarranted disclosure of genetic information to employers and \ninsurance companies.\n  Mr. President, I am cosponsoring this legislation because I believe \nit is important that we address these issues today rather than wait. I \nknow some have voiced concerns about this legislation. We hear them. We \nrecognize this is a complex area of law with many important interests \nat stake. In fact, Mr. President, we will be having a hearing in the \nLabor Committee this week on the issue of cloning, to which\n\n[[Page S2141]]\n\nour colleague from New Mexico will be testifying--not specifically \nabout this bill, but I suspect this bill may be the subject of some \ndialog in that hearing.\n  So we are already beginning to look to try and raise the questions \nthat people, I think, would want us to address, protecting people's \nprivacy rights, so that that information that we are able to glean will \nnot be misused. I think this is an important step in that effort. I \ncommend my colleague from New Mexico. I am delighted to cosponsor his \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I did not, in my statement, mean to tie \ncloning into this bill. It is just that all of that is part of this \nexplosion of the science of genetics and its application for various \naspects of both human and animal life in America and in the world.\n  Let me suggest that if we are going to continue research, we have \nthis major American project called the Genome Project wherein all of \nthe chromosomes of the human being are going to be mapped, all 23 pairs \nof them. We will know where most of the diseases are located within the \nchromosome system of the human being. Our scientists can then take this \ninformation and begin the long journey toward curing most of \nhumankind's serious diseases over time.\n  While all that is going on, the one thing we do not need, we do not \nneed an abuse of the information by either researchers, scientists, \ninsurance companies or the like, such that it would excite the American \npeople to turn against such research. One thing we ought to do in that \nregard is pass some kind of protection for genetic information. That is \nwhat this bill attempts to do.\n  Obviously, there is a whole field of ethics that must be really put \ntogether and nourished across the land regarding this, or we will cause \nbreakouts to occur in terms of abuse of genetic information, all of \nwhich could be very harmful to the greatest wellness effort in \nhumankind, in human history. That is, finding out the basic genetic \nstructure of the human being.\n  Mr. President, during the past 2 weeks, at every turn, we have been \nseen and heard reports of the latest achievement in the advance of \ngenetic technologies. Man has been controlling the genetics of domestic \nanimals and plants for many thousands of years, but the latest \nannouncements about cloning sheep and monkeys have been particularly \ndramatic. And most of the drama arises from the media speculation that \nfollows about the possibility of cloning humans. Such an event is \nwidely viewed as next to impossible because the scientific community \nand offices of Federal funding and oversight vigorously reject the \nconcept of creating genetic copies of human beings. But what these new \nevents do bring home to us is the grave significance of genetics in our \ndaily lives.\n  I rise today to revisit a timely and momentous issue in the discovery \nand elucidation of human genetic information--the issue of genetic \nconfidentiality and nondiscrimination.\n  The human genome project is rapidly proceeding toward its goal of \ndeciphering the human genetic code. Current projections tell us that \nthe goal of reading the entire genetic script of 3 billion nucleotides \nand some 100,000 genes of the human genome will be reached by the year \n2005, which will be several years earlier than was initially projected \nwhen the project was undertaken in 1990.\n  When the project is complete, we will have knowledge of man's \ncomplete genetic blueprint--a blueprint that is the most personal and \nmost private information that any human being can have.\n  We will have a wealth of knowledge of how our countless individual \ntraits are determined. And perhaps more important, we will have \nfundamental knowledge about the 3,000 or more genes that can cause \nsickness and sometimes even death. And we will have realized one of \nmankind's greatest scientific achievements.\n  At the time the human genome project was first brought to my \nattention 11 years ago, I realized that deciphering our genetic code \nwould have immense implications for our medical welfare. But equally \nimportant, if not more so, were the implications of genetic information \nwith respect to ethics and the law. This is why I insisted that the \nbudget for the human genome project include funds specifically \nallocated for addressing the ethical, legal, and social implications of \nour new genetic technologies.\n  Now that we have the know-how to generate genetic information on \nindividuals and their families, we find ourselves asking some very \nbasic questions about who has a right to control access to personal \ngenetic information. Should our personal physicians know this \ninformation? Our families and friends? Our insurers and employers? As \nwe begin to consider these questions, we find that they are deeply \ntroublesome issues that reach into the lives of many Americans.\n\n  Today I place before you a bill that addresses the broad issues of \ngenetic confidentiality and nondiscrimination. This legislation will \naffirm the right of the individual to have some control over his or her \nmost personal information. To be sure, much of our genetic information \nis similar--even identical--among all human beings. This is what makes \nus all members of the family of man. But much of our genetic \ninformation is also unique--it is the information that makes each human \ndistinct from all others. And it is information that can be deciphered \nfrom cells in a drop of blood or cells that are stored in a laboratory \nafter we have medical tests.\n  Our personal and unique genetic information is the essence of our \nindividuality. And today we seek to protect this information from \npublic scrutiny or disclosure without the express consent of the \nindividual who is the source of the information.\n  So, today, I, and my colleagues, Senator Jeffords and Senator Dodd \nintroduce the Genetic Confidentiality and Nondiscrimination Act of \n1997. This legislation is designed to reinforce the statutes that some \n19 state legislatures have enacted. This legislation echoes the \nconcerns of many of my colleagues in this Chamber as we all seek to \ncome to grips with this pressing and ubiquitous issue. I hope that this \nbill will invite exhaustive debate and legislative review, so that we \nwill achieve a firm national standard for individual privacy with \nrespect to genetic information.\n  The bill that I introduce today focuses on two areas of serious \nconcern.\n  The first issue is the relationship between the interests of genetics \nresearch and the individuals who selflessly participate as subjects in \nhundreds of genetics research projects. The past year, 1996, witnessed \nthe 50th anniversary of the birth of the Nuremberg Code and the public \nacknowledgement of the doctrine of informed consent for participation \nin research. Over this half century, we have repeatedly affirmed the \nright of the individual to be fully informed about any research project \nthat he or she is asked to participate in and to give voluntary consent \nto participation.\n  In this present bill we will extend the concept of informed consent \nto give each individual the right to control the deciphering of his or \nher most personal information and the disclosure of that information to \nother persons. And we will create a partnership between researchers and \nthe people--the subjects--who are the foundation of research in \ngenetics.\n\n  We might consider a recent example of genetic testing that was \ncarried out on a collection of samples that had been retained for some \nyears in a genetics laboratory. These samples had been gathered for the \npurpose of detecting carriers of a recessive gene for Tay Sachs \ndisease, a disease that invariably causes the death of infants who get \na double dose of the gene, one from each parent. The more recent \nquestion concerned the frequency of one of the breast cancer genes in \nthat population. So samples that were originally collected for one \npurpose were later used for another purpose, without the permission of \nthe people who had donated the samples and without the possibility of \ngetting any new information back to the people who had donated the \nsamples.\n  Both protection and partnership are critical as we continue to define \nour genetic legacies, particularly because\n\n[[Page S2142]]\n\ngenetics has implications in many facets of our everyday lives, \nincluding medicine, employment, insurance, education, forensics, \nfinance, and even our own self-perceptions.\n  The second issue addressed in this legislation is the relationship \nbetween individuals, on the one hand, and employers and health \ninsurers, on the other. This legislation will very simply preclude \nemployers or health insurers from requesting or requiring genotype \ninformation as a condition of employment or health insurance.\n  Many people in our society have already been discriminated against \nbecause other people had access to information about their genes. We \nwant to avoid any more situations in which healthy people are denied \nemployment or insurance when they disclose information about their \ngenes. Consider, for example, the man who acknowledged that he had \ngenes for hemochromatosis. This is a disease that can be devastating if \nuntreated, but it can be successfully treated. This man was \nsuccessfully treated and was completely healthy, but he was denied \ninsurance simply because of his genes, and this should not happen.\n  We do, however, carve out one exception to the general rule, for \nprotecting employees and coworkers from hazardous conditions or \nsituations in the workplace. For example, an employer may have a valid \nreason to know whether an employee has a genetic susceptibility to a \ncertain chemical that is a part of the work environment. So the \nexception allows a request for genetic information if it is a matter of \nimmediate business necessity.\n  I would like to be very clear that this legislation does not make it \nillegal to collect, or store, or analyze, or even disclose, an \nindividual's genetic information. It simply gives the individual \ncontrol over this process through a rigorous procedure for written, \ninformed consent. The only exceptions for individual control are \nquestions of compulsory process, such as criminal investigations, or \ncourt-ordered analyses.\n\n  Specifically, the purposes of this legislation are:\n  First, to define the circumstances under which DNA samples and \ngenetic information may be collected, stored, analyzed, and disclosed; \nsecond, to define the rights of individuals with respect to genetic \ninformation; third, to define the responsibilities of third parties \nwith respect to genetic information; fourth, to protect individuals and \nfamilies from genetic discrimination; and fifth, to establish uniform \nrules that protect individual genetic privacy.\n  The need for this legislation is clear and pressing. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues in the Senate and in the House to bring \nthis issue to a satisfactory resolution for the American people. The \nHuman Genome Project holds the greatest promise of benefits for \nmankind, but these benefits will elude us if people are afraid of the \nconsequences of deciphering their own genetic formulas.\n  I forward a summary of this bill to the desk and ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 423. A bill to extend the legislative authority for the Board of \nRegents of Gunston Hall to establish a memorial to honor George Mason; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          THE GEORGE MASON MEMORIAL ESTABLISHMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I introduce a bill to extend the \nlegislative authority for the Board of Regents of Gunston Hall to \nestablish a memorial to honor a distinguished Virginian, George Mason.\n  In 1776, George Mason wrote the Virginia Declaration of Rights, the \nfirst document in America calling for freedom of the press, freedom of \nreligion, proscription of unreasonable searches, and the right to a \nspeedy trial. The Virginia Declaration of Rights not only served as a \nmodel for our national Bill of Rights; but historians believe that \nMason's refusal to sign the Constitution for its failure, initially, to \ninclude a declaration of rights was a major impetus for eventual \nadoption of the first 10 amendments to the Constitution.\n  George Mason sacrificed friendships by insisting that a strong \nnational government could not be purchased at the cost of individual \nrights, and Mason inevitably chose his family over politics. He retired \nfrom public office following the Constitutional Convention and died \njust a few years later in 1792. His contemporaries, Thomas Jefferson \nand James Madison, lived decades longer and were elected Presidents of \nthe United States, and thus Mason's contributions were soon \novershadowed.\n  Efforts were combined during the 101st Congress to at last honor \nAmerica's ``Forgotten Founder.'' Legislation authorizing a private, \nnonprofit organization to establish a memorial to George Mason on \nFederal land in the District of Columbia passed and was signed by then-\nPresident George Bush. In the 102d Congress, a resolution concurred \nthat George Mason was an individual ``of preeminent historical \nsignificance to the nation,'' and authorized the placement of the \nmemorial within select area I lands, in sight of the memorials of two \nof Mason's closest friends: George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. The \nlegislation was signed into law on April 28, 1992, and approved by the \nNational Capital Memorial Committee in December 1993.\n  To pay homage to a man whose ideas played a prominent role in the \nfounding of the American Republic, a fitting memorial has been designed \nfor this supreme site, located between Ohio Drive and the 14th Street \nBridge, overlooking the Tidal Basin. The memorial designs have been \ncompleted and submitted for review to all necessary advisory and review \nboards and by agreement, the United States Park Service is to maintain \nthe memorial once completed. In accordance with the Commemorative Works \nAct of 1986, $1 million must be raised in non-Federal funds to \nconstruct this gift to Washington and all Americans and ground-breaking \nis ordered to occur no later than August 1997. The Board of Regents of \nGunston Hall Plantation, a historical organization that oversees \nMason's family home in Fairfax County, is dedicated to raising the \nnecessary funds for the monument and seeing this important project \nthrough to its completion, however, the August 1997 deadline is rapidly \napproaching. At this time, it seems that the fundraising effort will \nnot be completed and that's why today I introduce the necessary \nlegislation granting an extension until August 2000.\n  The Commemorative Works Act, passed into law to prevent overcrowding \non the Mall, requires two separate acts of Congress before a memorial \nmay be placed in area I lands, and both of these hurdles have been \ncleared. The final battle is a fundraising one and the Board of Regents \nof Gunston Hall has a plan of attack. Last year, they launched Liberty \n2000, a campaign to share George Mason's legacy of liberty. The Board \nof Regents hope to build an endowment fund to ensure a secure future \nfor Gunston Hall and attain the necessary non-Federal funds to break \nground and complete their efforts to bring George Mason's legacy to the \nMall. I ask that you join me in swiftly supporting this 3-year \nextension so we may properly commemorate this great statesman and \nVirginian, George Mason.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 424. A bill to adjust the Federal medical assistance percentage \ndetermined for Alaska under the Medicaid Program to reflect Alaska's \ncost of living; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 the alaska medicaid equity act of 1997\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I, along with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Stevens, introduce legislation that will more \naccurately reflect the appropriate Federal/State funding formula for \nAlaska's Medicaid Program.\n  One-sixth of Alaska's population is eligible to receive Medicaid, and \nthe population is growing. These Medicaid recipients are the needy \nchildren, pregnant women, disabled, and elderly poor of Alaska.\n  Ever since the Medicaid Program was established in 1965, the Federal/\nState funding formula has failed to recognize the extraordinarily high \ncost of living that all Alaskans face. Under current law, the funding \nformula that is used to determine the Federal matching payment is based \non a comparison between average per capita income in the United States \nand each individual State's per capita income.\n  Under the current formula, the minimum Federal Medicaid match is 50 \npercent. The highest Federal match is 77.2\n\n[[Page S2143]]\n\npercent and is provided to the State with the lowest per capita \nincome--Mississippi. By contrast, Alaska has a 50/50 Federal/State \nmatch based on the fact that it has the seventh highest per capita \nincome in the United States, $17,961 based on 1993 data.\n  However, many Federal programs recognize that per capita income, by \nitself, is not a fair measure of wealth. For example, a special Federal \nGovernment cost-of-living adjustment is provided to Federal employees \nin Alaska to reflect our cost differential. Other Federal formulas, \nsuch as the formula for the Federal School Lunch Program, Food Stamp \nProgram, and certain housing programs each recognize and take into \nconsideration Alaska's high cost of living.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that Alaska's $17,961 per capita income \nsuggests it is one of the wealthier States. However, when the 25 \npercent higher cost of living is factored in, the State looks far less \nwealthy. In fact, when Alaska's high cost of living is factored into \nthe equation, it would appear that an Alaskan with an income of $17,961 \nlives at the same economic level as a person in Iowa with a per capita \nincome of $14,399. Yet Iowa enjoys a 62/38 Federal/State Medicaid \nmatch.\n\n  Why is Alaska's cost of living higher than the lower 48 States? The \nanswer is primarily because of the high cost of shipping goods to \nAlaska. Almost everything of substantial size or volume comes to Alaska \nby water, and despite healthy competition among carriers, prices remain \nhigh due to the distance traveled and the fact that Alaska remains an \nimporter of goods, not an exporter. That means most vessels are unable \nto carry a backhaul cargo that would lower the overall cost of the \nround trip. Moreover, because of an undeveloped road structure, most \nfood transported to remote villages in Alaska rely exclusively on air \nfreight.\n  What this high shipping cost means is that it costs a family of four \nin Bethel, Alaska's largest rural community, nearly $30 more each week \nto feed their family, compared to the average family in the United \nStates. And, it is these rural Alaska areas that have the highest \nnumber of Medicaid recipients.\n  The present Medicaid formula is fundamentally unfair because it \ndoesn't reflect these facts. What it means is that more people in \nAlaska are eligible for Medicaid, but the Federal match isn't adjusted \naccordingly. Basically, the current Federal formula gives us more \nMedicaid users and provides less money to pay for their services. to \nexacerbate this inequity--health care costs in Alaska are estimated to \nbe 71 percent higher than the national average.\n  The legislation we are introducing today, The Alaska Medicaid Equity \nAct, finally resolves this inequity. It adjusts the Medicaid formula \nfor Alaska to factor in the State's high cost of living. Passage of \nthis legislation would result in an estimated savings of $40 to $50 \nmillion for the State of Alaska Legislature.\n  This adjustment was included in legislation that was reported from \nthe Senate Finance Committee as part of the reconciliation bill that \nwas adopted in 1995. However, that omnibus bill was ultimately vetoed \nfor unrelated reasons.\n  Mr. President, we in Alaska have endured this historic inequity for \nnearly a third of a century. I hope my colleagues will agree, the time \nto right this wrong is this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 425. A bill to provide for an accurate determination of the cost \nof living; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    COST-OF-LIVING BOARD ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today my good friend, Senator Moynihan, and \nI are introducing a landmark piece of legislation to create a cost-of-\nliving board that will improve our Government's ability to index \nFederal programs with a more accurate measurement of inflation. \nClearly, there are a number of ways to address the accurate measure of \ninflation with regard to our indexed Federal tax and benefit programs. \nIn my view, this bill represents one possible way to achieve greater \naccuracy. It is not the only way, but I believe it is our best effort \nto create a mechanism to fairly compensate taxpayers and benefit \nrecipients alike.\n  One of the most significant issues that faces Congress this year is \nthe accuracy of the Consumer Price Index, and I believe that Congress \nand the President need to seriously address the economic ramifications \nof an inaccurate measure of the cost of living. The five-member board \ncreated in our bill will meet throughout the year to, first, review the \nstatistical evidence about inflation produced by the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics and others, and after careful review of all the evidence \nregarding inflation, the board will then produce a cost-of-living \nadjustment by a majority vote of the members of the commission not \nlater than November 1 of each year.\n  This inflation adjustment number will serve as a number for which all \nFederal benefit programs and tax items will be indexed for the coming \nyear without further action by the Congress or the President. If, \nhowever, the cost-of-living board fails by a majority vote to produce a \ncost-of-living adjustment, then current law applies. That is to say, \nthat the BLS-produced CPI will be used to index tax and benefit \nprograms.\n  Let me be clear. This cost-of-living board will not--and I emphasize \nnot--study the accuracy of the Consumer Price Index. We have already \nhad the Boskin commission which did just that. The report was widely \npraised within the Economic Community, including many highly respected \neconomists, such as Dr. Alan Greenspan and Dr. Martin Feldstein.\n  One of the roles in Government is to protect American families from \ninflation. In doing so, it is important that we are able to measure \ninflation as precisely as possible, and I view this board as our best \nhope of accurately measuring inflation.\n  I cannot emphasize too greatly the importance of an accurate \nmeasurement of inflation. If the index is too high, it overcompensates \nretirees and others and undertaxes many taxpayers. If it is too low, it \nundercompensates retirees and overtaxes the taxpayer. What we want is \nfairness to all with as accurate an index as possible.\n  I want to stress that any action we take on this issue must be \nbroadly and deeply bipartisan. We must have the full cooperation and \nleadership by President Clinton. I hope the President will not miss an \nopportunity to consider this board as one possible option that will \n``take the politics out of it'' and fulfill his goals set out in his \nState of the Union Address to ``do the right thing for the country.'' \nClearly, this reform will not be successful without the President's \nleadership.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 425\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am honored to be a cosponsor of this \nmeasure which our revered chairman has brought to the floor. I would \nlike to endorse each and every thing he has said.\n  This legislation would create an independent Cost of Living Board to \ndetermine annually what cost of living adjustments should be made for \nthe following calendar year. In the event a majority of the Board \ncannot agree on a decision, then by default the automatic adjustments \nwould be based on the change in the Consumer Price Index as calculated \nby the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n  The Board would have five members and would be comprised as follows: \nthe Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; \nthe Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers; and three \nothers appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the \nSenate. The bill specifies that members of the board shall be \nprofessional economists familiar with issues related to the calculation \nof changes in the cost of living, such as index number theory.\n  There is a growing consensus that the CPI overstates the cost of \nliving. In December 1996, the Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer \nPrice Index appointed by the Finance Committee--the Boskin Commission--\nconcluded that the Consumer Price Index\n\n[[Page S2145]]\n\noverstates the inflation by 1.1 percentage points. The distinguished \nChairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, Alan \nGreenspan, agrees. And in testimony before the Finance Committee, \nChairman Greenspan provided the definitive response to those who have \nargued that this issue should not be ``politicized.'' He said:\n\n       There has been considerable objection that such a . . . \n     procedure would be a political fix. To the contrary assuming \n     zero for the . . . bias is the political fix. On this issue, \n     we should let evidence, not politics, drive policy.\n\n  I referred earlier to index number theory. I might add that in the \nlast decade or two, there has been very considerable advancement in the \nsubfield of index number theory--the point where mathematics meets \neconomics. We know a lot more than we did. We can do it better than we \ndo. There are persons who have specialized in this.\n  The first particular study goes back to 1961, when the National \nBureau of Economic Research, at the request of the then Bureau of the \nBudget, gave us a report by a committee chaired by George J. Stigler, \nsoon to be a Nobel laureate, on the price indexes of the Federal \nGovernment. It concluded the indexes overstated changes in the cost of \nliving.\n  They did not have any estimates of the bias at the time, but they \nknew there was a bias. And in the manner of academic work, people \naddressed it. For what it is worth, perhaps one of the most \ndistinguished practitioners now teaches at the University of British \nColumbia. In any event, we are able to do so much more than we have \ndone, and the need to get it right is paramount, it is our obligation, \nas persons responsible for the public fisc.\n  This bill represents the next step in a logical progression. We are \nbeyond a fact-finding commission. The overwhelming evidence is that the \nCPI overstates the change in the cost of living by between 0.5 and 1.5 \npercentage points.\n  It is now time to consider how to go about getting the number right--\nand getting it right every year henceforth. As the chairman indicated, \nit is our intention in introducing this bill to suggest one possible \nmechanism. Certainly there are other options, and I would not rule out \nany alternative at this point. Our purpose today is to keep attention \nfocused and keep the dialogue moving on this issue, for delay is \ncostly. If we get our numbers right--and that is all we propose to do--\nthen we save $1 trillion over 12 years. If we delay for 2 years, then \nthe savings are reduced to $750 billion.\n  I believe this Board, with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, \nthe Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and the three \neconomists nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, is a \nsuperb approach. We hope it will be given the attention it deserves now \nthat it has been made clear by the White House that they see the \nnecessity for doing this.\n\n  Our distinguished majority leader, over there in the corner even as I \nspeak, has spoken to this matter. And now we have a proposal for \nlegislative action. With great and renewed thanks for our chairman, I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Let me start out by thanking the distinguished Senator from \nNew York for his leadership in this critically important matter. I can \nsay, fairly, that nothing would have happened if it had not been for \nhis willingness to step out early on and take measures that I think are \nin the best interests of this Nation and the people of this great \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2129-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 66\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the names of the Senator from New York \n[Mr. D'Amato] and the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 66, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \nto encourage capital formation through reductions in taxes on capital \ngains, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 293\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from California \n[Mrs. Feinstein] was added as a cosponsor of S. 293, a bill to amend \nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make permanent the credit for \nclinical testing expenses for certain drugs for rare diseases or \nconditions.\n\n\n                                 S. 347\n\n  At the request of Mr. Cleland, the name of the Senator from Iowa [Mr. \nGrassley] was added as a cosponsor of S. 347, a bill to designate the \nFederal building located at 100 Alabama Street NW, in Atlanta, GA, as \nthe ``Sam Nunn Federal Center''.\n\n\n                                 S. 359\n\n  At the request of Mr. Thomas, the name of the Senator from Idaho [Mr. \nCraig] was added as a cosponsor of S. 359, a bill to amend title XVIII \nof the Social Security Act to change the payment system for health \nmaintenance organizations and competitive medical plans.\n\n\n                                 S. 405\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kerry] was added as a cosponsor of S. 405, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permanently extend the \nresearch credit and to allow greater opportunity to elect the \nalternative incremental credit.\n\n\n                                 S. 406\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland [Mr. Chafee] was added as a cosponsor of S. 406, a bill to amend \nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide clarification for the \ndeductibility of expenses incurred by a taxpayer in connection with the \nbusiness use of the home.\n\n\n                                 S. 418\n\n  At the request of Mr. Warner, the name of the Senator from Virginia \n[Mr. Robb] was added as a cosponsor of S. 418, a bill to close the \nLorton Correctional Complex, to prohibit the incarceration of \nindividuals convicted of felonies under the laws of the District of \nColumbia in facilities of the District of Columbia Department of \nCorrections, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                          Senate Resolution 50\n\n  At the request of Mr. Roth, the names of the Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Lugar], the Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Murkowski], the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Hagel], the Senator \nfrom Colorado [Mr. Allard], the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], the \nSenator from Virginia [Mr. Robb], the Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan], \nthe Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], and the Senator from Connecticut \n[Mr. Lieberman] were added as cosponsors of Senate Resolution 50, a \nresolution to express the sense of the Senate regarding the correction \nof cost-of-living adjustments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2145-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2145-S2146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nCOMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS EXPENDITURES AUTHORIZATION RESOLUTION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   LOTT (AND WARNER) AMENDMENT NO. 22\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Warner) proposed an amendment to \namendment No. 21 proposed by Mr. Glenn to the resolution (S.

Mr. President, today I would like to recognize \na great American from my home State, a man who is working to show all \nAmericans that individuals can make a difference in the war against \ndrugs. Ted Stone, a native of Durham, NC, wanted to do something to \nraise awareness about our Nation's drug problems. Ted has been a \nmotivational speaker for over 20 years now on the subject of drug \nabuse. He has spoken to millions of people in churches, schools, civic \norganizations, prisons, and drug treatment facilities. But he wanted to \ndo something more.\n  On March 14, 1996, here in Washington, DC, on the steps of our \nNation's Capitol, Ted began a 3,700 mile walk across America. He \ncompleted that trek on November 19 of last year in Los Angeles, CA on \nthe steps of city hall.\n  Ted's dramatic journey across America took him to the State capitals \nof Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, where he brought his antidrug \nmessage personally to Gov. George W. Bush, Gov. Gary Johnson, and \nGovernor Fife Symington.\n  Ted carried an American flag with him throughout his walk across our \nbeautiful country as a symbol that the American spirit can turn the \ntide in our Nation's war on drugs. Working together in our local \ncommunities I, too, believe we can raise awareness of our Nation's drug \nabuse problems.\n  At one point on his journey, a little boy asked Ted if he was like \nForrest Gump. Ted replied:\n\n       No, because when people asked Forrest Gump why he was \n     walking, he didn't know. I'm walking so that boys like you \n     can grow up in a country that is drug-free.\n  Ted believes, as I do, that the war on drugs will not be won in the \ncourtroom or even here in Congress, but in our local communities. And \nin fact, Ted knows personally about winning the war on drugs, because \nhe himself is a recovered amphetamine addict. He is living proof that \nindividuals can overcome drug addiction.\n  Today I hope my colleagues will join me in saluting a great American, \nTed Stone, for his efforts to keep our Nation drug-free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2146-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2146-S2147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MAYOR DENNIS ARCHER\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have the honor of paying tribute \nto my friend, Mayor Dennis Archer of Detroit, who will be recognized by \nthe Hartford Optimists Club of Detroit as 1997 Optimist of the Year. \nMayor Archer is being\n\n[[Page S2147]]\n\nhonored for his efforts to ``optimistically build a renaissance in \nDetroit for the 21st century.''\n  Since he was elected mayor in 1993, Dennis Archer's energy and \nefforts have infused the people of Detroit with a new spirit of hope. \nWhile Detroit faces many challenges, Mayor Archer's work is convincing \npeople from Michigan to Washington, DC that Detroit is in the midst of \na great comeback.\n  Mayor Archer has worked to build partnerships with community and \ncivic groups, businesses, and the State and Federal Governments. These \npartnerships have led to success in creating jobs, improving public \nsafety, and raising the standard of living for many of Detroit's \nresidents. In fact, Detroit's unemployment rate has been cut in half \nsince Mayor Archer took office.\n  Under Mayor Archer's stewardship, residential and business \ndevelopment is moving forward at a dynamic pace. In November, taxpayers \napproved a plan to build new baseball and football stadiums in the \ncity. Twenty-five new residential developments are under construction, \nas are new retail developments. General Motors recently decided to keep \nits world headquarters in Detroit, purchasing and moving to the \nRenaissance Center. And Detroit's empowerment zone leads those in all \nother cities in job creation.\n  Dennis Archer has always had confidence in the city of Detroit and in \nits people, and the results of his first 3 years are proving his \noptimism to be well-founded. While no one expects Detroit's problems to \nbe solved overnight, the city's progress under the Mayor's leadership \nis undeniable.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in saluting Mayor \nDennis Archer of Detroit, who truly deserves to be honored as 1997 \nOptimist of the Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2146-4", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2147-S2148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL SPORTSMANSHIP DAY\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to commemorate the \nseventh annual celebration of National Sportsmanship Day, which took \nplace on March 5. Designed to promote ethics, integrity, and good \nsportsmanship in athletics, National Sportsmanship Day was established \nby the Institute for International Sport at the University of Rhode \nIsland. This year, over 8000 schools in all 50 States and 75 countries \noverseas participated in National Sportsmanship Day.\n  There seems to be no shortage of stories about assaults on referees, \nplayers, and even press photographers. I am particularly pleased, \ntherefore, that the Institute for International Sport tackled the issue \nof violence in sports head-on. As part of National Sportsmanship Day, \nthe Institute held a day-long town meeting where athletes, coaches, \njournalists, students, and educators engaged in a lengthy discussion \nabout the causes and possible solutions for violence on the playing \nfield. I think that the Institute's work to foster this kind of \ndialogue among our young people is critical.\n  In addition to the town meeting, the Institute for International \nSport also sponsored an essay contest in which students wrote and \nshared their views on good sportsmanship, fair play, and courtesy on \nthe playing field. Several winning essays were published in USA Today \nand the Providence Journal Bulletin, and I ask that they be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Another key component of National Sportsmanship Day is the Student-\nAthlete Outreach Program. This program encourages high schools and \ncolleges to send talented student-athletes to local elementary and \nmiddle schools to promote good sportsmanship and serve as positive role \nmodels. These students help young people build self-esteem, respect for \nphysical fitness, and an appreciation for the value of teamwork.\n  I remain very proud that National Sportsmanship Day was initiated in \nRhode Island, and I applaud the students and teachers who participated \nin this inspiring event. Likewise, I congratulate all of those at the \nInstitute for International Sport, whose hard work and dedication over \nthe last 7 years have made this program so successful.\n  The material follows:\n\n          [From the Providence Journal-Bulletin, Mar. 4, 1997]\n\n   Whether They Realize It or Not, National Athletes Are Role Models\n\n                       (By Steven E. Sylven, Jr.)\n\n       Sportsmanship. Today, it seems to be as valuable as my `86 \n     Escort, which died a month ago. Is it any wonder though? Look \n     around at some of the players in any of the pro leagues. \n     You'll find guys who headbutt officials, spit on umpires, \n     throw towels at their coaches, and kick cameramen. These \n     ``professional'' athletes just ooze with sportsmanship and \n     set a great example for kids don't they?\n       Some of these players say they don't want to be considered \n     role models; that children should not look toward them as \n     one. Well, news flash fellas, you are role models. There is \n     no getting around this because you are professional athletes \n     and are forever in the spotlight. Kids see your every move \n     and they will imitate it. Why? Because they see you get away \n     with it and they think it's cool.\n       When I was a kid, I loved playing sports and, like most \n     kids, I would pretend to be my favorite player when playing. \n     When I was playing baseball, I was Dwight Evans; when playing \n     hockey, I was Mike Bossy; football, I was Dan Marino; and \n     when playing tennis, I was John McEnroe. Yes, John ``I will \n     yell at anything that does not go my way'' McEnroe.\n       I won't kid around here, I liked him for one reason and \n     only one reason, he could shoot his mouth off at anyone and \n     get away with it. I thought he was the best thing since \n     sliced bread, plus he was a good tennis player to boot. Talk \n     with any of my childhood friends who would play with me, \n     they'd probably tell you I put McEnroe to shame. I was bad.\n       There was one time I was playing and I missed a shot on a \n     critical point. Well, as critical a point as you can have \n     when you are playing your friend in a park; but I wasn't a \n     kid, I was John McEnroe and this was Wimbledon.\n       Anyway, I went off on about a five-minute tirade, spewing \n     forth any and every obscenity you can think of and then some. \n     It was so bad that a lady who was clear on the other side of \n     the park, came over and asked me to stop my mouth because she \n     had her little children with her. I just brushed her off. \n     After all, she was not my mother and besides McEnroe does it. \n     Why couldn't I?\n       Incidentally, this screaming after points became a habit \n     with me whenever I played and continued through high school. \n     So bad was it that I would almost get into fist fights with \n     opponents from other schools. One time, during the state \n     doubles championships, I was running my mouth so bad that my \n     coach almost pulled my partner and I out of the tournament * \n     * * and we were in the quarterfinals. Playing tennis the way \n     John McEnroe did was the only style I came to know.\n       Now, I'm not saying that all kids who imitate the bad \n     behavior of professional athletes are going to behave that \n     way for the rest of their lives. Nor am I saying that kids \n     only pay attention to the conduct of unruly players, for \n     there are far more players exhibiting the qualities of \n     sportsmanship than there are not.\n       What I am saying is that a player who screams and shouts \n     when things don't go his or her way and gets away with it, \n     may spark the interest of a child more than someone who just \n     accepts the fate the sports gods lay out for them. I speak \n     from experience here.\n       So as we celebrate National Sportsmanship Day today, it \n     would be nice if the not-so-sportsmanlike athletes of the \n     nation would take the time to recognize the value of \n     sportsmanship. If not for themselves or respected leagues, at \n     least for the little Wayne Gretzkys, Pete Samprases, and \n     Kerri Struggs out there.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                Sports' Code: Be Your Best At All Times\n\n         (By Brian Bert, Grade 5, Metcalf School, Exeter, R.I.)\n\n       I think good sportsmanship is not who wins or loses, but \n     playing your best. You have to remember it is just a game. A \n     good sport does not insult other teammates. He helps other \n     players up when they fall.\n       When I play sports I see a lot of good and bad \n     sportsmanship. Sometimes I see players who won't shake other \n     players' hand at the end of the game. I sometimes see \n     teammates blaming other teammates for losing the game. I see \n     coaches arguing with refs.\n       I also a lot of good sportsmanship like helping other \n     teammates up when they fall. Most good players shake hands at \n     the end of the game and say ``good game.'' A good sport would \n     say to others ``don't worry about your mistakes, it is just a \n     game''.\n       I felt I show good sportsmanship. I enjoy playing the game. \n     It does not matter who wins, I feel good sportsmanship will \n     help me through my life. It is a good lesson to learn.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Win or Lose, Strong Hearts Never Die\n\n       (By Erin K. Hannon, Grade 10, Exeter/West Greenwich High)\n\n       The 1996 Exeter/West Greenwich High School football team \n     showed opponents that winning is not everything. Despite \n     their nine losses, these young men displayed outstanding \n     sportsmanship and character throughout the season. Their love \n     and devotion to the game of football kept their spirits alive \n     whenever hope seemed to be fleeting. Although they did not \n     achieve the win they had been looking for they gained the \n     respect of many last year.\n       The tradition of football is just beginning to blossom in \n     the rural towns of Exeter and\n\n[[Page S2148]]\n\n     West Greenwich. This past season was only the second year \n     that the school had had a team. Experience was the key to \n     playing the game, and many of these boys had never played \n     organized football before. With only 19 boys on the roster, \n     including only one senior, these young men found it difficult \n     to compete with larger, more experienced teams across the \n     state. However, giving up was out of the question. They stood \n     tall and repeatedly showed that they deserved the respect \n     that all of the opposing teams were receiving. These boys \n     continued to give all that they had until the last whistle of \n     the season had been blown.\n       As the manager and statistician of the team, I witnessed \n     the pain in the eyes of each and every young man after a \n     loss. They put forth tremendous effort not only during the \n     games, but every day in practice. Their coaches, Mark \n     Graholski, John Houseman and Craig Belanger, pushed every one \n     of the boys until they could be pushed no further. They \n     taught the boys the fundamentals on the football field, and \n     more importantly, how the football team becomes a family \n     during the season. They learned how to stick together through \n     thick and thin and that although losing is not the greatest, \n     earning respect and dignity is far greater than winning.\n       One of the team's greater accomplishments last year was \n     receiving the Dick Reynolds Outstanding Sportsmanship Award. \n     This honor recognized not only the talent, but the impetus \n     and determination that came from within each and every young \n     man on the team. It also allowed the team to be noticed by \n     all not for their winning percentage, but for the way they \n     played the game. The players realized that winning was only \n     the icing on the cake and they were proud in what they had \n     accomplished overall.\n       The members on the Exeter/West Greenwich football team \n     learned more than the game of football last year, they \n     learned many aspects of the game of life. They learned that \n     being able to stand tall with a smile on your face is a far \n     better goal to achieve than winning. Their character and \n     sense of pride through a season filled with struggles showed \n     that they had the will to continue and the power to be \n     successful, win or lose. Although the pain and anguish of \n     losing will fade away, the character and sportsmanship of \n     these young men will remain for years to come.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            Professional Athletes Need To Learn Self-Control\n\n        (By Kaycee Roberts, Grade 7, Westerly's Babcock School)\n\n       The behavior of professional atheletes today is extremely \n     out of hand. Players and coaches alike go to the outler \n     limits to win, and often, to make the other team look bad. \n     Referees allow many more things to go on (and so do coaches) \n     than they should. Sports are played mainly for fun, but if \n     athletes and coaches keep acting in such an impolite and \n     downright ridiuculous manner, they will take the fun right \n     out of it. Therefore the behavior of role models in sports \n     needs to be improved.\n       First, children are watching these morally irresponsible \n     actions. They will see their idols commit these acts. So, of \n     course, they will act the same way. For example, when you see \n     a baseball player throw the bat and swear at the umpire, \n     children will think it is cool to do that, and they will go \n     out and repeat the same action. It is not right to introduce \n     this behavior to the youth of America.\n       Second, they celebrate and taunt, yet they are only doing \n     their job. When football players shout and dance because they \n     score a touchdown, they are celebrating actions they are \n     expected to perform. The football players are supposed to \n     score for their team. These flamboyant actions are totally \n     uncalled for. It would be like a stockholder screaming and \n     boasting because he sold stocks. They need to put aside their \n     ridiculous and foolish antics and play the game.\n       Last is the obvious fact that such behavior has absolutely \n     no point and does not benefit anyone. It certainly doesn't \n     benefit the subject of the taunt, nor does it benefit anyone \n     watching the game. Finally, role models in professional \n     sports desperately need to improve their attitudes. We are \n     going to be living in a very sad world if people cannot \n     simply control their tempers and behavior . We want to see \n     athletes set aside silly and childish ways and promote the \n     youth of America by freshly nourishing them in a good way.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the USA Today, Mar. 4, 1997]\n\n                 Pushing To Improve Is Mark of a Winner\n\n               (By Daryl Myer, Edinboro (PA) University)\n\n       His gait is modest and true, his body strong yet \n     unpretentious. His eyes glow with the vibrancy for life all \n     too few know. His smile is contagious. Ask any of his \n     friends, and they will tell you the truth: His work ethic and \n     will to win rate second to none. He is always trying to \n     become better, not only on the track, but in life as well.\n       It is practice time, and his teammates and coach have \n     gathered on the track for another workout. His coach reads \n     aloud the workout, and all the others quietly whine and \n     complain. He hears one teammate complaining about a blister \n     on his toe and another about a headache. He remains quiet, \n     showing no signs of apprehension about the pain that awaits \n     him. Ultimately, he realizes that his sore muscles and \n     screaming lungs will make him stronger and more proficient. \n     His goal is to become a national champion.\n       Many people might guess that he does poorly in track meets. \n     The exact opposite is true. His desire to win is \n     incomparable. He trains hard and races hard. He speaks only a \n     choice few words. What he says is profound, and he never \n     speaks about himself. In a day and age where athletes draw \n     attention to themselves in any way possible, he chooses to \n     place the emphasis on his team, not himself. Others taunt and \n     point fingers; he simply congratulates his competitors for a \n     job well done.\n       He is a true gentleman in every facet of the word. He \n     accepts responsibility for his actions and remains humble at \n     all costs. Honesty and integrity are of the same importance \n     as gold medals and records. His goals are high, but his will \n     is strong. He will be fair and just.\n       These are the ideals of a true sportsman, ideals my mother \n     and father taught me. It is my desire to follow their lead. I \n     want to become like ``him.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 Competitors Should Raise Bar on Ethics\n\n     (By Brian Bokor, Senior, Shorecrest Prep, St. Petersburg, FL]\n\n       We live in a world where winning supersedes all other \n     considerations. Moral values have been clouded by the desire \n     to win at any price. This is evident in business, politics \n     and in sports.\n       I have played organized sports for the last six years of my \n     life, and I have learned about sacrifice, hard work, self-\n     discipline and working with others. However, there is also a \n     dark side to the lessons taught in competition. Many athletes \n     will do whatever it takes to achieve a competitive edge.\n       I remember reading a couple of years ago about Colorado \n     defeating Missouri in a football game. After review of the \n     game film, it was discovered that Colorado scored on a fifth-\n     down play. The mistake was acknowledged, but Colorado refused \n     to forfeit the game. The Colorado coaches blamed the \n     ``mistake'' on the referees. Later that season, Colorado won \n     a share of the national championship. I believe this ``win'' \n     proves that most people consider winning to be far more \n     important than being fair.\n       My parents and I had discussed my concerns of a ``must-\n     win'' attitude in many aspects of society. Most people now \n     accept ``unfair business practices,'' ``dirty tricks \n     politics'' and ``academic irregularities'' as the norm. I now \n     question whether sports has encouraged this attitude in \n     society or whether society has imposed these practices on \n     sports. No matter what the answer, I believe society and \n     sports need to adopt a new code of ethics.\n       Sports participation has helped prepare me for success in a \n     competitive society. However, the unethical practices \n     illustrated in sports have led many competitors into \n     confusing what fairness and sportsmanship are all about. I \n     feel a responsibility to replace the ``winning-at-all-costs'' \n     attitude with an attitude of fairness and sportsmanship that \n     was the original intent of competitive sports.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                Good Starting Point Is Positive Attitude\n\n     (By Meghan Murray, Sixth-grader, Unqua School, Massapequa, NY)\n\n       What is sportsmanship? The definition is the qualities or \n     conduct of a sportsman, fair play. To me, sportsmanship's a \n     kind of attitude you have to a person or anything else. The \n     attitude can be positive or negative. To other people, \n     sportsmanship can relate only to sports. But, in fact, \n     sportsmanship doesn't relate only to sports. Jobs, homes, \n     schools, and friends can relate to sportsmanship.\n       Positive sportsmanship is a person who can take \n     constructive criticism, learn from it and turn it into \n     positive abilities. You can achieve sportsmanship by \n     expressing your skills. You have to earn positive \n     sportsmanship by working hard and concentrating on the \n     challenging situations that may arise.\n       Another thing about sportsmanship is the attitude. You can \n     shake the other team's hand after you win or lose a game. \n     That shows respect to the players as well as the coaches and \n     fans. If you don't shake the other team's hands, people might \n     think you are disrespectful toward the game.\n       After losing a game, disappointment may occur but this \n     should not reflect a bad attitude. A bad team player would \n     walk off the field mad. A good team player would want to meet \n     with his coach and team to see what went wrong and maybe fix \n     it for the next game.\n       Winning or losing should always result in good \n     sportsmanship. If you win and rub it in, you are not \n     practicing good sportsmanship! Don't be unkind and \n     disrespectful.\n       To be the most effective team player, you must start by \n     giving of yourself 100%. Such as attending all practices, \n     respect all team players and your coaches. Following all \n     rules and regulations of the game. Give all that you've got. \n     Keep up your grades at school. Take charge of what is your \n     destiny and take the responsibilities that may come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2147-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2148-S2149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the recent \ncelebration of International Women's Day, which took place on March 8, \n1997. Women have made great strides in the past century, both here in \nthe United States and around the globe. As we prepare to enter a new \ncentury, however, we must\n\n[[Page S2149]]\n\nrecognize that there is still much work to be done in the areas of \nequality and human rights for all women.\n  Here in the United States, women are making impressive contributions \nat all levels of society. They are daughters, mothers, wives, and \nsisters; they are entrepreneurs, research scientists, teachers, and \nscholars; they serve our Nation in the military, as civil servants, and \nas Members of the House, of the Senate and of the President's Cabinet.\n  This year, I was proud to be a Member of the Senate which unanimously \napproved the nomination of the first female Secretary of State, \nMadeleine K. Albright. More women serve in the 105th Congress than any \nother Congress in history, with 9 women in the Senate and 53 in the \nHouse. While women have made great progress in running for and \nattaining public office, we cannot forget that women are still vastly \nunderrepresented at virtually every level of government.\n  In 1996, American women celebrated the 75th anniversary of winning \nthe right to vote. Sadly, many women--and men--in the United States \nfail to take advantage of this aspect of democracy. As we prepare to \nenter the next century, we ought to encourage women to participate \nfully in our democracy, as informed voters and as candidates for public \noffice at the local, State, and National level.\n  One striking inequity that persists for American women is in their \nearnings as compared to men. According to 1995 data from the U.S. \nCensus Bureau, women earn only 71 percent of the wages of men. This \nwage gap varies by race: compared to white men, African-American women \nearn only 64 cents on the dollar, Hispanic women earn only 53 cents, \nand white women earn 71 cents.\n  Sixty percent of women are employed in traditionally female jobs. \nWomen also make up a large segment of the United States contingent work \nforce, which includes independent contractors, part-time and temporary \nworkers, day laborers, and on-call workers. According to the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons (AARP), participation in this contingent \nwork force has a significant impact on women aged 45 and above because \ncontingent workers receive lower pay and fewer benefits and have less \nopportunity for advancement than do full-time workers. Women are more \nlikely than men to be contingent employees due to an unequal \ndistribution of parenting and household responsibilities which prevent \nmany women from seeking full-time employment.\n  Only part of this disparity is explained by differences in men's and \nwomen's career paths. Women and men employed in the same job also \nreceive unequal pay. According to 1995 data from the U.S. Bureau of \nLabor Statistics, women received equal pay for only 2 of 90 occupations \nthat were studied.\n  As we look toward the 21st century, we must continue to fight for \nequal pay for equal work and continue to reform our Nation's health \ncare and Social Security systems for all Americans. While we have made \ngreat progress with the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act, there is still much work \nto be done.\n  Women abroad have also made progress over the past century. As the \nranking member of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, I have had the \nopportunity to review the status of women on that continent. Last year, \nI was pleased to be a part of a hearing, chaired by Senator Kassebaum, \nwhich explored the status of African women. African women are becoming \nmore active in the economy, in politics, and in solving national \nproblems than they ever have before. Many development indicators that \naffect women--the number of girls attending primary school and life \nexpectancy, for example--are also improving.\n  But with all these advancements, we cannot forget the challenges that \nwomen face in Africa. In many countries, women are legally prevented \nfrom owning property or signing official documents without the consent \nof their husbands. Women comprise a substantial majority of the nearly \n7 million refugees in Africa. And, in Africa, women suffer more from \nthe HIV virus than do men.\n  As we prepare to enter the 21st century, the great strides made by \nAfrican women, and women in others areas of the world, should be \napplauded, but the fact that there is still much work to be done should \nnot be forgotten.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I see International Women's Day as both an \nopportunity to celebrate the advancements of the last century and to \noutline goals for the next century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2148-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2149-S2150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MIT: THE IMPACT OF INNOVATION\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I commend the attention of the \nSenate to a significant new study released this week by BankBoston \nregarding the impact of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on \nthe economy of the United States and of the world.\n  Mr. President, we in Massachusetts have always known that MIT plays \nan outsized role in the economy of Massachusetts and of the United \nStates, but this new study by BankBoston quantifies the impact. And the \nimpact is staggering.\n  The report shows that MIT graduates are responsible for the formation \nof over 4,000 companies worldwide, and the creation of over 1.1 million \njobs, including 733,000 jobs in the United States.\n  If MIT graduates constituted an economy all by themselves, they would \nbe the 24th largest economy in the world.\n  Just as significant, the report shows that fully 80 percent of the \njobs created by MIT-related companies are manufacturing jobs, and that \nMIT-related companies are heavily invested in the production of goods \nand services for export outside the United States.\n  In other words, the fruit of the sophisticated research and training \noffered at MIT is real jobs for real working Americans, and real net \nwealth for the U.S. economy.\n  We are proud of MIT and its accomplishments, but what this Congress \nshould appreciate about the new MIT study is not what it says about \nMIT, but what it says about our research universities throughout the \ncountry, for the MIT story is one that could easily be told at research \nuniversities throughout the United States.\n  The moral of this story is that our historic Federal commitment to \nuniversity-based research, and to support higher education, has paid \noff in jobs and in new wealth for this country, not to mention superior \nnational security and continued advances for human health.\n  As we face tough fiscal choices this year on the way to a sustainable \nbalanced budget, we must keep the lessons of the MIT study in mind. We \nwill ill serve this country if, in the name of sustaining our economy \nthrough a balanced budget, we underinvest in the very things--research \nand education--that have made this country the unquestioned economic \nleader it is today.\n  I ask that the following article, ``Study Reveals Major Impact of \nCompanies Started by MIT Alums,'' be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n      Study Reveals Major Impact of Companies Started by MIT Alums\n\n                        (By Kenneth D. Campbell)\n\n       In the first national study of the economic impact of a \n     research university, BankBoston reported today that graduates \n     of MIT have founded 4,000 firms which, in 1994 alone, \n     employed 1.1 million people and generated $232 billion of \n     world sales.\n       ``If the companies founded by MIT graduates and faculty \n     formed an independent nation, the revenues produced by the \n     companies would make that nation the 24th-largest economy in \n     the world,'' said the report, entitled ``MIT: The Impact of \n     Innovation.''\n       Within the United States, the companies employed a total of \n     733,000 people in 1994 at more than 8,500 plants and offices \n     in the 50 states--equal to one out of every 170 jobs in \n     America. Eighty percent of the jobs in the MIT-related firms \n     are in manufacturing (compared to 16 percent nationally), and \n     a high percentage of products are exported.\n       The 36-page BankBoston report, which is the result of an \n     MIT survey of 1,300 CEOs and two years of fact-gathering and \n     checking by MIT and the bank, ``represents a case study of \n     the significant effect that research universities have on the \n     economies of the nation and its 50 states.'' The study notes \n     that many of the MIT-related founders also have degrees from \n     other universities, and that these entrepreneurs maintain \n     close ties with MIT or other research universities and \n     colleges.\n       ``In a national economy that is increasingly emphasizing \n     innovation, these findings extend our understanding of how \n     MIT has been instrumental in generating new businesses \n     nationwide,'' said Wayne M. Ayers, chief economist of \n     BankBoston. ``MIT is not the only university that has had a \n     national\n\n[[Page S2150]]\n\n     impact of this kind, but because of its historical and \n     continuing importance, it illustrates the contribution of \n     research universities to the evolving national economy.''\n       MIT President Charles M. Vest, commenting on the report, \n     said, ``About 90 percent of these companies have been founded \n     in the past 50 years, in the period of the great research \n     partnership between the federal government and research \n     universities. The development of these business enterprises \n     is one of the many beneficial spinoffs of federally funded \n     research, which has brought great advances in such fields as \n     health care, computing and communications.''\n       The five states benefiting most from MIT-related jobs are \n     California (162,000), Massachusetts (125,000), Texas \n     (84,000), New Jersey (34,000) and Pennsylvania (21,000). \n     Thirteen other states have more than 10,000 MIT-related \n     jobs--from west to east, Washington, 10,000; Oregon, 10,000; \n     Colorado, 15,000; Kansas, 13,000; Iowa, 13,000; Wisconsin, \n     12,000; Illinois, 12,000; Ohio, 18,000; Virginia, 15,000; \n     Georgia, 14,000; Florida, 15,000; New York, 15,000; and \n     Connecticut, 10,000.\n       Another 25 states have 1,000 to 9,000 jobs from MIT-related \n     companies--Alabama, South Carolina, Missouri, and New \n     Hampshire, 9,000; North Carolina, 8,000; Arizona and \n     Michigan, 7,000; Maryland and Tennessee, 6,000; Kentucky, \n     Minnesota, New Mexico, and Idaho, 5,000; Oklahoma, Indiana, \n     Utah, Rhode Island and Arkansas, 2,500 to 5,000; Delaware, \n     Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, Nevada, West Virginia and \n     Mississippi, 1,000 to 2,500 jobs. Only seven low-population \n     states and the District of Columbia had less than 1,000 jobs \n     from MIT-related companies.\n       More than 2,400 companies have headquarters outside the \n     Northeast.\n       The report noted, ``MIT-related companies have a major \n     presence in the San Francisco Bay area (Silicon Valley), \n     southern California, the Washington-Baltimore-Philadelphia \n     belt, the Pacific Northwest, the Chicago area, southern \n     Florida, Dallas and Houston, and the industrial cities of \n     Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.''\n       The report said the MIT-related companies ``are not typical \n     of the economy as a whole; they tend to be knowledge-based \n     companies in software, manufacturing (electronics, biotech, \n     instruments, machinery) or consulting (architects, business \n     consultants, engineers). These companies have a \n     disproportionate importance to their local economies because \n     they usually sell to out-of-state and world markets, and \n     because they so often represent advanced technologies.'' \n     Other industries represented include manufacturing firms in \n     chemicals, drugs, materials and aerospace, as well as energy, \n     publishing and finance companies.\n       ``Firms in software, electronics (including instruments, \n     semiconductors and computers) and biotech form a special \n     subset of MIT-related companies. They are at the cutting edge \n     of what we think of as high technology. They are more likely \n     to be planning expansion than companies in other industries. \n     They tend to export a higher percentage of their products, \n     hold one or more patents, and spend more of their revenues on \n     research and development,'' the report said.\n       In interviews, MIT graduates cited several factors at MIT \n     which spurred them on to take the risk of starting their own \n     companies: faculty mentors, cutting-edge technologies, \n     entrepreneurial spirit and ideas. The study profiled seven \n     MIT founders who started companies in Maryland, \n     Massachusetts, California, Washington state, Illinois and \n     Florida. Nearly half of all company founders who responded to \n     the MIT survey maintain significant ties to MIT and other \n     research universities in their area.\n       The findings of the study also reveal:\n       MIT graduates and faculty have been forming an average of \n     150 new firms a year since 1990.\n       In Massachusetts, the 1,065 MIT-related companies represent \n     5 percent of total state employment and 10 percent of the \n     state's economic base (sales in other states and the world). \n     MIT-related firms account for about 25 percent of sales of \n     all manufacturing firms and 33 percent of all software sales \n     in the state.\n       The study also looked at employment around the nation and \n     the world from MIT-related companies. Massachusetts firms \n     related to MIT had world employment of 353,000; California \n     firms had 348,000 world jobs. Other major world employers \n     included firms in Texas, 70,000; Missouri, 63,000; New \n     Jersey, 48,000; Pennsylvania, 41,000; and New Hampshire, \n     35,000.\n       In determining the location of a new business, the 1,300 \n     entrepreneurs surveyed said the quality of life in their \n     community, proximity to key markets and access to skilled \n     professionals were the most important factors, followed by \n     access to skilled labor, low business cost, and access to MIT \n     and other universities.\n       The companies include 220 companies based outside the \n     United States, employing 28,000 people worldwide.\n       Some of the earliest known MIT-related companies still \n     active are Arthur D. Little, Inc. (1886), Stone and Webster \n     (1889), Campbell Soup (1900) and Gillette (1901).\n       The report said the MIT-related companies would rank as the \n     24th-largest world economy because the $232 billion in world \n     sales ``is roughly equal to a gross domestic product of $116 \n     billion, which is a little less than the GDP of South Africa \n     and more than the GDP of Thailand.'' \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2149-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FATHER WILLIAM CUNNINGHAM\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Father \nWilliam T. Cunningham, who will be recognized by the Hartford Optimist \nClub of Detroit as 1997 Optimist of the Year. Father Cunningham is \nbeing honored for his efforts to ``optimistically build a renaissance \nin Detroit for the 21st century.''\n  A longtime advocate of social justice and racial equality, Father \nCunningham is one of the most respected and admired people in Michigan. \nIn 1968, he and cofounder Eleanor Josaitis began a civil and human \nrights organization in Detroit called Focus:HOPE. Focus:HOPE provides a \nunique combination of programs which seek to improve race relations, \ndeliver food to 86,000 low-income women, children and elderly each \nmonth, and provide advanced technology training for low-income young \nmen and women. Father Cunningham and Focus:HOPE have changed the lives \nof thousands of people throughout metropolitan Detroit by bringing to \nlife the proverb ``Give a person a fish and you feed him for a day; \nteach him to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.''\n  Father Cunningham's commitment to the people of Detroit has never \nwavered. I have been proud to be with President Clinton, Gen. Colin \nPowell, Ron Brown and many others on tours of Focus:HOPE. While each of \nthese dignitaries has walked away impressed by the size and scope of \nFocus:HOPE's mission, they have been equally inspired by the spiritual \nnature of Focus:HOPE and by the man whose vision and hard work have \nmade Focus:HOPE the success it is today.\n  Today, Mr. President, Father Cunningham's optimism is in full public \nview as he fights a battle against cancer. His determination to \ncontinue his legendary career serving the people of Detroit is as \nstrong as ever. Father Cunningham's faith and courage is an inspiration \nto all who witness it.\n  Father William Cunningham is an American treasure. I know my \ncolleagues will join me in congratulating Father Cunningham as he \nreceives the ``1997 Optimist of the Year'' award, and in wishing him \ngood health and continued success in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2150-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2150-S2151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CARM LOUIS COZZA\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the State of Connecticut, sports \nfans, and alumni of Yale University said goodbye to a true national \ncoaching legend when Carm Cozza stepped down as coach of the Yale \nUniversity football team last fall.\n  Carm was Yale's head coach for 32 years, winning a school-record 179 \ngames and coaching 1,300 players. He led the Elis to 10 Ivy League \nchampionships and coached future National Football League stars like \nCalvin Hill, who went on to win a championship with the Dallas Cowboys \nin the 1970's and Gary Fencik, a member of the Super Bowl XX champion \nChicago Bears. He is a Connecticut and American coaching icon.\n  ``I think Cozza epitomizes the champion that all of us try to be, \nthat we strive to be,'' said Fencik, an All-American in 1975, in a \nrecent interview with the New Haven Register.\n  ``You learn a lot more about a man under adversity and Carm had \ntremendous adversity that first year. My first year we didn't even have \na winning record and he treated that season the same as the next two \nwhen we won league titles,'' said Hill in the same story.\n  Cozza began his coaching career at Yale at a time when Ivy League \nfootball was truly top-notch college football. But as the prestige of \nIvy League football faded, and Division I-AA football slipped in \ngeneral, Carm stayed at Yale. He was offered jobs at the University of \nVirginia and Princeton, but elected to stay in Connecticut. And we're \ngrateful for that, because he's touched the lives of so many Ivy League \nathletes and so many other people in our State. A true testament of how \nsuccessful Cozza's former players have become is in the numbers--Seven \nNCAA post-graduate scholarship winners, seven GTE /CoSIDA District I \nacademic All-Americans, five National Football Foundation Hall of Fame \nScholar-Athletes, and five Rhodes Scholars. These numbers make Cozza \nthe proudest and the best of leaders.\n\n[[Page S2151]]\n\n  His coaches have also gone on to bigger and better positions. Eleven \nof his assistant coaches became head coaches on the college level. \nIncluded on the list are Buddy Amendola, who led Central Connecticut \nState University, Jim Root--William & Mary--Bill Mallory--Indiana--Bill \nNarduzzi--Youngstown State.\n  Cozza's football coaching career commenced at the high school level \nat Gilmour Academy and Collinwood High, both in Ohio, before he became \nthe head freshman coach at Miami in 1956. Five seasons later, he joined \nthe varsity as an assistant. He left Miami in 1963 to join John Pont's \nstaff at Yale and after Pont resigned to become head coach at Indiana, \nCozza became the Bulldogs' new head coach.\n  The lives he touched--let's just say they all remember. They all are \ngrateful. At a farewell dinner last fall, all but one of his captains \ncame back to pay tribute. The only one who didn't appear was on \nbusiness and couldn't get away. Each shared a story about him.\n  Sending written tributes, congratulating the coach on an incredible \ncareer, were President Clinton and former Presidents Bush and Ford. \nGov. John Rowland proclaimed the day he coached his final game Carm \nCozza Day and New Haven Mayor John DeStefano did the same for the city.\n  Carmen Louis Cozza was born on June 10, 1930, in Parma, OH. He earned \n11 varsity letters in football, basketball, track, and baseball, while \nserving as class president his last 3 years, at Parma High and was \ninducted into the school's Hall of Fame in 1982. Cozza and his wife, \nthe former Jean Annable, reside in Orange, not far from his beloved \nYale.\n  We'll all miss this living legend's presence on the football field. \nBut his presence in our hearts and the memories of his great career \nwill live on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2150-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2151-S2152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN EAST TEMOR\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on Sunday, March 2, 1997, the \nWashington Post ran two op-eds profiling how the award of the Nobel \nPeace Prizes to Asian democratic activists in recent years have helped \ndraw attention to the terrible human rights situation in Burma and in \nEast Timor. The two companion articles highlighted the work of 1991 \nNobel winner Aung San Suu Syi and the 1996 cowinners Bishop Carlos \nXimenes Belo and Jose Ramos Horta.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Ramos Horta late last month, and he \ntold me how--since the Nobel Committee's announcement in October--the \nattention of international policymakers and the press on the plight of \nEast Timor has increased dramatically.\n  Mr. President, the joint award to Bishop Belo and Mr. Ramos Horta, \nfollowed by the attention in the United States focused on political \ncampaign contributions from Indonesians, has made United States policy \ntoward Indonesia and human rights issues related to East Timor the \nsubject of heightened interest. The Nobel Committee said it hoped the \n1996 award would draw international attention to the situation in East \nTimor, and help build momentum for resolution of the conflict there.\n  I commend the Nobel Committee's decision, because I believe the more \nlight that the international community sheds on the horrible abuses \ntaking place in East Timor, the sooner we will come to a resolution of \nthis conflict.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the March 2, \n1997, Washington Post article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 2, 1997]\n\n         In East Timor, Teetering on the Edge of More Bloodshed\n\n                          (By Matthew Jardine)\n\n       ``Hello, Mister. Where are you from?''\n       I had just arrived at the tiny airport in Dili, capital of \n     Indonesian-occupied East Timor. The man, clad in civilian \n     clothes, didn't identify himself except to say he was from \n     Java, Indonesia's principal island. His questions--and the \n     respect he seemed to command from uniformed officials at the \n     airport--led me to believe he was an intelligence agent. As \n     the only obviously non-Indonesian or East Timorese on this \n     daily flight from Bali a few months ago, I attracted his \n     attention.\n       ``Are you a journalist?'' the man asked, examining my \n     passport. ``Where are you planning to stay?''\n       I mentioned a local hotel and told him I was a tourist, a \n     common lie that journalists tell to avoid immediate expulsion \n     from places such as East Timor. I wasn't surprised by the \n     scrutiny: During my first trip to East Timor in 1992, I was \n     frequently followed and questioned as I traveled around the \n     tropical, mountainous territory, which makes up half of an \n     uncommonly beautiful island at the eastern end of the \n     Indonesian archipelago, 400 miles north of Australia.\n       But the beauty belies a harsh reality. In the more than 21 \n     years since Indonesia invaded East Timor and annexed it, more \n     than 200,000 people--about one-third of the country's pre-\n     invasion population--have died as a result of the invasion, \n     Indonesia's subsequent campaign of repression, the ensuing \n     famine and East Timorese resistance to the ongoing \n     occupation, according to Amnesty International.\n       East Timor was a backwater of the Portuguese colonial \n     empire until April 1974, when the military dictatorship in \n     Lisbon was overthrown. Two pro-independence political parties \n     sprung up in East Timor; this development scared the \n     Indonesian military, which feared that an independent East \n     Timor could incite secessionist movements elsewhere in the \n     ethnically diverse archipelago or serve as a platform for \n     leftist subversion.\n       Indonesian intelligence agents began covertly interfering \n     in East Timor's decolonization, helping to provoke a brief \n     civil war between the two pro-independence parties. Amid the \n     chaos, Portugal abandoned its rule of the island. Soon after, \n     Indonesian troops attacked from West Timor (Indonesia has \n     governed the island's western half since its own independence \n     in 1949), culminating in a full-scale invasion on Dec. 7, \n     1975. They met with fierce resistance from Falintil, the East \n     Timorese guerrilla army. But the war turned in Indonesia's \n     favor with the procurement of counterinsurgency aircraft from \n     the Carter administration.\n       The Indonesian military was able to bomb and napalm the \n     population into submission, almost destroying the resistance \n     as well. An Australian parliamentary report later called it \n     ``indiscriminate killing on a scale unprecedented in post-\n     World War II history.''\n       Until 1989, East Timor was virtually closed to the outside \n     world. Then the Indonesian government ``opened'' the \n     territory to tourism and foreign investment, but continued to \n     restrict visits by international human rights monitors and \n     journalists.\n       As my taxi left the airport, I saw immediate evidence of \n     change since my 1992 visit: On a wall near the airport \n     entrance, someone had boldly spray-painted ``Viva Bishop \n     Belo,'' a tribute to Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, the head of \n     East Timor's Catholic Church. Belo and Jose Ramos Horta were \n     awarded the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize for their opposition to \n     Indonesian oppression.\n       During my 1992 visit, most East Timorese seemed too afraid \n     to make direct eye contact with me. This time, many people \n     greeted me as I walked the streets in Dili, a picturesque \n     city of 150,000. Some, particularly younger people, flashed a \n     ``V'' sign for victory, a display of their nationalist \n     sympathies.\n       East Timorese with the means to own a parabolic antenna can \n     now watch Portuguese state television (RTP)--which beams its \n     signal into the territory over Indonesia's objections--and \n     catch glimpses of pro-independence leaders in exile or those \n     hiding in the mountains. During my visit, RTP broadcast a \n     documentary on Falintil, which now numbers around 600 \n     guerrillas. The documentary, clandestinely made by a British \n     filmaker, contained footage of David Alex, a 21-year veteran \n     in the struggle against the Indonesian military and third in \n     the Falintil command. He is well known to the East Timorse, \n     but few had ever seen him or heard his voice until the \n     broadcast.\n       Despite these openings, East Timor remains a place where \n     few dare to speak their minds in public and even fewer dare \n     to invite foreigners into their homes. ``We are very happy \n     that the world has recognized our suffering with the Nobel \n     Prize,'' a middle-aged woman told me in a brief conversation \n     on a shady street, ``but we still live in a prison.'' Our \n     talk ended abruptly when a stranger appeared.\n       The streets of Dili are empty by 9 p.m. Accordingly to \n     several people I interviewed, Indonesian soldiers randomly \n     attack people, especially youths, who are outside at night. \n     Matters are worse in rural areas, where the Catholic Church \n     has less of a presence. ``Outside the towns, people are at \n     the total mercy of the Indonesian military,'' one priest \n     said.\n       Increasing international scrutiny has forced Indonesia to \n     be more discreet in dealing with suspected pro-independence \n     activists. But arrests, torture and extrajudicial executions \n     are still common, human rights researchers say.\n       Such repression, however, has not stilled opposition to \n     Indonesia's authority. Open protests have been a sporadic \n     occurrence since November 1994, when 28 East Timorese \n     students and workers occupied the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta \n     during President Clinton's visit to Indonesia. Demonstrations \n     and riot erupted in Dili and in other towns.\n       Protesters sometimes target Indonesian settlers and \n     businesses, a manifestation of the deep resentment caused by \n     the large scale migration of Indonesians into the territory. \n     There are upwards of 150,000 Indonesian migrants in East \n     Timor (out of a population of 800,000 to 900,000), according \n     to researchers. This influx, combined with administrative \n     corruption and the destruction caused\n\n[[Page S2152]]\n\n     by the war, has overwhelmed the indigenous population. \n     Joblessness and underemployment, especially among the young \n     East Timorese, are high.\n       Indonesia maintains order through a highly visible military \n     force of 20,000 to 30,000 troops and an extensive \n     administrative apparatus. But a sophisticated underground \n     resistance in the towns and villages challenges its \n     authority. The underground has strong links to Falintil \n     guerrillas in the mountains and to the resistance's \n     diplomatic front abroad, led by Ramos Horta.\n       I saw this firsthand when I spent 24 hours during my trip \n     with David Alex and 10 of the 150 Falintil guerrillas under \n     his command. Underground activists drove me to a rural safe \n     house, where I was taken on a lengthy hike to the guerrillas' \n     mountain camp. My transport in and out of the region relied \n     on the cooperation of numerous people from many walks of \n     life, exposing the hollowness of Indonesia's claims that the \n     resistance is marginalized and isolated within East Timor.\n       Many East Timorese told me that only the United States, \n     Indonesia's longtime military and economic patron, has the \n     clout to pressure the Jakarta government into resolving the \n     conflict. Successive U.S. administrations have provided \n     Indonesia with billions in aid since the 1975 invasion, \n     despite United Nations resolutions calling upon Indonesia to \n     withdraw and allow the East Timorese to determine their own \n     future.\n       Bill Clinton, who called U.S. policy toward East Timor \n     ``unconscionable'' before he became president, seems just as \n     beholden as his predecessors to the lure of Indonesia, which \n     Richard Nixon once called ``by far the greatest prize'' in \n     Southeast Asia. The Clinton administration has provided \n     Indonesia with almost $400 million in economic aid, has sold \n     or licensed the sale of $270 million in weaponry.\n       Meanwhile, East Timor teeters on the edge of increased \n     violence. On Dec. 24, 100,000 people gathered in Dili to \n     welcome Bishop Belo back from receiving the Nobel Prize in \n     Oslo. Youths in the crowd, apparently fueled by rumors of an \n     Indonesian military plot to assassinate Belo, attacked two \n     men who they suspected of being in the Indonesian military \n     and killed another carrying a pistol and a walkie-talkie. \n     (Belo had announced a month before that the military had \n     twice made attempts on his life.)\n       In the past three weeks, rioting has broken out in two \n     different regions of the territory. Indonesian troops have \n     responded with a major crackdown and numerous arrests. Rep. \n     Frank Wolf (R-Va.), after a recent three-day visit to East \n     Timor, described the atmosphere as one of ``terror'' and \n     ``total and complete fear.''\n       Some East Timorese I met on my recent visit expressed fears \n     that the violence and repression will intensify. ``The people \n     here are desperate,'' one priest said. ``If the situation \n     does not change soon, there will be much more \n     bloodshed.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2151-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MR.

Gilbert will come together to remember a man whose \nlife embodied the core values we hold so dear. While many people will \nattend tonight's service at Cosmopolitan Community Church in Chicago, \nhowever, they will be only a very small fraction of those whose lives \nhe touched, and those whose lives he made better.\n  Herman Gilbert was a leader; he was a doer; he made things happen. \nAll of his life, he worked to make his community a better place in \nwhich to live. All of his life he worked to open the doors of \nopportunity. All of his life he strove to turn what Dr. Martin Luther \nKing called the American ``Declaration of Intent'' into the reality of \nlife for every American.\n  Herman Gilbert led in many fields. He was a publisher; he cofounded \nPath Press to publish books by and about African-Americans. He was a \npolitical leader; he was one of the cofounders of the Chicago League of \nNegro Voters in 1959, and he served as chief of staff to Congressman \nGus Savage for 2 years. He was a civil rights leader, working closely \nwith Dr. King and Mayor Harold Washington of Chicago to fulfill the \npromise of America for minority Americans. He was a labor leader, \nactive in the United Packinghouse Workers, a progressive union.\n  Herman Gilbert was a strong man, with strong views. He brought \ndetermination, intelligence, good judgment, and perhaps most \nimportantly, a real commitment to principle and to fundamental values, \nin everything he did. He knew that nothing worth having comes easily, \nthat real achievement is built on hard work--and he worked hard all of \nhis life for his family, for his community, for African-Americans as a \npeople, and for his country.\n  I know he will be greatly missed by his wife, Ivy, by his sister, \nAddie Lawrence, by his son, Vincent, by his daughter, Dorothea, by his \nstepdaughter, Lynnette Tate, and by his grandchildren. He will also be \nmissed by the people of Mariana, AR, where he was born, by the people \nof Cairo, IL, where his family moved in 1937, by the people of the city \nof Chicago, where he spent most of his life, and by people all across \nthis country who have so benefited from his lifetime of effort on their \nbehalf, and on behalf of us all.\n  I will greatly miss him, Mr. President. His was a life that made a \ndifference for many, many people; his was a life that made an important \ndifference for me. Like the others whose lives he touched, I have \ngreatly benefited from the legacy embodied in the life and work of \nHerman C. Gilbert.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2152-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMMENDATION UPON THE RETIREMENT OF KAY DOWHOWER\n\n Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity and make a few comments about a bill that my colleague, \nSenator Max Baucus introduced yesterday. The bill, known as the Rural \nHealth Improvement Act, is designed to help struggling, small, rural \nhospitals across America.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Baucus as an original cosponsor of this \nimportant bill. It will go a long way in helping people served by rural \nfacilities.\n  As cochairman of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, I have worked long \nand hard to ensure rural families have access to quality care. This is \nan issue that concerns not just a select few, but all Senators because \nevery State has at lease some low-population areas.\n  Unfortunately, too many of our small hospitals are confronted with \nthe decision of having to close because they can no longer contend with \ndeclining inpatient stays, costly regulations, and low Medicare \nreimbursement rates. However, closing hospitals is not an acceptable \noption in Wyoming. In my State, if a town loses its most important \npoint of service--the emergency reoom--it is typical for patients to \ndrive 100 miles or more to the closest tertiary care center.\n  With the Medicare trust fund going broke, it also is understood that \nunderutilized facilities cannot continue to be subsidized. However, an \nalternative must still be available. That is why it is necessary to \ngive small rural hospitals the ability to downsize without having to \nmaintain a full-service operation.\n  Mr. President, the Rural Health Improvement Act allows facilities to \nreconfigure their service and reduce excess bed capacity while \nretaining access to emergency care. In short, the bill presents \ncommunities with a viable option. It accommodates different levels of \nmedical care throughout a State while providing stabilization services \nneeded in remote areas.\n  The bill is one in a series of measures the Rural Health Caucus is \nworking on designed to improve quality medical care in rural America. \nIt is similar to legislation I introduced as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, and I look forward to working with Senator Baucus to \npass this important, bipartisan piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2152-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S2153]]\n\n\n\n                       SAFE AND SOBER STREETS ACT\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG.

I do hope, Mr. President, that somehow, \nthrough Radio Free Asia or other means, he will learn that the Senate \nof the United States is sincerely concerned about him and will continue \nto work for his freedom--as we will for all prisoners of conscience in \nChina and Tibet.\n  Senate Resolution 19 proposes to put the U.S. Senate on record in \nsupport of the release of Mr. Choephel, a strong resolution on China \nand Tibet at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva and access to \nTibet for internationally recognized human rights group.\n  This resolution assures Tibetans--those in Nepal and India where they \nwait for the day they can reclaim their homeland, and those inside \nTibet where they resist the cultural, religious, and political \noppression of the Chinese Central Government--we in the United States \nhave not forgotten you. We are with you. We will always be with you.\n  Yesterday, March 10, was Tibet National Uprising Day, the anniversary \nof Tibet's 1959 uprising against the Chinese occupation.\n  For almost 40 years, the Tibetan people have been resisting Chinese \noccupation, while working to preserve their culture in exile in India \nand Nepal. Repression inside Tibet has been raised to a level not seen \nsince the Cultural Revolution. China has absorbed large portions of \nTibet into neighboring provinces and conducted a concerted campaign to \ndilute Tibet's population through the relocation of Han Chinese. \nTibet's leaders fear that Tibetans are now in the minority inside \nTibet.\n  China seeks to limit the number of young people who enter religious \nlife. Monks are forced to undergo political indoctrination and to \nrenounce the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama himself is the focus of \nvirulent attacks. His photograph is banned. China has detained the \nPanchen Lama, a young boy who is the reincarnation of Tibet's second \nmost important religious figure, and selected its own rival Panchen \nLama. The number of political prisoners has\n\n[[Page S2154]]\n\nincreased dramatically--Ngawang Choephel, the subject of this \nresolution is just one case. There are many, many others.\n  Yesterday was also the opening day of the U.N. Human Rights \nCommission in Geneva. Mr. President, Senate Resolution 19 reminds \nPresident Clinton and his administration of their responsibility to \nsupport and bring about the passage of a strong resolution on China and \nTibet at Geneva, and to raise relentlessly Mr. Choephel's case, and \nother cases, with the Chinese Government, while pressing for access to \nTibet by human rights monitors.\n  The administration must take this responsibility seriously and \nsincerely. However, according to news reports, the administration's \nposition on a China resolution at the Commission is just a bargaining \nchip in United States-China relations. There are frequent reports that \nthe United States may drop, or soften, a resolution at Geneva in \nexchange for some future progress on human rights in China.\n  We have been down this road before with the administration. It is \ndifficult to fathom what the administration believes it is achieving by \nrushing to entice China with softer positions on human rights, on \nproliferation, or on Hong Kong. Last year, the administration itself \nreports, human rights in China deteriorated. The President himself \nadmitted that his engagement policy has not brought results. It makes \nno sense to mute or abandon our objections to China's record at the \nU.N. Human Rights Commission in exchange for nebulous commitments. The \nadministration must tell the truth at Geneva.\n  In Burma, as well, the administration has recognized a marked \ndeterioration in human rights over the past year. For several months, \nthe administration has been reviewing its policy toward Burma in order \nto determine whether to impose a ban on new United States investment. \nThe administration last year signed into a law specifying criteria for \nimposing an investment ban--first, restrictions on, physical harm to, \nor the exile of Aung San Suu Kyi, or second, widespread repression of \nthe democratic opposition.\n  The SLORC regime is doing both, and the administration knows it. \nSince last summer, the SLORC has conducted a campaign of intimidation, \narrests, disappearances, and some executions of democratic activists, \nand those close to them. Aung San Suu Kyi has repeatedly been kept from \nmeeting and communicating with her supporters. Her phone service has \nbeen periodically cut. Her car was attacked.\n  Throughout all of this, the administration continued to review the \nlaw. It's time to follow the law. By failing to do so, the \nadministration has signaled both the SLORC and our allies in the region \nthat the United States isn't serious about supporting democracy or \ncombating drug trafficking in Burma.\n  Now comes a new tragedy in Burma. For the past few weeks, the SLORC \nhas been waging a campaign against the ethnic Karen rebels, the only \nmajor ethnic army which has not yet signed a cease-fire with the \nregime. The Karen, who are Christian, will not submit to SLORC's \ncontrol. The Thai Army has been repatriating refugees to Burma--in \nviolation of international law. The carnage on the border provides yet \nanother reason to invoke sanctions on the SLORC regime not just because \nit's the decent thing to do, but because U.S. law requires it.\n  The Karen National Union was one of several ethnic nationalities \nwhich agreed in January to a common platform of support for democracy, \nopposition to Burma's membership in ASEAN, rejection of the rigged \nconstitutional convention and the SLORC's cosmetic actions against \nnarcotics production and trafficking, and opposition to foreign \ninvestment.\n  The Karen National Union is part of the democratic opposition in \nBurma. The massive and brutal attacks on the KNU by the SLORC regime \nclearly trigger the Cohen-Feinstein condition on widespread repression \nof the democratic opposition.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, yesterday, March 10, marked the 38th \nanniversary of the Tibetan uprising, at a time when many Tibetan \ncitizens gave their lives to defend their freedom and to prevent the \nDalai Lama from being kidnaped by the Chinese Army. For those who stand \nwith the Tibetan people, it is a day to consider what can be done to \nlend support to their aspirations. The United States Senate will mark \nthe occasion by adopting this resolution Senate Resolution 19, \nintroduced on the first day of the 105th Congress, condemning the \negregious prison sentence imposed by the Chinese Government on Hgawang \nChoephel. The Foreign Relations Committee has considered the measure \nand unanimously reported-out the resolution last week.\n  Mr. Choephel, a Tibetan ethnomusicologist and Fulbright Scholar, \nreturned to Tibet in July 1995 to prepare a documentary film about \ntraditional Tibetan performing arts. He was detained in August 1995 by \nthe Chinese authorities and held incommunicado for over a year before \nthe Government of the People's Republic of China admitted to holding \nhim, and finally charged him with espionage in October 1996.\n  On December 26, 1996, the Chinese Government sentenced Ngawang \nChoephel to an 18-year prison term plus 4 years subsequent deprivation \nof his political rights following a secret trial. This is the most \nsevere sentence of a Tibetan by the Chinese Government in 7 years.\n  The imprisonment of Ngawang Choephel reflects the broader conflict \nbetween Tibetans and Chinese. Mr. Choephel's arrest, and harsh \nsentence, appear to stem from his collecting information to preserve \nTibetan performing arts. Such treatment of Tibetans is indicative of \nthe extreme measures the Chinese Government continues to take to \nrepress all forms of Tibetan cultural expression. To the Chinese \nGovernment, which views Tibetan religion and culture as an impediment \nto successfully unifying Tibet with the ``motherland,'' such efforts \nare reactionary. As we have seen, they are so threatening that Mr. \nChoephel has been sentenced to 18 years imprisonment for his efforts. \nThe New York Times editorial on January 2 explains:\n\n       The basis of Ngawang Choephel's conviction is unclear, but \n     even taping Tibetan culture for export could qualify as \n     espionage under Chinese law. Since its invasion of Tibet in \n     1950, Beijing has gradually increased its efforts to erase \n     Tibet's identity. China has arrested those who protested the \n     takeover and tried to eradicate the people's affection for \n     the leader of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama.\n\n  My first encounter with this transcending issue came with my \nappointment as Ambassador to India a near quarter-century ago. In 1975, \nalong with my daughter Maura Moynihan, I visited China as a guest of \nGeorge Bush, who was then Chief of our U.S. Liaison Office in Peking. \nBy this time, I was persuaded the Soviet Union would break up along \nethnic lines. But I was not prepared for the intensity of ethnic \ntensions in the People's Republic. One was met at the Canton railroad \nstation by a giant mural of Mao surrounded by ecstatic non-Chinese \npeoples who occupy more than half the nominal territory of the People's \nRepublic. In Beijing, 3-year-olds in the Neighborhood Revolutionary \nCommittee of Chi Eh Tao nursery school sang a patriotic song for us \nwhich began:\n\n       We will grow up quickly to settle the border regions. We \n     will denounce and crush Lin Piao and Confucious\n\n  A refrain which ended:\n\n       We will each grow a pair of industrial hands.\n\n  Much of that Stalinoid dementia has disappeared from the coastal \nregions of China, at least for the moment, but not from Tibet. My \ndaughter Maura has traveled to Tibet several times. After her most \nrecent trip last year, she wrote in the Washington Post of the Chinese \nassault on Tibetan religion and culture:\n\n       Beijing's leaders have renewed their assault on Tibetan \n     culture, especially Buddhism, with an alarming vehemence. The \n     rhetoric and the methods of the Cultural Revolution of the \n     1960s have been resurrected--reincarnated, what you will--to \n     shape an aggressive campaign to vilify the Dalai Lama.\n\n  The resolution before us records the United States Senate's response \nto these Chinese policies. We reject Chinese efforts to ``erase Tibet's \nidentity'' and their ``assault on Tibetan culture.'' Tibetans must be \nfree, not only to preserve their identity and culture, but to determine \ntheir future for themselves.\n  In the words of the International Commission of Jurists in 1960, \n``Tibet demonstrated from 1913 to 1950 the conditions of statehood as \ngenerally accepted under international law.'' The\n\n[[Page S2155]]\n\nGovernment of the People's Republic of China should know that as the \nTibetan people and His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet go forward on \ntheir journey toward freedom the Congress and the people of the United \nStates stand with them.\n  I thank all my colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution. In \nparticular I would like to recognize the long commitment that the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee Senator Helms, has shown in \nsupport of Tibetans and thank him for joining me in this effort today. \nI would also thank both Senators from Vermont, who have remained \nengaged in this matter since it was made known and for their joining me \nas a cosponsor of this measure.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Senate's \npassage of Senate Resolution 19, regarding United States opposition to \nthe prison sentence of Tibetan ethno-musicologist Ngawang Choephel by \nthe Government of the People's Republic of China. I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this resolution, which was introduced by Senator \nMoynihan, and was successfully reported out of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee last week.\n  This resolution expresses the Senate's strong sense that Ngawang \nChoephel should be released from the prison where he has been held in \nsince 1995. It also urges the United States to raise the issue of his \nrelease with Chinese officials, to promote a resolution at the U.N. \nHuman Rights Commission, and to seek access for human rights monitors \nin Tibet.\n  Mr. Choephel, a Tibetan national who--with the support of a Fulbright \nscholarship--studied ethno-musicology at Middlebury College in Vermont, \nwas detained by the Chinese authorities in Tibet in August 1995. After \nbeing held incommunicado for a year, he was charged with espionage in \nOctober 1996. In December of that year, the Chinese sentenced him to a \n18-year prison term following a secret trial.\n  Mr. Choephel was preparing a documentary film about traditional \nTibetan performing arts when he was detained. The State Department says \nthere is no evidence that his activities were anything but academic. \nUnfortunately, Mr. Choephel's arrest and sentence appear consistent \nwith previous Chinese actions to repress cultural expression in Tibet.\n  The U.S. State Department and several human rights organizations, \nincluding Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, note that China \nconsistently denies Tibetans their fundamental human rights. According \nto the most recent State Department Human Rights report, Chinese \nauthorities continue to commit widespread and well-documented human \nrights abuse, in violation of internationally accepted norms. Credible \nreports include instances of death in detention, torture, arbitrary \narrest, detention without public trial, and intensified controls on \nreligion and on freedom of speech and the press, particularly for \nethnic Tibetans.\n  Since its occupation of Tibet in 1949, the Chinese have also been \nresponsible for the destruction of much of Tibetan civilization. The \narrest of Mr. Choephel, who was engaged in efforts to preserve Tibetan \nculture, reflects China's systematic attempt to repress cultural \nexpression in Tibet.\n  It is crucial that the Senate continue to send the signal that human \nrights abuses should not be tolerated, and should figure prominently in \nforeign policy deliberations. As a member of the Senate Subcommittee on \nAsia, I feel that the United States must continue to urge China to \nrespect Tibet's unique religious, linguistic, and cultural traditions \nand observe fundamental human rights in Tibet and elsewhere.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and any statements relating to the resolution \nappear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 19) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 19\n\n       Whereas the Chinese Government sentenced Ngawang Choephel \n     to an 18 year prison term plus 4 years subsequent deprivation \n     of his political rights on December 26, 1996, following a \n     secret trial;\n       Whereas Mr. Choephel is a Tibetan national whose family \n     fled Chinese oppression to live in exile in India in 1968;\n       Whereas Mr. Choephel studied ethnomu- sicology at \n     Middlebury College in Vermont as a Fulbright Scholar, and at \n     the Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts in Dharamsala, \n     India;\n       Whereas Mr. Choephel returned to Tibet in July 1995 to \n     prepare a documentary film about traditional Tibetan \n     performing arts;\n       Whereas Mr. Choephel was detained in August 1995 by the \n     Chinese authorities and held incommunicado for over a year \n     before the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     admitted to holding him, and finally charged him with \n     espionage in October 1996;\n       Whereas there is no evidence that Mr. Choephel's activities \n     in Tibet involved anything other than purely academic \n     research;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     denies Tibetans their fundamental human rights, as reported \n     in the State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights \n     Practices, and by human rights organizations including \n     Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, Asia;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China is \n     responsible for the destruction of much of Tibetan \n     civilization since its invasion of Tibet in 1949;\n       Whereas the arrest of a Tibetan scholar, such as Mr. \n     Choephel who worked to preserve Tibetan culture, reflects the \n     systematic attempt by the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China to repress cultural expression in Tibet;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China, \n     through direct and indirect incentives, has established \n     discriminatory development programs which have resulted in an \n     overwhelming flow of Chinese immigrants into Tibet, including \n     those areas incorporated into the Chinese provinces of \n     Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and Quinghai, and have excluded \n     Tibetans from participation in important policy decisions, \n     which further threatens traditional Tibetan life;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China, \n     withholds meaningful participation in the governance of Tibet \n     from Tibetans and has failed to abide by its own \n     constitutional guarantee of autonomy for Tibetans;\n       Whereas the Dalai Lama of Tibet has stated his willingness \n     to enter into negotiations with the Chinese and has \n     repeatedly accepted the framework Deng Xiaoping proposed for \n     such negotiations in 1979;\n       Whereas the United States Government has not developed an \n     effective plan to win support in international fora, such as \n     the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, to bring \n     international pressure to bear on the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China to improve human rights and to \n     negotiate with the Dalai Lama;\n       Whereas the Chinese have displayed provocative disregard \n     for American concerns by arresting and sentencing prominent \n     dissidents around the time that senior United States \n     Government officials have visited China; and\n       Whereas United States Government policy seeks to foster \n     negotiations between the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China and the Dalai Lama, and presses China to respect \n     Tibet's unique religious, linguistic, and cultural \n     traditions: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Ngawang Choephel and other prisoners of conscience in \n     Tibet, as well as in China, should be released immediately \n     and unconditionally;\n       (2) to underscore the gravity of this matter, in all \n     official meetings with representatives of the Government of \n     the People's Republic of China, United States officials \n     should request Mr. Choephel's immediate and unconditional \n     release;\n       (3) the United States Government should take prompt action \n     to sponsor and promote a resolution at the United Nations \n     Commission on Human Rights regarding China and Tibet which \n     specifically addresses political prisoners and negotiations \n     with the Dalai Lama;\n       (4) an exchange program should be established in honor of \n     Ngawang Choephel, involving students of the Tibetan Institute \n     of Performing Arts and appropriate educational institutions \n     in the United States; and,\n       (5) the United States Government should seek access for \n     internationally recognized human rights groups to monitor \n     human rights in Tibet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/11/senate-section/article/S2153-5", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2155-S2156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, MARCH 12, 1997\n\n  Mr. ROTH.
