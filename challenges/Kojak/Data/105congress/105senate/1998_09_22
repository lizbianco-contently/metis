Following that vote, there \nwill be up to four additional votes occurring in stacked sequence with \nminimal debate time between each vote.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 5, line 10, insert ``(i)'' after ``(A)''.\n       On page 5, line 15, strike ``or'' and insert ``and''.\n       On page 5, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n       ``(ii) when any party in interest moves for dismissal or \n     conversion, whether the party in interest dealt in good faith \n     with the debtor; or''.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, my amendment to S. 1301 is designed to \nencourage responsible lending by the credit card industry just as the \nunderlying motivation of the bill is to require responsible borrowing \nby the general population of the United States.\n  Under the present legislation before us, a credit card company, or a \ncreditor, may go into a bankruptcy court and request that the judge \nmove a petition from chapter 7 to chapter 13 if the individual has the \nability to pay at least 20 percent and is not acting in bad faith. My \namendment will certainly look at the other side of the transaction and \nrequire that the creditor also act in good faith.\n  As I have indicated before, section 707 of this legislation will, for \nthe first time, give the power to creditors to request that a court \nconvert a chapter 7 petition into a chapter 13 case. This is \ndiscretionary with the judge. It is not mandatory. But implicit in \nthat, I believe, is already the standard of good faith that the judge \nwill require through his or her analysis of the request of the change \nfrom chapter 7 to chapter 13. But I believe it is appropriate--indeed, \nnecessary--to have an explicit standard of good faith on behalf of the \ncreditor, as well as on behalf of the debtor.\n  The bankruptcy judge, in considering this request, will first have to \ndetermine that the individual debtor has the ability to pay at least 20 \npercent of the claims against the debt, and, in addition, the judge \nwill have to consider whether the debtor filed for chapter 7 in bad \nfaith.\n  Once again, my amendment would propose a complementary analysis of \nthe creditor, whether that creditor has been offering credit in good \nfaith.\n  This is not only fair but is something that is necessary to maintain \nthe balance and the appropriateness of this change to a longstanding \nrule in bankruptcy court which allowed the debtor to go in and file in \nchapter 7.\n  Now, we understand the differences between these two provisions of \nthe bankruptcy code. Chapter 7 allows the debtor to discharge all of \ntheir debts. Chapter 13 requires them to repay a portion of the debts \nbased upon their ability to repay.\n  The proponents of this legislation have suggested that by using this \nmeans test, by saying that if a debtor can pay at least 20 percent and \nrequiring them, or at least giving the judge the option to put them \ninto a provision of chapter 13 where they must repay a portion, this \nprocedure will reduce the abuse of the bankruptcy system, the abuse \nthat is cited in terms of people coming in with that but still \ndeclaring under chapter 7 they cannot pay and having all of their debts \ndischarged.\n  We know that part of the impetus behind this legislation is the \nincrease in bankruptcy filings throughout the United States. The \nproponents of this legislation have pointed out that in 1997 alone \nthere were a record 1.3 million bankruptcy filings, and over the past \n10 years the bankruptcy filings have increased year after year after \nyear. Unfortunately, these assertions are correct.\n  In my State of Rhode Island, there has been a 500-percent increase in \nbankruptcy filings between 1984 and 1996. And so I think everyone is \nconcerned and, indeed, everyone is interested in working out an \narrangement which will prevent the abuse of the bankruptcy system, and \nthat is a part of the underlying legislation.\n  Just focusing alone, however, on the increase in bankruptcy filings \nmisses the full story because it is just one side of the story. On the \nother side, there has been an explosion in the extension of credit by \nthe credit industry of the United States. Many times their standards \nfor underwriting have diminished substantially. Many times they are \nissuing credit--in fact, fostering credit upon people at exorbitant \ninterest rates. This, too, must be factored into our analysis of the \nbankruptcy problem in the United States today. Between 1986 and 1996, \ntotal bankruptcy filings did increase by 122 percent, but outstanding \nrevolving consumer credit increased by almost twice as much--238 \npercent.\n  So when you look at both sides of the story, the analysis would lead \nme to believe, very strongly, that this is not solely the problem of \nindividual debtors gaming the system and taking advantage of this \nsystem. This is also the problem of the credit card industry, and the \ncredit industry in general, that is fostering and pushing credit on \nsome people who they know are incapable of keeping up with their debts. \nAnd so when we look at these changes, we have to look at both sides of \nthe question.\n  Now, this whole trend in the explosion of credit is reflected \ngraphically in the analysis of household debt and income data. Back in \n1974, total household debt was 24 percent of aggregate household \nincome. Today, that same ratio is 104 percent. That is graphic evidence \nof not only the increased access to credit but the unusually robust and \nforceful presentation of credit and availability of credit throughout \nthe United States.\n  We all know this in daily life. You just have to go to your mailbox \nevery day and get a credit card solicitation. You just have to sit in \nyour home from early morning to late at night 7 days a week and answer \nthe telephone and hear a solicitation from a credit card company saying \nthey want to give you credit. It is annoying, it is constant, and it \nreflects this incredible urge on the part of the industry to push \ncredit as much as they can.\n\n  Last year, for example, the credit card companies sent out over 2 \nbillion credit card solicitations. By my calculation, that is roughly \n10 for every American man, woman and child. A recent Wall Street \nJournal article about a California family demonstrated just the \nubiquitous and constant effort to get people to sign up for these \ncredit cards. In 1997 alone, this one family was offered almost $5 \nmillion in credit through mail solicitations. The wife, who was not \nworking and without independent income, was offered more than $2.5 \nmillion in credit. Her husband, who was president of a nonprofit \norganization, earning a good salary, on the other hand, was offered \nonly $592,000 in credit, suggesting that the industry is not so much \ninterested in how much you make but really how much you potentially \nmight spend. In that regard, the daughter in the household was offered \nanother $1.4 million in credit--in 1 year.\n  What does this say? This says that the industry is not looking \ncarefully at\n\n[[Page S10675]]\n\nwhere it is sending its solicitations. It is not looking at those \npeople who can pay, and, in fact, in many cases it is burdening people \nalready in debt with further debt, and now what they would like to do, \nwhen these individuals come before the bankruptcy court, is they would \nlike to say, well, listen, you people who can't discharge your debts \nfully, you have to pay up. I think, again, that the appropriate \nbalance, if we are to pursue this ability to move from chapter 13 to \nchapter 7, is to at least look at the good faith of the credit card \nindustry.\n  In view of these facts, Mr. President, it becomes clear that the \nincrease in bankruptcy filings is not simply a result of more borrowers \nborrowing more money. It is also a factor of these credit card \ncompanies soliciting poorer and poorer credit risks, and doing it quite \ndeliberately, quite knowingly.\n  Data from the National Bankruptcy Review Commission supports this \nassertion. Indeed, this data suggests that the proportional incidence \nof bankruptcy filings has actually decreased slightly in the last 20 \nyears. We have seen the numbers go up, up, up. But if you look at the \nratio, if you look at the proportional incidence, given the outstanding \ncredit, there has been a slight decrease. In 1977, there were 0.74 \nbankruptcies for every million dollars of consumer credit. In 1997, \nthere are 0.73 bankruptcies for every million dollars in consumer \ncredit.\n  So when you, again, look at the situation, it is not simply a group \nof Americans who have suddenly decided that they no longer want to \nhonor their obligations, that they want to abandon the tradition of \nresponsible credit behavior that their fathers and mothers had; these \nstatistics suggest that not much has changed except in the absolute \nnumbers, and that has been driven by this constant extension of credit \nby the companies, in many cases to people who they know are very \nunlikely to be able to keep up with the debts at the time.\n  The approach in the underlying bill overlooks, I think, this other \nside of the equation. They focus solely on the borrower. They take the \n``blame the debtor'' approach. I do not think that is entirely correct. \nMy amendment seeks to address that approach by striking a balance, by \nallowing--in fact requiring--the judge to look at the good faith of the \nindividual company that is extending this credit. Most, indeed, the \nvast majority, of reputable creditors day in and day out take pains to \nensure that they are doing the proper underwriting, that they are \ntargeting people who have the ability to pay and they are not abusing \ntheir ability to market their products. But there are those operators \nwho are not so scrupulous. These unscrupulous operators should not \neasily have the ability to force an individual from one chapter in the \nbankruptcy code to another.\n  At the heart of what my amendment is suggesting is that we explicitly \ndo what I believe is implicit within the existing legislation--that the \njudge makes a finding that the creditor, in fact, operated in good \nfaith. Under the present language, he or she is required to make a \njudgment that the debtor has not acted in bad faith in their \napplication for chapter 7. I think that the same approach, \ncomplimentary approach should be applied to creditors.\n  My amendment adds this good-faith standard, and it is not the only \nplace you will find a good-faith standard or its related bad-faith \nstandard within this legislation and within the bankruptcy code. For \nexample, section 202 of the bill protects the debtor's ability to \ndischarge certain debts if in the language of the bill ``the debtor \nmakes a good-faith effort to negotiate a reasonable alternative \nrepayment schedule.''\n  The point is clear that throughout this legislation we have imposed \ngood-faith standards at various junctures to give the bankruptcy judge \nguidance in assessing various petitions for various claims, so that \nthis amendment is consistent with that good-faith theme throughout the \nlegislation.\n  My legislation does not prescribe specific factors to be considered \non the good-faith standard. Instead, it gives the bankruptcy judge the \ndiscretion to make that judgment. Again, that is consistent with this \nlegislation and also with the general practice in the bankruptcy code. \nJudges, bankruptcy judges particularly, are quite familiar with making \nthese analyses of good-faith judgment, either on the part of the \ncreditor or the part of the debtor. In fact, if you look through the \nbankruptcy code, there are about 79 annotations related to the court's \ninterpretation of ``good faith.'' So it is a constant of the bankruptcy \nlaw and it is something that is not a novel injection into this \nparticular legislation. I think, in fact I am convinced, that the \njudges can handle this analysis of ``good faith'' very clearly and very \nwell.\n  But one might ask, what are we talking about in terms of good faith? \nFor example, if a judge had found that there was intimidation in the \nextension of credit, that is certainly not good faith, and I do not \nthink any creditor should be able to claim this privilege under the \nbankruptcy code if it can be shown they intimidated the creditor. If \nthey are taking advantage of creditors, if their marketing pattern is \nto market to vulnerable people in our population--seniors or low-income \nAmericans who may not have the ability to get good counseling on their \ndebts--all these things together which suggest bad faith, or the lack \nof good faith, if they are consistent, demonstrable, then that judge \nshould not allow the ability for that claimant to demand that debtor be \nmoved from one section of the bankruptcy code to another.\n  All of these things together, I think, suggest very strongly that we \nhave to look out for the exception, in terms of the creditor \npopulation, those unscrupulous creditors. There are examples already in \nthe legislation where we have taken steps to guard against unscrupulous \noperations in the extension of credit. For example, the committee \nreport comments that in section 202 they use ``substantially \njustified'' language to describe or to allow the award of attorney's \nfees in terms of allegations that a debt was obtained fraudulently. \nThat is an attempt, as the committee report says, because they are \n``concerned that some unscrupulous creditors have alleged false \nmisrepresentations with no proof of doing so.'' Indeed, there are \nprotections already in the bill. I think, in this particular section, \n707(b), there should be further protection for the good faith standard \nthat would protect that.\n  I have mentioned also that there is a concern to have some sense of \nwhat might be operating out there presently that would fall under this \nambit of bad faith, or lack of good faith. There is a practice that is \nevolving in the industry of offering, particularly to low-income \npopulations, these loan checks, where essentially they will send a \ncheck unsolicited to the home and all you have to do is sign it to get \nthe money. But once you do that, you now have a debt with a substantial \ninterest rate in many cases. That is the type of behavior I think a \njudge reasonably can look at and say, ``Is this good faith?''\n  For all these reasons and many, many more, the standard of good faith \nshould be obvious to the bankruptcy judge. And I believe the way we \nhave designed this overall legislation and this particular amendment is \nthat we give that individual not only the incentive but also the \nmission to look closely at the company applying for this transfer of \nthe debtor from one chapter to another.\n  I am pleased to say that this particular amendment has been endorsed \nby the Consumer Federation of America and that it represents an attempt \nto balance the standard within this particular legislation. I hope all \nmy colleagues will support this amendment. It seems to me to do several \nthings that are essential.\n  First of all, it recognizes that the problem we face is not solely, \nexclusively as a result of the behavior of debtors; that, in fact, it \nis the result of the behavior of lenders who are lending more and who \nare doing it without the kind of tight underwriting standards that are \nnecessary. In that context, to give them the opportunity to move a \ndebtor from a chapter 7 to a chapter 13 without looking at their \nbehavior, I think, is inappropriate. It is particularly inappropriate \nwhen the judge must consider the behavior of the debtor in filing a \nchapter 7 petition.\n  This amendment, I believe, is a very important one. It will restore \nthe balance in this particular section, section 707 of the underlying \nlegislation, and it will, I think, provide not only a way to safeguard \nagainst abuse of the bankruptcy system by debtors, but also\n\n[[Page S10676]]\n\nstrike a balance so creditors understand they have the responsibility \nto act responsibly also.\n  I urge support of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment by the Senator from Rhode \nIsland is very much a modification of an amendment he proposed which \nwould require bankruptcy judges to consider whether a creditor had used \nsound underwriting practices and standards when considering whether to \ndismiss or convert a chapter 7 to chapter 13. The modified amendment \nnow requires judges to consider whether a creditor acted in good faith \nwhen considering whether to convert or to dismiss that case.\n  It is my understanding from discussions that have gone on between \nSenator Reed's staff and my staff, and from what Senator Reed has said, \nnow, as he has introduced his amendment, that the good faith standard \nin the modified amendment also includes many of the underwriting \nconsiderations in the original amendment. So, accordingly, many of the \nobjections to the original amendment still apply to this modified \namendment presented by the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  At the outset, as with other amendments which relate to lending \npractices, I urge my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on a motion I will make \nto table this amendment because the Banking Committee should have a \nchance to consider this issue. But, since this amendment affects the \nmeans-testing provisions of S. 1301, I would like to describe how this \namendment will be difficult to apply in practice, should it be adopted.\n  Under the bill as written now, judges are directed to consider \nrepayment ability, and given the power to dismiss or convert chapter 7 \ncases if a debtor could repay some portion of his or her debt. This is \nthe very foundation of this legislation. This is what makes this bill, \nthis year, different than any bankruptcy legislation we have had in the \n100-year history--and this is the 100th year that the first national \nbankruptcy code was passed, on an ongoing basis.\n  This amendment also requires judges to consider whether a creditor \nacted in good faith, including a creditor's lending practices. I don't \nthink anyone knows how this amendment will work in the real world. \nThere are questions raised by this amendment but not answered by the \namendment:\n  How would a judge even find out what the creditor's underwriting \npractices are?\n  What is ``good faith'' in the context of section 707(b)?\n  Procedurally, who would have the burden of producing evidence about \nunderwriting practices in good faith?\n  And if a creditor had properly extended credit to the debtor whose \nchapter 7 case is pending, but had recklessly offered credit to other \npeople, is a judge supposed to factor that in as well?\n  What if there are two pending motions asking for dismissal or \nconversion--one motion by a creditor who has sloppy underwriting \npractices or who acted in bad faith, and another motion by a creditor \nwith tight underwriting standards who acted in good faith? In this \ncase, should a judge deny both motions?\n  Mr. President, what these questions show is that the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Rhode Island should be rejected because it \nis not good bankruptcy policy. There are too many unanswered questions \nand, of course, the underlying question regarding which underwriting \npractices are sloppy and which underwriting practices are not sloppy \nneeds to be addressed not by the Judiciary Committee, not on the floor \nof the Senate, but in the laboratory of jurisdiction of that subject \nwhere legislation is perfected, and that happens to be the Senate \nBanking Committee.\n  There are already penalties for creditors who refuse to act in good \nfaith. We made sure they were in this bill. They are a very important \npart of making this a well-balanced piece of legislation.\n  We talk so much about personal responsibility and making it tougher \nto get into bankruptcy that maybe people viewing this debate have \nsensed over the last week that all we are going after is the debtor, \nbut that sometimes creditors don't act in good faith. This bill is \nbalanced because it has penalties against creditors. For instance, if a \ncreditor refuses to negotiate in good faith, then that creditor can't \nobject to the discharge of his or her debt. This is already in the \nbill.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Reed amendment and \neventually get this bill to final passage, because this is a very \nneeded bill. We have 2 weeks to work out some differences between the \nHouse and Senate. The other body's bankruptcy bill is considerably \ndifferent from ours. And I don't say that in a denigrating way; it just \nis different. The process of negotiating for provisions somewhere \nbetween the House and Senate provisions--also we have to consider the \nWhite House, because we want a bill that the President can sign--takes \n2 weeks to get done, and we need to get this bill passed.\n  I hope the Senator from Rhode Island is aware that the 20-percent \nfigure was raised to 30 percent in the managers' amendment. I need to \nclarify that point because that 30-percent figure is also something \nthat the White House was involved in working out as well, because the \nWhite House had raised some concerns about our 20-percent figure.\n  There also was some willingness on the part of the White House to \nconsider some points of view we had about the 30-percent figure, and \nthey even modified their original position, to some extent, to satisfy \nme.\n\n  I think it is odd that the Senator from Rhode Island is critical of \nlenders extending too much credit. When the credit union bill was on \nthe floor, there was an amendment to strike the Community Reinvestment \nAct. The Community Reinvestment Act, of course, requires banks to \nextend credit to low-income people.\n  I don't think that any of us can argue with the social responsibility \nof a bank to be fair to all people and all sectors, with the \nunderstanding that they have a responsibility to the stockholders of \nthat bank and other people who are saving, but, within the concept of \ngood financial prudence, to lend accordingly to all sectors of a city, \nall types of people who have the ability to repay.\n  We had this community reinvestment amendment offered, and we had many \nMembers talk about the need to make sure that credit is widely \navailable to low-income people. What in the heck do you think credit \ncards are about? They are about giving people who maybe would not have \nthat opportunity elsewhere an opportunity to borrow--again, within the \nconcept of personal responsibility for debt.\n  Now, through this amendment, we hear that we should, in effect, deny \na creditor the ability to collect on a debt if the creditor extended \ncredit to low-income people. On the one hand, a month ago we had a bill \nbefore us that we were trying to modify to make it reasonable, and the \nother side, which was opposed to that, said we are hurting low-income \npeople with that amendment. And now with this amendment they are saying \nthat low-income people are people taken advantage of.\n  It seems to me that you can't have it both ways. I believe that \nborrowing and I believe that lending decisions are best made by \nindividual Americans and not second-guessed by bankruptcy judges or \npolitical leaders in Washington, DC.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Let me respond to the Senator from Iowa. First of all, he raised \ninteresting arguments about the amendment I did not propose, which \nwould be a more detailed review of the underwriting practices of credit \ncard companies and those that extend credit. For the reasons he \nillustrated, I did not suggest\n\n[[Page S10677]]\n\nthat amendment, because requiring a bankruptcy judge to look at the \nmyriad of different underwriting standards of companies throughout the \nUnited States would not be appropriate.\n  What is appropriate, I believe, is to require that they look at the \ngood faith of the person who extends the credit and is now requesting \nthat the debtor be transferred from chapter 7 to chapter 13. It seems \nto me to be perfectly consistent with the notion that the judge would \nalso look at the good faith of the debtor--whether that debtor, in \nfact, was trying to use chapter 7 as a dodge. That is already in the \nlegislation.\n  He also raised some very interesting questions about how this will \napply in practice, but I think the answer--a compelling answer, in my \nview--is that this is exactly what a bankruptcy judge is authorized and \nempowered to do on a daily basis--make judgments about the good faith \nof the debtor and, I suggest, also the good faith of the creditor. He \nor she can make these judgments. That is why they are there. They have \nthe facts. This is a standard that is persistent throughout the \nbankruptcy code.\n  There are numerous places in which the judge is called upon to make \ngood-faith determinations. It does not require the kind of searching, \ndetailed analysis of all the credit policies of a particular credit \ncard company or a bank that extends credit, but what it requires is a \ncommonsense view of whether or not the individual who has extended the \ncredit has abused their market power or has, in fact, somehow distorted \nthe relationship which we think is appropriate between a borrower and a \nlender.\n  The Senator from Iowa also makes reference to the CRA Act in terms of \nsuggesting that my demonstration of the explosion of credit is in some \nway inconsistent with suggesting that the Community Reinvestment Act \nplay as positive a role.\n  I do not think we witnessed a 238-percent increase in consumer \ncommunity lending over the last several years as we have witnessed an \nexplosion of the extension of credit by credit card companies. I do not \nthink that we have seen the kind of robust lending into distressed \ncommunities that many in this Chamber would think would be appropriate.\n  So to make that analogy by pointing out that credit card companies \nare increasingly lax about their extension of credit is somehow \ninconsistent with supporting very thorough and very limited lending \nunder the CRA, I do not think carries weight.\n  What we have is a situation in which the credit card companies--and \nwe know this. Again, you do not have to go ahead and commission a \nsurvey to find out and discover this fact; you just have to sit home \nsome Saturday when at 9:30 in the morning the phone rings, and you \nthink it is your cousin or your brother calling up, and it is a credit \ncard company. You politely hang up the phone. At 10:30 you get another \ncall, thinking again it is a family member, and it is another credit \ncard company. You go out to your mailbox at 11 a.m. Guess what? There \nare two solicitations, a platinum card and a gold card; and at 2 \no'clock, thinking it is a member of the staff, it is another credit \ncard company. You know this because you go back to your States, as I \ndo, and you learn this from your constituents.\n  This industry is really promoting credit. Is it beneficial? Sure it \nis. Access to credit is something that moves this economy forward. But \nwhen this credit extension is not done in a wise way, when in fact \nthere is tangible evidence that there has been, in fact, bad faith--and \nthat is a fairly strong standard to meet--then I think that the judge \nshould be able to say or should be required to say you cannot move a \ndebtor from chapter 7 to chapter 13.\n  I am also pleased to note that the increase in the standard is to 30 \npercent of the ability to pay. I think that is an improvement in the \nlegislation, just like I think this would be an improvement in the \nlegislation.\n  Let me conclude by saying I, frankly, believe that the way this \nlegislation is already structured, with the judge in a position, not \nrequired to but having discretion--and the language is ``may'' move a \ndebtor from chapter 7 to chapter 13--there is implicitly already a \ngood-faith standard that I think any bankruptcy judge worth his or her \nsalt in seeing a company that was abusive, that is filing constant \npetitions to move someone from chapter 7 to chapter 13, that have a \nknown record for shoddy behavior in the community, I would think that \nindividual would take that into consideration and should take that into \nconsideration.\n  That is why I do not believe my amendment is a unique or extreme \ndeparture from what already should be the standard. I would hope that \nwe could adopt this amendment. I think it will go a long way to ensure \nthat there is a balanced test, that you look at the debtor, you \ndetermine whether that individual can pay a certain amount--30 \npercent--and you look to see if that debtor has been deploying bad \nfaith to apply to chapter 7, but at the same time look over, not at any \nrigorous searching review of underwriting standards, but look at that \nvery, very obvious standard of good faith, look at that creditor. That \nis what this amendment is supposed to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have had a chance now for a second \ntime to hear the explanation of the amendment from the Senator from \nRhode Island. I think he is a person who always acts in good faith on \nhis amendments and other legislative activity. He is a very active \nmember of the Aging Committee, which I chair, and I have had a chance \nto observe him there as being a very serious Senator. So I do not raise \nany questions with the motives of the Senator because I think he even \nsees a need for bankruptcy legislation.\n  But I still have to point out that I think the amendment, even if the \nintent is good, is just unworkable. I do not know whether we could have \nan amendment written to accomplish his goals that could be perfected \nenough to be workable--I should not draw that conclusion; that is a \npossibility--but I do believe that the language we have before us would \nfall into that category, because the modified amendment still requires \nbankruptcy judges to review underwriting standards. That is what the \nSenator from Rhode Island said earlier on the floor.\n  So I do not think that we know how this amendment will work. I do not \nknow how you can make even a commonsense determination of whether \nlending practices are in good faith unless the judge begins to second-\nguess many credit-granting decisions.\n  As I have said, if the Senator from Rhode Island believes that there \nare too many credit card solicitations, then I think I should refer him \nto a letter that I read into the Record last week, which I am going to \ninsert in the Record at this point as well, a letter from the junior \nSenator from North Carolina, Mr. Faircloth, who chairs the subcommittee \nof banking where I made an argument, from a procedural standpoint, that \nthis amendment should be considered there, and that he has offered to \nhold hearings on this subject matter, and maybe even the goal that the \nSenator from Rhode Island seeks can be accomplished, but, more \nimportantly, accomplished in a studied approach.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record \nas justification on a procedure not to add this amendment to this bill \nbut to have the Banking Committee consider this.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    Committee on Banking, Housing,\n\n\n                                            and Urban Affairs,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 16, 1998.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \n         Courts, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chuck: It is my understanding that a number of \n     amendments relating to credit cards will be offered to S. \n     1301. Most, if not all, of these amendments will relate to \n     matters in the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. I Chair \n     the Financial Institutions Subcommittee of the Banking \n     Committee.\n       I share the concerns that many have regarding multiple \n     credit card solicitations and solicitations to minors. In \n     fact earlier this year, my Subcommittee held a hearing on \n     bankruptcy issues, with representatives of the credit card \n     industry testifying. I have requested and received GAO \n     reports on such practices as high loan to value loans and the \n     sending of ``live'' loan checks.\n       As for many of the proposed amendments relating, however, \n     none have been passed by\n\n[[Page S10678]]\n\n     the Committee. In fact, none have been considered by the \n     Committee. Further, none of the proponents of the amendments \n     have requested hearings on any of their legislative \n     proposals.\n       During consideration of the bankruptcy bill, please know \n     that I would be more than willing to hold a hearing or \n     hearings on any these proposals in my Subcommittee where they \n     rightfully should be considered under regular order.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Lauch Faircloth,\n\n                                         Chairman, Subcommittee on\n                                           Financial Institutions.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I do not know if this is the final word, but the Senator is \ndoing a remarkably good job moving this legislation forward. I agree \nwith him, it is quite important because of this increase in the number \nof bankruptcy filings. There has been a huge growth in my home State of \nRhode Island, a 500-percent increase in just a few years. If we are \ngoing to do it, let's do it in a fair and balanced way.\n  I also go back to the underlying legislation that we are trying to \namend. It says essentially that a creditor may file a request to move \nthe debtor from chapter 7 to chapter 13, and the judge will make a \ndetermination. It is not mandatory. As I read it, even if that judge \ndetermines that the debtor has 30 percent, the sufficient amount of \nmoney to repay, and that the debtor may have, in fact, been \nquestionable in filing a chapter 7 petition, the judge is still not \nrequired to grant the request and move the petitioner from chapter 7 to \nchapter 13.\n  So as I said before, I think, implicitly, we already have this good-\nfaith standard, because that is what the judge is going to apply. He or \nshe is going to look at the behavior of both parties and determine if \nthis is appropriate--if the individual should have all his debts \ndischarged or whether there should be some partial repayment.\n  What I would like to do is make it clear that this good-faith \nstandard does exist, and it does not require this searching analysis of \nthe underwriting practices of any company. It just requires a judge \nlooking at the facts before him or her and making a judgment, as they \ndo every day, as to what is fair, who has acted with clean hands coming \nto the bar of justice.\n  I also say, in conclusion, that this amendment has the strong support \nof the Consumers Union and the Consumers Federation of America. This \nlegislation is designed to ensure there is responsible borrowing, that \nthe American public is responsible, and that they recognize their debts \nand their obligations.\n  I believe and I think there is underlying support of the Consumers \nUnion and the Consumer Federation of America, that the credit industry \nshould also be responsible and understand their obligations. This is \njust a small way of making explicit what I think is already within the \nlaw--to recognize that responsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank my colleague from Iowa for yielding the floor to \nme. First, I ask unanimous consent that I be made an original cosponsor \nof the consumer bankruptcy reform bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as a cosponsor, I rise today in strong \nsupport of the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Bill. The bill contains \nsorely needed provisions to help curb the dramatic rise of personal \nbankruptcies in this country.\n  It is incredible that while most sectors of the economy are \nexperiencing an economic boom--with the notable exception of some of \nthe hardest-working farmers in the country--personal bankruptcy filings \nhave reached record highs. My constituents tell me that declaring \nbankruptcy has become so routine as to be considered just another \npersonal finance option. No longer is it an avenue of last resort. It \nhas become a matter of convenience, sometimes to avoid the personal \nresponsibilities of living within one's means and repaying one's debts. \nI believe this shift in attitude is due in large part to a system which \nreadily lends itself to abuse and exploitation.\n  The passage of the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform bill is critical \nbecause it directly confronts the abuses within our bankruptcy system. \nOne of the main features of the bill would allow bankruptcy judges to \ndismiss or reassign cases if the system is being ``abused.'' Under the \nbill, one of the factors which shows abuse in a chapter 7 filing is if \nthe debtor has current income sufficient to pay at least 20% of \nunsecured claims against him. A motion alleging abuse of the system \ncould be filed by the judge, the trustee, or any party in interest.\n  We must return to the real purpose of bankruptcy laws--to establish \nuniform rules in facilitating debt collection. Unfortunately today, the \nlaws are increasingly recognized as a tool for escaping debt \nresponsibility. They are becoming a substitute for personal \nresponsibility.\n  In addition, I am disappointed that some of my colleagues seek to \noffer a nongermane amendment to to the underlying bankruptcy \nlegislation that would increase the minimum wage.\n  As my colleagues may recall, it was only two years ago that Congress \nenacted legislation that increased the federal minimum wage in two \nphases, from $4.25 to $4.75 on October 1, 1996, and from $4.75 to $5.15 \non September 1, 1997. Now, as part of the Small Business Regulatory \nFairness Act of 1996, this provision represented a 20 percent increase \nin the federal minimum wage.\n  Now, I voted for this legislation because it included a number of \nlong overdue tax measures designed to help small businesses grow and \ncreate more jobs in our economy. These changes, in my judgement, would \nbe far more helpful to wage earners than would the minimum wage \nincreases.\n  Two years after enactment of this legislation, I am not convinced \nthat the economic effect of that federal minimum wage increase is fully \nunderstood. For this reason, I am particularly concerned that an \nadditional increase in the federal minimum wage at this time could \nactually have an adverse impact upon our economy.\n  Mr. President, the proponents of an additional increase in the \nminimum wage argue that Congress should do more to help Americans \nincrease their take-home pay. I agree. However, I believe this can be \ndone far better through tax cuts and reduced government regulation. By \ndoing so, we will save the private sector billions of dollars which \ncould be used for investment that brings better jobs and higher wages.\n\n  Mr. President, basic economics tells us that raising real wages above \nwhat the market will bear will cause unemployment. The higher real \nwages rise above the market rate the greater the level of unemployment \nand overall downward pressure on all wages. The solution, therefore, is \nto allow wage rates to adjust to market conditions. Otherwise we will \nhave persistent, widespread unemployment that hurts the low-income \nworkers the hardest.\n  Raising the cost of doing business by raising the minimum wage is \nprobably going to mean even fewer of those jobs. Some statistics say as \nmany as 600,000 of those jobs will be lost, killing work opportunities \nfor young people and those families who depend on a needed second \nincome.\n  Besides artificially inflating salaries, hiking the minimum wage \nignores the real concerns of many working Americans. Yes, they want \nbetter jobs that pay better salaries, but they have told me repeatedly \nthat what matters most is not how much you earn but how much of your \nown paycheck you are allowed to keep after the greedy Federal \nGovernment has deducted its taxes.\n  Families today are taxed at the highest levels since World War II, \nwith 38 percent of a typical family's budget going to pay taxes on the \nfederal, state, and local level. In nominal dollars, a two-income \nfamily is paying more just in taxes today than their paychecks totaled \nin 1977. That's nearly 50 percent more than they are spending for food, \nshelter, and clothing combined.\n  Compared to the proposed minimum wage increase, tax relief and \neconomic growth is a better solution for helping low-income families. \nIt will increase incentives to work, save and invest. It\n\n[[Page S10679]]\n\nwill allow families to maximize their income and improve their standard \nof living. Tax relief will allow families who today are forced to \nscrimp just to cover their monthly bills and their tax bills to have \nmore money to spend on their children's education, health care \nexpenses, food and clothing, or insurance.\n  In 1981, President Reagan initiated massive tax reduction which \nresulted in an economic miracle we are still benefiting from today. \nOver eight years, real economic growth averaged 3.2 percent and real \nmedian family income grew by $4,000, 20 million new jobs were created, \nunemployment sank to record lows, all classes of people did better.\n  According to the National Taxpayers Union, if Congress could roll \nfederal domestic spending back to 1969 levels, a family of four would \nkeep $9,000 a year more of its own money than it does today.\n  Recent estimates by the CBO show that the government will enjoy a \nnearly $1.6 trillion budget surplus over the next ten years. This \npotential surplus is generated by working Americans and should be \nreturned to the taxpayers. Tax relief particularly, lower payroll \nincome tax rates will immediately increase Americans' take-home pay and \nallow them to keep a little more of their own money.\n  In sum, Mr. President, the real answer to increasing the take-home \npay of American families is not promoting political grandstanding \nefforts like this which would only destroy jobs, but to support more \nmeaningful tax relief and sustainable economic growth. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the bankruptcy legislation and resist any effort \nto distort the intent of this most important bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10673-6", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10679-S10692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NONPARTISAN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to express the \nview that Congress should make our inquiry into possible impeachment of \nPresident Clinton as bipartisan as possible, nonpartisan, fair, and \njudicious. There is an abundance of evidence that the American people \ndeplore excessive partisanship in general and oppose any kind of \npartisanship where we are dealing with a matter which is judicial or \nquasi-judicial.\n  I recall an admonition from my father years ago. When in a \npartnership situation he said, ``Arlen, don't make it 50/50; give 60 \npercent. It will look like 50 percent to your partner. If you give 50 \npercent, it will look like 40 percent.'' That bit of advice which my \nfather gave me as to a partnership arrangement, I think, is applicable \nto relationships or arrangements of many kinds.\n  I think it is very important that there be a real effort on the part \nof Republicans, because we Republicans are in control, to not press for \nevery bit of advantage. I believe that the proceedings in the House \nwere off to a good start when there was a vote of 363-33 to release the \nStarr report, with about two-thirds of the Democrats voting in favor of \na release of the report. It seems to me where we have a proceeding like \nimpeachment, which is really judicial, that it ought to be bipartisan \nor nonpartisan.\n  With respect to the playing of the tapes of President Clinton, it has \nbeen my preference that the approach be somewhat different from that \nwhich was undertaken by the House of Representatives. The playing of \nthose tapes, I think, would have been subject to no criticism at all \nhad the House moved ahead with an impeachment inquiry, either in a \npreliminary stage or after the signing in a more formalistic sense to \nhave impeachment hearings. Then it would have been in the regular \ncourse of business in regular order to see the tape of the President so \nthat the Members of the House could make an evaluation of the evidence \nas to what to do next.\n  Then where those hearings would be public, with the availability of \nthe President's tape, his deposition before the grand jury would have \ncome into the public domain in a matter of due course, and then as a \nregular proceeding with the hearings of the House of Representatives so \nthat the House would have obviated the controversy and the concern of \nwhether there was an inappropriate release of the President's tapes. \nOnce the hearings start, even in a preliminary sense, the House Members \nhave an obligation to see what the evidence is.\n  Similarly, with the release of other evidence, such as the testimony \nof Ms. Monica Lewinsky yesterday, that testimony is appropriate in \nregular course, but there is bound to be some concern raised when it is \nreleased en masse and not as a part of a regular proceeding by the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  From my days as district attorney of Philadelphia, which was a quasi-\njudicial position, a district attorney--a public prosecutor--is part \nadvocate and part judge. The expression is made as to the district \nattorney being a quasi-judicial official. I found it very important in \nthe cases which I tried personally and in the administration of the \noffice to exercise great care to be fair with the defense, both in \nterms of proceedings generally and in the presentation of evidence at \ntrial.\n  The juries in a criminal case, like public opinion generally, have a \nsense as to fairness, and it builds up, I found, the credibility of the \nprosecutor not to be looking for every slight advantage in the course \nof either investigation or trial. The impeachment proceedings, it seems \nto me, are really totally judicial in nature. The articles of \nimpeachment have been analogized to a bill of indictment, but I think \nthey are not really a bill of indictment in a criminal proceeding; or \nit may be argued that a bill of indictment before a grand jury is \njudicial in nature.\n  However, I hope that when we in the Congress vote in this body, when \nresponsibilities come to the Senate, or in the other body, the House of \nRepresentatives, that there will be an approach which is bipartisan and \nnonpartisan. We are proceeding in a matter of the utmost, utmost \ngravity, the potential for impeachment of the President of the United \nStates, and I think the American people will demand and are entitled to \nthat kind of bipartisanship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time that I \nhave on my side.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized to offer a second-degree amendment relative \nto the minimum wage, on which there shall be 2 hours of debate equally \ndivided.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3540\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase the \n                         Federal minimum wage)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3540.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3540.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . FAIR MINIMUM WAGE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Fair \n     Minimum Wage Act of 1998''.\n       (b) Minimum Wage Increase.--\n       (1) Wage.--Paragraph (1) of section 6(a) of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(1) except as otherwise provided in this section, not \n     less than--\n       ``(A) $5.65 an hour during the year beginning on January 1, \n     1999; and\n       ``(B) $6.15 an hour during the year beginning on January 1, \n     2000.''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n     takes effect on January 1, 1999.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand that there is a time \nallocation, 1 hour for those who support this amendment, and 1 hour in \nopposition. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n[[Page S10680]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 12 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I will briefly review the bidding about where we are \nwith regard to the minimum wage.\n  Since the end of World War II, the minimum wage has increased seven \ndifferent times. President Eisenhower signed a bill for an increase of \nthe minimum wage. President Kennedy did as well, as did President \nJohnson. President Nixon supported an increase in the minimum wage. \nPresident Carter supported an increase in the minimum wage. President \nBush supported an increase, and President Clinton has supported it as \nwell.\n  In the postwar period, if we look at where the economy went in the \nimmediate 20 years after World War II, the economy grew across the \nboard. The percent of increase for those at the lower income level rose \njust as well as those at the upper level. There was very, very little \ndisparity. If you look at the difference quintiles, from the period of \nthe postwar--1945 really up to about 1970--there was virtual growth \ntogether.\n  During this period of time, we found that Republicans and Democrats \nalike supported the increase in the minimum wage on a very basic and \nfundamental principle; that is, if Americans are going to work, they \nought to be able to have a livable wage--they should not be in poverty. \nMen and women who want to work 40 hours a week 52 weeks a year and play \nby the rules ought to have a livable wage. That concept has been \nsupported by Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  All we are asking today is whether we are going to continue that \nbasic, fundamental vote of fairness and justice in our country. That is \nthe issue. It is as plain and simple as that.\n  There are reasonable questions that we have to ask ourselves. The \nfirst is, What is going to be the impact on the state of our economy?\n  We have the greatest economic growth and price stability in the \nhistory of the Nation. We have seen untold fortunes made during the \nperiod of the last 6 years, but not for those at the lower end of the \neconomic ladder, not for those who are the minimum-wage workers. Their \nactual purchasing power has been reduced. It is surprising, most \nAmericans think, that everyone has not moved up together. Many have \nmoved up the economic ladder, but not those at the lower part of the \neconomic ladder.\n  All we are trying to do is to say to those hard-working Americans at \na time when we have record unemployment, the lowest inflation that we \nhave had at any time (except one of the seven times where we raised the \nminimum wage in the postwar period)--the lowest rate of inflation--\nthat, given our economic situation, we can make sure and we can afford \nfor those working Americans a livable wage for themselves and for the \nmembers of their family. That is the very simple issue.\n  It is fair to look at what has happened with the last increases in \nthe minimum wage to see what the impact has been of those increases on \nthe rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation.\n  We find, as I have demonstrated and put in the Record repeatedly, and \nwill not take the time unless challenged on those issues here today, \nthat effectively we have seen virtually no adverse impact in terms of \nour economy since the last two increases--absolutely none. The economy \nis stronger, and stronger than ever. We saw in 1997 more than 1,200,000 \njobs created in the small business industry.\n  We have heard from the restaurant association that since the last \nincrease in the minimum wage their employment has grown by 240,000 \njobs. They have not been disadvantaged. If you are looking at a growth \nindustry, according to the Labor Department, it is in the restaurant \nindustry.\n  Mr. President, you can see what I have just stated reflected on this \nchart. This chart reflects clearly the fact that in constant dollars \nthe minimum wage now is at one of its lower levels. Over the period \nfrom the mid 1950s, all the way through the mid-1980s, a 30-year period \nwhere we have Republican and Democratic Presidents alike, we have \nminimum wage and purchasing power that would be even above what this \nproposal is that is offered today: 50 cents next year, 50 cents the \nfollowing year. Even if we have those two increases, we will still be \nbelow the 30-year average under Republicans and Democrats.\n  That is all. We are not trying to say we are going to the highest \nlevel that we have ever had, even though we have the best economy. All \nwe are saying is let us put them in the realm of the 30-year period for \nthese working families in America.\n  A great deal is said around here about the importance of work. These \nare working families trying to provide for their children.\n  Who are these workers?\n  These workers are child care workers and attendants. Beatrice \nStanford of Wilmington, DE, is a low-wage grandmother who has worked at \nthe YMCA Child Care Center for 4 years, earns $5.75 an hour, and is the \nsole supporter for her teenage son and daughter and two grandchildren. \nBeatrice's children have worked from time to time, but she now calls \nthat her biggest mistake. Her daughter fell behind in school because of \nall the hours she was putting in at work. She needed summer school, but \nshe couldn't afford the $300 for the course. Instead, she had to do a \ncorrespondence course that cost $164. She made up the course but lost a \nyear. Beatrice finds it a struggle just to pay the rent. She can't \nafford a car, so she takes a bus to work and catches a ride to the \nsupermarket.\n  These are child care workers--the faces of those who are working for \nthe minimum wage. Beatrice Stanford, a grandmother trying to provide \nfor her children and not being able to make ends meet.\n  Mr. President, there are other workers like Renda DeJohnette who \nprovides home health care in Los Angeles. Child care workers, home \nhealth care workers, teachers' aides--these are all the people who make \nup the minimum wage.\n  Renda DeJohnette provides home health care. Renda works in a county \nprogram to help senior citizens and the disabled to remain in their \nhomes and avoid institutionalization. Renda is a single mother with two \nteenage children. She earns $5.75 an hour washing clothes, preparing \nmeals, cleaning houses and finds it hard to make ends meet. A low \nminimum wage increase would allow her to put food on the table and pay \nall of her bills.\n  The list goes on.\n  There is Marcus Reynolds of Lynn, MA. To understand the minimum wage \nfrom both sides of the paycheck, for 20 years he earned the minimum \nwage cleaning offices, making beds in hotels, stocking shelves, and \nlifting heavy packages in stores.\n  Often he worked two jobs, sometimes three. He says, ``No matter how \nmany jobs I worked, how little time I slept, the minimum wage was not \nenough to make ends meet. Even when I was basically just working and \nsleeping, providing for food and rent and transportation was more than \na challenge. It was often a struggle.'' Now he owns a very small \nsandwich shop. He pays his entry-level workers $6 an hour. He says, ``I \ncan't afford to pay them less.'' He respects them as workers and as \npeople, and as he puts it, ``What kind of family value is it to pay \nsomeone supporting a family a wage that is below poverty?''\n  Mr. President, these are the people we are talking about. We are \ntalking about teacher's aides who are working with our children. We are \ntalking about child care helpers. We see the turnover that is taking \nplace in the Head Start Program, and we are all concerned about that \nbecause we know the importance of consistency of care in terms of \nlooking after our children.\n  One of the principal reasons for this turnover is that we are paying \nthe child care assistants in these kinds of settings the minimum wage, \nand they just cannot make ends meet. We are talking about those health \nworkers who are working with our parents to try to keep them at home, \nto help and assist them so they are not institutionalized. They are the \nhelpers and assistants in the nursing homes looking after our parents. \nThey are the people who take care of the buildings which house \nAmerica's corporations, working long, hard hours at night.\n  When we asked minimum wage workers what the impact was when they saw \nan increase in the minimum wage last time, the answer that so many of \nthem gave was amazing: ``You know, Senator, what the impact is going to \nbe\n\n[[Page S10681]]\n\nwhen we raise the minimum wage. We are only going to have to work two \njobs instead of three.'' Only two jobs instead of three. ``We might get \na chance to see our children more often. We might be able to go to \nteachers' meetings. We might be able to spend some time with our child \nhelping with some homework.''\n  That is the difference in terms of any kind of increase in the \nminimum wage. That is what we are talking about. That is what we are \ntalking about at a time when we have the strongest economy in the \nhistory of this country and at a time when we have hard-working \nAmericans who are prepared to do the work.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 12 minutes requested by the Senator have \nexpired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this chart here says it: ``The minimum \nwage is not a livable wage.'' We are talking about a livable wage here \nin the United States of America. These are the average figures for a \nfamily. The monthly minimum wage budget includes what is necessary for \na family of three. Food on the table, $348; housing, $582; \ntransportation, $145; and what remains is $131. That does not include \nchild care, where the national average in terms of one child would be \n$333 or health care where the average is $49 or clothing where the \naverage is $63, which comes to $445. You have to squeeze three items, \n$445, into the remaining of $131.\n  The question is, how many times is a parent going to serve peanut \nbutter to a child in order to save the $10, $15 or $20 so they can look \nafter health care needs? How many times are they not going to pay their \nutilities in order to be able to look after a child? This is what we \nare talking about--hard-working Americans who deserve a living wage. \nThis issue is the same as the last 70 years when we have debated it in \nthe Senate. But we have come together in decency and fairness at \nimportant times for working Americans.\n  Finally, Mr. President, just last year we had an increase in our own \nminimum wage. Members of this body got $3,100. That is $1.50 an hour. \nThat is the increase every Member of this Senate received--$1.50 an \nhour in 1 year. We are looking at child care workers, health care \nworkers, teacher's aides getting 50 cents next year and 50 cents the \nfollowing year. If it was fair enough for the Members of the Senate, it \nought to be fair enough for those hard-working Americans who are trying \nto provide for their families. That is the issue--fundamental fairness \nto working Americans. Hopefully, we will be successful.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have very much enjoyed listening to my \ncolleague once again on this very important issue, which seems to come \nback on an annual basis. The ink is barely dry on the announcement for \nlast year's increase in the minimum wage and the Senator from \nMassachusetts is back asking for another serious, mandatory wage hike.\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, and those who support \nthis concept, believes that an increase in the minimum wage is the \nquick, painless way to help the disadvantaged in our society. They \nbelieve that a minimum wage hike is absolutely costless, and they \nbelieve that it has no adverse impact whatsoever. I can only wonder, \nthen, why they have not offered an amendment raising the minimum wage \nto $15 an hour or $20 or $25 or $30, because if it has no impact and it \nreally is going to benefit people, why not do that. In fact, if raising \nSenators' salaries $1.50 an hour over the last year is right, why not \ngive everybody whatever the amount of money the Senators make--\n$100,000, $130,000, or whatever it is--to even things up and make \neverybody equal in our society? I am sure the Senator is not arguing \nthat so I do not mean to raise that type of ridiculous argument.\n  Frankly, if raising the minimum wage was all it took to raise people \nout of poverty--or to make life better for the working poor--I would \nvote for it.\n  But, I believe the proponents of this amendment and of the underlying \nconcept have greatly oversimplified the issue. And, I believe they know \nthey have oversimplified it.\n\n\n                           employment impact\n\n  I will admit to my colleagues that the most elusive aspect of the \neconomic debate on the minimum wage is an estimate of its impact on \nemployment. Study after study has been done to quantify the employment \neffects of an increase in the wage floor. And, economists have \ndisagreed about the severity of the employment impact.\n  There is, however, overwhelming consensus that there is indeed an \nadverse effect on employment. Three-quarters of the 22,000 members of \nthe American Economic Association agree that minimum wage hikes have a \ndisemployment effect that stifles employment opportunities for low-\nskilled workers.\n  In 1981, the Minimum Wage Study Commission, which was formed under \nthe Carter administration, concluded that for every 10 percent increase \nin the minimum wage, the disemployment effect was between 100,000 to \n300,000 jobs.\n  Disemployment means jobs not only eliminated, but also jobs that are \nnever created in the first place. For example, if a retail store \nplanned to hire five additional workers and, as a result of the higher \nlabor costs, only hired two, the disemployment effect is three jobs.\n  For the sake of argument, let's take the more conservative boundary \nof this range of impact. The Kennedy-Wellstone amendment proposes a \n19.4 percent increase in the minimum wage over two years.\n  That means that, using the most conservative multiplier, nearly \n200,000 entry level jobs would be lost.\n  Now, Mr. President, let's line up 10 applicants for entry-level jobs. \nWhich two of them are most likely to lose out at this higher minimum \nwage level? The suburban teenager working to pay the insurance on his \ncar? The spouse working to put a little extra money into the household \nbudget? The senior citizen who is supplementing his retirement income \nand trying to stay active? Are they the people who would lose out?\n  Or, would it be the new immigrant still learning a new language? \nPerhaps the young woman just out of a drug rehabilitation program, or a \nyoung man recently paroled from prison. Perhaps those who will miss out \nare high school drop outs.\n  Michgan State University economist David Neumark suggests that the \nemployment effects of a higher minimum wage are actually most acute on \ncertain subgroups. In his paper ``The Effects of Minimum Wages on \nTeenage Employment, Enrollment, and Idleness,'' Neumark finds that \nhigher minimum wages act as an incentive for teenagers to seek \nemployment and that those with more experience and greater skills crowd \nout those with fewer skills. Those who are displaced find themselves \n``idle,'' i.e., neither enrolled in school nor employed.\n  I certainly do not consider this a positive effect of the minimum \nwage increase. But, it gets worse.\n  The probability that a black or Hispanic teenager will be displaced \nis five times greater than for the general population of teenagers.\n  But, perhaps the perverse impact of minimum wage increases is summed \nup best by two of President Clinton's own appointees to the Federal \nReserve Board, William Baumol and Alan Blinder: ``The primary \nconsequence of the minimum wage law is not an increase in the income of \nthe least skilled workers, but a restriction on their employment \nopportunities.'' [Baumol and Blinder, cited in Glassman, Washington \nPost, 4/9/96]\n  This is pretty serious stuff. The ones who really get hurt are the \nones who need the help the most.\n  The long and the short of it is simply that you cannot mandate an \nincrease in the price of entry level or unskilled labor--which is \nexactly what the statutory minimum wage is--without reducing the demand \nfor that labor.\n  The term ``labor costs'' is complicated. It includes lots of things: \nwages, insurance, FICA taxes, unemployment taxes, training, uniforms or \nother expenses. But, for now, let's just say it's wages and FICA taxes.\n  Some may be tempted to say that another dollar an hour is no big deal \nfor an employer. Well, let's take a hypothetical employer in my home \nstate of Utah. Let's see how big of a deal it is.\n\n[[Page S10682]]\n\n  Is it only $1 for the ABC Company in Salt Lake City, UT? ``Hey, it's \nonly $1, what's the big deal?'' they say. Assume you are a business \nowner with 25 part-time employees who work 30 hours a week. How much \nwould a minimum wage hike cost you? You fill in the blanks.\n  First year, 50 cents times 25 employees times 30 hours per week times \n52 weeks per year equals $19,500 in the first year.\n  The second year, $1 times 25 employees time 30 hours per week times \n52 weeks per year equals $39,000 in the second year. Add in the \nadditional FICA and other taxes--I'll bet you forgot about those--that \nis $5,265, just use 9 percent, if you will, to keep it easy.\n  And the grand total is $63,765. Think about that. This is the average \nsmall business. The average small business owner takes home less than \n$25,000 per year. So where is the money going to come from? Where is \nthe money going to come from?\n  If you stop and think about it, under the Kennedy-Wellstone \namendment, the 2-year increase in labor costs would be more than \n$63,000. Actually the figure is $63,765. That is 2\\1/2\\ times what a \ntypical small business owner takes home.\n  The median take-home for small business owners, as I have said, is \n$25,000. That's based on the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, the representative of the small business people in this \ncountry, and that is using CPS data.\n  Exactly what would you do, Mr. President, if you were this small \nbusiness owner faced with a dollar per hour mandatory increase in your \nlabor costs?\n  The answer should be obvious. As one small business owner noted:\n\n       Unfortunately, many entry-level jobs are being phased out \n     as employment costs grow faster than productivity. In that \n     situation, employers are pressured to replace marginal \n     employees with self-service or automation or to eliminate the \n     service altogether. . . .\n\n  I should mention that the small business owner I just cited is former \nSenator George McGovern.\n  His eyes were opened once he left the distinguished U.S. Senate and \nwent into a small business himself and found out it is pretty tough to \nbe in business. There are a lot of demands on you. That was Senator \nGeorge McGovern, who I believe voted for every minimum wage increase \nthe whole time he was in the U.S. Senate. I give him credit for being \nwilling to call it the way it is.\n  Harriet F. Cane, owner of the Sweet Life restaurant in Marietta, \nGeorgia, after the last minimum wage increase reports that she went \nfrom 16 employees to 9. She voiced her frustration in the Wall Street \nJournal:\n\n       Money for minimum wage increases has to come from \n     somewhere. . . . If you pass another increase in the minimum \n     wage, you can tell the teenagers and working mothers I employ \n     why they no longer have jobs. Then try asking for their \n     votes.\n\n  And, I also share Senator McGovern's concerns about one other aspect \nof the minimum wage. He goes on to ask:\n\n       When these jobs disappear, where will young people and \n     those with minimal skills get a start in learning the \n     ``invisible curriculum'' we all learn on the jobs?\n\n  Senator McGovern is right. Entry level jobs are only the first run of \nthe ladder. How many of us are today doing the same job we did as \nteenagers? Quite obviously none of us in Congress. And, I would venture \nvery few outside of Congress.\n  Ed Rensi started in 1965 in Columbus, Ohio, at 85 cents an hour. \nToday, he's the president and CEO of McDonald's. [Shlaes, WSJ, 8/15/95] \nJust think about that.\n  James Glassman, writing in the Washington Post, quotes this finding \nby David Macpherson, professor of economics at Florida State \nUniversity: ``A year after having been observed working at the minimum \nwage of $4.25, the average wage for these workers was $6.08 an hour.'' \n[Glassman, Washington Post; 4/9/96] That is a $1.83 increase--43 \npercent.\n  Amity Shales, writing in the Wall Street Journal, cites a 1992 study \nin the Industrial Relations and Labor Review that stated that 63 \npercent of minimum wage workers earn higher wages within 12 months and \nthat the increases average 20 percent. [Shlaes, WSJ, 8/15/95]\n  So, let me get the proponents' argument straight: Someone who has a \nminimum wage job is going to be better off with a 19.4 percent increase \nunder the Kennedy-Wellstone amendment--if he or she doesn't lose his \njob or have his hours reduced--than under current law where there is a \ngreater probability of keeping the job and getting a 20 percent or \ngreater raise in their wages?\n  I find this logic terribly twisted.\n  It is a great myth that everyone currently earning the minimum wage \ngets `stuck'' in a minimum wage job. The fact is that people cycle \nthrough these jobs regularly. They get raises; they get more education; \nthey learn a new skill; they prove themselves reliable; they move on \nand up.\n  And, I'll say one more thing about jobs at the bottom. I am proud \nthat I worked my way through school. I even worked as a janitor. Some \nof my colleagues might poo-poo that experience. Well, I am proud of it. \nNot only was I a darn good janitor, but I met good, decent people doing \nit as well, and I have to tell you I made 65 cents an hour.\n  I like to think maybe I have progressed in life and that little bit \nof training I got as a janitor helped me to appreciate what working is. \nIt helped me to put myself through school. It helped me to have the \ndignity that comes from working, the discipline that I learned from \nhaving to meet hours, meet work schedules, and meet work expectations. \nAll of that was pretty darned important.\n  One thing I learned was that there is no such thing as a menial job--\nonly people who do not understand the importance of any job performed \nwell. And maybe that's one thing wrong with our society today--but \nthat's a subject for another day.\n\n\n                           Winners and Losers\n\n  First jobs are for learning as well as earning. If we continue to \nraise the bar for entry, how many adults will we have who have never \nworked? How many teenagers and young adults who need a chance are not \ngoing to get one?\n  According to the conservative estimate, at least two out of every 10. \nMy colleagues on the other side may not think that is too high a price \nto pay in order to benefit the other eight. But, considering the \nevidence that hiking the minimum wage is a lousy way to help the \nworking poor, I can't agree--I cannot agree, to make it even more \nclear.\n  It is true that some workers will reap the benefit of the increase. \nSome workers will get a $40 a week raise. But, by mandating wage \nincreases, two out of 10 entry-level job seekers won't have a job at \nall--very likely those who need a chance the most.\n  Senator Kennedy has gone to great lengths to disassociate this \nminimum wage increase from organized labor's legislative wish list. He \nhas tried to convince us that this is a women's issue and a children's \nissue. He has tried to tell us that we should enact this 19.4 percent \nincrease in order to lift the poor and working poor out of poverty.\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is attempting to give \nthis perennially bad idea a Cinderella-like transformation. I must \npoint out to my friend and colleague that there is no way this pumpkin \nis going to turn into a handsome coach.\n  Let's look at the demographics of who will be helped and who will be \nhurt by the loss of job opportunities.\n  There are twice as many minimum wage earners in families earning more \nthan $25,000 per year--that is 51 percent of them--than in families \nearning less than $12,500 per year. That is 25 percent of them. And, \none of five lives in a family earning $50,000 or more. [Deavers; \nEmployment Policy Foundation, 3/5/98 briefing, p. 21]\n  Nearly 43 percent of all minimum wage earners are teenagers and young \nadults living at home; 16.5 percent are spouses of other earners; 22.5 \npercent are not heads of household. Only about 20 percent are heads of \nhousehold supporting dependents.\n  In Utah, the distribution is even more lopsided.\n  Who really benefits from the minimum wage hike in Utah? The average \nfamily income of Utah employees who will benefit from President \nClinton's proposed minimum wage hike is $37,816. According to the U.S. \nCensus Bureau data, fully 89 percent of Utah employees whose wages will \nbe increased by President Clinton's proposed minimum wage hike either \nlive with their parents or another relative, live alone, or\n\n[[Page S10683]]\n\nhave a working spouse. Just 11 percent of them are sole earners in \nfamilies with children, and each of these sole earners has access to \nsupplemental income through the earned income tax credit.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, only 11 percent are single parent with \nkids or single earner in couple with kids. Stop and think about it.\n  That is important to look at. Our State is maybe a little bit better \nthan the national average where it is 22 percent. That 11 percent is \ndoubled to 22 percent. But it still means that 78 percent of the people \nare those who need that entry-level job, that first job, that \nopportunity of starting on the ladder climbing higher.\n  Of course, we should be concerned that certain families are \nstruggling with minimum wage incomes. There should be no insinuation \nthat those of us who oppose this amendment do not care about these \nstruggling families.\n\n\n                   minimum wages can't fight poverty\n\n  But, we need to understand the limits of a minimum wage increase to \nreach these families with any tangible benefits.\n  The minimum wage increase cannot be targeted only to certain workers. \nWe cannot say that Mrs. Jones who is trying to raise two kids on the \nminimum wage gets the increase, but Mrs. Brown who is working to \nsupplement her husband's earnings does not.\n  The reality is that those who are not poor are more likely to get \nraises and those whose skills do not justify the higher wage will be \nout of jobs.\n  Study after study has concluded that raising the minimum wage is an \nineffective means of helping those who are disadvantaged.\n  David Neumark of Michigan State and William Wascher of the Federal \nReserve Board concluded that:\n\n       On balance, we find no compelling evidence supporting the \n     view that minimum wages help in the fight against poverty. \n     Rather, because not only the wage gains but the disemployment \n     effects of minimum wage increases are concentrated among low-\n     income families, the various trade-offs created by minimum \n     wage increases more closely resemble income redistribution \n     among low-income families than income redistribution from \n     high- to low-income families. Given these findings, it is \n     difficult to make a distributional or equity argument for \n     minimum wages. [Neumark & Wascher, ``Do Minimum Wages Fight \n     Poverty?'' NBER Paper, August 1997].\n\n  Peter Brandon, of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the \nUniversity of Wisconsin has found that ``welfare mothers in states that \nraised their minimum wage remained on public assistance 44 percent \nlonger than their peers in states where the minimum wage remained \nunchanged.'' [Brandon, cited in Understanding the Minimum Wage, 1995]\n  A conference paper prepared by Robert V. Burkhauser (Syracuse \nUniversity), Kenneth A. Crouch (University of Connecticut), and David \nC. Wittenburg (The Lewin Group) reports the results of a simulation \nmodel on the effects of the 1990-1991 minimum wage increase. After \nholding the employment variable constant (which was not the actual \neffect), ``only 19.3 percent of the increase in the wage bill caused by \nthat minimum wage increase went to poor families. This is less than the \n22 percent of workers whose wages were increased by the minimum wage \nincrease who live in poor families.'' [Burkhauser, Crouch, Wittenburg, \n``The Behavioral and Redistributional Consequences of Minimum Wage \nHikes: Evidence from the 1990s;'' AEI Conference, May 4, 1998, p. 5]\n\n  Yes, Mr. President, raising the minimum wage sounds like an easy way \nto help those who are working but still struggling to find their way \nout of poverty. It is no wonder that, lacking the facts, the American \npeople would support this.\n  But, upon examination, using minimum wage increases to alleviate \npoverty is like trying to shoot a fly off an elephant--and we are not \neven aiming at the fly but at the entire elephant. The amendment \nproposed by Senator Kennedy and Senator Wellstone is not directed to \nworkers who are poor, but rather at the entire universe of minimum wage \nworkers. And, even former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has \nacknowledged that most minimum wage workers are not poor.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  The idea that there is no adverse impact from a mandatory increase in \nthe cost of hiring workers is delusional.\n  But, what is worse, is that this adverse impact is for nothing. And, \nthose very individuals who need entry level jobs the most are the ones \nmost likely to be displaced by the increased competition for those \njobs.\n  This proposal, like the emperor who has no clothes, is specious--it \nis still specious, and I haven't even touched on inflationary or \ngeographic inequities. I would need another hour to do that.\n  It is disappointing that some of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle remain so enamored with this discredited dinosaur of a labor \npolicy. Even the Democratic Leadership Council, citing findings of the \nProgressive Policy Institute, has repudiated minimum wage hikes, \ncorrectly claiming that they are counterproductive.\n  Hiking the minimum wage is not the only way to assist working \nAmericans and those struggling to make ends meet. Let's work on some of \nthose ideas. Personally, I would like to raise people's paychecks by \ncutting their taxes. That is probably a far better way of doing it than \ndoing it this way. That would increase their paychecks without the risk \nthey might lose their jobs, which is a big risk that will happen with \nthis giant albatross.\n  I think we can work together on education. We passed the A+ Education \nbill earlier this year with bipartisan support. Education--or the lack \nof it--is the single biggest factor in determining an individual's \nearning capacity.\n  Let's tackle illiteracy and other root causes of low-skills and low-\nearnings potential. But, for Heaven's sake, let's recognize the minimum \nwage as the mirage it really is.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the Kennedy-Wellstone amendment. It \ndeserves to be defeated, and it is time we start approaching these \nproblems in a better way, in a way that really will help people, \nespecially those who are at the lowest level of poverty in this \ncountry. I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nKennedy's and Senator Wellstone's proposal to raise the minimum wage. \nThere, in my view, is a very compelling reason why we must do this and \nwe must do it today. That reason, simply stated, is that if you are a \nfull-time worker, a head of household, a single head of household and a \nfamily of three, you will make $10,700 a year. That is $2,900 below the \npoverty level. Today, the minimum wage law in the United States \nguarantees to so many people only one thing: that they will still be in \npoverty. We can do much better than that, and we should do much better \nthan that.\n  There have been discussions about the employment effects of raising \nthe minimum wage. Studies have been presented; statistics have been \npresented. Let's look clearly at what has happened in the last two \nepisodes in which we raised the minimum wage.\n  Back in October of 1996, the minimum wage was increased to $4.75. And \nwhat happened to unemployment? It fell; it was in a cyclical pattern, \nbut it fell. Again, in September of 1997, we raised the minimum wage to \n$5.15, and once again unemployment fell.\n  This legislation is not a job killer. This legislation does not deny \nopportunities to work for anyone. What it does is it gives people more \nmoney in their paycheck, gives them more opportunities to provide for \ntheir families, gives them a bigger share in this country's economy. \nThat is why we need to do it.\n  There are others who argue, ``Well, those are just general \nstatistics.'' The real problem with the minimum wage increase is it \naffects some discrete subgroups like teenagers. If you look at the \nrecord of teen unemployment, age 16 to 19, once again the same pattern \nemerges. The minimum wage was raised in October of 1996--it is a \ncyclical process--and unemployment declined. Again, in September of \n1997, with some cyclical variation, a declining curve, unemployment in \nthis category also falls. So the arguments against the minimum wage \nbecause it kills employment just do not hold water based upon the most \nrecent experiences.\n\n[[Page S10684]]\n\n  Then there is the argument that small businesses will invariably and \nautomatically react to an increase by cutting back on their employment. \nThere has been a recent study by two researchers from the Jerome Levy \nEconomic Institute at Bard College. And 90 percent of the small \nbusinesses they surveyed indicated that the 1996 minimum wage increase \ndid not change their hiring decisions. Their hiring decisions were \nbased upon the demands in their marketplace for their products, driven \nby a very strong economy. Moreover, 75 percent of these individuals \nsurveyed said that a further increase to $6 would also not influence \ntheir decisions about hiring.\n  So small business is not reacting to this proposed minimum wage \nincrease by saying, ``We are going to cut off employment.'' What this \ndoes is give hard-working Americans a chance to put more money in their \npaycheck to provide more opportunities for their families.\n  We have also heard arguments on the floor today that, ``Well, the \nminimum wage is benefiting not just the poorest people, just teenagers \nwho work, but maybe spouses who work and their husbands or wives are \nemployed in more lucrative jobs.''\n  First of all, the reality of the minimum wage is that 74 percent of \nthe wage earners are over 20, so the vast majority are not teenagers. \nAnd 40 percent are the family's sole breadwinner. They have people who \ndepend upon them, depend upon them bringing in a living wage. And 63 \npercent are women; and 50 percent of the minimum wage earners are in \nthe lowest 40 percent of earners in the United States. This does, in \nfact, provide a very positive impact on the opportunities for low-\nincome Americans.\n  There is another argument here, too, that I think we have to present. \nLast Congress, many of us joined together to pass significant welfare \nreform, in fact, directing people off welfare into the workforce; and \nit is an irony, at best, moving people from welfare into poverty-level \nwages--indeed, below poverty-level wages. To make this experiment in \nwelfare reform truly workable, we have to ensure that when people leave \nwelfare they get adequate pay. And the minimum wage increase will help \ndo that.\n  Also, it seems to me illogical that in every other sphere of economic \nendeavor raising someone's pay is seen as a good thing, not a bad \nthing, that most of our activities in the workplace are designed to get \nincreases in pay. In fact, very few people would think, ``I'm not going \nto ask for an increase in pay. It might curtail my opportunities to \nwork.'' Because the reality, as demonstrated by my colleague, just to \nsurvive, to put food on the table, clothe children, to provide minimal \ncare to their families, requires an increase in the minimum wage.\n  I think there is another argument that has to be stressed. We are \ncoming into some rocky economic times in the United States because of \nthe turmoil throughout the world. Demand for American goods overseas is \nfaltering. How do we keep our economy going? One way to do that is to \ngive the American people more purchasing power. Increasing the minimum \nwage does that for the very lowest income Americans, those people who \ngo into the Kmarts, go into the Wal-Marts, to buy products. In fact, \nthey are typically the types of individual households that, because of \nthe demands on them, are constantly buying products for their children, \nbuying goods and services. This will also help, I think, in a broader \neconomic sense.\n  So for all these reasons--basic justice and fairness, to keep our \neconomy moving, to recognize that there are so many good reasons to do \nthis--it does not affect employment dramatically but what it does \naffect is the ability of working families, people who work very hard to \nprovide for their families and maybe provide a little extra. That, to \nme, is why we are all here.\n  I strongly support the efforts of Senator Kennedy, the efforts of \nSenator Wellstone, and their strong commitment to ensure that the \nbenefits of this economy are shared not by just those who are affluent \nbut are shared by the broadest segments of American society, \nparticularly by those who struggle each and every day under \ncircumstances, frankly, that few of us have had to endure, to be good \ncitizens, to work hard, and to get something a little bit more for \ntheir families.\n\n  I hope, in that spirit, and recognition of those facts, that we \nstrongly support this amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 12 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the President and the Senator from Utah.\n  I rise today to share my thoughts about another proposed increase in \nthe minimum wage. Having been a small business owner for 27 years, I \nwant to be sure that my concerns regarding the full economic impact \nthat that Federal one-size-fits-all mandate can have on rural States \nlike Wyoming are made known. This complex economic issue demands \ncareful consideration.\n  I want to say right up front, I favor an increase for all wages. But \nthat increase should be sparked by a strong free market economy, not by \na Federal mandate that would be detrimental to small businesses and to \nthe existence of hundreds of minimum-wage-paying jobs in Wyoming that \nare already few in number.\n  I travel throughout Wyoming almost every weekend. I regularly hold \ntown meetings and attend ice cream socials as a way of listening to my \nconstituents' concerns. I want to point out, Wyoming residents are \nthick-skinned individuals and they are not shy about sharing opinions--\nthey show up and they share.\n  I was not surprised to hear from them that another increase in the \nminimum wage could close small businesses and eliminate jobs--two \nthings that are already tough to come by in Wyoming.\n  As a former shoestore owner, I have always felt that the minimum wage \nrepresented a starting wage--better referred to as an entry-level wage. \nI hear people trying to equate it with a ``living wage.'' It is a \nminimum wage. It is an entry-level wage.\n  An entry-level wage in Wyoming changes quickly as the individual \nworker gains experience and improves his or her skills in the \nworkplace. Almost two out of three workers who start at the entry-level \nwage earn a higher wage within 6 months--more skill, more money. Every \njob works that way. There are just different entry-level rates--more \nskill, more money. Kids with no skills have to gain experience in the \nworkplace if they are to understand why hard work is a fundamental step \nto life's success.\n  Moreover, college students seeking part-time jobs to help supplement \ntheir education are going to find it even more difficult to obtain work \nwhen the number of these available jobs is cut.\n  Are the economic realities that impact these kids being considered by \nthis amendment? I will gladly welcome any explanation based on \nWyoming's labor market.\n  Only 480,000 people live in Wyoming, fewer than any other State in \nthis country. That is not bad; we have plenty of elbowroom. Wyoming \nstill remains a State of high altitude and low multitude dominated by \nmiles and miles of miles and miles. We can still call the wrong number \nand know who we are talking to. But my State's labor market has \nproduced a set of statistics that worry us. Wyoming ranks 50th in new \neconomic growth, 50th in the creation of new jobs, and 50th in \ntechnical industries. That is not a change. We lack the population \nneeded to lure high-turnover jobs. We lack critical mass where there is \nenough population for businesses to feed on each other.\n  While other States are celebrating budget surpluses, Wyoming \npoliticians argue over every available penny, knowing that a $200 \nmillion shortfall is expected within the next 5 years. To put that in \nperspective, a 1 cent statewide sales tax only raised $50 million a \nyear for the State. Having served in the State and the legislature for \n10 years, I have dealt with this reality firsthand.\n  Folks need to understand why another increase in the minimum wage \nimpacts States like Wyoming differently than Connecticut or \nMassachusetts. The Nation's economy may be strong, but my State hasn't \nshared\n\n[[Page S10685]]\n\nthat fortune. It takes a long time for rural States with sparse \npopulations to benefit from these trends. I am not going to buy into \nthe notion that another minimum wage hike is necessary just because the \nNation's economy is doing well. There is more to it than that.\n  Despite Wyoming's economic portfolio, the absence of intrusive State \ntaxes ensures that family incomes go a long way. It would go even \nfurther if I could say the same for Federal taxes--however, we will \nsave that debate for another time. Wyoming residents pay no State \nincome tax, a five-cents-on-the-dollar sales tax, bare-bones ``sin'' \ntaxes and fuel taxes, and some of the lowest property taxes in the \ncountry. In fact, a Wyoming family of four making $50,000 per year pays \nabout $2,500 total in State and local taxes--including sales tax. In \nConnecticut, that same family of four pays $10,000. That is an \nincredible difference. Connecticut folks pay four times as much in \nlocal and State taxes. Labor Secretary Herman stated in a letter to \nChairman Jeffords of the Senate Labor Committee describing how another \nminimum wage increase would make an ``enormous difference in the lives \nof workers and their families'' and that it would ``mean an additional \n$2,000 a year \n* * *'' I guess if I had to pay over $10,000 each year just in State \nincome tax, a Federal minimum wage hike might not sound too bad. \nHowever, those folks should be screaming for lower taxes--not higher \nwages! Those East Coast families have to make up to four times as much \nto cover State and local taxes.\n  Wyoming's low taxes give the dollar plenty of mileage, despite lower \nwages. Even where the availability of housing is scarce, it's still \naffordable. My youngest daughter now attends the University of Wyoming \nin Laramie where rental property is tough to come by. Still, a person \ncan rent a single-family home there for less than $400 per moth. A one-\nbedroom apartment in a modest Washington neighborhood often exceeds \n$1,000 per month. That is a monumental difference. Similar to taxes, \nEast Coast workers need to make up to 2\\1/2\\ times as much to cover \nhousing. I made a few phone calls to some local ``fast food'' \nrestaurants and I learned that each of them started their employees \nabove the minimum wage. I was quoted wages starting from $5.25 per hour \nat the Burger King in Falls Church to $6.00 per hour at an Alexandria \nMcDonald's. The labor market and cost of living determine these pay \nrates, not Federal minimum wage laws. But in Wyoming, where these same \nfactors are much different, the wages are dictated entirely from \nWashington where folks pay 4 times as much for State and local taxes \nand 2\\1/2\\ times as much for housing. To no surprise, the Burger King \nin Casper, the McDonald's in Cheyenne, the Taco Bell in Laramie and the \nMcDonald's in Sheridan all start their employees at this entry-level \nwage. Remember, those who show some interest don't stay at that entry-\nlevel wage long. Remember, those who show some interest don't stay at \nthe entry-wage level. Another mandated, one-size-fits-all minimum wage \nhike may sound like a good deal for Wyoming's entry-level employees, \nbut it isn't Each time the minimum wage is increased, these jobs that \nput money in the pockets of kids--and sometimes senior citizens, too--\nbecome extinct.\n  That is not just Wyoming. This chart shows that although the growth \nand the overall economy did accelerate, it agrees with the other \ncharts. It accelerated in 1996 and 1997. The job growth at eating and \ndrinking places fell sharply after the wage hikes. In 1995, job growth \nin the whole economy was 2 percent; eating establishments, 3.9. In \n1996, after the wage increase goes into effect, the economy grows by \n2.8 percent, and the kids working in restaurants only have a growth of \n2.2 percent.\n  After outpacing overall employment growth each year in the 1990s, job \ngrowth at eating and drinking places fell sharply in 1996 and 1997. \nThis chart shows the total employment and the eating and drinking \nemployment. So both of them show the same trends.\n  Another chart shows what the new job opportunities at eating places \nwere in 1994 and 1995 versus 1996 and 1997. The rate of growth allowed \nfor 532,800 jobs in 1994 and 1995. Then the minimum wage kicked into \neffect. The growth was only 281,600 jobs; we lost over 250,000 jobs in \nthat market alone. That is a quarter of a million kids who didn't get a \njob.\n  Despite Wyoming's sparse population, the number of jobs are even \nfewer. The complaint I hear from my constituents is not about low \npaying wages, but the lack of jobs. Folks in my State are tired of \nseeing their kids leave Wyoming to attend college elsewhere simply \nbecause there are not enough part-time and full-time entry-level jobs \nto help them get a little experience and pay for their education while \nthey go to college. Since the bulk of jobs in Wyoming are provided by \nsmall businesses, another increase in the minimum wage will only \nincrease that disparity. Another minimum wage increase would hike all \nwages. I'm in favor of all wages being increased, but not at the cost \nof critical jobs. If the entry-level wages have to go up, the workers \nearning slightly more than the minimum wage would have to earn more \ntoo. This isn't just a debate about entry-level wages. Not only would \nsmall businesses have to pay its employees a higher wage, but the price \nof products that the business purchases at wholesale costs and sells at \nretail prices will undoubtedly have to go up--causing customers to \npurchase less as a result. Lower sales means less jobs. Downsizing \nwould result. If that fails, the business folds--often quickly by \nWyoming's standards. This is basic macroeconomics and a simple \nexplanation on why Federal mandates can hurt the very people they are \nintended to help. Unfortunately, people don't work at the Federal \nlevel. They work at the local level--even for those who work for the \nFederal Government.\n\n  Not only have I heard the argument that our economy won't be hurt by \nanother increase since it is already so strong, but the argument is \nalso portrayed to sound as if another increase is long overdue. Over \nthe past 10 years, the Federal Government has walked all over States \nlike Wyoming by subjecting them to national, one-size-fits-all \nmandates, all kinds. In 1989, the Congress and President Bush \nnegotiated an agreement that provided for three increases in the \nminimum wage over a 12 month period. By April 1, 1991, the minimum wage \nrose from $3.35 per hour since 1981 to $4.25 per hour.\n  Congress didn't stop there, however. On May 22, 1996, the House \npassed a tax bill to assist small businesses, entitled the Small \nBusiness Job Protection Act of 1996. On May 23, the very next day, the \nHouse passed another bill that increased the minimum wage from $4.25 an \nhour to $5.15 an hour over two years. These two bills were combined \ninto one package and sent to the Senate where it passed. I was still a \nsmall business owner in Wyoming at that time, but I was still appalled \nby the action Congress and this President took under the guise of \n``small business protection.''\n  That takes us to today. Now the Senate is talking about another \nincrease in the minimum wage--$1 over the next two years. I am a member \nof the Senate Labor Committee that has jurisdiction over this matter. \nThe committee has not had one, single hearing discussing the impacts of \nanother minimum wage increase. The committee has not considered any \nlegislation that would increase the minimum wage. Rather than discuss \nthe impacts that the pending legislation would have on States like \nWyoming, the committee process was shunned. Instead, we're now debating \nthis issue as a matter of election year theatrics. Politics does not \nconstitute sound policy and this attempt to increase the minimum wage \nagain simply confirms that notion.\n  I am not interested in playing games with the minimum wage. This is a \ncomplex, economic issue that must be carefully considered. If the \nminimum wage goes up, then so does the poverty level. But wages are \nalready going up because of full employment. A quick downturn in the \neconomy would escalate unemployment. This would be a lose-lose \nsituation. Phony wage hikes drive prices up--so we trick the worker \ninto thinking he or she is getting more--but the bills still can't be \npaid at the end of the month. Government dabbling in a free economy is \nphony economics.\n  Congress has a duty to weed out political schemes from impacting our \nNation's market and labor force. States like Wyoming deserve better \nthan that and I'm not going to sit idly by and allow my constituents' \nconcerns to be silenced.\n\n[[Page S10686]]\n\n  This matter should receive a fair hearing and additional \nconsideration by the respective committees and must not be excluded. \nThis is the last-minute election year pitch; nothing more. I strongly \noppose this attempt to pass a minimum wage increase, and I ask my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be on the floor with my \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, in support of this amendment.\n  Let me say to my colleagues on the other side--perhaps we can have \nsome discussion and debate about this--that I find it very interesting \nwhat is going on here. If I am wrong, I am sure my colleagues will try \nto prove me wrong. I don't actually think they can prove me wrong. Here \nis what is going on.\n  The reason that the vast majority of the people in our country have \nmade it crystal clear that they are for an increase in the minimum \nwage, that they think to go from $5.15 cents and hour to $6.15 over a \n2-year period is imminently reasonable is because they think this is a \nfamily-value issue. This occurred the last time we went through this \ndebate and this time as well. Most people in Minnesota and most people \nin the United States of America believe that it is our responsibility \nas Senators and as Democrats and Republicans to create a climate \nwhereby they can do their best by their kids, because when they do \ntheir best by their kids, they do their best by our country. One of the \nways they can do best by their kids is to have a decent job and a \ndecent wage so they can support their families. That is what this \ndebate is all about.\n  Mr. President, we have these arguments trotted out here. I do not \nlike where they come from. We have the same old song. I understand that \nfor a variety of different reasons some of my colleagues are opposed to \nraising the minimum wage. I understand this may be a difficult vote. So \nwe have to figure out other arguments to make. I don't think it looks \ngood.\n  I am going to sort of break from the traditional boundaries of debate \nand say this: I don't think it looks good.\n  In this past year we gave ourselves a cost of living raise of $1.50 \nan hour on top of giving ourselves, several years ago, a $30,000 \nincrease. We in the Senate went from $100,000 to $130,000-plus.\n  At the time, I had colleagues come up to me and say, ``We need to do \nit. We have two places. We have children. They are in college. It is \ntough. It is very difficult to make ends meet.'' So we voted ourselves \na $30,000 increase, and then, on top of that, we vote ourselves a \n$1.50-an-hour cost of living increase. Yet, we say it is just \noutrageous to increase the minimum wage for people who are working \nfull-time, playing by the rules of the game, 52 weeks a year, 40 hours \na week, and are making poverty wages. People who work full-time ought \nnot to be poor in America. They ought to be able to make a decent wage \nand support their children. $100,000 to $130,000 for us is fine, but to \nraise the minimum wage $1 over 2 years is not fine.\n  That is a tough argument to make for people in the country, because \nmost people in the country believe that it is our job to make sure that \nwhen people play by the rules of the game and work hard that they earn \na decent living. Most people in this country believe that those people \nought to have that chance. Thus, the arguments come out.\n  And so we heard that we are going to lose all these jobs, but that \ndidn't happen. Here are the figures from the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics. I am not bringing out any particular conservative group or \nliberal group. I am just going by BLS data. When we went from $4.25 to \n$4.75 over this first year, 394,000 new jobs were added to the economy. \nThen when we went from $4.75 to $5.15, 517,000 new jobs were added to \nthe economy.\n  When I am finished I look forward to my colleagues refuting this; to \njust explain away the data. Sometimes we don't know what we don't want \nto know. But these are the facts from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nWhere is the evidence that this increase in the minimum wage that \nhelped so many people in our country--10 million-plus people, 140,000 \npeople in Minnesota, helped people do better by themselves and better \nby their kids--where is the evidence that it led to a decrease in jobs?\n  In the State of Wyoming, since the Federal minimum wage was \nincreased, unemployment in Wyoming dropped by 8 percent. Where is the \nevidence that the increases in the minimum wage lead to a sharp drop in \nthe number of jobs in the State of Wyoming? It is just the opposite. \nAccording to BLS, 15 percent of the workforce in Wyoming will benefit \nfrom our increase--30,000 workers.\n  So I don't understand this whole argument about how it will lead to a \ndecrease in jobs. For reasons I can't understand, I think it is just \nsort of ``blind ideology'' that my colleagues don't want to support \nthis. We are glad to have a big increase for ourselves. Then I say, \n``OK. What could be the reasons?''\n  Here are the arguments that are brought out to the floor. One is we \nwill see all of these jobs disappear. But precisely the opposite is \nhappening.\n  Until I hear to the contrary, I don't quite understand that argument.\n  My colleague from Wyoming, who I enjoyed hearing, said we didn't have \nany hearings. The chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources, my good friend, said we would be pleased to have hearings.\n  So we don't have hearings. Hearings are denied and then that is used \nas an argument why we shouldn't take action.\n  Then I hear my good friend from Utah make the argument that these \njobs are not just about earnings. They are about learning, and that we \nshould recognize the dignity of work. I agree. But do you want to know \nsomething? The best way that we can recognize the dignity of the work \nis to make sure there is some value to the work and make sure that \nthese men and women who are taking care of our children, taking care of \nour parents, providing us with food, cleaning buildings, and you name \nit, are provided with a decent wage.\n  A lot of people, no matter how hard they work, are poor because wages \nare too low. To talk to them about the dignity of their work and how \nthis is great for learning just misses the point, if we won't talk \nabout earnings.\n  I don't know what reality we are dealing with here. We are dealing \nwith the phenomenon of many working poor families in our country with \nthe head of household working full-time, and those families are still \npoor.\n  I am hearing colleagues talk about how we are opposed to raising the \nminimum wage because somehow we think it will undercut the dignity \npeople have. Or we are opposed to raising the minimum wage because we \nreally think this is as much about learning as it is earning. I just do \nnot understand these arguments.\n  Mr. President, we know that this especially helps women because they \nare disproportionately among the low-wage workers. We know that this \ndisproportionately helps adults. We dealt with the mythology that this \nis all about teenagers. Then we get into the argument: But there are a \npercentage of these workers who are younger people, high school age, \ncollege age.\n  Again, I don't know what reality my colleagues are focused on here. \nBut do you know, they work for compelling reasons as well. In case \nanybody hasn't noticed, higher education is an expensive proposition.\n  Many high school students and college students are working--I meet \nmany college students who are working 2 and 3 minimum wage jobs. That \nis why it takes them 6 or 7 years to graduate. They are not doing it \njust on some lark. They are doing it because this is key to their being \nable to finance their education or help their parents finance their \neducation. Or, if they are older--since many of the students are older \nand going back to school--it is even more critical.\n  I heard my colleague from Utah refer to a study that showed when you \nhave a higher minimum wage, welfare mothers stay on welfare a longer \nperiod of time. That does not make any sense to me. I would love to \nknow what there is to that story. Because, frankly, if you\n\n[[Page S10687]]\n\nare going to talk about the importance of going from welfare to \nworkfare, presumably one of the key things you want to make sure of is \nthat the jobs are there that pay a decent wage so those mothers and \nchildren will be better off. For some reason, States with higher \nminimum wage--or I guess the argument is supposed to be that by raising \nthe minimum wage we have discouraged these parents from moving from \nwelfare to work? It just makes no sense. I would love to know a little \nbit more about that finding.\n  So, my conclusion--and I say this with some indignation--we just have \nall the sympathy in the world when we have oil companies coming out \nhere asking for special breaks, but we have very little sympathy when \nit comes to these working poor families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired. Who \nyields time? The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have listened to my good friend from \nMinnesota, and certainly understand his concerns. But I think the \npicture he gives of the situation is somewhat different than what I \nperceive. I have faithfully supported minimum wage increases over the \nyears, but there comes a time when we try to push things too fast and \nwe could well destroy the very goals we are trying to reach.\n  One of my major goals as chairman of the Labor Committee is to get \npeople into the workforce and keep them there. That is why I worked so \nhard with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact legislation \nthat will improve and streamline our adult education job-training \nprograms. That is why I am working so hard on developing legislation \nthat will improve our postsecondary, adult and vocational education. \nThat is why I have, with my friend from Massachusetts, introduced \nlegislation to help the disabled find jobs and get off the federal \nrolls while maintaining their health benefits. And that is why, \nalthough I have supported past minimum wage increases, I am concerned \nthat if we raise the minimum wage too soon after the last increase, we \nmay cause more harm than good.\n  Here in Congress, we continually grapple with the issue of how to \nassist low-skilled workers--particularly workers who have to support a \nfamily--without destroying the very jobs they rely on to support \nthemselves and their families. It is hard for people with families and \nlow skills to get by. We have seen and heard a lot of evidence about \nthis. But it is also hard for small businesses to get by. Business \nfailures are commonplace and margins are thin. When we raise the \nminimum wage, we make it more difficult for these businesses to justify \nhiring inexperienced, unskilled, and untrained workers.\n  For the past 60 years, we have relied upon the minimum wage to set a \nfloor beneath wages. Every time we have increased it, we have given \nbusinesses five years or so to adjust from the last increase to the \nnext enactment. The only exception was once during the 1970s when the \nreal minimum wage declined even as the nominal wage was increasing. \nThose of us will remember, this was during a time of incredible \ninflation.\n  However, before the last increase even took effect, the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts had launched a new campaign for another \nincrease in the minimum wage. The net effect of these increases would \nbe a 45 percent rise in the minimum wage over a four and a half-year \nperiod. I am concerned that saddling small business with this steep \nincrease over a relatively short period of time will have some negative \nrepercussions both on the business owners as well as workers who count \non their minimum wage jobs, and perhaps on those individuals who are \nseeking their very first job.\n  Although increases in the minimum wage have been important, they are \nnot the only tool we have used to assist low-income workers who are \nsupporting families. In addition, we have developed targeted government \nsupports for the working poor, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit \n(EITC).\n  Over the years, the EITC has been expanded to target and supplement \nthe wages of low income families without threatening any job loss. This \nyear, the EITC will enable a minimum wage worker who is either a single \nparent or the single wage earning parent of dependent children to \nreceive 3,756 additional dollars, bringing that family's income to \n$14,468. In addition, the EITC is set up so that these families do not \nhave to wait for a lump-sum tax refund; instead the workers can receive \nthe tax credit in their weekly paychecks.\n  A recent report released by the Center on Budget and Policies \nPriorities found that the EITC now moves more than two million children \nout of poverty. The report concluded that, ``the EITC is the most \neffective safety net program for children in working poor families.'' I \nstrongly support the EITC because it is making a difference in the \nlives of working families. I also support the EITC because it provides \nan incentive to work, the incentive is specifically targeted to help \nworkers from low income families, and it does so without threatening \njobs, as a minimum wage increase will.\n  Further, I am concerned that when we raise the minimum wage we are \nnot targeting low income workers. Statistics show that more than half \nof the minimum wage workers live in families with yearly incomes over \n$25,000. In addition, statistics reveal that the majority of minimum \nwage earners are young, single and childless. I understand that in my \nhome state of Vermont, only a small percentage of minimum wage workers \nare supporting their families on their wages. The fact that an increase \nin the minimum wage does not specifically target low income families \nbecomes particularly significant when we consider the dramatic impact \nthat a back-to-back increase will have on small businesses as compared \nto the actual number of low-income working families who will be helped \nby the increase.\n  I believe that we should give the last minimum wage increase some \ntime to be absorbed into the economy before we move to increase it \nagain. I also think that we should continue to focus our efforts on \nassisting the working poor by working to improve and expand targeted \napproaches such as the EITC.\n  Finally, I believe that before we open up the Fair Labor Standards \nAct to raise the minimum wage, we should take some additional steps to \nupdate the FLSA to better assist our working families.\n  This update is sorely needed because, while the makeup of the \nAmerican workforce has changed dramatically over the past 60 years, few \nprovisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act have been updated to reflect \nthose changes. The needs of today's workforce are different than the \nneeds of the workforce of the 1930s. Increasingly, employees are \nrequesting that their employers offer more flexible work schedules and \ncompensation packages. Unfortunately, the FLSA and its underlying \nregulations preclude employers from accommodating such requests. In \nother words, even though our workers are requesting more flexible \nworking arrangements so that they can juggle work and family \nobligations--the arrangements that would be most helpful to these \nworkers are actually prohibited under current law. And our attempts to \nchange that were frustrated earlier in this past session.\n  The Family Friendly Workplace Act would assist these working families \nby amending the FLSA to allow employees the ability to choose comp. \ntime-- the opportunity to choose paid time off instead of cash \ncompensation for overtime work. It would also allow employees to work a \nflexible biweekly schedule--to schedule their hours over a two-week \nperiod so that they can work additional hours during one week in order \nto take that time off during the second week. These same options have \nbeen available to Federal, State, and local employees for some time and \nthey have been extremely popular with these public sector employees.\n  Why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refuse to \nacknowledge this and allow us to bring the FSLA up to the present-day \nneeds of this Nation I do not know.\n  During the first session of the 105th Congress, we engaged in \ncontentious and partisan debate over the Family Friendly Workplace Act. \nWhile we were\n\n[[Page S10688]]\n\nable to pass the bill out of the Labor Committee, our Democratic \ncolleagues prevented us from moving forward on the floor of the Senate.\n  To be quite truthful, I still have a hard time fathoming why this \nissue has been so contentious. After all, we are talking about amending \nthe law so that hourly employees in the private sector will be able to \npartake in some of the same scheduling options that salaried and \npublic-sector employees currently enjoy. The public support for this \nbill has been overwhelming, and I am frustrated that we have been \nunable to move it forward.\n  The point I am trying to make here today, Mr. President, is that \nwhile the minimum wage is important--and obviously it is--another \nincrease at this time will not necessarily benefit our workforce. \nHowever, there are things that we can do today that will benefit \nworking families. It is my hope that my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle will recognize this point and will begin working with me to \nhelp our workers meet the needs of their families by amending the FLSA \nto allow for more flexible work schedules. I hope my colleagues will \nlift their prohibition and allow us to consider this very important \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor--I believe there \nis going to be a motion to table--I urge my colleagues to vote in favor \nof the motion to table the Kennedy amendment which will increase the \nminimum wage by 19 percent. Just 2 years ago we raised it 21 percent.\n  I heard some of the proponents of the amendment say, ``We need to \nincrease minimum wage because if we don't, these people will not be \nable to make a decent living.'' Frankly, I concur; if somebody needs to \nlive on $5.15 an hour, that probably is not a very good living. But if \nyou follow that philosophy through, then let's increase the minimum \nwage to $10 an hour or maybe $20 an hour. It just doesn't make sense.\n  What are we doing if we increase minimum wage? Right now, the minimum \nwage is $5.15 an hour. There are 2.2 million people who make that \namount. The proposal is to increase it to $6.15 an hour. According to \nCBO, there are 11.7 million workers who make less than $6.15 an hour. \nIf we do that, we are saying it is against the law for them to work for \nless than $6.15 an hour--the Federal Government, in its wisdom, has \ndecided that it is against the law for anybody in America to work for \nless than $6.15 an hour. I think that is a mistake. We are saying it is \nbetter for them not to have a job: ``If that job doesn't pay $6.15 an \nhour, we would rather have them be unemployed.'' The Federal Government \nmakes it against the law.\n  Do I want them to make $6.15 an hour? You bet. Do I want them to make \nmore than $6.15 an hour? You bet. But I would hate to pass a law saying \nit is against the law for them to work for less than that. That is \nexactly what we are doing. Maybe this $6.15 an hour works in \nMassachusetts, but it may not work in rural Montana or in rural New \nMexico.\n  I am bothered by the fact that we are telling people if whatever job \nthey have--and maybe it is a beginning job; a lot of minimum wage jobs \nare beginning jobs; maybe they are working part time in a restaurant, \nmaybe they are pumping gas or sacking groceries or something--but \nbasically the Federal Government is saying, ``We would rather have you \nbe unemployed; if your job doesn't pay this much, we would rather have \nyou unemployed.'' Then they are entitled to receive Government \npayments, welfare benefits, so on.\n  To me, that just doesn't make sense. To go back on this poverty line \nand say, ``If you don't make this money, it just is not worth it,'' is \nhogwash. That is really devaluing the whole process of people starting \nto climb the economic ladder. We are saying if the job doesn't pay so \nmuch, we would rather you be unemployed.\n  Sometimes that first job, even though it doesn't pay very much, is \none of the most important jobs an individual can get, because they \nlearn what it means to get a job, to be at work, to be on time. They \nlearn maybe that that job doesn't pay enough, so they need to get a \nbetter job. Maybe they need to improve their skills or maybe they need \nto continue their education.\n  To say we would rather have you be unemployed--whom does that really \nhurt? It hurts low-income people. It hurts minorities \ndisproportionately. It basically leaves a lot of people with idle time \nwho, frankly, would be better off making $5 an hour and having a job \nand learning some skills so they can get a better job in the future. \nInstead, we will be raising the ladder and saying, ``No, we would \nrather have you be unemployed.''\n\n  There they are, a 16-, 17-, 18-year-old person unemployed, maybe \ngetting in trouble, maybe still wanting to have some money or \nsomething, so they get involved in doing other things. Sometimes those \nother things are illegal.\n  Mr. President, you can't repeal the law of supply and demand. If you \nraise minimum wage, you are going to cost jobs, you are going to put \npeople out of work, and, yes, the Congressional Budget Office says \nmaybe it is 100,000, maybe it is 500,000.\n  My daughter worked, and she was going to college. She was working in \na restaurant as a waitress making $5 and something, I think--a little \nless than $6 an hour. At least she did when she started. I don't want \nthe Federal Government to say, ``We don't want her to have that job.'' \nI don't want to price her out of getting that job. Unfortunately, she \ndrives a car. I want her to help pay for that car. I want her to put \ngas in that car.\n  Again, I think learning skills in whatever job level a person is able \nto start at--the higher the better, that is great. But if it is a \nminimum wage job, if it is a low-income-type job, if they are able to \nlearn skills from that point, great. Let's not price it out of the ball \npark. Let's not put those people out on the unemployment lines. Let's \nnot deprive a minority youngster who is 15 years old, or 16 years old, \nor 17 years old, in Chicago the chance to start climbing the economic \nladder.\n  Raising the minimum wage--I understand maybe the proponents' goal, \nand I share the goal of trying to raise people's incomes, but I want to \ndo it through a free market, not do it through a Government mandate \nthat is going to put hundreds of thousands of people out of work.\n  Unfortunately, I think that is the net result of this amendment. If \nnot, let's raise the minimum wage a lot more. I would like for \neverybody to make $10 an hour. If the economic arguments are valid \nbehind raising this--if we raised it 21 percent 2 years ago, if we are \ngoing to raise it another 19 or 20 percent--if there is no negative \neconomic impact, let's make it $10 or $20 an hour. Let's make sure \neverybody is going to be wealthy. Let's make sure nobody is on the \npoverty line.\n  Frankly, that won't work. That just flat won't work. Most \nimportantly, let's not deprive young people of the chance to climb the \neconomic ladder. The hundreds of thousands, millions of these people \nwho are making this level wage are people like my daughter. Let's give \nthem a chance as well to start climbing the economic ladder. Let's not \nprice it out.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the motion to \ntable the Kennedy amendment at the proper time. I compliment my \ncolleague from Utah and also my colleague from Vermont for their \nstatements.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for leading this debate, an important debate.\n  The first job that I ever had where I was paid an hourly wage was the \nresult of two lies. I walked into a delicatessen at age 14 in the home \nState of the Presiding Officer, in St. Louis, MO, a place called Union \nStation. I bought a half dozen bagels for my mother. The man leaned \nover the counter and said, ``Are you looking for a job, boy?''\n\n[[Page S10689]]\n\n  I said, ``Yes.''\n  He said, ``How old are you?''\n  And then the first lie came out. I was 14 and I said, ``I'm 16.''\n  ``OK.''\n  I said, ``How much does the job pay?''\n  Then the second lie came out. He said, ``The minimum wage, 60 cents \nan hour.''\n  With that exchange, we entered into a contract: An underage worker \nmaking less than the minimum wage got his first job besides delivering \npapers. I have had a lot of jobs ever since. I have met a lot of people \nalong the way who have struggled at low-wage jobs and tried to make a \nliving.\n  And this debate is really about them.\n  I guess there is a sense of frustration by some on the floor that \nthese people in low-income categories will not be quiet. They keep \nspeaking up and saying, ``We can't make it. We're not making it. We \nneed more help. We're trying to keep our families together. We're \ntrying to provide the basics for our kids, and $5.15 an hour just won't \ndo it.''\n  A lot of people would wish that the so-called invisible hand of the \nmarket would be all that we rely on, but, fortunately, we do not. \nFortunately, since the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we have said \nthis country will have a minimum wage, because we believe there is \ndignity in work and there is dignity attached to work that pays a \ndecent wage.\n  Unfortunately, we politicians, who draw regular salaries, have fallen \ndown on the job of keeping up with inflation. Take a look at this chart \nabout what has happened to the real minimum wage while we have gone \nthrough all this political gasification on the floor of the House and \nthe Senate.\n  Starting in 1955, it was the equivalent of $4.50 an hour; it was not \nthat, but in 1997 dollars it would have been $4.50 an hour. We saw the \nminimum wage, the real wage, the earning power of the minimum wage \nreach a high of $7.38 and then plummet between 1970 and 1988 to a low \nof $4.34.\n  If Senator Kennedy is not successful with his effort today, you are \ngoing to see that line plummet again. What it means is the real earning \npower of people in low-income jobs will continue to descend; and as it \ncontinues to descend, it will be more difficult for them to provide \nclothing for their kids, any kind of health insurance, to pay rent on a \ndecent place to live, to provide some of the amenities of life that all \nof us just take for granted.\n  I have listened to the arguments, and they are so weary and time worn \nthat ``if you raise the minimum wage, we will increase unemployment.'' \nThe spokesmen and spokeswomen for the business community have been \ngiving us that song for as long as this debate has been on the floor of \nCongress. They cannot seem to divert their eyes away from their hymnal \nin singing this long enough to look at the facts. And the facts say \njust the opposite.\n  Look at what the impact on unemployment has been by our most recent \nincrease in the minimum wage. When it was increased to $4.75, \nunemployment started going down. When it was increased to $5.15, it \nwent down further. So the argument that raising the minimum wage forces \nemployers to lay people off may happen in an isolated case or two, but \nin looking at the overall economy, you have to say there is no \ncorrelation here. The minimum wage has gone up and unemployment has \ngone down.\n  ``Oh,'' they say, ``wait a minute. You're not talking about the most \nvulnerable people. These are the first ones they are going to lay off, \nthat teenager,'' like myself at age 14 or 16, or whatever, ``trying to \ngo to work and make a minimum wage. Surely, they will be the first \ncasualties.'' The facts do not support that. The facts say just the \nopposite.\n  Look at this. Unemployment continues to go down as the minimum wage \ngoes up among teenagers age 16 to 19. They say, ``Well, there are \nspecial classes of teenagers.'' We all know the problems with minority \nteenagers. They are a special class. ``Surely, they'll be the first \nones to suffer if we raise the minimum wage.'' Again, not the case. \nMinimum wage goes up; unemployment goes down.\n  There is really nothing to these arguments against an increase in the \nminimum wage. Frankly, we have heard so many of them--people who will \nnot acknowledge that the last time we increased the minimum wage we saw \nan increase in employment in America.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma stood up and said, ``Be careful. If you \nraise this minimum wage, we're going to lose jobs.'' Since September \n1996, the last time we raised the minimum wage, 61,000 new jobs have \nbeen created in the State of Oklahoma. There are 154,000 Oklahomans who \nwould receive a raise of $1 an hour if this Kennedy amendment passed.\n  In my home State of Illinois, 179,000 new jobs have been created \nsince we last increased the minimum wage. There are 374,000 Illinois \nworkers and their families who are waiting for that, hoping that we \nwill listen again to the need to raise this basic minimum wage.\n  Who are the people who will benefit? The teenagers and the \nminorities? Yes. But if you want to describe who they are, you have to \nlook at the bigger picture. Sixty percent of them are women; 74 percent \nare adults, 20 years of age or older. Some want to refer to this as a \nkid wage. Seventy-four percent of the people who would benefit by this \namendment are over 20 years of age, 8.9 million workers in the United \nStates.\n  Work is an ennobling experience. It has been in my life, the lives of \nmy parents and the lives of my children. I am glad that I did it. And I \nlearned a lot in the experience. I always wanted to feel that I was \ngetting paid fairly for hard work. Sure, I would work hard at my job to \ndo a good job, but I would like to think when the paycheck came in I \nwas getting a decent wage.\n  Fortunately, in my life, there were very few times that I ever \nstruggled to make ends meet with my family. My wife and I weathered \nthose years. But for some people this is a weekly experience--waiting \nfor that paycheck to come in and wondering if they are going to make \nit.\n  Who are these people we are talking about? These are the people we \nentrust our parents to in nursing homes. These are the people who are \nchanging the sheets on their beds, cleaning up after them. These are \nthe people who we entrust our children to in day-care centers and our \ngrandchildren--I might add since I am now in that vaunted category--\ngrandparents worried about grandchildren. These day-care workers are \nmaking a minimum wage, and we give them the most precious cargo we can \ndeliver in bringing in our children. These are the people who made the \nbed in your hotel room, who took the dirty dishes off your table, who \ntook in your cleaning. These are the people who every day get up and go \nto work. They know that work is ennobling. They are asking for \nfairness.\n  I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Two more minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to those who are opposing this minimum wage, that \nit is a sad day when we have reached the point when the U.S. Congress \nis so unresponsive to the reality of workers in America, so insensitive \nto what is really going on among workers in businesses across the \nUnited States.\n  When the record is written about this Congress, and what it has \nachieved, I am afraid it will be reminiscent of General MacArthur's \nspeech to a joint session of Congress over 40 years ago. He said, ``Old \nsoldiers never die, they just fade away.''\n  Well, maybe--maybe--it is time for this Congress to fade away--this \nCongress, which has been unwilling to address the most basic issues in \nthis country; unwilling to pass campaign finance reform; unwilling to \npass a tobacco bill to protect our children who continue to be lured by \nthose companies; unwilling to show initiative to protect Social \nSecurity when Americans say that is their No. 1 priority; unwilling to \ndo anything about education, like the crumbling schools initiative of \nmy colleague Senator Carol Moseley-Braun; unwilling to address a \nPatients' Bills of Rights when every American family knows how \nvulnerable we are when it comes to health insurance and the way doctors \nand hospitals are treated; and unwilling to address the most basic \nissue, the most basic issue of fairness, that the people who get up and \ngo to work every day in America deserve a decent living wage.\n  It will be a tragedy if this turns out to be just another partisan \nroll call\n\n[[Page S10690]]\n\nswept aside and ignored because hundreds of thousands in my State and \nmillions across America look to this Congress to be sensitive and to \nlead. Unfortunately, today, the debate suggests that we will not. And \nthis Congress will fade away with an ignominious record when it comes \nto the people who are going to work every day and keeping America \nmoving.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah yields 3 minutes to the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to talk about the procedure of \nthis minimum wage bill on a very, very important bankruptcy reform bill \nwe have. The substance may be very important, but the procedure is what \nwe want to consider as we ask our colleagues to vote on this amendment.\n  We are on the first major change in bankruptcy legislation in 20 \nyears--very needed change. So what is the minimum wage bill doing on \nthis bill? This bill was voted out of committee 16-2. The author of \nthis minimum wage amendment was one of those two people who voted \nagainst it. Obviously, by putting minimum wage on this, it is a poison \npill to defeat this legislation. This is an anchor that is going to \ntake this bill to the bottom of the ocean if this amendment is adopted. \nWe must not let this amendment be adopted if we want a strong \nbankruptcy bill, any bankruptcy bill, out of this Congress.\n\n  We have about 2 weeks left to get this bill worked up, with wide \ndifferences between the House bill and the Senate bill. If we adopt \nthis amendment on minimum wage, I am sure the majority leader will take \nthis bill down.\n  I am asking my colleagues not to vote for this amendment because of \nthe merits or demerits of minimum wage, but because this is a poison \npill that will destroy the bankruptcy reform legislation that has so \nmuch going for it. When a bill comes out of the Judiciary Committee 16-\n2, it has a lot of bipartisan support, and you know it will go. This is \none way that one opponent of this bankruptcy bill can stop it.\n  Now, as important as a minimum wage increase might be to help some \nfamilies in America, this bankruptcy bill is also very important to \nhelp lower-income families in America because there is not a single \nfamily in America--low-income or high-income--that is not paying part \nof the costs of bankruptcy; $40 billion costs to the economy every \nyear, $400 for a family of four. So every family that the Senator from \nMassachusetts is trying to help through an increase in minimum wage, he \nis hurting by stopping the reform of bankruptcy. We must reform \nbankruptcy. This is a hidden tax on the poor of America.\n  By passing this legislation, reducing the tax, we will help the very \nsame families that the Senator from Massachusetts wants to help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding this \ntime.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent privilege be \ngranted to Yvonne Byrne of my staff for the duration of the debate on \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, let me commend my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, for his long-time commitment and leadership \non this issue, among many others, but especially on this issue. So many \npeople are now working in America and earning at least a raise from the \nminimum wage of what we had a few years ago of $5.15 because of the \nhard work and effort and leadership of Senator Kennedy.\n  As Senator Kennedy knows, this is an issue of basic fairness about \nwhether those Americans who work hard, who have helped our Nation grow \nto a period of very significant economic prosperity, should, indeed, \nreceive some of the benefits of this prosperity.\n  I was in Iowa on Friday. I visited the Tri-State Food Bank in Sioux \nCity, IA. Now, the unemployment rate in Sioux City and the surrounding \nareas is about 2 percent--literally almost no unemployment. The economy \nis growing; people are working. It is some of the best times people in \nthat area have ever had from what they tell me and from what all the \nindicators are. Yet, the director of the Tri-State Food Bank Mr. Ron \nSwanson informed me that they are getting more demand for food from the \nfood bank than they have ever had before. Now they are concerned about \nthe winter and whether or not they will have the food necessary. I \nsaid, with all these people working, why is it that people are coming \nto the food bank?\n  Earlier, I visited the food bank in Des Moines and Karen Ford told me \nthe same thing. That in this time of economic prosperity and growth and \nlow unemployment, the demand for the commodities and the food from the \nfood banks is higher than ever.\n  As I was told in Sioux City on Friday, you have a lot of people who \nhave come off of welfare in the so-called Welfare-to-Work Program. They \nare making minimum wage, they are feeding their families, clothing \ntheir kids, sending their kids to school, paying rent, they are getting \nfood stamps. But their food stamps are running out before the end of \nthe month so they have to go to the food bank to get USDA commodities \nof rice, USDA canned pears and canned peaches, USDA flour, plus the \ndonations that churches, schools and the businesses in that area donate \nto the food bank.\n  Now, these are not people that are shirking. These are not people \nthat are just out on the streets. These are people that go to work \nevery day trying to provide for their families. Yet they have to go to \nthe food bank before the end of the month because the food stamps run \nout. These are people making the minimum wage--$5.15 an hour.\n  It is not right in this country when in this time of economic \nprosperity when millionaires are created every day and we have \nbillionaires like we have never seen before, that people who work and \ngo to work every day can't even get enough food to last until the end \nof the month.\n  That is what this is about. That is what this whole debate and this \nvote is about. For the life of me, I can't understand why anyone would \nvote against raising the minimum wage just the modest amount that \nSenator Kennedy is proposing.\n  I had my staff calculate up for me what the minimum wage would be if \nit had increased at the same rate that CEO salaries, chief executive \noffice salaries, had gone up on average since 1960. If the minimum wage \nhad increased at the same rate as CEO average salaries since 1960, the \nminimum wage today--are you ready for this--would be $41 an hour. Now, \nthat tells you about the spread. That tells you what is happening in \nour society. Fewer and fewer people making more and more money, getting \nall the wealth, more and more people shoved to the bottom who make the \nminimum wage, who get food stamps, and then have to go to the food bank \nto get food to last them until the end of the month. It is not right. \nIt is not right in this country that those conditions have to exist.\n  They tell us, well, if you raise the minimum wage there will be \nunemployment, people will be out of work. How many times do we have to \nhear this nonsense? We know it is not true. We have the facts, we have \nthe data. It is absolutely not true. For example, in Iowa about 5 years \nago, Iowa raised their minimum wage more than the national minimum \nwage. What we heard at that time from the Republicans in Iowa was, oh \nmy gosh, it will cost us all these jobs, people will leave Iowa. They \nwill go to other States where there is a lower minimum wage.\n  In 1989, Iowa raised their minimum wage. By 1996, the Iowa minimum \nwage was forty cents more than the Federal minimum wage. Guess what \nhappened? Nobody left. People worked. Jobs didn't leave. Businesses \ndidn't leave. In fact, we had one of the greatest periods of job growth \nand business growth in the State of Iowa when we had a higher\n\n[[Page S10691]]\n\nminimum wage than the Federal minimum wage.\n  Now the Federal minimum wage has caught up to Iowa. I think that \npoints out the fallacy of the argument that if you raise the minimum \nwage, businesses are going to go out of business and they will leave. \nWe proved in Iowa that is not so because we had a higher minimum wage \nthan the Federal.\n  This is the time for us to stand up and be counted for what is fair \nand right in our society. I thank Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have had a good debate and discussion \non this issue during the course of the morning. The opposition to an \nincrease in the minimum wage raised a number of issues, which we \nanticipated and responded to.\n  First of all, they say that there is going to be an increasing \nproblem in terms of unemployment. We have demonstrated that we have the \nlowest unemployment since World War II.\n  They argue that it is going to add to the problems of inflation. We \nhave demonstrated that we have the lowest rates of inflation, and we \nhave demonstrated a very substantial growth in terms of small business \ninterests.\n  I want to point out, since our friends, Senator Hatch and Senator \nEnzi, talked about the restaurant industry, that they have been prime \nopponents of any increase for the hardest working Americans, those at \nthe lowest end of the economic ladder. I point out that in this \nindustry in 1996, the average restaurant CEO grew in income by 8.6 \npercent. Their average bonus increased 13 percent. Their average value \nof stock options exploded by over 100 percent. Their average total \ncompensation grew by 6 percent.\n  These are some of the highest paid CEOs in this country who are \nmaking that high salary on the basis of low-wage workers. I might also \nadd that of the 100 top CEOs in the restaurant industry, there is not \none single woman--not one single woman.\n  Mr. President, before we take all of the arguments by my friend from \nUtah where we have seen since 1996 a growth and an increase of 59,000 \njobs--that was after the increase of the minimum wage in 1996 in \nOctober, and September 1997--one of the lowest unemployment rates in \nthis country, I have a list of the statements that have been made by my \nfriend from Oklahoma that he gave in the last debate: I don't think \nthat they should do it in my State because they are going to put people \nout of work.\n  That was said in 1996. Senator Hatch virtually said the same thing in \n1996. The facts demonstrate to the contrary.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to point this out. We have seen here \nwhat you can't get away from: that is, the decline in the purchasing \npower for low-income Americans. That is a fact. It is lower now than it \nhas been for a period of 30 years.\n  Republicans signed onto this program. President Eisenhower, President \nNixon, President Bush--all Republicans--supported an increase in the \nminimum wage. Yet we hear from our Republican leadership that we can't \npossibly do it because it is going to destroy America.\n  Mr. President, it is important to understand why this issue is so \nimportant to the religious community. We have 170 organizations, the \nprincipal leaders in the religious community, supporting an increase in \nthe minimum wage because they understand it, whether it is the American \nFriends, Catholic Charities, the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical \nChurch, the Lutheran Church, the American Council of Churches, U.S. \nCatholic Bishops, United States Church of Christ--they understand it. \nIt is a moral issue for them--believing in the dignity of the \nindividual. They ought to be able to have a decent living, that they \nare working in America to provide for their children. That is what the \nissue is.\n  You can give us all the charts you want made up by the restaurant \nindustry to distort what is really being debated on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  This is an issue involving women--sixty percent of the recipients are \nwomen.\n  It is an issue involving children--the neediest and the poorest \nchildren in this country who are the sons and daughters of those \nminimum-wage workers.\n  This is a civil rights issue--it is paying people the entry wage, a \nlivable wage for those individuals who come from different backgrounds \nand tradition, and also the minorities in our country.\n  This is basically the moral issue of our time--and when we have been \nat our best, we have responded to it, Republicans and Democrats alike. \nIt is a fundamental issue that has been stated by my colleagues--\nSenators Wellstone, Harkin, Durbin, and others who have spoken on it.\n  To sum up, it is whether the United States of America, with the most \nextraordinary economic prosperity in the history of our Nation, is \ngoing to say that our fellow citizens who work hard and who have \nchildren ought to have a livable wage. That is what the issue is about. \nThe Republican leadership is saying no to those working families.\n  We hope that we are going to have some support from the other side of \nthe aisle because we believe that there are those who understand the \nimportance of this issue to working families. There is no issue before \nthis U.S. Senate that involves fairness and decency and equity like an \nincrease in the minimum wage. This is it. Now is the time.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I always enjoy listening to Members of \nCongress talk about how the minimum wage is going to benefit this \nsociety as we raise the minimum wage. Some of us have worked for the \nminimum wage in our lifetimes. We know what it is like to work for the \nminimum wage. We also know what it is like to lose your job because you \nraise the minimum wage too much, and small business people who do not \nmake all that much money have to either reduce employment or get out of \nit. That is what happens.\n  The Senator from Minnesota, the Senator from Illinois, and the \nSenator from Massachusetts I think are looking at the wrong numbers. \nThey should be looking at employment--not unemployment. They should be \ncomparing it to what might have occurred without the mandatory minimum \nwage increases. There is no question that we have a good economy right \nnow. A rising tide lifts all boats, thank goodness.\n  I notice that my colleagues are not discussing the plunging youth \nemployment rates following the minimum wage increases in 1978 or 1989. \nThe 1996 legislation that raised the minimum wage included a package of \ntax cuts. To some extent, of course, that helped mitigate the impact. \nYou would think that by increasing the minimum wage we were going to \nhave an increase in jobs. Really, I don't know any responsible \neconomist who makes that argument. The fact remains, however, that \nunskilled workers are not helped, they are often hurt, by increases in \nthe minimum wage, particularly in areas where the market wage for \nentry-level workers is lower.\n  You are looking at one of the main sponsors of the child care \ndevelopment block grant. I wonder how many children are not being cared \nfor because we keep increasing the minimum wage and freezing people out \nof child care.\n  Yes, there are a lot of issues involved here. Wouldn't it be better \nto cut Americans taxes? We could give everyone more money in their \npaychecks without jeopardizing jobs and at the same time without \nhurting small businesses or without triggering price increases for \nconsumers.\n  I think instead of having minimum wages we ought to have minimum \ntaxes. But where do we get the help from the other side on that? We \ndon't get much of it. If you cut taxes, you actually give people an \nincrease in wages, because they actually take more money home.\n  Frankly, that is what we ought to be interested in doing to help \nthese people along the way. It would help small business people, where \nmost of the jobs are created. Better than 50 percent of all jobs are \ncreated by small business people, who would be the most severely \nimpacted and who are the most severely impacted by increases in the \nminimum wage, other than those who never get a chance to enter into the \nworkforce as a result of increases in the minimum wage.\n  Let's be honest about it. This is not the simple little economic \ninterest, as\n\n[[Page S10692]]\n\nsome on the other side have been saying. There is a lot involved here. \nWe ought to be reducing taxes, not increasing minimum wages.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have not heard my colleague from Utah \nrespond to this. I haven't heard one colleague on the other side of the \naisle respond to the data or to the facts. I have heard them try to \nhide behind the argument that raising the minimum wage was going to \nlead to a loss of jobs. Since increasing the minimum wage in the prior \nyear, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 517,000 new jobs. \nSometimes we do not want to know what we do not want to know. I have \nnot heard any refutation of that at all.\n  So my question is, Why in the world would we not value work and give \ndignity to work by raising the minimum wage, which is so important to \nwomen in the workplace, so important to children, so important to \nfamilies?\n  Then my colleague from Utah moves on to another argument concerning \nchild care. In all due respect, that is what is so sad about this \ndebate. If we really wanted to do our best by families and value \nfamilies, we would be raising the minimum wage, we would be investing \nin affordable child care--which this Republican-led Senate will not do. \nWe would have universal health care coverage, which this Republican-led \nSenate will not do. In child care, I hope the tradeoff is not to say \nthat we are not going to be able to provide good child care for \nchildren unless we continue to devalue the work of men and women in \nchild care. Many of them barely make minimum wage or barely above it. \nThat is why we have a 40-percent turnover every year. This is not \nacceptable.\n  We can raise the minimum wage, which is important for women, \nimportant for these working families, important for children, important \nfor young people who are trying to work their way through school. We \ncan invest in the health and skills and intellect and character by \ninvesting in affordable child care. We can invest in health care. This \nRepublican-led Senate has done none of these things.\n  In all due respect, in all due respect, the reason that 75 or 80 \npercent of the people in the country believe we should raise the \nminimum wage is because they have some sense of fairness and justice. \nWe raised our salaries by $30,000 just a few years ago. We gave \nourselves a cost-of-living increase that amounts to a $1.50 increase \nper hour, we make $130,000-plus and say we need to make that. And yet, \nwe will not raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 over a 2-year \nperiod so people who work hard will not be poor in America and their \nchildren will not be poor? This is really outrageous.\n  I hope we get a majority vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe I have some time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 1 minute 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just again to underline the excellent \npoint my friend from Iowa made, according to the U.S. Conference of \nMayors study, in 1997 requests for emergency food aid increased 86 \npercent in the cities served--these are cities with Republican and \nDemocratic mayors. Mr. President, 67 percent of the cities cited low-\npaying jobs as one of the main causes of hunger. Low-paying jobs are \nthe most frequently cited causes of hunger. Nearly half of those \nrelying on emergency food aid do so because their earnings are too low. \nIn 1997, in Jeffersonville, IN, one-fourth of the families receiving \nemergency shelter were earning less than $6 an hour.\n  This is about fairness to teachers' aides, to child care workers. It \nis a basic and fundamental issue with regard to health care workers as \nwell. We are either going to respect our fellow citizens and give them \nthis modest increase in the minimum wage, or we are not going to meet \nour responsibilities.\n  Mr. President, has the time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining is 10 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield me the 10 seconds--I have 10 \nseconds, Mr. President--there is a lot of talk in this town these days \nabout morality and immorality. This has to do with morality. This has \nto do with what is moral in this society and to stick up for people who \nare low-income and are going hungry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10679-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10692-S10695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Debate on this issue has expired. The hour of \n12:30 having arrived, the Senate will be in recess until 2:15 p.m.\n  Thereupon, at 12:31 p.m., the Senate recessed until 2:15 p.m.; \nwhereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by the Presiding \nOfficer (Mr. Coats).\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nKennedy's amendment to raise the Federal minimum wage. I am proud to be \nan original co-sponsor of the legislation--upon which this amendment is \nbased--to raise the minimum wage 50 cents a year over the next two \nyears bringing it to $6.15 per hour by the year 2000.\n  For more than half a century, Congress has acted to guarantee minimum \nstandards of decency for working Americans. The object of a Federal \nminimum wage is to make work pay well enough to keep families out of \npoverty and off Government assistance. Any individual who works hard \nand plays by the rules should be assured a living standard for his or \nher family that can keep them out of poverty.\n  If nothing is done before the year 2000, the real value of the \nminimum wage will be just $4.82 in 1997 dollars--about what it was \nbefore Congress last acted to increase the minimum wage in 1996. The \nincrease being proposed today would bring the purchasing power of the \nminimum wage to $5.76. Now, no one asserts that raising the minimum \nwage will correct every economic injustice, but it will certainly make \na significant difference to those on the low end of the economic scale. \nWe have the opportunity to enact what is in my view a modest increase \nto help curb the erosion of the value of the minimum wage in terms of \nreal dollars, and it is an opportunity which we should not let pass us \nby.\n  Currently, full-time minimum wage worker earns just $10,712 --$2,600 \nbelow the poverty level for a family of three. A dollar increase in the \nminimum wage would provide a minimum wage worker with an additional \n$2,080 in income per year, helping to bring that family of three closer \nto the most basic standard of living. This extra income will help a \nfamily pay their bills and quite possibly even allow them to afford \nsomething above and beyond the bare essentials.\n  According to the Department of Labor, 74 percent of workers who will \nbenefit from an increase in the minimum wage are adults, 50 percent \nwork full time, 60 percent are women and 40 percent are the sole \nbreadwinners in their families. Mr. President, these are not the part-\ntime workers and suburban teenagers many opponents of the minimum wage \nincrease would have you believe.\n  After 30 years of spiralling deficits we are on the verge of \nbalancing the budget for the first time in 30 years - 4 years ahead of \nschedule. Today, the budget is virtually balanced, unemployment is at a \n25-year low, and inflation is at a 30-year low. However, despite this \nperiod of economic prosperity, the disparity between the very rich in \nthis country and the very poor continues to grow. According to the \nEconomic Policy Institute, projections for 1997 indicate that the share \nof the wealth held by the top 1 percent of households grew by almost 2 \npercent since 1989. Over that same period, the share of the wealth held \nby families in the middle fifth of the population fell by half a \npercent. In light of these estimates, consider that the Department of \nLabor predicts that 57 percent of the gains from an increase in the \nminimum wage will go to families in the bottom 40 percent of the income \nscale.\n  It is both reasonable and responsible for Congress to enact measures \nwhich provide a standard that allows decent, hard-working Americans a \nfloor upon which they can stand. We did it back in 1996 when we \napproved, by a bipartisan vote of 74-24, a 90 cent increase in the \nminimum wage bringing it to its current level of $5.15 per hour, and it \nis appropriate to do it here again. With the economy strong, we have a \nresponsibility to reinforce this basic economic floor for millions of \nAmerican workers\n\n[[Page S10693]]\n\nto prevent them from sliding further into the basement.\n  This is, and always has been, an issue of equity and fairness for \nworking men and women in this country and I strongly encourage my \ncolleagues to support this amendment and vote against the motion to \ntable.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nKennedy amendment and as a cosponsor of the minimum wage increase.\n  I cannot sit idle as I hear of those struggling to live on today's \nminimum wage. I thought, like many of you, that the minimum wage earner \nwas my daughter or one of her friends: a teenager flipping burgers or \ntaking food orders to earn some extra cash for new clothes or a movie.\n  That is the misperception though. The sad fact is that 71 percent of \nthose workers who benefited from the last increase were adults over the \nage of 20. This increase will benefit those that need it most--working \nfamilies at the bottom. A full-time, year-round minimum wage worker in \n1997 earned only $10,712, $2,000 less than the $12,803 needed to raise \na family of three out of poverty. Some 40 percent of minimum wage \nworkers are the sole income-earners in their families.\n  I am immensely troubled with the fact that 58 percent of those \nstruggling with a minimum wage are women. These millions of women, many \nof them single mothers, would benefit directly from this increase.\n  These single moms are trying. Trying to raise two kids on a below-\npoverty income. And how does Congress reward these single parents? By \nattacking Medicaid that would have paid for her son's asthma medicine. \nBy cutting her child care support that allows her work. By taking away \nfunding for nutrition programs that pay for her kids to eat at school \nor day care. By eliminating her Head Start Program that gives her kids \na chance at starting school ready to learn. By refusing to add one \ndollar to her hourly wage--a wage that pays for heat, clothing and \nfood.\n  Aren't these the individuals and families we are trying to keep \nemployed and off of federal support? Instead, this Congress has \ntargeted the low-income family through cut after cut and a resistance \nto move them above the poverty line.\n  This amendment does not eliminate jobs, it barely keeps people \nworking, who otherwise would be completely reliant on public support. \nToday's minimum wage is 18 percent below the 1979 level. Each year we \nwait means a loss of $2,000 to that single mother. To that low-income \nfamily, that would have meant more than seven months of groceries, four \nmonths of rent, a full year of health care costs, or nine months of \nutility bills.\n  I did not reach my decision to support the minimum wage easily. I \nhave listened carefully to the concerns of small-business owners from \nacross my state, who have highlighted the implications of this \nincrease. I don't want to see prices for the American consumer rise or \njobs eliminated. But I don't think an increase to the minimum wage will \nend employment in small business, either.\n  Now is the time to adjust that inequality and demonstrate a true \ncommitment to our working families. A slight increase in this wage \nprovides those who work hard and play by the rules an increased \nopportunity and a chance to succeed. If any of my colleagues oppose the \nminimum wage, I urge them to try living on $10,712 this year and then \nreconsider their vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support \nfor raising the minimum wage. In 1996, Congress helped millions of \nworking Americans by increasing the minimum wage by 90 cents over two \nyears. Passing that historic measure was a good first step. Now, it is \ntime for us to take another one.\n  I am proud to be cosponsoring the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1998, a \nbill that will help even more Americans take that next step. This much-\nneeded legislation would raise the hourly minimum wage to $6.15 over \nthe next two years. The first part of this bill would take effect on \nJanuary 1, 1999, and would raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to $5.65 \nper hour. Then, on January 1, 2000, the minimum wage would be raised to \n$6.15 per hour.\n  I support this minimum wage increase for many of the same reasons I \nsupported the last one. In 1995, I said that an increase in the minimum \nwage would help working Americans improve their standard of living. I \nsaid that it would help them move one step closer to self-sufficiency. \nAnd I said that it would give them the opportunity to practice self-\nhelp.\n  It has done all these things, and it has helped business and trade at \nthe same time. The results in my state alone tell the story. Since we \nincreased the minimum wage in 1996, employment in Maryland is up and \nunemployment is down. We've added 54,500 new jobs since September 1996, \nand the unemployment rate dropped to 4.7%. I'd say that's progress.\n  I believe we can expand upon the progress we've already made by \nincreasing the minimum wage again. A minimum wage increase would give a \nraise to more than 129,000 Marylanders and their families. It would \nenable Marylanders to improve their standard of living. It would move \nthem closer to self-sufficiency. And it would allow them to practice \nself-help.\n  An increase in the minimum wage equals an increase in the standard of \nliving for working Americans. This is especially important to me. Since \nI first came to Congress, my economic mission has always been a pretty \nsimple one: to help those who are in the middle class stay there or do \nbetter and to give those who are not in the middle class the chance to \nget there. I support this bill because it gets at the heart of my \nmission. I know that to some people, a $1.00 increase in the minimum \nwage over the course of two years may not seem like much at all. But \neven a small increase like this one will mean a whole lot to many \nothers.\n  An increase in the minimum wage will also help many Americans move \none step closer to economic self-sufficiency. We all know by now that \nminimum wage workers aren't just high school kids working part-time \njobs after school and on the weekends. In fact, two-thirds of minimum \nwage earners are adults, and nearly 60% are mothers, many with young \nkids to support.\n  We don't have to tell working moms who are struggling to make ends \nmeet what an extra $1.00 an hour means. An extra $1.00 an hour means \nmore groceries in the refrigerator. An extra $1.00 an hour means that \nthe mortgage or the rent gets paid. An extra $1.00 an hour means a full \ntank of gas in the car. And, most importantly, an extra $1.00 an hour \ncan mean more time to spend with their families. That single dollar \ngoes a long way for those moms.\n  Finally, an increase in the minimum wage will give people the \nopportunity to practice self-help. For too long now, Americans, \nincluding those working moms, have been working longer and harder only \nto see their paychecks get smaller and smaller. This cycle has got to \nstop. Those Americans who are working for minimum wage are not asking \nfor handouts. They're asking for fair pay for hard work.\n  Right now, even after the previous minimum wage increase, a mother \nwho works full-time--that's 40 hours per week and 52 weeks a year--\nearns only about $10,700 a year. That is $2,600 below the poverty level \nfor a family of three. I don't think that someone who shows up everyday \nand works hard should be condemned to a life in poverty. A fair day's \nwork should mean a fair day's pay.\n  Does that $10,700 salary reward a working mom's hard work? No. Does \nthat salary give her an incentive to stay off welfare? No. Does that \nsalary give her the time to walk her kids to school, help them with \ntheir homework, or even read to them at night? Absolutely not. In fact, \nthat $10,700 salary barely allows her to clothe them, put a roof over \ntheir heads, or put food on the table. No mom should have to make the \nchoice between paying the heating bill or buying her child new school \nshoes. Forcing working moms to make choices like that is wrong.\n  That same mom who works full-time, plays by the rules, and does \neverything else we ask of her ought to be able to get ahead. I don't \nthink that's asking too much. Hard-working minimum wage workers are \njust like everyone else--they want to climb up the American economic \nladder. Too often, however, that ladder looks too tall to climb. Too \noften, the rungs on that ladder are too far apart from each other.\n\n[[Page S10694]]\n\n Too often they are just a little bit out of reach. As representatives \nof those workers, we can help them climb that ladder. We can and should \ngive them that little push they need to grasp the next rung. This bill \ngives them that little boost, and that is why it has my full support.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to speak \nabout a few of the compelling reasons that the Senate should pass the \namendment to increase the minimum wage by $1.00 per hour by the year \n2000.\n  I am a cosponsor of this legislation because I believe that by \nraising the minimum wage now, we can accomplish a number of critical \nobjectives. We can improve the quality of life for millions of \nAmericans, expand the market for all of the goods and services that the \nworkers of our nation produce, increase the amount of taxable income in \nthe country, reduce expenditures for public assistance, close the ever-\nincreasing gap between working people and wealthy individuals, and--\ncertainly not least--honor the American tradition of rewarding hard \nwork and perseverance.\n  The current minimum wage is not a living wage for the millions of \nAmericans who try to support themselves and their families on $5.15 an \nhour. Today, 6.2 million Americans earn the minimum wage. In my state \nalone, 5.7 percent of the workforce--making up roughly 296,000 people--\nearns that salary. This means that an Illinoisan, working 40 hours a \nweek, 52 weeks a year, earns only $10,712 per year. That's about $2,600 \nbelow the poverty line for a family of three and over $5,700 below the \npoverty line for a family of four. And make no mistake about it--this \nis an issue that directly affects families. As much as opponents of \nthis amendment would like us to believe that the minimum wage primarily \naffects teenagers working at their first jobs, the actual fact is that \nthree-fourths of those earning the minimum wage are adults, many trying \nto support families. And with respect to the fact that one-fourth of \nthose who will be assisted by this legislation are teenagers, we should \nbear in mind that many teenage minimum-wage workers contribute the \nmoney they earn (or at least a portion of it) to their families' total \nincome.\n  A $1.00 increase in the minimum wage would provide a full-time worker \nearning the minimum wage with a little over $2,000 a year in additional \nincome. That money could pay for more than seven months of groceries, \nmore than four months of rent or mortgage bills, over a full year of \nhealth care, or more than nine months of utility bills for a family \nliving on the minimum wage. That $2,000 would make a world of \ndifference to such a family.\n  Moreover, a family that can pay for rent, groceries, or health care \nis putting money back into the economy. That family is buying goods and \nservices produced by other workers. It is also earning taxable income \nand reducing the amount government has to spend on public assistance. \nAn increase in the minimum wage helps people to contribute to, rather \nthan burden, the nation's economy. And it wouldn't just be minimum wage \nworkers who would be able to make a greater contribution to the \neconomy. Currently, there are almost six million Americans who earn \nbetween $5.16 and $6.14 per hour who would also receive a pay raise if \nthis amendment were to become law. All 12 million Americans who stand \nto benefit from this legislation--not just the 6.2 million earning the \nminimum wage--must be taken into account when we consider the fact that \nadopting this amendment would increase the pool of consumers and \nincrease taxable earnings.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to dispel a myth that many opponents \nof increasing the minimum wage have put forward over the years: that \npaying a living wage means losing jobs. Around the time that we debated \nraising the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 per hour, a group of \nrespected economists, including three Nobel Prize winners, concluded \nthat such an increase would have positive effects on the labor market, \nworkers, and the economy. In 1996 we went ahead and raised the minimum \nwage to $5.15 per hour and what happened? Bureau of Labor Statistics \ndata show that employment increased. Four million new jobs have been \ncreated since that time. Unemployment has hovered around its lowest \nrate in a generation. This will not surprise anyone familiar with the \nscholarly literature on this issue. The Economic Policy Institute \nstudied the effect of the last minimum wage increase on the economy and \nfound that it had no negative impact on jobs or inflation. A recent \nstudy by economists at Berkeley and Princeton Universities showed that \nthe type of moderate increases in the minimum wage that we are debating \ntoday do not cost jobs. It should be noted that their research included \nthe increase we enacted two years ago.\n  Some have argued that small businesses would be hurt by Senator \nKennedy's amendment. The reality is that many such businesses will \nsuffer if we do not raise the minimum wage. Small businesses which \nright now pay a living wage to their employees are at a competitive \ndisadvantage with those that try to cut costs by slashing wages. This \ncreates a race to the bottom with the most profits going to companies \npaying the lowest wages. Adopting this amendment will ensure that all \nbusinesses will be able to afford to pay a decent wage to their \nworkers.\n  I would like to make a point regarding how this amendment would \naffect single working women. Twenty percent of those earning the \nminimum wage are female heads of households. These are women who are \ntaking responsibility for themselves and their children. They are doing \nprecisely what we have told them we expect them to do: get a job and go \nto work every day. We have told them that AFDC is a thing of the past, \nthat they cannot rely on the government to take care of their families. \nI am not seeking to re-open the welfare reform debate. But I do want to \nknow how we can send these women that very clear message and then fail \nto provide a minimum wage that allows them to support their families at \na level above the poverty line? The fact that a single mother working \nfull-time cannot bring her family out of poverty represents a clear \npolicy failure on our part. With this legislation, we have the \nopportunity to take a step towards addressing it.\n\n  Right now, our economy is strong. The unemployment rate is low and \nnew jobs are being created in record numbers. This economic strength, \nhowever, has not translated into increased wages for many of those on \nthe lower rungs of the economic ladder. In fact, the income disparity \nbetween the richest and the poorest is increasing. Consider, for \nexample, what has happened in my state. Over the last 20 years, the \nincome disparity between the richest and poorest Illinoisans has \nincreased by over 46 percent. During that time, the average income of \nthe poorest twenty percent of families in Illinois fell by $1,460 to \n$10,000. At the same time, the average income of the richest twenty \npercent increased by over $25,000. An increase in the minimum wage will \nhelp close that gap.\n  I conclude by reminding my colleagues that at the heart of the \nAmerican Dream lies the belief that hard work is the foundation of \nsuccess. Fortunately, for most people in this country, that remains a \nvalid notion. But it is not for those who earn the minimum wage. We \nmust guarantee that those attempting to provide for themselves and \ntheir families by earning the minimum wage receive a living wage. Here \nin Washington, we talk a great deal about family values and the \nAmerican Dream. There's nothing wrong with that as long as we stand up \nfor those ideals ourselves when given the opportunity. This amendment \nrepresents just such an opportunity and I strongly urge my colleagues \nto vote for it.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport efforts to increase the federal minimum wage by passing the \nFair Minimum Wage Act of 1998. This important legislation will provide \nAmerican laborers with a 50 cent increase to the minimum wage on \nJanuary 1, 1999, and a second increase on January 1, 2000. This modest \nincrease, which would raise the minimum wage to $6.15 per hour, will \nhelp 12 million lower income Americans.\n  Our country's economy is growing. It's economic vitality and the \nsuccess of welfare reform have resulted in better news and a better \nlife for working people. Or have they?\n  The truth is, even though the economy is on an up-swing, wages are \nstagnant and people are still living in poverty. In fact, over half a \nmillion people\n\n[[Page S10695]]\n\nlive in poverty in our own state of Wisconsin.\n  Despite successes in the welfare to work initiative, last year, a US \nConference of Mayors study indicated that eighty-six percent of cities \nreported an increased demand for emergency food assistance. Thirty-\neight percent of those people seeking food at soup kitchens and \nshelters were employed. This is an increase of fifteen percent since \n1994. It is evident that, in many cases, minimum wage workers can not \nafford to feed themselves or their families.\n  Mr. President, no hard working American should have to worry about \naffording groceries, shoes for their kids, or medicines. The people \nwhom the bill will help are not people who spend their money \nfrivolously, these are the families who scrimp and save to provide \ntheir children with the necessities of life: shelter, food, clothes and \nan education.\n  In a recent study, The State of Working Wisconsin--1998, by the \nCenter on Wisconsin Strategy, we find some troubling news regarding \nwages. Today, the Wisconsin median hourly wage is still 8.4% below its \n1979 level. Since 1979, Wisconsin's median wage declined 50% faster \nthan the 5.3 percent national decline over the same period. These \nnumbers are, sadly, not Wisconsin specific. This is the situation all \nover the country.\n  I urge my colleagues to bring some respect and dignity to the federal \nminimum wage. America's labor force deserves a chance to be successful \nand we need to give them the tools. I urge them to support the Fair \nMinimum Wage Act of 1998. Its a vote in support of every full time \nworker hoping to make ends meet.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the minimum wage is about fairness. The \nminimum wage should be a fair wage that rewards people for an honest \nday's work.\n  This is the right time to provide fairness by increasing the minimum \nwage. Our budget is balanced and the economy remains fundamentally \nstrong. We've created new jobs at an historically high pace of 250,000 \nper month. The inflation rate has averaged just 2.5 percent since \n1993--the lowest rate since the Kennedy Administration--and the \nunemployment rate has fallen from over 7 percent in 1992 to 4.5 percent \nfor the past two months.\n  However, as the economy rolls along, it is leaving behind working \nfamilies. The benefits of this strong economy are not being enjoyed by \nlower wage workers.\n  In fact, according to a U.S. Conference of Mayors study, 38 percent \nof people seeking emergency food aid in 1996 held jobs--up from 23 \npercent in 1994. Low-paying jobs are the most-frequently cited cause of \nhunger today according to this survey.\n  People who are willing to work should not have to turn to a soup \nkitchen in order to feed their families. There is no better time than \nnow to address the problem of fair wages in this country.\n  A full time minimum wage worker now earns just $10,712 per year--\n$2,600 below the poverty level for a family of three. To have the same \npurchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum wage today would have to \nbe $7.33 an hour instead of $5.15.\n  Even where the current minimum wage is a little higher in my state--\n$5.75. The purchasing power of the wage is over $2.00 an hour lower \nthan the purchasing power of the minimum wage in 1968. After adjusting \nfor inflation, today's $5.75 minimum buys 26 percent less than it did \nin 1968.\n  Nationwide, 4.8 million families depend on the minimum wage for their \nsole source of income. Of the workers that would benefit from an \nincrease, 60 percent are women--over 7 million women, and 57 percent \nare families in the bottom 40 percent of the income scale.\n  In my state alone, almost 10 percent of the workforce would benefit \nfrom an increase in the minimum wage--nearly 1.2 million Californians \nand their families.\n  Opponents of a minimum wage increase argue that minimum wage \nincreases result in massive job losses. I believe--and the data prove--\nthey are wrong.\n  The National Restaurant Association claims a study found that over \n146,000 restaurant jobs were lost as a result of the 1996-97 minimum \nwage increases. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics say that as of \nApril 1998, 187,000 new restaurant jobs were created since the minimum \nwage increases in 1996.\n  The retail industry has many minimum wage jobs in California. Since \nSeptember 1996, 97,000 retail jobs have been added in California.\n  The job numbers tell the story. We have increased the minimum wage to \nits current level of $5.15 per hour, yet the number of unemployed \nAmericans has dropped consistently over the past six years. Since 1992, \n3 million less Americans are jobless. In fact, according to the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics, 16.3 million jobs have been created since January \n1993.\n  Clearly this is an issue of fairness. Everyone in this country \ndeserves an honest, fair wage for a hard day's work. No one who is \nwilling to work should have to take their children to a soup kitchen at \nnight in order to feed them.\n  Senator Kennedy's amendment would increase the minimum wage in two \nincrements of 50 cents each--to $5.65 on January 1st, 1999 and to $6.15 \non January 1st, 2000. After the first increase, a minimum wage earner \nwould make about $11,700 annually. And after the second increase, a \nminimum wage worker would earn about $12,700 each year--still $600 \nbelow the poverty level.\n  Unemployment is at historically low levels. Job creation has boomed \nin the past six years. There is no better time to address this problem. \nThe time for a modest increase in the minimum wage is now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10692-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10695-S10700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3540\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 2:15 \np.m. having arrived, there will now be 5 minutes for debate, equally \ndivided, prior to a vote relative to the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes 15 seconds.\n  At long last, the Senate is about to vote on raising the minimum \nwage. The Nation has enjoyed extraordinary prosperity in recent years. \nUnemployment and inflation are at their lowest levels in a generation. \nInterest rates are low, and the economy is strong and growing. But 12 \nmillion hard-working Americans are left out and left behind. They are \nminimum wage workers, and for them, the current prosperity is someone \nelse's boom. Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, minimum \nwage workers earn just $10,700 a year, $2,900 below the poverty level \nfor a family of three.\n  A full day's work should mean a fair day's pay. But for these 12 \nmillion Americans, it does not. These hard-pressed Americans can barely \nmake ends meet every month. Too often they are forced to choose between \npaying the light bill or the phone bill or the heating bill. An \nunexpected illness or family crisis is enough to push them over the \nedge.\n  Their plight is shocking and unacceptable. If this country values \nwork as we say we do, we must be willing to pay these workers a decent \nwage. The wealthiest nation on Earth can afford to do better for these \nhard-working citizens, and today we have the opportunity to do so. We \ncan raise the minimum wage.\n  Giving workers another 50 cents an hour may not sound like much, but \nit can make all the difference for these hard-working Americans. It can \nhelp buy groceries or pay the rent or defray the costs of job training \ncourses at the local community college.\n  The minimum wage is a women's issue. It is a children's issue. It is \na civil rights issue. It is a labor issue. It is a family issue. Above \nall, it is a fairness issue and a dignity issue. Raising the minimum \nwage is a matter of fundamental fairness and simple justice.\n  In a few moments, the Senate will have the opportunity to do more \nthan pay lip service to these basic principles. If we believe in these \nideals, we will vote to raise the minimum wage. No one who works for a \nliving should have to live in poverty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S10696]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we know that only about 22 percent of the \nAmerican people who are on minimum wage are people who have households \nto support. Almost every job on minimum wage is given to somebody who \nliterally needs a job, would not otherwise have that opportunity and \nprobably would have his or her job chances diminished if the minimum \nwage is increased. We found that to be the case year after year after \nyear.\n\n  You cannot mandate increased labor costs without adverse impacts. \nWhat are those impacts?\n  Decreased employment opportunities, particularly for teenagers, and \nothers, who are in the worst condition, with few skills and employment \nbarriers. In large part, these reductions will be fewer jobs created, \nthe elimination of certain services, such as bagging groceries or \nhaving them loaded in your car, or having services performed less \nfrequently.\n  Higher prices for goods and services. The minimum wage is an \nineffective antipoverty policy. Why? Because three-quarters of those \nearning the minimum wage are not heads of households or do not live in \npoor families--three-quarters of them. Most of these jobs are taken by \npeople who are not from the poorest of the poor. Since the minimum wage \nincrease cannot be targeted only to those who need it, the likelihood \nis that those with more experience, maturity, or skills will get or \nretain entry-level jobs and those who need a first-chance job the most \nare going to lose out.\n  Also, higher minimum wages stifle entry-level training opportunities. \nWorkers have typically ``paid for'' their training and introductory \nwork experience by working at entry-level wages. Mandating a higher \nminimum wage makes entry-level opportunities less available and our \nworkforce less prepared for greater skills and opportunities down the \nline.\n  It is a myth that workers get ``stuck'' at minimum wages. Within a \nyear, the average minimum wage earners get a 20 percent increase or \neven higher wage increase based on his or her greater skill level and \nexperience.\n  Higher wages act as an incentive for some youth to leave school to \ntake jobs.\n  So what is worse is that this adverse impact is for nothing. Those \nvery individuals who need entry-level jobs the most are the ones most \nlikely to be displaced by the increased competition for them. Frankly, \nhiking the minimum wage is not the only way to assist working Americans \nand those struggling to make ends meet. Let's work on some of these \nideas.\n  Personally, I would like to raise people's paychecks by cutting their \ntaxes. That would increase their paychecks without the risk that they \nmight lose their jobs. And I think we can work together on education. \nWe passed the A+ education bill. Let's tackle illiteracy, and let's do \nit this way rather than through this really untried procedure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair announces all time has been used on \nthe opponents' side, but the Senator from Massachusetts has 18 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator would like to use the remainder of his time, \nI will use leader time to conclude debate and move to table the \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back and ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I intend to move to table the amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has that right and may \nmove to table, if he so wishes, after the statement.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before I do that, I want to yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume out of leader time. I will be very brief.\n  Mr. President, when I became majority leader 2 and a half years ago, \nthis issue was pending before the Senate and it had caused a lot of \nproblems and some difficulties in trying to decide how to deal with it. \nAfter a period of weeks and months, we came to the conclusion that we \ndid need a minimum wage increase at that point, but with a lot of small \nbusiness tax provisions being included. And they helped to mitigate the \neffect on small business men and women and the jobs they create in \nparticular.\n  But we had a minimum wage increase the year before last. We had a \nminimum wage increase last year. This increase, in my opinion, would be \nbad for the economy, bad for business, and bad for job creation.\n  I would like to just cite you two examples to think about. I have a \nson, first of all, who is a small businessman. And he employs people at \nthe entry level, people who do not have high school educations--unwed \nmothers, people who are desperate to get a start, to get a job. And he \ngives them that opportunity. A lot of them go on to wind up being \nsupervisors and owners of their own companies and create jobs. They \nlive the American dream.\n  But I had occasion to hear comments from one lady--I believe she was \nfrom Marietta, GA--named Harriet Cane. She owns a Sweet Life \nRestaurant, which she describes as a very small dessert and luncheon \ncafe. It seats 45 people. As a result of the last increase in the \nminimum wage, she reduced her staff from 16 to 10, by attrition \nprimarily, raised prices modestly, and had to increase her own hours on \nthe job to 16 a day. And here is her exact quote:\n\n       I will tell you this, that if the next increase does go \n     through, what will happen to my store. Bottom line: my doors \n     will close. I've talked with my CPA. We've tried to be \n     creative. We've tried to find a way to handle the increase in \n     payroll that it would represent. As a little shop, I have no \n     option. I just want the world and the communities to \n     understand that this is a reality and not just rhetoric.\n\n  Also, a very impressive statement was given on that occasion when I \nheard Harriet Cane by a gentleman from Texas named Jose Cuevas. Jose \nCuevas came with no prepared statement, but he spoke from the heart. He \nand his wife, he said, have lived the American dream. He is a Hispanic \nrestaurant owner in south Texas who is approximately 44 years old. And \nhe and his wife, at the ages of 22 and 20, saved money and worked \nreally hard so they could buy their first store. This is what he had to \nsay:\n\n       It became a dream. We now have four locations. We have $2.6 \n     million worth of sales. We have seen a lot of people come \n     through our door, and a lot of good people. They have all \n     left something. They have all gone on to better things. I \n     think of how this minimum wage will affect other people's \n     dreams of owning their own companies, their own restaurants. \n     I was fortunate enough that I and my wife worked side by side \n     with two other employees until we earned a little bit more \n     and could hire extra people. But at $6 or even $5.50 an hour, \n     it will make it almost impossible. Our last raise in the \n     minimum wage cost us $60,000 in labor costs.\n\n  In conclusion he said,\n\n       So I urge you to continue to fight the battle for us, \n     because I believe it's true and right. America is built on \n     small business owners, just like all of us that go out every \n     day, work hard, and create jobs so that others could live the \n     American dream like we have.\n\n  Mr. President, I think this is the wrong action at the wrong time. \nThe people who will be hurt the most are the people that well-\nintentioned Senators really want to help, because they will wind up not \ngetting an increase in the minimum wage, they will wind up with no job.\n  I urge the Senate to vote to table this amendment. I now move to \ntable the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment No. 3540 offered by the Senator from \nMassachusetts. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the original version of S. 1301 would \nhave made a debtor's attorney responsible for the panel trustee's costs \nand fees if the attorney lost a 707(b) motion brought by the trustee--\nnot if the filing was made in bad faith, not if the filing was \nfrivolous, but simply if he or she lost the motion.\n  Fortunately, an amendment was accepted at the Judiciary Committee \nmarkup which would make the debtor's attorney liable only if he or she \nwas ``not substantially justified'' in filing the petition. Even this \nstandard, however, is untenable.\n  The opponents of the Feingold-Specter amendment argue that debtors \nattorneys are notoriously bad actors who abuse the bankruptcy system. \nNo credible evidence, however--beyond an unsubstantiated story here and \nan unsubstantiated story there--has been offered to support the \nproposition that debtors attorneys are more likely to act in bad faith \nthan any other type of attorney.\n  Why then would we allow this bill to contain a provision which \napplies a stricter standard of conduct to consumer debtors' attorneys \nthan to any other type of attorney--a provision which is, as pridefully \nnoted by the opponents of my amendment, designed to punish debtors' \nattorneys?\n  I have heard from bankruptcy judges in my home State of Wisconsin and \nthey strongly object to the premise that debtors' attorneys are by any \nmeasure less admirable or honest than other types of attorneys. \nMoreover, they believe that this provision of the bill is fundamentally \nwrong and endangers debtors' access to the system.\n  The conduct of consumer debtors' attorneys should meet the standards \nset for all attorneys in Federal Civil Rule of Procedure 11, which is \nincorporated in Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedures 9011.\n  Every other fee-shifting provision in Federal law which holds the \nattorney liable require affirmative wrongdoing by the attorney. With or \nwithout my amendment--indeed, with or without this bill--if a debtor's \nattorney brings a ``frivolous'' or ``improper'' Chapter 7 filing--the \ncourt can order sanctions against that attorney.\n  Let me be clear--under current law, debtors' attorneys can already be \nfined if they act in bad faith. There is simply no legitimate basis for \na different and more punitive standard that only applies to debtors' \nattorneys in bankruptcy proceedings.\n  Should not the purpose of this bill be to rid the bankruptcy system \nof abuse, not to punish a particular type of attorney? The basic \npremise of this bill--the fundamental tool it uses to weed out abuse--\nis the 707(b) motion. That is, the motion which is filed by the panel \ntrustee when she feels that the debtor is abusing the system.\n  To supposedly encourage a trustee to file such a motion, this bill \nwould award her costs and fees only when the debtor's attorney's \nactions were not substantially justified. Under the Feingold-Specter \namendment, the trustee would be rewarded for her efforts whenever she \nwins a 707(b) motion.\n  Let me ask you--if you were a panel trustee charged with the duty of \nprotecting the integrity of the bankruptcy system and your primary tool \nfor doing so was the 707(b) motion, would you be more likely to file \nsuch a motion when you got paid whenever you won such a motion or only \nwhen the debtor's attorney was demonstrated to have been not \nsubstantially justified?\n  Before you answer, let me ask you one more question. What if, before \nyou could get paid--as under the current bill--you, a panel trustee--\nnot the court or an independent third party--also had to incur the \nadditional time and cost of bringing and arguing another motion to \nprove that the debtor's attorney was not substantially justified?\n  The answer to these questions is clear. If you were a panel trustee \nyou would have a stronger incentive to bring a 707(b) motion--that is, \na stronger incentive to rid the bankruptcy system of abuse--under the \nFeingold-Specter amendment than you would under the current language of \nthe bill.\n  So, the Feingold-Specter amendment seeks to maintain the incentive \nfor trustees while preserving a debtor's access to justice and \nrepresentation. It does so by making the trustee's fees and costs an \nadministrative expense under Section 503(b) if the trustee is \nsuccessful in her 707(b) motion to convert the case into Chapter 13. If \nthe court dismisses the Chapter 7 filing, the debtor would be required \nto pay the trustee's cost and fees.\n  Your vote on the Feingold-Specter amendment comes down to this--if \nyou want to muddle the system with needless additional hearings and to \nstrike a mean-spirited, unfounded blow against debtors attorneys, vote \nagainst our amendment; if on the other hand, you want to rid the \nbankruptcy system of abuse in the most equitable and efficient manner, \nthen vote for our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa controls 5 minutes in \nopposition to the amendment. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume at this point.\n  The bill that is before us, and it is reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee, penalizes lawyer misconduct. I think these penalties are \nvery fair. They are very narrowly focused. Of course, penalties are \nvery necessary. Many lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy view \nbankruptcy as an opportunity to make big money for themselves. This \nprofit motive causes bankruptcy lawyers to promote bankruptcy as the \nonly option, even when a financially troubled client might obviously \nhave the ability to repay some debt.\n  This profit motive creates a real conflict of interest where \nbankruptcy lawyers push people into bankruptcy who do not belong there, \nand they do it because they get paid up front. I think that any \nreasonable person would say that lawyers who file bankruptcy cases \nwhich are not substantially justified ought to be required to help \ndefray the costs of their frivolous cases. That is all my bill does. \nSenator Feingold's amendment would gut this reasonable effort to \ncontrol the bankruptcy bar, which is seriously out of control.\n\n[[Page S10698]]\n\n  The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act contains reasonable lawyer \nmisconduct penalties which will cause lawyers to think twice before \nthey, willy-nilly, cart somebody into chapter 7 and pocket a nice \nprofit in the process. Some bankruptcy lawyers, in their rush to turn a \nprofit, operate what are known as bankruptcy mills--nothing more than a \nprocessing center that happens to be for bankruptcy. There is little or \nno investigation done as to whether an individual actually needs \nbankruptcy protection or whether or not a person is able, at least \npartially, to repay their debts.\n  Recently, one of these bankruptcy attorneys from Texas was sanctioned \nby a bankruptcy court. The practices of the bankruptcy mills are so \ndeceptive and so sleazy that last year the Federal Trade Commission \nwent so far as to issue a consumer alert, warning consumers of \nmisleading ads that promise debt consolidation. So I think there is a \nwidespread recognition that bankruptcy lawyers are preying on \nunsophisticated consumers.\n  Yesterday I spoke about the bankruptcy lawyer who had written a book. \nI had this chart up. I spoke about this bankruptcy lawyer who had \nwritten this book entitled, ``Discharging Marital Obligations in \nBankruptcy.'' This author, a bankruptcy lawyer, actually said that he \nis going to counsel you on how to avoid your obligations to pay defense \ncosts, alimony, and child support. So it is all about how high-income \npeople can get out of paying child support and alimony.\n  I think it is outrageous that bankruptcy lawyers are helping \ndeadbeats cheat divorced spouses out of alimony and children out of \nchild support, so that is why we want to vote this amendment down. I \nthink my colleague, Senator Kyl, wanted time.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is currently 1 minute 20 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  The key point here is to simply hold the attorney responsible for the \ncosts of a hearing. That is all we are talking about. It is either \ngoing to be the attorney or it is going to be the people who are owed \nmoney in a bankruptcy, or even the debtor, to be responsible for the \ncosts of that hearing in the event the attorney has made a wrong filing \nhere, a filing that was not substantially justified. So, if the \nattorney can establish that what he did was substantially justified in \nputting his client into chapter 13 bankruptcy as opposed to chapter 7, \nthen he has no responsibility here and would have no liability for the \ncosts of the hearing. But if it turns out that he was not substantially \njustified in doing that, then this would permit the court to assess the \ncost of bringing the motion and having the hearing against that lawyer. \nThat is all we are talking about here.\n  In view of the fact that the National Bankruptcy Commission has been \nvery concerned about these bankruptcy mills, this is a legitimate \nconcern and a way to avoid this kind of mistake from occurring. It puts \nthe responsibility where the responsibility ought to lie. I support the \nposition of the Senator from Iowa in urging opposition to the Feingold \namendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to table the Feingold amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3565\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 5 \nminutes equally divided on Feingold amendment numbered 3565.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Ironically, bankruptcy is the only Federal civil \nproceeding in which a poor person cannot file in forma pauperis.\n  What this means, in any other Federal civil proceeding you can file a \ncase without paying filing fees if the court determines you are unable \nto afford the fee; but in bankruptcy, you either pay the filing fee or \nare denied access to the system. That is right, the bankruptcy system--\nwhich is by definition designed to assist those who have fallen on hard \ntimes--is unavailable to the poorest of the poor.\n  This prohibition against debtors filing in forma pauperis is a clear \nobstacle to their efforts to gain access to justice. The current fee is \n$175; $175 is roughly the weekly take-home pay of an employee working a \n40-hour week at the minimum wage.\n  I think it is unrealistic and unreasonable to expect an indigent in \nthis case to raise such a fee simply to enter the system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Given the fact that I have such high regard on behalf \nof the leader of this bill on our side, Senator Durbin, I yield the \nremaining time to Senator Durbin who will further speak in favor of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. I rise \nin support of this amendment. When you have people who are so dirt poor \nthat they can't come up with the $175 filing fee, we usually say in \ncivil actions that we are going to waive the fee in court. For some \nreason, that waiver is not in the law in bankruptcy. It certainly \nshould be. People wouldn't be coming to the bankruptcy court were they \nnot in dire straits.\n  I support the Senator from Wisconsin because this has been tried \nsuccessfully. It does not result in a mad dash to the courthouse by \npeople who otherwise would not file for bankruptcy.\n  Now, the milk of human kindness curdled a few moments ago on the \nSenate floor when it came to bankruptcy lawyers, and the poor folks \ndidn't do too well a few minutes ago when it came to minimum wage. \nPlease stop and think about this for a minute. The poorest of the poor, \ncoming to bankruptcy court trying to turn their lives around, want the \nsame kind of treatment people get in all other civil suits. That is not \nunreasonable.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield all the time on this side to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this Feingold amendment is directly \ncontrary to the purpose of the bill that Senator Grassley has worked so \nhard for. It requires no fee for filing under chapter 7, where the \ndebtor wipes out all his debts. However, the amendment does require a \nfee under chapter 13, where the debtor pays back a portion of his debt. \nTherefore, it would encourage filings under chapter 7, when we\n\n[[Page S10699]]\n\nbelieve more people should file under chapter 13.\n  This Congress has considered this issue before and rejected it. The \nNational Bankruptcy Commission just completed a long study of \nbankruptcy and did not call for the elimination of this fee. The United \nStates Supreme Court in 1973 squarely held that it is constitutional. \nThe bankruptcy system should discourage frivolous filings.\n  Furthermore, this amendment provides no standard for the judge to \ndecide who in bankruptcy ought to pay and who ought not to pay. And, in \naddition to that, it would clog the courts with multiple hearings \nregarding who should pay the $160 filing fee. In addition, bankruptcy \nlaw currently allows filing fees to be paid in four installments. When \na person files bankruptcy, they are able to stop paying all of their \ndebt. Debtors are able to pay the filing fee because all other \nobligations have been tolled under the automatic stay.\n  This amendment will result in additional court hearings that distract \nthe bankruptcy court from its primary purpose. This practice will be \nencourage filings under chapter 7 when filing under chapter 13 would be \nmore appropriate. People who can pay a portion of their debt ought to \nbe accountable for that amount.\n  I believe that this amendment will cost millions. In fact, based on \nthe number of filings last year, we could be talking about $100 million \nin costs.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The question is on agreeing \nto amendment No. 3565.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to table the Feingold amendment \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be \nvitiated on the underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The question now occurs on agreeing to amendment No. 3565.\n  The amendment (No. 3565) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3610\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes for debate, equally divided, on the Reed amendment. The Senator \nfrom Rhode Island is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, the underlying legislation that we are considering \ntoday will allow a creditor to request a bankruptcy judge to move a \npetition in bankruptcy from chapter 7 to chapter 13. As we all realize, \nin chapter 7, a debtor may fully discharge his debts, and in chapter \n13, there is an obligation to partially pay one's debts.\n  The focus of this legislation is on the debtor. There are two \nconditions which the creditor must show: The creditor must show either \nthe individual debtor has at least enough assets to pay 30 percent of \nthe debts or that the debtor has acted in bad faith in applying for \nchapter 7 liquidation.\n  I believe this focus exclusively on the debtor misses half of the \nequation. The other important half of the equation is the behavior of \nthe creditor. My amendment explicitly requires the bankruptcy judge to \nconsider the behavior of the creditor, whether that creditor acted in \ngood faith in the extension of credit.\n  We all know there has been a significant increase in bankruptcy \nfilings, but what we frequently overlook is the fact that there has \nbeen an extraordinary increase in credit extension. In 1986 through \n1996, that 10-year period, filings increased by 122 percent, but \nrevolving consumer credit increased 238 percent in that same period. As \na result, we have had a situation where much of this credit extension \nhas been done with very poor underwriting standards, a situation in \nwhich the companies themselves might very well anticipate that the \ndebtor could not handle the debt.\n  Those companies that act recklessly and unscrupulously should not \nhave the option to request that a debtor be thrown into chapter 13 from \nchapter 7. As a result, I believe it is incumbent upon the bankruptcy \njudge to look explicitly at the issue of the good faith of the \ncreditor.\n  This is not just a question of the volume of credit that has been \nextended; this is the proliferation of solicitations. Each year, 2 \nbillion credit solicitations are made in this country, many of them \nwithout any concern of the ability of the debtor ultimately to pay. We \ndon't need a test to establish this fact. We just have to sit home on a \nSaturday and at about 10 o'clock, you get the first call from a credit \ncard company. Then at 10:30, you get the second call. At 11, the mail \ncomes and you get two or three solicitations, and it goes all the way \nthrough the evening.\n  What I want to see, and what the amendment requires, is if there is a \nconsideration to move a debtor from chapter 7 to chapter 13, the judge \nshould be able to apply a good-faith standard when reviewing the \nactivities of the creditor. This establishes balance, this establishes \na strong presumption that both sides must be looked at in terms of this \nrather unique and novel approach to the bankruptcy code. It is well \nwithin the expertise of the banking judge to make this determination.\n\n  I simply conclude by saying that this amendment has the strong \nsupport of the Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union. This \nis an opportunity to vote with consumers with regard to this \nlegislation.\n  I now retain the remainder of my time but also ask at this time for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I oppose the amendment. Under the provision, in any 707(b) \ncase brought by a creditor, the court would consider whether the \ncreditor had used good faith in the extension of credit. This \ndetermination necessarily would involve looking at underwriting \ndecisions.\n\n[[Page S10700]]\n\n  The bankruptcy court shall not be asked to interfere in the \ncomplicated process of making credit underwriting decisions. This is \nparticularly true when current underwriting practices are quite \nsuccessful, with an average of 95 to 97 percent of consumer credit \nextended today repaid on time.\n  Mr. President, this amendment permits new uncontrolled and virtually \nunlimited inquiries into creditor conduct. It encourages complicated \nand involved discovery and burdensome court proceedings. It introduces \nunwarranted defenses to strong enforcement of the needs-based \nprovisions of S. 1301, this bill.\n  The amendment permits a debtor to avoid repaying all his creditors by \nattacking the good faith of any creditor who brings a motion to enforce \nthe needs-based provisions. And the amendment has no standard for what \nis good faith. So this is a killer amendment.\n  Moreover, S. 1301 already contains numerous provisions to make sure \ncreditors are acting appropriately. As I have noted in my previous \nremarks, this is a well balanced bill that is a combination of months \nand months of deliberations and cooperation between Senators Grassley \nand Durbin and other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. They, \nalong with other members of the Judiciary Committee, have done a fine \njob in ensuring that this bill is a fair bill. This balanced and \nbroadly supported legislation not only curbs abuses of the bankruptcy \nsystem but also provides unprecedented consumer protections.\n  Let me begin by saying being a creditor and winding up in bankruptcy \ncourt to collect unpaid bills is not a desirable situation for any \ncreditor. Creditors who deal with debtors in bankruptcy, even in the \nbest of circumstances, are likely to recover only pennies on every \ndollar they are owed.\n  In any event, S. 1301 already contains nine provisions with rather \nsevere penalties to creditors for improper behavior. We have given due \nconsideration to these concerns.\n  First, if a creditor brings a motion to dismiss a chapter 7 case and \nfails, the debtor gets attorney's fees and costs if the creditor was \nnot substantially justified or if the creditor filed the motion in an \neffort to coerce the debtor.\n  Second, if a creditor unreasonably refuses a debtor's offer to work \nout a repayment schedule, the creditor is barred from asserting any \nclaim of nondischargeability or any claim of denial of discharge.\n  Third, if a creditor willfully violates the automatic stay, the \ncreditor pays the debtor's attorney's fees, actual damages, and \npunitive damages, if appropriate. We have really gone a long way here.\n  Fourth, if a creditor fails to comply with the requirements for a \nreaffirmation agreement, the court can order heavy sanctions and \npenalties.\n  Fifth, the legislation will make it much harder for creditors to get \ndeterminations of nondischargeability. Only false representations by a \ndebtor that are considered ``material'' will be actionable. If a \ncreditor makes an unsuccessful claim of nondischargeability or denial \nof discharge, the creditor is liable for the debtor's attorney's fees, \ncosts, and punitive damages, if the creditor's claim is not \nsubstantially justified. The reverse is not true. If the creditor wins \nthe nondischargeability proceeding, the debtor does not have to pay the \ncreditor's attorney's fees. So it isn't reversible.\n  Sixth, if a creditor willfully violates the postdischarge injunction, \nthe creditor is liable for minimum damages of $5,000 and attorney's \nfees and costs, with the possibility of treble damages.\n  Seventh, if a creditor fails to comply with Truth in Lending Act \nrequirements for certain mortgage loans, the creditor's claim will not \nbe recognized or paid in bankruptcy. For instance, if a creditor does \nnot provide for certain disclosures, or fails to meet the requirements \nof the act, even if it is a technical violation, the creditor's claim \nwill be denied in bankruptcy. In other words, the debt, both principal \nand interest, will be completely forgiven. These new penalties are in \naddition to those penalties already present in the Truth in Lending Act \nitself.\n  Eighth, if a creditor willfully fails to credit payments to a \nbankruptcy plan, the creditor is liable for minimum damages of $5,000 \nand attorney's fees and costs, with the possibility of treble damages.\n  And ninth, if a creditor's proof of claim is disallowed or reduced by \n21 percent or more, the debtor gets attorney's fees and costs, and so \nforth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. As you can see--I hope we can vote down this amendment--a \nlot of hard work has been put into this.\n  Mr. President, I move to table and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is time remaining.\n  Mr. REED. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 6 seconds.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you.\n  I applaud all the consumer protections that the Senator from Utah has \nlisted, but I would like to add one more. I would like to add, along \nwith the Consumers Union and the Consumer Federation of America, the \nprotection of looking at the good-faith operation of a creditor who is \ndemanding that a debtor be placed from chapter 7 into chapter 13.\n  With respect to the standard, my standard is as equally well defined \nas the bad-faith standard that exists today within the legislation, \nbecause good faith and bad faith are something that the banking judge \nshould be able to determine, and it does not require an elaborate \nsearching through of underwriting policies and looking through \ndocumentation and going around the country.\n\n  What it does require is that that trier of fact, that bankruptcy \njudge, determine whether or not the creditor has abused the \nrelationship, either by intimidation or deceit. All these things would \nrise to the level of a lack of good faith. I suggest very strongly the \nbankruptcy judge can do that, and should do that in this context.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-two seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I rise to support this amendment because I think it makes \na good bill even better. We are trying to stop the abuses in \nbankruptcy. We say if you want to file for bankruptcy and you do not \nhave good cause, we are going to throw you out of court. We might \npenalize you, and we are going to do the same thing to your attorney. \nSo from the debtor side--the person who owes the money--it is a pretty \ntough standard.\n  What the Senator from Rhode Island says is, let's have a standard as \nwell for the collection agencies and the creditors who are not treating \npeople fairly. I think we want to eliminate all abuses in the \nbankruptcy court, not just by the debtors and their attorneys, but by \nthe creditors, too. What the Senator from Rhode Island suggests is \nfairness and balance. It gives the court the ability to look at strong-\narm tactics used by collection agencies and creditors to the detriment \nof debtors who are trying to get out of debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10695-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  VISIT TO THE SENATE BY MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF \n                               SINGAPORE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am advised there is an objection, so I, \ntherefore, object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to engage my colleague from \nMichigan, the sponsor of the Child Custody Protection Act, in a \ncolloquy to clarify the legislation's intent with regard to existing \nState parental notification laws.\n  The State of Maine has a carefully constructed adult consent \nrequirement. In my state, a minor under 18 may obtain an abortion with \nthe informed consent of either one parent, a guardian or an adult \nfamily member. Absent that consent, she may obtain an abortion if she \nreceives counseling from a physician, psychiatrist, ordained member of \nthe clergy, nurse, physician's assistant or qualified counselor. She \nmay also obtain an abortion without parental or adult family member \nconsent by securing a court order.\n  Will the legislation we are considering today in any way override or \nsupersede Maine State law?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I want to thank my colleague from Maine for this \nopportunity to answer important questions on the Child Custody \nProtection Act. The intent of this legislation is to protect state-\npassed parental involvement laws. Residents of the states have \nsupported and passed parental involvement laws and they deserve to have \ntheir will protected. The Child Custody Protection Act would have no \neffect on Maine's parental consent law as it applies to minors who \nreside in Maine. It would in no way override or supersede that law with \nrespect to Maine minors, families, or others. The only effect of \nlegislation would be to restrict a non-parent, non-guardian from \ntransporting a minor from another state where the minor resides to \nMaine in order for the out-of-state minor to obtain an abortion in \nMaine and avoid the minor's home state parental involvement law.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Opponents of this bill contend that health care \nproviders in states like Maine that do not have a law requiring \nparental involvement could still be liable for conspiracy or as \naccomplices under this legislation. The liability would presumably \napply when they perform or participate in performing an abortion on a \nminor brought into Maine in violation of the proposed statute. Is this \nanalysis correct? Are there any circumstances under which Maine's \nhealth care providers performing or participating in the performance of \nwhat, under Maine state law, would be legal abortion on a minor, could \nbe held liable under your bill? Would these providers have any new \nlegal responsibilities as a consequence of the enactment of this \nlegislation?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. This is an important point to clarify. The violation of \nthis act is not the performance of an abortion. The violation of this \nact is the transportation of a minor across state lines to obtain an \nabortion without involving that minor's parent as required by the law \nof her home state. The abortion provider would only be in violation of \nthis act if the provider actually conspired to transport or assisted in \ntransporting the minor across state lines to obtain an abortion without \nthe parental involvement that the minor's home state required. \nProviders who had not engaged in any such activities related to the \ntransport of a minor would not incur any criminal liability or face any \nnew legal responsibilities under this legislation.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong support \nfor the Child Custody Protection Act of 1998, which would make it a \ncrime to transport a child across state lines to circumvent a state law \nrequiring parental involvement or a judicial waiver for a minor to \nobtain an abortion.\n  Twenty-two states have laws saying a parent or guardian has to be \nnotified or their consent given if a child is trying to get an \nabortion. What's happening now--far too often--is that people who \naren't parents or guardians are taking the children across state lines, \nsecretly, to get abortions in another state where parental notification \nisn't required.\n  It is my hope that this bill will achieve two important goals--to \nprotect the health of children and to protect the rights of parents. In \nfact, Mr. President, I believe that empowering parents is the single \nbiggest investment we can make in ensuring the health of our children.\n  Parents have the right and duty to be involved in the moral and \nmedical decisions that affect their children's welfare.\n  When it comes to parental notification on abortion, the American \npeople have reached a clear consensus. By a huge majority--80 percent--\nthey favor parental notification. And 74 percent favor not just \nparental notification, but parental consent. This is a clear expression \nof the national wisdom. This legislation is an effort to make that kind \nof informed decision possible.\n\n[[Page S10702]]\n\n  Earlier this year, we worked on another bill, one that is now law. In \nthat bill, the Administration and the Congress mandated that the flight \nof a parent to another state to avoid paying child support is a Federal \ncrime. I worked with Senator Kohl to champion the Deadbeat Parents \nPunishment Act in order to protect the interests of America's children. \nWe have to pursue zealously those who would harm our children, either \nby omission or by commission.\n  Mr. President, the very same principle is embodied in the Child \nCustody Protection Act. There are those living among us who would place \nour children in harm's way by transporting them across state lines to \nachieve dangerous goals, both physically and emotionally. One such goal \nis abortion. The right of citizens to pass and enforce laws regarding \nthe rights of parents is completely violated by the ability of others \nto transport children to another state to obtain an abortion. As a \nnation, we must use all the resources available to us in order to \nprotect our children, and our families, from this conduct.\n  That is our purpose here today. I thank Senator Abraham for his \nstrong leadership in bringing this legislation forward.\n  I am sorry that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nrejected our unanimous consent agreement. It was a fair agreement that \nprovided unlimited debate on germane amendments to this bill. \nUnfortunately, the vote that we will take shortly to invoke cloture to \nend debate on the bill, may really be a vote to kill the bill if it \nfails. Let's be frank those voting to continue debate are really voting \nagainst the health of our children and the rights of parents. I would \nimplore my colleagues on the other side to vote for cloture--for our \nkids.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Mark Twain was right on target with his \ncomment that everybody was talking about the weather but nobody was \ndoing anything about it.\n  Well, in our time almost everybody is indeed talking about family \nvalues but, thank goodness, many voices are being lifted in a concerted \neffort to do whatever is necessary to reverse a dangerous trend in \nAmerica.\n  It's a trend that has been leading America down the slippery slope to \nself destruction.\n  The remedy? The preservation and restoration of the moral and \nspiritual principles and priorities laid down by our Founding Fathers a \ncouple of centuries ago.\n  Given the time, I could identify hundreds of souls across this land \nwho are hard at work in this massive restoration project--Bill and \nElaine Bennett, for example. And in this Senate there are many who \nspeak out with some regularity on the subject.\n  I am proud of them, and in today's special frame of reference, I am \nspecially proud of the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Spence \nAbraham, and all the cosponsors of S. 1645, The Child Custody \nProtection Act which is the pending business.\n  Mr. President, like, I pray, the majority of Americans, I was \noutraged by news reports that a 13-year old Pennsylvania girl was taken \nby a non-relative to another state to have an abortion without her \nparents' knowledge. Not knowing the whereabouts of a child, is surely a \nparent's worst nightmare. But, Mr. President, how much more frightening \nwould it be for parents, if federal law permitted a stranger to perform \nan abortion on their child. Abortion is a medical procedure, \npotentially, which may cause psychological and physical complications. \nBut this frightening scenario happened, and it will continue to happen \nif Congress does not pass the ``Child Custody Protection Act''. This \npending legislation ensures that state laws requiring parental \nnotification before an abortion can be performed on a minor will not be \ncircumvented by crossing a state line. In other words, the parents in \nPennsylvania will have their rights protected, so that, in turn, they \ncan protect their 13-year old daughters from this traumatic experience.\n  Of course, if we were talking today about a medical procedure, other \nthan abortion, there would be no need to defend a parent's right to be \ninformed. But, this major money-making industry is worrying its \npocketbook will be affected if parents are able to discourage their \ndaughters from having an abortion. Abortion advocates are once more \npulling out their deceitful tricks and desperately trying to defeat \nthis bill.\n  Even Senators who disagree on the legality of abortion should feel \ncomfortable with this legislation, because the vast majority of \nAmericans agree that parental notification laws need to be protected. A \nrecent poll conducted by Baselice & Assoc. shows that 78% of Americans \nstrongly believe that it should be unlawful to take a minor across \nstate lines to obtain an abortion without her parents' knowledge.\n  It comes down to this: Congress has an obligation to protect parental \nrights. Congress needs to protect states, like Pennsylvania, that have \ndecided that parents have a right to be notified about their daughters' \nintent to destroy an unborn child--a decision, by the way, that even \nthe Supreme Court has deemed constitutional in Planned Parenthood vs. \nCasey.\n  The parents in Pennsylvania are courageous, and they have not minced \ntheir words. They state unequivocally that they will not be pushed \naside when it comes to being involved with their daughters' well-being. \nIt is up to those of us in Congress to stand by the parents in \nPennsylvania and the other states which have passed laws protecting \nparental authority.\n  To be precise, twenty-two other states have passed laws similar to \nPennsylvania's--North Carolina being one of them. The parents of North \nCarolina have exercised their rights as voters and have also said that \nno abortion shall be performed on their daughter without their \nknowledge.\n  The question Congress needs to ask itself is this: Whose rights are \nwe going to protect, those of abortionists--or parents? Are we going to \ntolerate that abortionists, who desire nothing more than to make a \npretty penny off of young girls who are in a vulnerable state of mind, \nhave more rights than the parents who love and care for their daughters \nmore than anyone else in the world. Congress needs to be unmistakably \nclear that the job of deciding what is best for a teenager belongs to \nparents, not abortionists.\n  Simply put, America cannot afford to allow parental authority to be \nundermined. With the breakdown of so many families, it is absolutely \ncritical that nothing further be done to weaken the relationship \nbetween parents and their children. While there are numerous \ncontributory factors to society's ills today--the disintegration of the \nAmerican family is, in my judgement, the primary culprit.\n  By passing the ``Child Custody Protection Act,'' we are saying that \nthe custody of children both rightfully and fundamentally belongs to \nresponsible parents.\n  I pray that the Senate will follow the overwhelming decision of the \nHouse of Representatives and protect a parent's right to decide what is \nbest for their daughter.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the cloture motion on S. 1645, the Child Custody Protection \nAct. I do so as a supporter of the bill and as one who supported \ncloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1645.\n  Let me be very clear. I support a family's involvement in a minor's \nvery grave decision to have an abortion. I also support the rights of \nStates to protect minors in their borders by passing constitutional \nconsent measures. In my State of Wisconsin, there is a law that \nrequires minors seeking an abortion to get the permission of a parent, \na grandparent, an adult sibling, or a judge in cases where family \nsupport is unlikely.\n  The reports of adults driving unrelated minors across state lines to \navoid state consent laws are very disturbing. It is bad enough that a \nminor would make such a large decision and have such a serious \nprocedure without the support of a family member. It is worse that the \nprocedure might be performed far from home and away from the child's \nfamily doctor. It is because of these concerns that I supported S. \n1645.\n  However, S. 1645 as written is very narrow, and currently would cover \nonly those few states that have strict parental consent laws. It would \nnot cover Wisconsin where the law allows other family members to grant \nthe required consent. In voting in Judiciary Committee to send S. 1645 \nto the floor, I had assumed that we would be able to\n\n[[Page S10703]]\n\naddress this shortcoming, as well as other technical difficulties with \nthe bill.\n  Unfortunately, the Majority decided to file cloture immediately on \nthe bill before any perfecting amendments could be offered. Under the \nstrict rules of cloture, virtually no amendments to S. 1645 would be in \norder. Of most concern to me, it would have be out of order to consider \nan amendment protecting from criminal prosection a grandparent who \ndrove a minor across state lines for an abortion. I supported such an \namendment in Committee and think it is a necessary, wise, and humane \naddition to this legislation.\n  I am sorry that final consideration of this important measure will be \npushed aside by partisan procedural wrangling. Consent laws may be one \naspect of the highly charged abortion debate on which a majority of the \nCongress and a majority of the American people can agree. Sadly, we \nwon't have a chance to find out as the rush to the campaign shoves \nconsensus and sound policy off the agenda.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am opposed to S. 1645, the so-called \nChild Custody Protection Act. This legislation would prohibit and set \npenalties for transporting an individual under the age of 18 across a \nstate line to obtain an abortion even though the abortion is legal in \nthe state that individual is taken to. It would subject close relatives \nsuch as grandmothers, aunts, and siblings to criminal prosecution for \nan action totally legal where taken. In fact, an amendment that would \nhave excluded grandmothers and other close adult relatives from federal \nprosecution was defeated in Committee by proponents of this bill. \nInvoking cloture at this time would preclude this amendment on the \nSenate floor.\n  When faced with difficult choices regarding abortion and reproductive \nhealth, young women should be encouraged to seek counsel from their \nparents or other trusted adults. In many cases, even in states without \nmandatory parental consent laws, young women involve one or both \nparents. However, if a young woman feels that she cannot involve her \nparents for whatever reason, such as her fear it would put her in \ndanger of abuse or if the pregnancy is the result of incest, she should \nnot be discouraged from seeking the counsel of a trusted adult. I \nsupport adult involvement in this very difficult decision, but we must \nrecognize that in some cases it is not always possible for the adult to \nbe a parent. This bill would make it a federal misdemeanor for a \ngrandmother to take her granddaughter to another state for an abortion \neven if the mother is dead and the father is in jail for incest.\n  Without question, we should encourage parents, educators and \ncounselors to help prevent teenage pregnancy within their state and \ncommunities. Teenagers need to be informed of the responsibility that \ncomes with sexuality and parenthood. But making it more difficult for \nyoung women to turn to a trusted adult, be it an older sister, aunt, or \ngrandmother, is clearly not the way to do this.\n  This legislation also raises some unusual federalism questions that \nconcern me. Under this bill, state laws would follow the people who \nlive in those states when they travel to other states. The legislation \nwould require the federal government to prosecute people for an \nactivity that is lawful in the states in which the activity takes place \n(if that activity is not lawful in the state in which they reside). The \nFederal government does not impose this same restriction on crossing \nstate lines in any other case that I can think of such as to gamble or \nbuy liquor, cigarettes or guns. For the first time since slavery this \nlegislation would make it criminal to go to a state to act in a way \nthat is legal in that state. This is a terrible precedent.\n  This legislation would impose federal penalties in states that have \nopted not to implement parental involvement requirements. I believe \nsuch decisions should be made by the citizens of each state, not by the \nresidents of a neighboring state.\n  People who act legally in Michigan should not be prosecuted because \nacts are illegal in another state and Michigan citizens should not be \nprosecuted for acts which are legal in the state in which they are \nperformed.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to reiterate my support for \nS. 1645, the Child Custody Protection Act. I have long supported the \nright of states to enact and enforce parental notification laws with \nrespect to a minor's access to abortion services, and I believe steps \nshould be taken to prevent individuals from circumventing such laws. \nHowever, I voted against cloture on this bill today because such a vote \nwould have had the effect of denying my Senate colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle an opportunity to offer amendments. While I do not \nnecessarily support all of the amendments which might have been \noffered, I cannot in good conscience vote to circumvent what should be \nan open and fair debate on this important issue. The White House has \nthreatened to veto this bill in its current form and I believe a vote \nfor cloture today would have sealed the fate of this bill without \nconsideration of compromise language toward the shared goal of \npreventing abortions.\n  Every parent has the right to be involved in their minor's decision \nto terminate a pregnancy. The Child Custody Protection Act would \npromote parental participation in what must be the most difficult \ndecision a young girl might face. The federal government can play a \nroll in protecting states rights in this regard, and should support \nminor and adult women in alternatives to abortion. I always have \nsupported efforts to promote adoption to ensure that children grow up \nin a loving environment with a supportive family. I believe the federal \ngovernment should promote adoption assistance and should encourage \nmoving children from foster care into adoptive homes. I remain hopeful \nthat my colleagues in both political parties and I can work together to \ncreate a system that reduces unwanted pregnancies and abortions, \nencourages adoption, and results in strong families.\n  Mr. President, I will continue to work with the Senate leadership in \nan effort to move the Child Custody Protection Act forward so that the \nrights of parents are protected in the face of this most difficult \ndecision, and that minor and adult women continue to be provided with \nalternatives to terminating a pregnancy.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Obviously, as the sponsor of the legislation, I am \ndisappointed we will not be moving forward at this time.\n  As I think the Presiding Officer is aware, as our fellow Members are \naware, we have been trying to work with the interested parties on both \nsides since the bill came out of committee to try to limit the number \nof amendments so we might have a piece of legislation that could move \nthrough here in a reasonable period of time. Unfortunately, we could \nnot get to that point. Our hope had been to limit, through the \nunanimous consent offer that was made earlier today, the amendments to \nthose that have been filed that were germane. That was not agreed to.\n  Unfortunately, as is certainly every Member's prerogative here, there \nwas the desire for people to bring amendments that were wholly \nunconnected to the child custody protection issue.\n  Obviously, given the calendar of the Senate as we look forward to the \nnext few weeks, much business remains for us to complete, so the \nlikelihood we will be able to continue with respect to this legislation \nduring this Senate session seems very unlikely.\n  I certainly remain receptive to any counteroffers from the minority \nwith regard to the possibility of limiting amendments and time. \nRealistically, that does not seem like it is potentially going to occur \nthis year.\n  I think this is very important legislation. Across this country, \nevery day families who live in States that have enacted parental \nconsent laws are finding that those laws mean nothing because minor \nchildren are being transported across State lines without parental \ninvolvement or consent for the purpose of abortions being committed. \nThis is wrong. People in my State, where we have enacted such \nlegislation, have the right to rely on this legislation, to believe \nthat their children will be safe and protected, and that they will \nparticipate in the important decisions of their children's lives.\n  I hope if we can't resolve this issue and bring this bill back to the \nfloor this year that our colleagues will work together with me next \nyear so that we might be able, early in the session, to move ahead. The \nHouse passed this legislation overwhelmingly. I believe if it came to a \nfinal vote of passage in the Senate it would likewise pass \noverwhelmingly. I believe it would move legislatively in a direction \nthat is good not only for the young children affected by this \nlegislation, but for our families, as well.\n  I want to thank the people who voted for cloture today. I want to \nencourage those who wish to bring amendments that are not germane to \nthis legislation to consider other vehicles to possibly include those \namendments so that we might still have a chance this year to move ahead \non this legislation and do so in an expeditious timeframe.\n  If not, I certainly want to send out a welcome to anybody who wants \nto work with me because I do not intend to end this effort this year. I \nintend to continue until we pass the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10701-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10704-S10712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow I will be laying down a Sense of \nthe Congress amendment calling on the Federal Reserve to lower interest \nrates as a preemptive strike against a recession in 1999. This is a \nvery crucial issue coming at this point in time. I am going to take \nsome time to speak about it and lay out why it is necessary for us, I \nbelieve, to take this kind of action and to express ourselves.\n  The amendment I will be offering on behalf of myself and Senators \nDorgan, Conrad, Wellstone, Kerrey, and Bryan will urge the Federal Open \nMarket Committee to promptly reduce short-term interest rates as a \npreemptive strike against a recession in 1999. One week from today, the \nFederal Open Market Committee will meet to vote on interest rate \npolicy. That is why it is crucial that the Senate send a clear message \nto the Fed: ``Lower interest rates now.''\n  Mr. President, if we want to significantly decrease the number of \nbankruptcies in this country, one of the best ways to accomplish this \nimportant goal is to reduce the risk of people losing their jobs.\n  With the chance of deflation and a recession rising, we need to lower \ninterest rates.\n  Over 2 years ago, against the conventional wisdom of the time, I took \nto the floor of the Senate to speak and to openly put a hold on \nChairman Alan Greenspan's renomination to the Federal Reserve Board \nuntil we had a debate on U.S. monetary policy.\n  One of the reasons I did this was to ensure that we had a significant \ndebate on the Fed's focus only on inflation to the exclusion of other \nfactors. I believed then, and I believe now, that it is wrong for the \nFed to maintain high real interest rates without any significant signs \nof inflation threatening our country.\n  I believed at the time, and I continue to believe, that we should \nlower interest rates, allow the economy to grow, and to provide a \nmaximum level of employment. Specifically, I said at the time that I \nthought our economy could grow at least at a rate of 3.5 percent a year \nfor a number of consecutive years, with an expansion of the labor force \nand improved productivity. I also argued that we could at the same time \nhave an unemployment rate of 4.5 percent a year without triggering a \nsignificant level of inflation.\n  That is what I said 2 years ago. At the time, many economists and \neconomic writers took me to task on this, openly questioning my views. \nMany of these economists believed in a theory--an economic theory--\nwhich called NAIRU, which stands for the ``nonaccelerating inflationary \nrate of unemployment.'' I will get to that and what it means in just a \nmoment.\n  But a couple of years ago, advocates of NAIRU, believed that if the \nunemployment rate fell below a certain rate--at that time it was \nsomewhere between 5.5 and 6 percent--if the unemployment rate went \nbelow that level, employers would have to significantly raise wages and \nsalaries igniting a 1970s style of inflation. And these economic \ntheorists believed that the Fed should raise interest rates as a \npreemptive strike against inflation.\n\n[[Page S10705]]\n\n  In other words, if unemployment ever fell to that level, regardless \nof anything else, these economic theorists under this theory believed \nthat the Fed should raise interest rates right away to preempt any \ninflation from occurring.\n  That is what the Fed has done in the past. They have raised interest \nrates to a very high level.\n  But look where we are today. The unemployment rate currently is at \n4.5 percent. It has been below 5 percent for nearly a year and a half, \nand it has been under 6 percent for 4 years. And there is no inflation. \nOur gross domestic product was 3.8 percent last year and 5.5 percent \nduring the first quarter of this year. During this time, inflation \nhasn't gone up. In fact, it has gone down.\n  The rate has decreased to its lowest level since the 1960s during the \npast 2 years.\n  To Chairman Greenspan's credit, he has recently distanced himself \nfrom the view that there should be a preemptive increase in interest \nrates, simply because of NAIRU. He has, through his actions at the Fed, \nallowed our economy to grow and unemployment to fall without raising \ninterest rates.\n  So unemployment has fallen from 6, to 5.5, to 5, to 4.5 percent. \nUnder NAIRU, this would have triggered automatic increases in interest \nrates, but under Mr. Greenspan they have not. And I applaud him for \nthat.\n  Unfortunately, many on the Federal Open Market Committee have \ncontinued to push for higher interest rates even as the signs of an \neconomic slowdown in the United States continue. While they have not \nsucceeded in raising interest rates, they represent a major obstacle \nagainst lowering interest rates, an action which is becoming \nincreasingly needed.\n  Real interest rates are at a historical high. Although the Federal \nOpen Market Committee has not directly raised interest rates since \nMarch of 1997, real interest rates are rising. In fact, real interest \nrates are at historically high levels, the highest in 9 years, because \ninflation has continued to fall while the Federal Reserve has failed to \nlower the Federal funds rate. The chart that I have here points that \nout.\n  This chart shows, for example, the real Federal funds rate. That is \nthe market rate less the CPI percentage. As we can see, it has been, \nfor a short period--from 1996 to 1997--going up, and last year and this \nyear has gone up. Actually, this tick, it would be going up here again \nover the last few weeks. So we have about 4 percent real Federal funds \nrate right now. In fact, even Chairman Greenspan noted during his \nHumphrey-Hawkins testimony on February 24 of this year:\n\n       Statistically it is a fact that real interest rates are \n     higher now than they have been on the average of the post-\n     World War II period.\n\n  That is a quote from Mr. Greenspan. It is a fact that real interest \nrates are higher now than they have been on the average of the post-\nWorld War II period. I ask why--why are real interest rates so high? \nThere is no inflation; no signs of inflation. In fact, the economy is \nslowing down a little bit. We see some recessionary signs. Yet we still \nhave these high interest rates. The high interest rate policy that is \nbeing imposed by the Federal Reserve, I have always said, is really a \nstealth tax on hard-working American families, and I believe it is a \ncontributing factor to the near collapse of several economies \nworldwide.\n  It is time for the FOMC, the Federal Open Market Committee, to \nprovide a significant and immediate cut in interest rates as a \npreemptive strike against a recession in 1999. Interest rates have a \nsignificant impact on virtually every family in America, on every \nproducer, business and family farmer in this country. I believe lower \ninterest rates have been needed for a long time, but now quick action \nis truly crucial for our country's well-being.\n  The economic signs, not only in the U.S. economy but in economies \nworldwide, demand swift and appropriate action to counteract the \nproblems that lie ahead. I can only say that I believe we have waited \ntoo long. Just as inflation can spiral, and spiral out of control, so \ncan deflation spiral out of control. I hope that because the Federal \nReserve would not act a little sooner, that we have not reached a point \nwhere we are now in a deflationary spiral, and that even more drastic \naction may have to be taken. But I do believe that significant action \nhas to be taken right now to lower these interest rates.\n  Don't just take my word for it. Here is a quote from Mr. Jerry \nJasinowski, the President of the National Association of Manufacturers, \nand Earnest Deavenport, the CEO of Eastman Chemical Company. On \nSeptember 8th they said:\n\n       The current volatility in world financial markets and its \n     threat to global growth . . . could lead to recessions \n     throughout the developing world and Eastern Europe, as well \n     as a slowdown in the United States.\n\n  Here is what they said on this chart, on September 8:\n\n       We recommend a significant loosening of monetary policy. \n     Specifically, the Federal funds and the discount rates should \n     be reduced by 50 basis points as soon as possible.''\n\n  That is what they said on September 8.\n  Or we can listen to Mr. John Smith, President of General Motors. On \nSeptember 15th he said, here it is on this chart here:\n\n       The question is whether the Fed will wait until the \n     recession is imported and then act, or act now. GM believes \n     it should act now.\n\n  That is the President of General Motors on September 15, just last \nweek.\n  Or, James Glassman at the American Enterprise Institute, he has \nwritten several op-eds in the Washington Post calling on the Fed to \nlower interest rates. Again he said recently:\n\n       The most important step right now is for the Federal \n     Reserve to cut interest rates. That would pump more money \n     into the system, encouraging businesses to borrow and \n     consumers to spend. It would also temporarily weaken the \n     dollar, thus helping the currencies of countries in dire \n     economic straits.\n\n  I could go on all day quoting business leaders, economists, editorial \nwriters and others calling on the Federal Reserve to lower interest \nrates. From the Business Roundtable to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to \nthe Economic Policy Institute and progressive economist Jamie Galbraith \nat the University of Texas, from the chairman of the Joint Economic \nCommittee, to Robert Samuelson at the Washington Post, and Stephen \nRoach at the New York Times, the message to the Fed is clear: Lower \ninterest rates now.\n  The Fed's policy needs to be reversed and interest rates \nsignificantly lowered or our growing economy is likely to quickly sink, \nperhaps into a very serious recession. So, what we need is to lower \ninterest rates as a preemptive strike against these ominous economic \nsigns.\n  If we do not do this soon, we will see our hopes for higher wages, \nmore jobs, and the end of Federal deficits dashed on the rocks of \nrecession and rising unemployment. We could be driven by deflation \nrather than fearing inflation. With deflation, people delay major \npurposes because they know it is going to be cheaper later on. The last \ntime, of course, that we saw significant deflation was in the Great \nDepression of the 1930s, but it used to happen regularly in the last \ncentury.\n  How bad can it get? From 1929 to 1933, wages fell by 25 percent; \nwholesale prices fell by 30 percent; farm commodities fell by 51 \npercent. And with the shrinking economy, unemployment increased from \n5.3 percent to 36.3 percent. Prices were cheaper, but with no money \ncoming in, most people could not benefit at all.\n  Today, the signs of increasing global deflation are widespread. The \nproblems in the U.S. economy are greatly exacerbated by the enormous \ndifficulties in many Asian Pacific nations, Russia, Latin America and \nMexico.\n  As former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury C. Fred Bergsten wrote \nin the Washington Post on September 20th:\n\n       The Asian economic crisis is much deeper, much more \n     pervasive and likely to last much longer than anyone \n     imagined. Economies that had grown 6 to 8 percent annually \n     for two decades are declining by like or greater amounts, a \n     swing of Depression-era magnitude with incalculable political \n     and social consequences. The contagion has already spread far \n     beyond Asia, engulfing Russia and much of Latin America, and \n     could do so even more violently in the days ahead. We now \n     face a truly global crisis, which has already hit the United \n     States hard and will do so with increasing force.\n\n  The fall in the Canadian and Australian dollars, two countries \nlargely dependent on agriculture and mining is a demonstration of the \nworldwide impact of the deflationary trend in commodities.\n\n[[Page S10706]]\n\n  A far more severe threat is the long-term economic paralysis of the \nJapanese economy which has turned into a significant recession. Some \npredict that a bailout of the Japanese banks could cost as much as 20 \npercent of Japan's entire GDP.\n  That is much larger than our savings and loan crises back in the \n1980s. Some estimate that the bad loans of Japanese banks may be about \n$1 trillion. It is unfortunately clear that the Japanese government is \nnot moving quickly enough to resolve the difficulties in their \nfinancial sector. The Japanese have already seen their wholesale prices \ndecline in 5 of the last 6 years. To further illustrate this point, I \nwould like to quote an article in September 14 Wall Street Journal \nwhich I found very troubling.\n  It says:\n\n       News that Japan has fallen into its longest economic \n     contraction in 5 decades has led some economists and \n     government officials to suggest that the country has nudged \n     closer to a viscous spiral of falling prices, falling \n     employment and falling output that would damage its economy \n     even further.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that this entire article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 14, 1998]\n\n               Japan's Weak GDP Suggests Little Hope Soon\n\n                           (By Bill Spindle)\n\n       Tokyo.--News that Japan has fallen into its longest \n     economic contraction in five decades has led some economists \n     and government officials to suggest that the country has \n     nudged closer to a vicious spiral of falling prices, falling \n     employment and falling output that would damage its economy \n     even further.\n       Economic activity fell 0.8% during the April-to-June \n     quarter from the previous quarter, the government said \n     Friday, an annualized decline of 3.3%. And with spending by \n     companies and consumers plummeting, there was almost no sign \n     the situation will improve soon.\n       ``The Japanese economy is walking along the edge of a \n     deflationary spiral,'' said Taichi Sakaiya, head of the \n     government Economic Planning Agency.\n       Even before the gross domestic product numbers were \n     released Friday, the benchmark Nikkei stock index plunged \n     more than 5% amid concern over the economy and the gyrating \n     U.S. stock market. At the end of the morning session on \n     Monday, the Nikkei was up 30.12 points to 13947.10. The \n     dollar weakened almost five yen during the Asian trading day \n     as spooked investors brought dollar investments home and \n     cashed them in for yen. The Japanese bond market touched \n     another record high as yields, which move in the opposite \n     direction of prices, plunged to 0.79% on the benchmark long \n     bond.\n       Japan's report on gross domestic product--the total value \n     of goods and services produced in the economy--was a litany \n     of problems that exceeded even the downbeat expectations of \n     most private economists.\n       Consumer spending, the largest chunk of Japan's economy, \n     fell an annualized 3.3%. Housing investment, which provided \n     one of the few bright spots in the preceding quarter, plunged \n     by an annualized rate of 4%. And corporate capital investment \n     posted a second straight decline, falling 20% at an \n     annualized rate. That is a particularly bad omen, since \n     business investment has historically been a key engine that \n     drives employment and thus consumer spending. That ``suggests \n     the economy is going to be contracting going forward,'' said \n     Brian Rose, an economist at Warburg Dillon Read.\n       While Japan's trade surplus made the biggest contribution \n     to economic growth, even that silver lining was more a sign \n     of economic weakness than strength. The surplus expanded \n     because Japan's imports--which fell 6.8% from the previous \n     quarter--are declining faster in the weak economy than \n     exports, which slipped 0.4%. The only clear plus for the \n     economy was an annualized 1% rise in government expenditures, \n     indicating some of the spending from a fiscal stimulus \n     package may be trickling into the economy.\n       These most recent data--showing that Japan's economy \n     deteriorated for a third straight quarter, the longest \n     contraction since the government began compiling figures in \n     1955--comes as the government gropes for effective tools to \n     turn the tide. On Wednesday, the central bank loosened \n     monetary policy by cutting the interbank lending rate to \n     0.25% from 0.5%. However, private economists and even some \n     government officials said the move would provide little help \n     for an economy where the usual tools of monetary policy have \n     broken down.\n       The government is also pouring some $100 billion worth of \n     tax cuts and spending into the economy, part of an economic \n     rescue package passed in April. Still, private economists say \n     the stimulus package--the centerpiece of the dominant Liberal \n     Democratic Party's economic strategy--could be swamped by the \n     deterioration in the rest of the economy. Nonetheless, many \n     economists still think the spending and tax-cut package will \n     be enough to at least break the momentum of the contraction \n     temporarily over the next two quarters.\n       The fallout from the continued economic deterioration could \n     also eventually hit the banking system. Already a swelling \n     number of bankruptcies is creating concern that banks' huge \n     portfolios of bad loans will grow further as more borrowers \n     fail.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as the second largest economy, Japan's \npoor economic situation is going to have a very significant effect on \nour economy and the economies of most other countries.\n  Again I quote Fred Bergsten, a very respected expert in international \neconomics. He urges that ``the United States and European Union should \nglobalize the strategy of cutting their own interest rates. This would \nencourage capital reflows to the crisis countries, reduce their debt \nburdens and improve their competitive position by promoting a stronger \nyen. It would also ensure continued world growth and help prevent \nfurther stock market declines.''\n  Mr. Bergsten went on to note the fact that the 30-year bond interest \nrate is below the Fed funds rate and urged a cut in this rate by a full \npercentage point.\n  Chairman Greenspan recently said that the U.S. can't ``remain an \noasis of prosperity'' in ``a world that is experiencing greatly \nincreased stress.''\n  Again, this statement does appear to be a significant and positive \nshift in the views of the Chairman of the Fed.\n  However, I am concerned that there are members of the Federal Open \nMarket Committee who both refuse to consider the global economy when \ndetermining monetary policy and are still worried that low unemployment \nwill automatically trigger inflation.\n  The financial crisis in Asia, Latin America, Russia and many other \nareas of the world poses a serious threat to our economy and, to date, \nthe United States has not established the appropriate monetary policy \nto minimize it. The FOMC, through its control of the federal funds \nrate, has the ability to take decisive action against the economic \nproblems that face us.\n  Many economists note that devalued currencies in several countries \nwill not only reduce the rate of inflation but also sharply increase \nour trade deficit, eliminating many jobs and slowing growth in the \nprocess. Worldwide commodity prices are at their lowest level in \ndecades.\n  With regard to our record trade deficit, on September 18, the \nChristian Science Monitor reports that ``So far this year, the trade \ndeficit in goods and services is running at a record annual rate of \n$185 billion, 68 percent higher than last year's record deficit of $110 \nbillion. America's deficit with Pacific Rim countries hit $87.8 billion \nin the first seven months--42 percent above the imbalance for the \nperiod in 1997.''\n  The September 7 issue of Insight Magazine, says that ``Santa Claus is \ncoming to America, only his goods are making the early trip by sea \nrather than sleigh--in huge freighters filled to capacity.''\n  What will this mean for the U.S. economy? Most importantly, it means \na significant loss of jobs, perhaps as much as 1.1 million. In fact, \nWilbur Ross, the senior managing editor of the Rothschild Investment \nGroup, believes that ``the loss of American jobs due to decreased \ndomestic production for export will outweigh any short term benefits of \nlower prices.''\n  Experts on balance-of-trade issues say nearly every major industry \nwill be affected: automotive, steel, electronics, appliances, \nmachinery, textiles and apparel.\n  Mr. President, lower interest rates would allow people in other \ncountries to buy out goods, and, in turn, reduce the risk of Americans \nlosing their jobs.\n  Lower interest rates are also needed to help our farmers. Worldwide \ncommodity prices are at their lowest level in decades.\n  The price of farm commodities are connected to this problem, and we \nknow what is happening to farm commodities in our country. I was just \nrecently in the Midwest, and I can tell you that corn, beans, wheat and \nall the attendant crops are at their lowest prices in years. They are \nfalling dramatically. Livestock prices are also going down. We are \nseeing average hog prices this year at their lowest level since 1974 \nand, again, no indication that they are going to go up.\n\n[[Page S10707]]\n\n  This is an idea of what is happening to corn prices. We can see how \nthey are dropping in the Midwest. I have shown these charts before in \ndiscussing the need for some legislation on agriculture.\n  Basically, what this chart shows, and all the other charts indicate, \nis corn, soybeans, wheat, cattle hogs--all the commodities we have in \nthe farm sector--are drastically dropping, and dropping very rapidly.\n  Wayne Angell, a former Federal Reserve Governor appointed by \nPresident Reagan, and one of the last experts in farm economy to sit on \nthe Federal Reserve Board, I might add, said on September 9, ``The \nFederal Reserve should cut interest rates to stem declines in the \nprices of key commodities.''\n  Angell goes on to say that, ``If commodity prices continue to fall \nunchecked, the U.S. economy risks a fall in the prices of hard assets, \nsuch as real estate, with potentially severe risks to the economy.''\n  He said that on September 10.\n  He is right, we are already seeing this. We are seeing this happen in \nthe Midwest. Already we are seeing a softening of land prices, and \nperhaps it could lead to a downward spiral. I and many others in this \nbody are working on solutions to fix the problems in the ag sector, \nlike increasing loan rates, providing storage payments to farmers, \nhelping those who have suffered disasters, helping to do something \nabout the Federal Crop Insurance Program. One of the best things the \nFederal Reserve can do for farmers is lower interest rates.\n  There are direct effects. For example, a 1-percent reduction in \ninterest rates means the average farmer in Iowa will save $1,400 in \ninterest payments on their land each year. In addition to reductions in \nland payments, lower interest rates means farmers will be able to \nreceive a much-needed break in the prices they pay for new machinery, \nfertilizer and seeds. It means that farmers' incomes will increase and \nthe negative effect on the rural economy will be somewhat reduced.\n  Again, for example, a 1-percent reduction in interest rates means a \ntypical 950-acre grain farm in Iowa will see an increase of about \n$2,500 in income a year.\n  But the indirect effects of lower interest rates, as I mentioned, are \neven more important. We need the engine of the U.S. economy working at \nfull speed to help the world economy to recover. Lowering interest \nrates will help restore worldwide markets for our agricultural goods. \nAs I have said many times in the past, lower interest rates amount to a \nbadly needed tax break for hard-working families.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. economy is the only large, healthy economic \nengine in the world, and if our economy does slow (and our growth \nincreased just 1.6 percent in the last quarter compared to 5.5 percent \nin the first quarter), it will be exceedingly difficult for the \nworldwide economy to recover. The chance of a long, deep, worldwide \neconomic recession is, unfortunately, very possible.\n  There are already increasing signs of a possible recession in the \nU.S. economy. For example, 30-year Treasury bond rates have sunk to \nrecord lows and are now below the short-term Federal funds rate. This \nis indeed a yellow warning light that the U.S. economy could be headed \nfor a significant decline. Again, this chart shows that. The 30-year \nTreasury bond rates are now lower than the short-term Federal funds \nrate. That sends a very powerful signal that we could be headed for a \nvery, very steep decline.\n  Wholesale prices slid a steep 0.4 percent just in August alone. For \nthe first 8 months of the year, producer prices have fallen at a 1.4 \npercent annual rate, compared with a 1.2 percent rise for all of 1997.\n  Nobel laureate Milt Friedman, with whom I do not very often agree on \neconomics, called this a ``significant decline.'' And former Fed Vice \nChairman Alan Blinder, says:\n\n       If you ask about the prospect of deflation and you restrict \n     your attention to goods, the answer is yes, and in fact we've \n     had some.\n\n  So, Mr. President, we are already seeing troubling deflationary signs \nin our own economy. Action must be taken now.\n  The fall in the U.S. stock market, another flashing warning signal, \nwill clearly have its own impact on what is referred to as the ``wealth \neffect.'' To describe the troubling nature of this situation, I would \nlike to quote an article from the September 14 issue of Time magazine. \nThe article pointed out that:\n\n       A slumping stock market can certainly add to the drag on a \n     slowing economy, through the so-called wealth effect. In a \n     rising market, economists estimate that for every dollar of \n     increased wealth, consumers spend an additional 4 cents. And, \n     they often stop spending that money when their stock gains \n     erode. If $2 trillion has been lost from investors' pockets \n     over the past couple of months, then at 4 cents on the dollar \n     we could expect an $80 billion drop in annual consumer \n     spending, or about 1% of the total U.S. economy. While that \n     alone is not enough to stop the economy from growing . . . it \n     could combine with the global currency crisis to tip the U.S. \n     into recession later this year or in early 1999.\n\n  The article in Time goes on to say that:\n\n       . . . a persistent stock market decline can also hurt the \n     economy by making companies more cautious about expansion and \n     hiring. That usually means layoffs or plant closings, which \n     ripple through our economy as laid-off people cut spending.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article from Time be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Time Magazine, Sept. 14, 1998]\n\nWhat a Drag! Asia, Russia, Latin America--Trouble Abroad Threatens the \n                              U.S. Economy\n\n (S.C. Gwynne Reported by Bernard Baumohl, William Dowell and Aixa M. \n Pascual/New York, Julie Grace/Milwaukee, Alison Jones/Durham and Adam \n                          Zagorin/Washington)\n\n       Smack in the American heartland, far from both Wall Street \n     and Asia, the 15,500 workers of Harnischfeger Industries, \n     based in St. Francis, Wis., got slammed from both directions. \n     A proud world beater that builds mining equipment and huge \n     machines that produce 70% of the world's printing paper, \n     Harnischfeger has just seen its sales to Singapore and other \n     troubled Pacific Rim countries drop from $600 million a year \n     to nearly zero. Its stock, riding high at $44 a year ago, was \n     beaten down to $16 in last week's market rout, gutting the \n     401(k) retirement plans of many of its employees. ``What I \n     have in Harnischfeger stock is down by two-thirds,'' says a \n     glum Dave Trench, 57, a machinery stock attendant at a \n     Harnischfeger subsidiary in Nashua, N.H. ``When I look at \n     retirement, I might start to sweat.'' At least he still has \n     his job--for now. Harnischfeger announced in late August that \n     it soon will begin dismissing 3,100 employees, or a fifth of \n     its work force.\n       Look at Harnischfeger, and you can see the origins of the \n     stock market's grinding 1,698-point decline, a loss of 8% \n     from the July 17 peak of the Dow Jones industrial average at \n     9337.97. The company also offers a glimpse of what might come \n     next, as American workers and investors like Dave Trench \n     wonder whether the long boom is over. Should they pull their \n     money out of stocks? Does the market slide foretell a \n     recession? How is any of this bad news possible when the U.S. \n     economy seems so strong, with the lowest unemployment, \n     inflation and interest rates seen in a generation?\n       Like American business generally, Harnischfeger entered \n     this turmoil strong and lean. Well-managed with a skilled and \n     productive work force, it had prospered from the past \n     decade's explosive growth in global freedom and commerce. But \n     then came the currency crisis that began in Thailand in July \n     1997 and spread like a contagion through the rest of Asia--\n     and last month to Russia and last week to Latin America, \n     hammering down local currencies and slashing demand for U.S. \n     exports. Cheaper Asian exports began grabbing more and more \n     domestic business away from U.S. companies and sliced into \n     their earnings. That trend finally drove down an overheated \n     stock market, taking back, in the past seven weeks, almost a \n     quarter of the $9 trillion that stocks have pumped into U.S. \n     portfolios during the roaring '90s.\n       When the Dow plunged 512 points last Monday, investors at \n     first regarded it as an irrational response to the financial \n     and political turmoil in Russia--a vast country that still \n     bristles with 7,000 strategic nuclear warheads but whose \n     economy scarcely rivals that of the Netherlands and accounts \n     for less than 1% of U.S. exports. Investors treated Monday's \n     market action as another of those ``dips'' in which they had \n     been taught to buy stocks on the cheap. Heck, it wasn't even \n     as big as the one-day dip last Oct. 27, and the market had \n     shrugged that one off six weeks before powering to new highs \n     and greater glory.\n       With that in mind, bargain hunters on Tuesday sent the Dow \n     rebounding 288 points, in the second-largest single-day point \n     gain in history, President Clinton, for whom rising stocks \n     have covered a multitude of sins these past six years, \n     tracked the Dow anxiously as\n\n[[Page S10708]]\n\n     he traveled to beleaguered Moscow. During a dinner with \n     Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Clinton stopped economic \n     adviser Gene Sperling in the receiving line to tell him, \n     quietly but with palpable relief, that ``the market's up'' \n     and flashed a thumbs-up sign.\n       But this time things were different. The Dow fell \n     Wednesday. And the next day. And the next day, losing ground \n     for the seventh trading day out of the previous eight and \n     posting a 411-point, or 5%, setback for the week. Despite the \n     release last week of fresh reports chronicling persistent low \n     unemployment and rising orders for factory goods, anxiety \n     spread from the stock market to the ``real'' economy of \n     jobs and paychecks. The market drop served as a reminder--\n     one about as subtle as a poke in the eye--that in today's \n     global economy, not even a healthy U.S. can quarantine its \n     factories and offices and markets from the illnesses of \n     countries halfway around the world. It vividly showed \n     Americans how the turmoil in Asia and Latin America is \n     slashing the profits of U.S. corporations, which might be \n     forced to respond with layoffs and cutbacks in spending.\n       Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, speaking after the \n     markets closed last Friday, revealed that Fed policymakers \n     are worried that the threat to the U.S. economy from global \n     financial turmoil rivals the danger of wage and price \n     inflation. The Fed is now as likely to cut interest rates, he \n     hinted, as to raise them. ``It is just not credible that the \n     U.S. can remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world \n     that is experiencing greatly increased stress,'' Greenspan \n     said in a speech at the University of California, Berkeley. \n     Then he headed off to join Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in \n     a meeting where they urged Japan's new Finance Minister to \n     deal with his country's insolvent banks and other financial \n     troubles, which are dragging down not only the huge economy \n     and financial market of Japan but also those of other Asian \n     countries--and now the U.S.\n       Only 21 months ago, with the Dow at 6500, Greenspan was \n     warning against ``irrational exuberance'' in the stock \n     market. Several other wise elders expressed hope that last \n     week's correction will have the cleansing effect of \n     strengthening the historic relationship between stock \n     valuations and the earnings of the underlying companies--a \n     notion that had fallen out of favor after years of ``momentum \n     investing,'' in which all that mattered was that someone \n     would buy the hot stock that some greater fool would soon bid \n     up to an even higher price. The price-earnings ratio for the \n     S 500 has approached a record 30 this summer, twice its \n     historical norm. Securities analysts, reassessing the impact \n     of the turmoil in Asia and other foreign markets, last week \n     began chopping down their estimates for growth of U.S. \n     corporate profits, to as little as 3% for all of 1998, and \n     zero growth for 1999, a sharp drop from last year's robust \n     12%.\n       In a bit of lucky timing, Fidelity Investments, the mutual-\n     fund giant, last week rolled out a promotional and \n     educational campaign starring Peter Lynch, its legendary fund \n     manager. Lynch was troubled, he told TIME, that ``in the \n     first half of this year, the S 500 was up 15%, but \n     [corporate] profits were down.'' He also expressed relief \n     that the correction came now, rather than having the market \n     drop to 7500 ``after it's gone up to 14000.''\n       There was remarkably little evidence of panic among \n     individual investors last week. One measure of that is the \n     amount of money that flows in and out of equity mutual funds. \n     In August, a month that included several gut-wrenching weeks, \n     there was a net outflow of $5.4 billion, or well under 1% of \n     the total invested in equity funds. Though this was the first \n     such exodus since the recession and stock slump of 1990, the \n     number is still quite modest when compared with the 4% that \n     fled equity funds after the October 1987 correction. Last \n     week investors pulled a net $6.2 billion out of stock funds \n     Monday and Tuesday, but on Wednesday a net $6.5 billion \n     flowed right back as the market bounced, according to Trim \n     Tabs Financial Services. ``There has not been any retail \n     panic as far as we can see,'' says Scott Chaisson, a branch \n     manager for Fidelity in midtown Manhattan. ``There seems to \n     be an awareness that there are going to be ups and downs like \n     this.''\n       The real test, though, won't come until later, when new \n     investors face the results of their first sustained market \n     decline. An unprecedented 43% of adult Americans are now \n     invested in stocks, up from only 21% in 1990. (That helps \n     explain why we are hearing less Schadenfreude over the \n     discomfort of Wall Street yuppies than in past corrections.) \n     A striking 57% of all household assets today are allocated to \n     equities. Small wonder: the market has doubled just since \n     1994. But these investors are about to get account statements \n     showing declines of 20% to 30%. Even if they have been in the \n     black over the past 12 months, not to mention the past few \n     years, it will be a shock to be reminded, for the first time \n     in years, that stocks can go down as well as up.\n       Investors large and small who had put money overseas in \n     search of diversification, or simply higher returns, were \n     sorely disappointed last week. Day after day, one giant U.S. \n     bank after another came forward, like sheepish A.A. members \n     fallen off the wagon, to confess they had succumbed to the \n     lure of big returns from Russian investments on which--\n     surprise!--the Yeltsin government has defaulted. Citicorp \n     announced that its earnings for the third quarter will be cut \n     by about $200 million in Russian losses. The price tag at \n     Bankers Trust, about $260 million; at brokerage firm \n     Salomon Smith Barney, $360 million in the past two months.\n       All told, U.S. financial institutions had losses mounting \n     to $8 billion by week's end, and one of the fears that \n     drugged the stock market was that U.S. companies might face \n     even larger losses in Latin America, where they have much \n     more exposure (about a third of U.S. exports) and where \n     currencies came under fresh assault late last week. Brazil \n     saw $11 billion in capital fleeing the country in the past \n     five weeks--not because its economy is weak but because of \n     each investor's fear that other investors might flee any \n     economy slurred with the label ``emerging.'' Money also fled \n     the stocks of financial institutions with lots of business \n     and investment in the merging markets. Citicorp's stock \n     dropped to about half of its recent high, losing $40 billion \n     of market value.\n       Other companies that took major hits were transportation \n     stocks whose business involves trade and travel: the parent \n     companies of such airlines as American, United and Delta. \n     Companies like Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Gillette, \n     which not long ago were praised for their successful \n     penetration of global markets, last week were punished \n     harshly through stock sell-offs. General Electric, the \n     world's most valuable public corporation and one of the most \n     admired, fell 22%, losing $68 billion of its market value.\n       The near panic over emerging markets was strongest among \n     some of the hedge funds, the high-risk vehicles that often \n     deliver high returns to wealthy investors. After famed \n     investor George Soros lost $2 billion in Russia, John \n     Meriweather's Long-Term Capital Management announced that it \n     had lost $2.1 billion, or half its asset value, so far this \n     year. ``Russia and Asia became the trigger for the correction \n     in the U.S. stock market,'' says David Wyss, chief economist \n     at DRI/McGraw-Hill, a consulting firm. ``Although there had \n     already been a softening in earnings over the past few \n     quarters, traders needed to be hit with a two-by-four to make \n     them realize you just can't get double-digit increases in \n     earnings every year.''\n       Russia also became the trigger for another concern, at once \n     political and economic: ``We were suddenly threatened by an \n     old fear--the Soviet Union and militarism,'' says John \n     Silvia, chief economist at Scudder Kemper Investments. ``If \n     the world is not as peaceful as we expected, then a lot of \n     money in the U.S. that went into consumer spending and \n     capital investment may now have to go back to defense, and \n     that's going to shock the budget here.''\n       As the Dow ended its week at 7640.25, it was approaching \n     one of the standard benchmarks for a bear market: a 20% drop \n     from a previous peak. Many investors, though, have been in a \n     quiet bear market for several months; that's because, during \n     the last stages of the run-up in the Dow and the S 500, \n     most of the increase was accounted for by such large \n     companies as Coca-Cola and Microsoft; many smaller stocks \n     were left behind. In the S 500, virtually all the gains in \n     share prices in recent months were made by the 50 largest. At \n     the same time, the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks--\n     traditionally favored by many individual investors--was off \n     29% from its April high. And as of Monday, the average stock \n     in the New York Stock Exchange was off 38% this year. Even \n     before last week, nearly half of U.S. domestic stock funds \n     were losing money for the year.\n       Several economists see the current market as an \n     untraditional bear market or, as Harvinder Kalirai, an \n     economist at the consulting group I.D.E.A., sees it, what's \n     happening on Wall Street is ``a cyclical bear in a secular \n     bull market. This is a cyclical fluctuation.'' The longer-\n     term or secular trend in the market, though, ``is still \n     high.''\n       Many individual investors also hold that faith. Dennis \n     Lese, 52, an executive with Amoco Corp. in Chicago, says that \n     he is staying in the market but that the six-figure losses he \n     suffered last week have caused him to postpone his planned \n     early retirement. ``I was thinking about retiring and living \n     off stocks,'' he says. ``But now I think I'll work a few more \n     years.''\n       Others seemed content to ride it out, in the knowledge that \n     the gains of the past few years will cushion the impact of a \n     down market now. ``Anyone with brains knows the thing to do \n     is to sit back and wait,'' says Stephanie Rubin, 52, an \n     executive with a search firm in Chicago who has about \n     $300,000 in stocks. ``If it's down 25% on paper, it doesn't \n     bother me because it's money tied up in an IRA account. I'm \n     not going to touch this money till I'm 65.''\n       Some people who were actively playing the market, however, \n     were singing a different tune. ``I was panicking,'' said Alan \n     Herkowitz, 39, a New York systems analyst and a self-\n     described ``short-term trader'' who invests ``play money'' in \n     the market.\n       One of the biggest worries in a sustained market downturn \n     is that it might depress consumer confidence and spending. \n     Contrary to popular belief, though, bit stock market drops \n     alone rarely herald recessions. According to a study by Peter \n     Temin, an economics professor at M.I.T., falling stock prices \n     directly caused only one minor economic downturn in this \n     century, in 1903.\n       But a slumping stock market can certainly add to the drag \n     on a slowing economy, through the so-called wealth effect. In \n     a rising market, economists estimate that for every dollar of \n     increased wealth, consumers spend an additional 4 [cents]. \n     And they often\n\n[[Page S10709]]\n\n     stop spending that money when their stock gains erode. If $2 \n     trillion has been lost from investors' pockets over the past \n     seven weeks, then at 4 [cents] on the dollar we could expect \n     an $80 billion drop in annual consumer spending, or about 1% \n     of the total U.S. economy. While that alone is not enough to \n     stop the economy from growing, economists say, it could \n     combine with the global currency crisis to tip the U.S. into \n     recession later this year or in early 1999.\n       A persistent stock market decline can also hurt the economy \n     by making companies more cautious about expansion and hiring. \n     ``If the stock price isn't doing well,'' says John Lonski, \n     chief economist for Moody's Investors Service, ``shareholders \n     will put pressure on management to cut costs to improve \n     returns.'' That usually means layoffs and plant closings, \n     which ``ripple through the economy'' as laid-off people cut \n     spending.\n       Pushing against these negative currents, fortunately, is \n     the persistent, fundamental strength of the U.S. economy. The \n     trend in wages and employment, which wield far more influence \n     over consumer confidence and spending than stock prices, \n     remains strong. As she placed a tortilla warmer in her \n     shopping cart last week at a store in Nashville, Tenn., Sue \n     Allison, 53, a public relations officer for the Tennessee \n     supreme court, observed that ``there are a million people out \n     tonight spending $90 on nothing, just as I am. My husband and \n     I won't touch [our retirement stocks] for at least 15 years, \n     so I don't worry about short-term losses.'' In fact, aside \n     from corporate profits and stock prices, most other leading \n     indicators are pointing briskly upward. Orders from American \n     factories rose 1.2% in July, the strongest performance since \n     November. As investors around the globe sought a safe haven \n     for their capital, long-term interest rates continued their \n     slide to 5.3%, a silver lining for the U.S. in the cloud over \n     emerging markets. Those low rates in turn have boosted the \n     used-housing market, which recorded an all-time high of \n     houses sold in July. Housing values, another important factor \n     in Americans' calculation of their wealth, are rising smartly \n     at about 5% a year. Unemployment stands at 4.5%, nearly a 28-\n     year low, and only 1.8% for those with college degrees. \n     Thanks to rising productivity, real wages have been rising \n     for the first time in nearly three decades without spurring \n     inflation. The U.S. growth rate, while down from its feverish \n     5.5% in the first quarter, is still expected to register 2%-\n     plus for the rest of the year. The only skunk at this picnic \n     is the Asian, Russian and Latin financial crisis, estimated \n     to have knocked about 2.5 percentage points off second-\n     quarter growth of 1.5%.\n       If recession comes, economists say, the cause will be the \n     inability of countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, \n     Mexico and Venezuela to buy as many U.S. exports with their \n     devalued currencies--and the hit on U.S. wages and corporate \n     earnings as cheap imports from those countries grab a greater \n     share of the U.S. consumer's wallet.\n       At Nucor Corp., a $4 billion North Carolina steelmaker, the \n     global tumult has hit home in both ways. Nucor's exports are \n     down, falling globally from an annual rate two years ago of \n     700,000 tons to the present 30,000 tons, much of which is \n     accounted for by Asian markets. But far more worrisome is the \n     tough competition in the U.S. market from cheap steel made in \n     Japan, Korea and Russia. Currency devaluations in those \n     countries have made their products cheap for American buyers, \n     says chairman Ken Iverson. ``The U.S. is the only economy \n     left that's doing well, so they're going to ship it all \n     here.'' That makes America the consumer of last resort--a \n     lifeline to many foreign economies, but at a heavy cost to \n     many U.S. companies and workers. Again, such disruptions \n     quickly get capitalized into stock prices: Nucor shares have \n     fallen from $61 a year ago to $39 last week.\n       Another North Carolina company feeling the pain is Beacon \n     Sweets, which makes, among other products, ``gummi watches'' \n     (gelatin candy in the shape of a watch). Although most of its \n     business is domestic, Beacon had begun to grow in China, \n     Korea, Singapore, the Philippines and Japan. But over the \n     past year, Beacon has seen its export business evaporate. \n     Says Stephen Berkowitz, an executive vice president: ``Our \n     business in those countries has absolutely dried up as a \n     result of currency devaluations.''\n       Perhaps the greatest risk to both the U.S. and global \n     economies is that today's hard times could bring a rising \n     tide of global protectionism, including controls not only on \n     trade but also on flows of capital. With the leadership in \n     Russia and Japan virtually paralyzed, and President Clinton \n     distracted by his personal problems there is a danger that \n     the trend toward freer markets could be reversed. This is \n     already happening in places like Malaysia, which last week \n     imposed foreign-exchange controls hurtful to multinational \n     firms in the U.S. and elsewhere--not to mention to Malaysia \n     itself, which will be hard pressed to attract investment. Nor \n     is the U.S. immune. If unemployment begins to rise, blame \n     will quickly attach to the rocketing U.S. trade deficit--one \n     of the most immediate effects of the crisis in Asia--and will \n     tempt members of Congress to impose new limits on imports. \n     That, more than any other factor, could eventually lead to a \n     significant recession in this country and others. ``What we \n     need is leadership,'' says Hugh Johnson, chief investment \n     strategist at First Albany, a brokerage firm. ``Without it, \n     we have a vacuum, and the market always hates that.''\n       For Clinton, much is at stake. The rising market and robust \n     economy have long boosted his approval rating and made both \n     is allies and his adversaries loath to cross him. A \n     significant downturn in the economy, or a longer stock \n     decline than expected, could make Americans feel much less \n     patient with his foibles, and could embolden his enemies. \n     Studies of polling show that a sour economy in 1973-74 \n     contributed significantly to Americans' disgust with \n     President Richard Nixon in the later stages of the Watergate \n     scandal.\n       For American investors too, much is at stake. One of the \n     worst things they could do is let rising volatility and \n     uncertainty drive them out of stock investments. Returns on \n     stocks have far outdistanced most other investments over \n     time, producing an average annual return, after inflation, of \n     6.4% from 1927 through 1995, which includes the period when \n     stocks struggled to regain the highs they reached before the \n     1929 crash and the Great Depression. Investors can also take \n     heart that the stock market usually bounces back far more \n     quickly than it did in the 1930s. In nine of the 11 months \n     where the S 500 lost 4% or more since October 1987, returns \n     were positive within two months of the drop. In all cases, \n     including the 1987 crash, the market returned to positive \n     returns within six months. As TIME's Dan Kadlec explains in \n     the following story, most investors should stay with stocks, \n     except when handling money they might need within the next \n     three years.\n       For all its problems, Harnischfeger offers encouragement to \n     other Americans at this uncertain time. Folks at the \n     Wisconsin company have earned higher wages and have been able \n     to educate their children better because of the profits they \n     have reaped from the unprecedented spread of global commerce \n     and free trade. But the price of that prosperity is a global \n     economy so interlinked that the troubles of America's trading \n     partners very quickly become its troubles too, even when \n     America's domestic economy is showing remarkable resilience, \n     as it is now.

One argument against lowering interest rates is that our \nunemployment levels are already low. Some say that our current rate of \nunemployment at 4.5 percent is too low, companies cannot find workers \nand will be forced to pay more, hurting their profits, hurting the \neconomy.\n  Businesses have surprised many economists by creating multiple ways \nto improve efficiency. Of course, more can and should be done. I \nbelieve there is room for additional job growth. Companies have also \nbeen effective at finding new employees who were not actively looking \nfor work and were, therefore, not counted as unemployed.\n  We need economic growth to continue in order to improve wages, to \nbring still more people into the labor force, to give those working \npart time the chance to work full time, and to provide opportunity for \nthose on welfare, and for those who have entered the workforce at the \nbottom rung, to start moving up the ladder.\n  With only those looking for work counted as unemployed, there are \nstill millions of others not counted as unemployed who could be brought \ninto the workforce. As difficult as it may be to find workers now, this \nwill be viewed as a small problem compared to a serious economic \ndownturn, a recession, and deflation.\n  Again, if inflation should start to accelerate we can always apply \nthe brakes and whatever inflation may have occurred can be reduced. But \nto forever limit our growth to a preset limit blocks Americans from the \nopportunity of reaching their full potential.\n  If we do move to deflation, if we go into a serious recession at this \npoint, without America's strength, the world's economy could sink to \nDepression-era levels.\n  For the sake of our farmers and our small business owners, for hard-\nworking Americans, and the rest of our economy, and for countries \naround the world, I sincerely hope that Chairman Greenspan and the \nFederal Open Market Committee do not misjudge the current economic \nindicators in the U.S. and worldwide economies.\n  While I am pleased that Chairman Greenspan recently hinted at a \npossible rate cut, I am afraid the Federal Open Market Committee may \nhave already misjudged the ominous economic signs that are out there. I \nonly hope it is not too late. That is why, Mr. President, the Senate \nmust send a clear signal to the Federal Reserve: Lower interest rates \nnow.\n  The Fed must show that it has as much concern for the jobs of \nAmerican workers as it has for the interests of U.S. investors \nthroughout the world. An immediate cut in interest rates will give our \neconomy the boost it needs to maintain its strength during the next \nyear as the fragile nature of many economies throughout the world \nrecovers.\n  So, Mr. President, that is what we need--for this Senate to send a \nclear signal that we have looked at the economy, we have listened to \nour constituents, we have been out in our States; we see it, we feel \nit, we know it. Things are declining --I can tell you that--in the farm \nsector and in rural America. We know what is happening worldwide. Now \nis the time for the Fed to act for a significant cut in interest rates.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I had asked one of the smartest people \nin the Senate on this issue, Senator Domenici, to debate it. And there \nis going to be some discussion of this amendment tomorrow before we \nvote on it. At that time, Senator Domenici will speak about it for our \nside. But I also want to address the issue shortly, but not from the \nstandpoint of the merits of where interest rates ought to be, but just \nthe issue of whether or not it is appropriate to do this on this \nbankruptcy legislation, as well as the whole issue of whether or not \nCongress should try to interfere with the issue of the Federal Reserve \ndeciding what the interest rate should be. Because I think it is fair \nto assume that we want to make sure that interest rates are \nappropriate. But who should make that decision?\n  So I offer this advice to my colleagues on this amendment offered by \nmy colleague from our State of Iowa, Senator Harkin.\n  While we are all for lower interest rates, I think this amendment \nshould be opposed because of the traditional separation of the Federal \nReserve from the political process. What we generally speak of is the \nindependence of the Federal Reserve System. For short, we all speak of \nthe independence of the Fed.\n  This country has a very long history of protecting the work of the \nFederal Reserve from political manipulation. Since the 1930s, Congress \nhas gently refrained from passing legislation in an attempt to \ninfluence monetary policy. In fact, according to the Congressional \nResearch Service, in the past 25 years, Congress has acted on only five \noccasions on legislation that affects the Federal Reserve System. Most \nof these actions have been in the form of nonbinding resolutions or \nreport language. So congressional action of a statutory nature has been \nrare, and when it has been done whenever Congress has spoken on this \nissue, it seems it has had a very tempered approach. Maybe we ought to \nsay that this sense of the Senate is a tempered approach in the sense \nthat it doesn't change statute, but still it is an attempt by a \npolitical body to influence a part of our government that we have \nalways tried to keep immune and separated from politics.\n  There is a sound reason for keeping the Fed independent of this \npolitical process. It is because we in this body, whether we want to \nadmit it or not, tend to think too much for the short-term. We tend to \nthink in terms of the next election rather than the next generation. \nToo often, it is even more personal than that--what can I do to \nincrease my chances of reelection? These short-term policies, as we too \noften find out, can lead to long-run disasters.\n  While increasing the money supply can put more people to work prior \nto an election, of course, it can lead to crippling inflation in the \nlong run. The Fed appropriately is not subjected to the pressures to do \nsomething potentially reckless for the purpose of short-term gain. This \npolicy has served us well for generations and the U.S. economy remains \nthe envy of the world because of it. In fact, in this decade alone, \nmany nations have followed the lead that the United States has \npracticed for over 60 years. They have done this by bringing more \nindependence to their own central banks. Great Britain, under a new \nlabor Prime Minister, has moved to make the Bank of England\n\n[[Page S10711]]\n\nmore independent. Other European Union nations in their new union have \ncommitted to an independent central bank upon the creation of that \nmonetary union which starts January 1, 1999.\n  Furthermore, every nation that has faced a monetary crisis in recent \nmemory has attempted in the name of reform to keep its central bank \nfrom political influences. We saw it in Mexico just 3\\1/2\\ years ago \nwhen the peso declined so rapidly in Mexico. They have moved in that \ndirection. We see it today in Japan, Korea, and Thailand. A major \nreason for each of their economic problems, of course, is the cronyism \nin bank lending practices and political influence over the banking \nsystems. Maybe another way to say it is too much of an incestuous \nrelationship between their corporations and their government, between \ntheir bank and their government, to a point where there was no arm's \nlength transactions; the marketplace did not work appropriately. Nobody \nhad to make a sound business judgment because there was always somebody \nthere to bail them out.\n  These people now, after the crisis in Southeast Asia, have begun to \nsee the wisdom of a central bank, free of political influence. We \nshould recognize the wisdom of it, as well.\n  As I said earlier, we are all for low interest rates. The relatively \nlow interest rate environment that we currently enjoy has allowed \nmillions of Americans to purchase a home for the first time. It has \nkept the cost of doing business for small business and farmers down. It \nhas helped the Federal Government reduce its budget deficit by reducing \nthe costs of the national debt.\n  Instead of pointing fingers at the Fed, Congress should instead focus \non the things that are within its authority that lead to lower interest \nrates, like balancing the budget and reducing Government borrowing. We \nhave been on this course now for the last 3 or 4 years. So, September \n30th of this year for the first time we can tell the people we finished \nthe fiscal year not only with the budget balanced but with paying down, \nprobably 60-billion-some dollars, on the national debt.\n  During this 30-year period of irresponsible Federal spending in which \nthe national debt has been run up to $5.4 billion, and without the \nchanges made in the last 3 or 4 years, at the end of the Clinton \nadministration the debt could have gone to $6.7 billion--at least that \nis what we were projecting in the 1994 budget resolution discussions. \nDuring this period of time of 30 years the Fed has been a \ncounterbalance to an irresponsible Congress, trying to make sure that \ninflation was kept down as a result of fiscal policy that would tend to \ndrive interest rates up for the Federal Government because the Federal \nGovernment always stands first in line for credit and is always willing \nto pay more and will pay more than any other borrower would pay or have \nto pay.\n  Congress has sole constitutional authority over the fiscal policy of \nthis country, and in many respects fiscal policy has had as big an \nimpact on interest rates as monetary policy. For instance, interest \nrates will remain relatively high as long as the Federal Government is \ncompeting with borrowers for money. That is why I find it interesting \nthat often the same Members who want to direct monetary policy at the \nFed tend to vote against sound fiscal policies such as balancing the \nbudget and reducing Government spending.\n  If a Congress did its job of managing fiscal policy better, maybe we \nwouldn't have to worry so much about what the policy of the Federal \nReserve is. Now we are in a position of balancing the budget, paying \ndown some on the national debt, not having the Federal Government \neating up all of the total credit that is needed, the Federal Reserve \njob will be much, much easier.\n  In short, I oppose these efforts to subject the decisionmaking of the \nFederal Reserve to the vagaries of the political process. By most \naccounts, the Fed has been largely responsible for this period of \nunprecedented economic growth fueled by both low interest rates and low \ninflation. So I say that we should stay on course that Congresses for \nthe past 60 years have laid out for us, and that is keeping the Fed \nfree of political influence that has led to economic calamities in so \nmany other parts of the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I just want to respond a little bit to my \ncolleague from Iowa by again pointing out to Senators that while we do \nrespect the independence of the Fed, as we say, some argue that it is \nnot even appropriate to debate monetary policy or to send signals to \nthe Fed.\n  I say to my colleague from Iowa, as William Jackson at the \nCongressional Research Service writes in the report to Congress,\n\n       Constitutional authority to regulate the value of money, \n     and by implication, to determine monetary policy, rests with \n     Congress, article I, section 8 of the Constitution.\n\n  This authority has been largely delegated to the Federal Reserve by \nthe Federal Reserve Act, as amended. Nonetheless, the Fed, as a \ncreature of law, may have its policies dictated as well as its \nstructure changed by Congress. Since the 1930s, Congress has generally \ndeclined from doing either. But in the past 25 years, Congress has \noccasionally legislated more Fed accountability, with an aim towards \ninfluencing policy. And Congress has periodically enacted nonbinding \nlanguage to express its monetary policy preferences to the Fed, with \nthe implication that more structural changes could be forthcoming in \nthe absence of policy response by Fed officials.\n  Again, I think it is not only our right but our duty as Senators to \ndebate monetary policy and to give our thoughts and guidance and \ndirection to the Fed.\n  The Federal Reserve, I keep reminding people, is nowhere mentioned in \nthe Constitution of the United States. It is not a separate branch of \ngovernment. It is not something that is under executive powers \nenumerated in the Constitution. The Constitution gave Congress the \npower to coin money and regulate the value thereof. Of course, we don't \nwant to do that. I would hate to see us do that. So we delegate it. We \nset up the Federal Reserve with the Federal Reserve Act. We amended it \nmany times to do that. And it has worked well.\n  But it still means that as policymakers we have a right and, I think, \nan obligation to send guidance and direction to the Fed about what is \nhappening in the economy and what they ought to do. The last time the \nSenate debated a sense of the Congress calling on the Federal Reserve \nto lower interest rates was on December 19, 1982. It passed by a vote \nof 93 to nothing here in the Senate. Ninety-three to nothing the Senate \npassed a sense-of-the-Senate resolution asking the Fed to lower \ninterest rates.\n  Again, given all of the recent support for interest rate cuts in the \nbusiness community by economists, editorial boards, and political \nleaders on both sides of the aisle, I see no reason why the Senate \nshould not vote unanimously, again, urging the Fed to lower interest \nrates to stem what I and others--not only myself but a lot of others, \nfrom conservative to more liberal economists all over America--are \nsaying: there are ominous signs of a possible recession in the U.S. \neconomy.\n  As I said, even the Chairman of the Fed himself, Chairman Greenspan, \nhas moved in this direction recently. He said encouraging things about \nthe need to perhaps cut interest rates. But I am fearful that the rest \nof the Federal Open Market Committee hasn't gotten the word yet.\n  I think we need to send them the word that what we see as \npolicymakers in our daily lives, what we see in our States, what we see \nin terms of the issues that we deal with in the Senate, that we see an \neconomy that is going down from a 5.5 percent growth rate last quarter \ndown to 1.6 percent next quarter. We see rapidly falling commodity \nprices, especially in the farm sector. We see wages beginning to \nstagnate. We see the 30-year Treasury bonds now lower than the Federal \nfunds rate. There are some very ominous signs out there.\n  This amendment is designed to simply exercise not only our right but, \nI believe, our obligation as Senators to debate this situation.\n  Of course, if Senators don't agree that is what is happening--that \nindeed there may be a recession out there, that there are some signs of \nfalling commodity prices, for example, and of worldwide recession--I \nguess people can debate that. Obviously, if Senators feel the other \nway, they obviously should not vote for a sense-of-the-Congress \namendment like this. But I hope\n\n[[Page S10712]]\n\nthat Senators who feel that they shouldn't vote against it because \nCongress has no right telling the Fed what to do--I would just say look \nat the history.\n  I will have more to say tomorrow about the many times Congress has \npassed some legislation, or sense-of-the-Senate, or sense-of-the-\nCongress resolution giving guidance and direction to the Fed. I hope \nthat we will exercise not only our right but I believe our obligation \nto do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my colleague from Iowa has accurately \nstated what the Constitution says and what we can do. I don't have any \ndispute with that. The only dispute I would have is whether or not it \nwould be wise for Congress to do that after we have had such a success \nof building confidence in the economy when there is an absence of \ncongressional manipulation of monetary policy. I fear if there is a \nperception in the private sector of Congress from time to time making \nan impact upon monetary policy, that is going to build in protection \nfor people who are investing and, consequently, drive interest rates \nup. We don't want that to happen.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, my colleague Senator Grassley \nintroduced Senate Joint Resolution 56, a bill cosponsored by Senator \nKyl and me that expresses the sense of Congress in opposing efforts in \nvarious States to legalize marijuana and other Schedule I drugs for so-\ncalled medical use. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, and I \nwant everyone to understand that current drug laws should not be \ncircumvented by allowing illegal harmful drugs to be introduced freely \nin our society.\n  Last week, an identical measure sponsored by Congressman McCollum \npassed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 310 to 93.\n  Mr. President, proponents of legalization argue that marijuana and \nother drugs are needed by those living with pain and disease. They \nstress that these drugs improve the quality of life and should not be \ndenied to those suffering. I understand their argument that we need to \nbe compassionate to those that are suffering. My heart goes out to \nthose people living with disease and to the families that care for \nthem. Nevertheless, those arguments are flawed, and we cannot allow \nthis legalization effort to contravene our Federal drug laws.\n  In 1996, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing and examined the drug \nlegalization initiatives in California and Arizona. We heard testimony \nfrom many of those involved in the war on drugs including General Barry \nR. McCaffrey, Director, Office of National Drug Control Policy, and Mr. \nThomas A. Constantine, Administrator, Drug Enforcement Administration. \nAs a result of chairing that hearing, I learned that there is \noverwhelming evidence showing that marijuana is not a medicine and that \nits use by those suffering from cancer and other diseases is \ncontradicted by the many side effects of the drug use. The testimony \ngiven at that hearing proved to me that the growing legalization \nmovement in our States is harmful to the very people they are proposing \nto help.\n  As many of you know, I have not been afraid to speak out and to urge \nthat this administration do more to stem the rising tide against \nteenage drug abuse in our country. Illegal drug use by teenagers is one \nof the most serious domestic problems facing our Nation today: in my \nmind, it may be the most crucial issue for our Nation's ability to \ncraft productive and law-abiding citizens. The worsening problem of \ndrug abuse among our children and teens wreaks havoc on the lives and \npotential of thousands of young people each year. Legalization \nmovements send a confusing message to the Nation's youth and threaten \nto increase the already alarming rise in drug use among teenagers. If \nwe do not act decisively, we will pay a heavy price.\n  For example, the results of the latest National Household Survey on \nDrug Abuse found that drug use among our children is climbing at an \nalarming rate. The number of children ages 12 to 17 using illicit drugs \nhas more than doubled since 1992. Between 1996 and 1997 alone, drug use \namong 12- and 13-year-olds increased almost 75 percent.\n  The abuse of marijuana, a drug many widely consider a gateway drug to \nmore serious substance abuse, more than doubled among children between \n1992 and 1997, increasing 75 percent between 1996 and 1997 alone. Not \nsurprisingly, the rate of minors first trying heroin is at its highest \nlevel in 30 years, and the rate of minors trying cocaine and \nhallucinogens has more than doubled in the 90's.\n  Although deeply troubling, this disturbing trend should come as no \nsurprise to this administration. I warned this administration as early \nas 1993 that its failure to take the issue seriously and take strong \naction to fight drug abuse would prove disastrous to our children. \nUnfortunately, the evidence is now in and my predictions were all too \nprophetic to the great detriment of our children and future \ngenerations.\n  Our country's laws prohibiting narcotic and dangerous drug use are \nnot arbitrary. These laws are designed to protect our children and to \nprotect mature adults from harmful chemicals. These laws should be \nfully enforced because they help prevent drug experimentation and drug \naddiction.\n  Promoting the use of marijuana for so-called medical purposes is \nnothing more than a sham effort to legalize drugs through the back \ndoor. If we do not act decisively, we will pay a heavy price.\n  In the words of General McCaffrey, our Drug Czar, ``[additive drugs \nwere criminalized because they are harmful; they are not harmful \nbecause they were criminalized.]'' The more a product is available and \nlegitimized, the greater will be its use. If drugs were legalized in \nthe U.S., the cost to the individual and society would grow \nastronomically.\n  The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is the key law by which \nlegitimate drug products are evaluated and regulated in this country. A \ncentral precept of this law is that all drugs be proven safe and \neffective under their labeled indications. Proponents of medicinal uses \nof marijuana should not be exempt from this basic public health \nrequirement. Anecdotal reports that marijuana may be beneficial should \nnot cloud the fact that only controlled clinical trials can meet the \nexacting licensure requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct. If there is, in fact, a medical benefit from marijuana then it is \nimperative that the necessary scientific studies be conducted to assess \nand confirm such benefit. To date, proponents of medical uses of \nmarijuana have been unwilling or unable to come through the front door \nof the FDA with evidence of its safety and efficacy. The \npharmacological armamentarium contains many proven drugs to treat pain. \nIt is poor public policy to acquiesce in back door mechanisms that \npermit unsafe and unproven products like marijuana to reach the \nbedsides of American patients.\n  I believe this to be an important resolution and urge my colleagues \nto join me and Senators Grassley and Kyl in sending a clear message to \nthose who advocate the legalization of marijuana and other Schedule I \ndrugs for medical use in our States. I ask for their support when this \njoint resolution comes to the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10713-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10713-S10716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n INAUGURAL ADDRESS OF HIS EXCELLENCY ANDRES PASTRANA ARANGO, PRESIDENT \n                              OF COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on August 7, 1998, Andres Pastrana Arango \nwas sworn in as the 60th President of Colombia, 28 years after his \nfather, Misael Pastrana, took the same oath of office. A former \njournalist, mayor of Bogota, and Senator, president candidate Andres \nPastrana swept into office with the largest electoral margin in his \ncountry's history.\n  With the election of President Pastrana I believe that a new \nopportunity has been created for the United\n\n[[Page S10714]]\n\nStates and Colombia to work closely together to deal with issues of \nmutual concern to our two countries. I very much hope that both of our \ngovernments will take advantage of this opening because it is in the \ninterests of both countries that we do so.\n  In his inaugural speech of August 7, President Pastrana set forth his \nagenda for his term of office. Breaking the stranglehold of major \nnarcotrafficking organizations and bringing peace to Colombia are among \nPresident Pastrana's highest priorities. During the course of his \naddress, he laid out his plans to end the 34 year old civil war and to \ncounter drug trafficking and the violence and corruption it brings with \nit. In order to tackle the financial, political and social problems of \nhis country, he also pledged to undertake a complete turnaround in \nColombia's Government during his administration.\n  I believe that President Pastrana has been very quick in shaping the \noutline of policies and programs that should help to strengthen \ndemocratic institutions in Colombia and respect for human rights. His \ninaugural address gives me hope that the United States working together \nwith the Government of Colombia can make that a reality. I would urge \nmy colleagues to take the opportunity to read for themselves President \nPastrana's Inaugural address. I ask unanimous consent that his address \nbe printed in full at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection; it is so ordered. (See \nExhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, President Pastrana is visiting the United \nStates this week, and the Committee on Foreign Relations will have the \nhonor of receiving him on September 24. At that time we will have an \nopportunity to discuss at length President Pastrana's vision for his \ncountry. I look forward to the opportunity to do so.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Inaugural Speech as President of the Republic by Mr. Andres Pastrana \n                                 Arango\n\n       This day is not only mine, but of all of us Colombians. The \n     solemn oath that I have taken today before almighty God and \n     before you is a sacrament of our democracy. It is an oath \n     pronounced throughout our history that, in this case, \n     acquires a greater dimension since it requires that we \n     likewise succeed in the fulfillment of our obligations and \n     not repeat the errors of the past. Proud of our heritage, we \n     are now going to seek the best for our future.\n       We are not only conferring the presidency upon me today; we \n     are also inaugurating a new era for Colombia on the right \n     path. I make a commitment to myself and to you to govern \n     without privileges nor discriminations, but for all \n     Colombians. Those who hold the highest positions in \n     government shall have the greatest obligations under the law, \n     and those who think that power gives one the right to break \n     the law shall not govern. Put simply, there shall be no room \n     for corruption in my administration and it shall not be \n     tolerated nor forgiven. I want--and I shall accept nothing \n     less--this administration to go down in history as the \n     cleanest of all administrations.\n       Within the immense margin of our challenges, let us risk \n     facing the big changes that we need. Let us again trust that \n     our cities and our countryside become safe and peaceful. Let \n     us believe that once again our industry and our agriculture \n     will prosper, that our children will receive a good \n     education, that their health will be protected, and that \n     their parents will be safe from the scourge of unemployment.\n       Fulfilling these expectations implies serious and sustained \n     efforts, a common cause and the uncommon courage to gather \n     new ideas and be willing to never quit nor give up.\n       For change does not happen in a week, a month, or a year. \n     Perhaps, it will not even be complete at the end of this \n     administration. We are at the dawn of a new era, not yet in \n     its splendor. But change begins today.\n       We have vast natural resources but, more importantly, great \n     human talent. If we prepare ourselves conscientiously, we \n     should not fear the economy's globalization. On the contrary, \n     we shall welcome it and we shall compete and prosper within \n     it.\n       I see a Colombia proudly acknwoeldged in our hemisphere and \n     in the entire world, for navigating through the prodigies of \n     cyberspace and not in the artificial paradises of cocaine. I \n     see a proud Colombia, with enough authority to challenge \n     other nations to control their own drug demand, because we \n     were able to combat our own country's supply and demand.\n       As President, I shall not surrender even a bit of our \n     sovereighnty, but I shall appeal to the entire country to \n     comply with the law and to build the prosperity that shall \n     make Colombia a magnet for investment with its modern \n     economy.\n       We shall look for prosperity not only in industry and \n     enterprise, but also in agriculture, which has been abused of \n     for many years without being paid its due. We are going to \n     invest more in the countryside. Let us not forget that the \n     land is the soul of Colombia and that those who cultivate it \n     are the soul of the land.\n       Colombians, during my campaign I proposed ten great \n     changes. Each one of them is equally important and they shall \n     all be promoted. We must try again, and trust once again, \n     that we can change and attain a better country. I ask for \n     your help, for, more than the decisions of a President, it is \n     your hands that shall mold the final substance of our \n     efforts.\n       To the people of Colombia, I owe the privilege of being the \n     leader that shall close the doors of the 20th century and \n     open those of the 21st century, towards the vast horizon of \n     the Third Millenium. I have been given the responsibility of \n     continuing and improving, wherever possible, the \n     accomplishments of other leaders. But more than six million \n     Colombians, and a broad consensus of the country, have chosen \n     me to find the road to this Promised Land that Colombia \n     should be.\n\n\n                          A colombia in peace\n\n       A very wise Spanish saying says, ``Without peace, there is \n     no bread''. Therefore, first of all, I want peace, which \n     means peace and bread. And it is the Promised Land that we \n     yearn for, a Colombia in peace.\n       But reconciliation requires a government that is able to \n     organize collective leadership for peace. This implies \n     sacrifices, requires renunciation, and demands serious \n     commitments that would be sterile, as long as Cain continues \n     killing Abel.\n       The President of the Republic assumes the non-renounceable \n     leadership of building peace. Do not expect me to build a \n     bureaucracy for peace. As of now, I invite all Colombians to \n     continue and to work within the ``Agenda for Peace'' that I \n     am going to lead.\n       It must be clear for every one that I shall recover for the \n     State the monopoly of force for peace, social justice, and \n     the happiness of the Colombian people. Every minute that we \n     save on war is an investment in life. International \n     cooperation in our peace processes should not be viewed as \n     the inability to build it ourselves, but as a new way of \n     making peace.\n       The call to peace as a necessary condition for the \n     country's project is evident. But peace demands the \n     transformation of the human energy of animosity, which is \n     characteristic of wars, into vital energy for the \n     reconstruction of a new Colombia.\n       It is precisely this vital energy that should not permit \n     that violent acts, like those of recent days, occur again; \n     acts that fill me, like their families and all my countrymen, \n     with pain. They do not contribute to the atmosphere of \n     understanding that we, myself personally and my entire \n     administration, are ready to propitiate by putting all of our \n     efforts into it.\n       The first question is that of identity. What is Colombia \n     and what do we want it to be? Historically, the nation looked \n     for its identity in a homogeneity that was excluding, which \n     despised diversity or nullified it. A country demanded a \n     religion, a language, and even a dominant ethnic group. From \n     dictatorial positions or from republican pacts, these \n     conditions of identity were being imposed for an indefinite \n     time to conform other systems of power. A subsequent \n     evolution, particularly the current one, demonstrates that \n     those that have been excluded in any way, usually demand, \n     with great violence, the acknowledgment of their existence \n     and their right to participate. The point is that the \n     identity of the new Colombia that faces the challenges of the \n     21st century and is handed over to the new generations must \n     be inclusive of Colombian diversity, not exclusive, as it has \n     been until now for a significant number of Colombians. \n     Keeping the nation united must be the origin and the end of \n     this historic determination in favor of peace.\n\n\n               a model for development and social justice\n\n       I receive a country with seriously affected economic \n     indicators and with its public finances in ruin. I, \n     therefore, intend to do an inventory of the conditions in \n     which I received them. But we shall also promptly present, in \n     the coming weeks, the great guidelines of the measures to be \n     taken in order to bring Colombia out of the situation in \n     which we found it.\n       A fundamental part of this recovery program is budget \n     adjustments. Our country cannot continue to carelessly spend \n     beyond its possibilities. If we did so, the already serious \n     unemployment situation that we inherited would be even more \n     overwhelming. And the imbalances everywhere would make the \n     economy unmanageable and would commit the development of the \n     country for a long time. Therefore we shall rigorously \n     dedicate ourselves, from the very first days of this \n     administration, to putting the fiscal house in order.\n       But we shall not only organize public finances. We also \n     have to reactivate an equitable economic growth. The \n     development plan that the administration must submit to \n     Congress within the first six months, as stated by the \n     Constitution, shall be the opportunity to draft the \n     navigational chart that shall permit us to open the doors of \n     the 21st century to a society with better and more equal \n     growth. In this purpose, the search for peace is not only a \n     common yearning but also an intelligent strategy for economic \n     development. Peace is the most urgent task on our country's \n     agenda and the best social contract that we can make towards \n     the future.\n\n\n                            drug trafficking\n\n       We must take advantage of the closing of the century to do \n     an inventory of the serious\n\n[[Page S10715]]\n\n     damage caused to society by drug trafficking. Ecologically, \n     there is no doubt that it is the main predator of large areas \n     of Colombian territory, which is valued in the world for the \n     diversity of its environmental treasures.\n       Not to mention, the increase in corruption, whose effect on \n     institutions has become one of the most fatal aggressors that \n     the Colombian State has confronted in all its history. Or the \n     increase in violence, due to easy money for the attainment of \n     objectives that used to be the fruit of years and years of \n     honest labor. Or the increase in drug use.\n       If Colombia survives in spite of so many misfortunes, it is \n     only because of the moral fortitude of a people that has \n     known how to face them. But let us not ask it for more \n     miracles.\n\n\n           the ``peace fund'' with tri-partite contributions\n\n       In order to reach this national objective, besides the \n     political initiatives that we are implementing, peace shall \n     be the common thread of the next development plan. It shall \n     be funded by tri-partite contributions from different \n     sources. Firstly, the government itself, which, as a \n     consequence of the austerity program to be undertaken, shall \n     free significant resources to be earmarked for strategic \n     investments for peace. Secondly, contributions from the \n     international community that has demonstrated its interest in \n     collaborating financially to acclimatize peace in Colombia. \n     And thirdly, monies that wealthy Colombians shall contribute, \n     through a ``Peace Bond of Compulsory Subscription'', whose \n     authorization we shall request from Congress, and through \n     which the valuable demonstrations of so many good-willed \n     Colombians may become concrete.\n       As I said in my campaign, we shall submit a bill before \n     Congress that shall permit the gradual reduction of the \n     Aggregated Value Tax while simultaneously and forcefully \n     combating current tax evasion. Moreover, once the fiscal \n     adjustment program yields results, we shall propose a \n     reduction of income tax rates for those companies generating \n     new employment.\n\n\n                           our foreign policy\n\n       The transparent and categorical mandate that I have \n     received from the Colombian people must also transform our \n     international position in order to carry out a foreign policy \n     with a broad consensus, that is coherent and systematic, that \n     overcomes the exclusivism of any group, region, or party. Our \n     diplomacy shall be efficient, able to work without \n     disadvantages, respectful of commitments and aware of its \n     non-renounceable dignity and its well-earned rights.\n       I am convinced that the irreversible purpose of \n     globalization demands a more equitable international order. \n     We do not want to be simple spectators but, rather, diligent \n     actors in this new world commitment.\n       I am aware that our international agenda demands a \n     different way of looking at it. We do not reject \n     responsibility. We assume it. Our foreign policy shall be \n     aimed at strengthening our negotiating power with regards to \n     fundamental issues on the global agenda. We shall reaffirm \n     our commitment to the promotion and defense of human rights \n     and International Humanitarian Law, with acts and effective \n     actions.\n       As President of the Republic, I shall fully exercise the \n     constitutional duty of leading foreign relations, aware that \n     the leadership of the Head of State in a regime like ours is \n     irreplaceable.\n       Our foreign policy shall be guided by the protection of \n     Colombia's essential rights. We share the great principles \n     contained in the United Nations Charter and in the \n     instruments of the Inter American system. Colombia's \n     international word is sacred to us. We defend the sanctity of \n     treaties and the good faith in relations among States. We \n     have always supported the pacific and negotiated solution to \n     conflicts. National heritage is the product of law, never of \n     force or of arbitrary imposition. We believe in the force of \n     multilateralism, in the collective action organized to \n     confront problems and to prevent and resolve divergences and \n     conflicts.\n       Venezuela is the country with which Colombia has made more \n     progress in economic integration. The strong historic and \n     cultural ties that unite us shall permit us to foster \n     understanding in all areas in order to continue making \n     progress in the process of binational integration and in the \n     consolidation of the Andean Community of Nations in order to \n     project it to the entire continent.\n       The United States, as hemispheric power and because it is \n     the biggest and most advanced economy in the world, is a \n     fundamental country for Colombia's international relations. \n     We also begin a new era of understanding and trust with them, \n     which will permit the diversification of our common agenda so \n     as to continue on the road of true cooperation, more as \n     brothers than as good neighbors.\n       Regarding Europe and the Pacific Basin countries, we shall \n     continue strengthening our economic and cultural relations, \n     as well as the ties among the various integration blocks that \n     exist today. In this respect, we shall assign particular \n     importance to the European Union, Latin American and \n     Caribbean Summit that will take place next year, as a result \n     of the dialogue between the European Union and the Rio Group.\n       Colombia embarks today on search of the international \n     community, to re-assume the leadership that belongs to it in \n     the ``New World'' design.\n\n\n                             Social Justice\n\n       This is evident: peace is not possible without social \n     justice. Colombia is a society torn by social distances. It \n     is urgent, therefore, to improve the distribution of national \n     wealth, to make society cohesive and direct it towards peace, \n     through education, health and employment.\n       The world is changing in giant leaps. Society has \n     discovered that its great source of wealth is no longer \n     mineral but human. To invest in it, as well as in our natural \n     resources, is the change that will make us strong. And this, \n     in turn, compels us to reflect upon the meaning of continued \n     fighting over scarce material resources instead of \n     strengthening our democracy and developing our industry and \n     our trade, based on human resources, education, technology, \n     and science.\n       Therefore, it is time to break with history and to change \n     our course. Thus, the development model that I propose to you \n     is not dependent upon peace negotiations but, rather, \n     establishes the basis for a transparent, fertile, and lasting \n     peace.\n\n\n                       The economy and employment\n\n       The macroeconomic effort shall be aimed at the urgent \n     generation of employment. To generate employment--good \n     employment--is essential if we want to have a real future. \n     Employment is not only the new name for peace but also our \n     first expression of solidarity.\n       In order to attain the goals of collective improvement, it \n     is necessary to build a strong and solidary economy, which we \n     are lacking today. Correcting the imbalances and channeling \n     the economy towards development and full employment again \n     will initially demand the adoption of severe but essential \n     measures.\n       Economy and education must go hand in hand to establish the \n     basis for progress. The coming Third Millennium needs new \n     learning. We are going to change education in Colombia so \n     that it may become an open door, where the question will not \n     be how much money the family has but, rather, how much talent \n     the student has. Awakening young people to knowledge is the \n     only way to face the future successfully.\n\n\n                    Preferential Option for the Poor\n\n       My administration makes and reaffirms a preferential option \n     for the poor. We do not want a Colombia with excluded \n     persons. The government's task is to foster and consolidate \n     economic growth that will reduce the injustices of poverty \n     and demonstrate, with its results, that it is worthwhile to \n     be just.\n       For my administration, the poor are a moral commitment, a \n     political commitment, an economic commitment, a cultural \n     commitment, and not just a statistic index. A plan for \n     overcoming poverty convokes, channels, and opens new \n     dimensions for international cooperation and must prevent \n     poverty from being the dangerous ally of those who, with drug \n     trafficking, try to undermine the foundations of the nation \n     and of the international community.\n       Being solidary in Colombia means helping to create jobs, \n     investing in the creation of jobs, buying at a fair price to \n     create and foster the quality of those jobs. When I think of \n     globalization, I think about its most urgent aspect, which \n     is globalization of solidarity.\n\n\n                           recovering values\n\n       This is why, together with Gustavo Bell, I would like to \n     invite all of you to recover values. This country must \n     organize itself and become strong against corruption. We \n     cannot continue to tolerate the systematic robbery of goods \n     belonging to the community. It is necessary to end \n     corruption, and the people have taken a first step with their \n     vote. The President and each one of his officials must be a \n     model for others. Their words must be truthful and their \n     example must be clear. There is no greater corruption or lie \n     than good advice followed by bad example.\n       Let no one be wrong. The government shall persecute the \n     corrupt, shall bring them to light, and shall rescue the \n     institutions from the claws of the corrupt.\n\n\n                     the need for political reform\n\n       For all these reasons, a thorough political reform must be \n     undertaken. ``We cannot pour new wine into old vessels.'' The \n     recovery of politics for the common good, for social justice, \n     for solidarity, and for development requires the creation of \n     new forms of governing, of controlling, of competing for \n     power, of designing laws, of creating the future.\n       I thank God for the privilege of having my mother and \n     family here present. I thank Divine Providence for the gift \n     of Nohra's company and leadership and of Santiago, Laura, and \n     Valentina's challenging future.\n       And I thank the Lord for having given me in Misael Pastrana \n     a living example of values, of loyalty to life, of love of \n     country. He was a patriot who, in light of Colombia's destiny \n     and uncertainties, affirm and warn, ``the promised land is at \n     stake''. It is necessary for ``The New Dawn'' brings us \n     optimism, faith, truth, solidarity, and the commitment \n     required to change history because no one will do for us what \n     we must do for ourselves.\n       Dear friends: A ``New Dawn'' begins now! Today, it is not \n     only the inauguration of a new President, but also the \n     opening of a new era for the nation. With Gustavo Bell we \n     will make the dream of ``The Great Alliance for Change'' come \n     true for Colombia.\n       The glory of a leader consists in attaining peace, striving \n     for the citizens' well-being and happiness. Achieving this \n     shall be the\n\n[[Page S10716]]\n\n     only reward I will aspire to at the end of my mandate. This \n     is no time for hesitation or doubt. This is a moment for \n     decisions and courage. Long and difficult is the road leading \n     to the Colombia we yearn for. Let us begin now! Tomorrow will \n     be another day!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10713-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, in a time of unprecedented economic \nprosperity, we have seen a reduction in inflation and unemployment yet \na full-time minimum wage earner makes almost $3,000 below the poverty \nlevel--a mere $10,712 per year. No one who works full time should be \npoor in this country--it's time to raise the minimum wage.\n  Republicans say that raising the minimum wage will cause job loss and \nput undue burdens on business owners. But in a recent study conducted \nby Princeton economists David Card and Alan Krueger, their analysis of \nNew Jersey's minimum wage increase in 1992 showed that employment in \nfast food restaurants grew at least as quickly as in neighboring \nPennsylvania where the minimum wage stayed the same. Also noted in the \nstudy was that higher wages actually benefitted employers--turnover \nexpenses were reduced and productivity improved due to better motivated \nand more stable employees. Mr. President, it's time to raise the \nminimum wage.\n  Additionally, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that \nsince the 1996-97 wage increases took effect, 4 million new jobs have \nbeen created and unemployment is at 4.5%--its lowest level in a \ngeneration. In fact, a study by the Economic Policy Institute documents \nthat there was no measurable negative effect on jobs. The only \nmeasurable effect was on workers--they received the pay increases they \ndeserved. Mr. President, it's time to raise the minimum wage.\n  Contrary to what has been said by my colleagues on the opposite side \nof the aisle, workers who will benefit from this increase are not \nprimarily teenagers from high income families. 70% are adults over the \nage of 20 and forty percent of minimum wage workers are the sole bread \nwinners in their families. As a matter of fact, the average minimum \nwage earner brings home half of their family's income. Additionally, \n60% of minimum wage earners are women. Mr. President, it's time to \nraise the minimum wage.\n  In 1979, minimum wage earners needed to work an average of 40 hours \nper week to stay out of poverty. Today those same workers must work 52 \nhours. By raising the minimum wage one dollar by the year 2000 we will \nrestore its purchasing power to its mid-1970's level. With unemployment \nlevels 50% to 75% lower and inflation rates 2 to 3 times lower, we can \nafford to restore that purchasing power. Mr. President, it's time to \nraise the minimum wage.\n  It is time to honor the American working people with a fair wage. As \nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt said, ``Our nation, so richly endowed \nwith natural resources and with a capable and industrious population, \nshould be able to devise ways and means of insuring to all able-bodied \nworking men and women a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.'' I call \nupon my colleagues in the Senate to begin narrowing the gap between \nrich and poor in this country. We must help bring economic prosperity \nto the men and women who feed our families, care for our children and \nelderly parents, and play by the rules. It's time to help working \nfamilies and it's time to raise the minimum wage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10716-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CAL RIPKEN'S STREAK OF PLAYING 2,632 CONSECUTIVE GAMES\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, Sunday, September 20, 1998 marked the \nend of an era in sports. Cal Ripken, baseball's Iron Man, took a well-\ndeserved day off. As the Baltimore Sun put it, ``The Streak died of \nnatural causes. It was 2,632.''\n  Cal Ripken sat in the dugout Sunday night not because of injury, or \nillness, or a manager's decision. Cal voluntarily took himself out of \nthe lineup because he felt he was not playing up to his own standards, \nand would not contribute enough to the team. Cal's quietly monumental \ndecision exemplifies the dignity and class with which he has conducted \nhimself throughout his career.\n  When Cal Ripken began his streak in 1982, Ronald Reagan was \nPresident, I was a Congresswoman, ``Dallas'' was the most popular TV \nshow, and the movie ``ET'' was setting box office records. A baby born \nthat year is about to be a junior in high school. Ryan Minor, who \nplayed in Cal's place Sunday night, was 8 years old.\n  I was in the stands September 6, 1995, the night that Cal played game \nnumber 2,131. I've watched history being made on the Senate floor, but \nthat night I watched history being made on the glorious green field of \nCamden Yards. I will never forget the joy we all felt as the banners \nrolled, the light bulbs flashed, and Cal took his victory lap.\n  Records are made to be broken, but I can't imagine Cal's record being \nbroken in our lifetime. The next closest player, Albert Belle, would \nhave to play in every game for the next 14 years to equal The Streak.\n  What Cal has accomplished is simple: Every day for the last 16 years, \nhe got up, got dressed, and went to work. He represents the old-\nfashioned ethic displayed by millions of Marylanders every day as they \nwork hard, play by the rules, and take care of their families. It's not \nfancy, it's not flashy, but it is the glue that holds our communities, \nour society, and our nation together.\n  So to Cal Ripken, I say hats off, thank you for being you, and thank \nyou for showing all of us how it's supposed to be done.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10716-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10716-S10719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE OMNIBUS PATENT ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been working diligently along with \nSenators Daschle, Bingaman, Cleland, Boxer, Harkin, and Lieberman to \nget this measure considered and passed by the Senate. It an important \nmeasure to America's future.\n  Along with all the Democratic cosponsors of the bill, I signed on to \noffering our patent bill as an amendment to this bankruptcy bill. I \nhelped provide an opportunity for this amendment in the unanimous \nconsent agreement accepted by the Senate on Friday September, 11th. It \nis long past time for the Senate to consider this patent reform \nlegislation.\n  Unfortunately, Republican opposition to the bill has prevented Senate \nconsideration for more than a year. This is another example of how \nsecret, anonymous holds on the Republican side are preventing important \nlegislation from being considered by the Senate. I deeply regret that \nthose same Republican objections have now succeeded in preventing our \nRepublican cosponsor, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nfrom even offering this amendment to the bill in the amendment spot \nthat we had reserved for that purpose. I believe that there is strong \nsupport for this measure. I cannot guarantee that all 45 Democratic \nSenators will vote for it, but I do know that no Democrat has prevented \nor is now preventing its consideration.\n\n[[Page S10717]]\n\n  I want to thank Secretary Daley and the Administration for their \nunflagging support of effective patent reform. Our patent bill would be \ngood for Vermont, good for American innovators of all sizes, and good \nfor America. Unfortunately, the Republican majority or some secret \nminority of that Republican majority will not allow patent reform to \nproceed.\n\n\n                      Overview of the Patent Bill\n\n  The Patent Bill would reform the U.S. patent system in important \nways. It would: reduce legal fees that are paid by inventors and \ncompanies; eliminate duplication of research efforts and accelerate \nresearch into new areas; increase the value of patents to inventors and \ncompanies; and facilitate U.S. inventors and companies' research, \ndevelopment, and commercialization of inventions.\n  In Vermont, we have a number of independent inventors and small \ncompanies. It is, therefore, especially important to me that this bill \nbe one that helps them as well as the larger companies in Vermont like \nIBM. So I talked to independent inventors and representatives of \nsmaller companies to see what reforms they recommended. I have tried to \nmake sure that their recommendations were incorporated into the Patent \nBill as the legislation has advanced through Congress.\n\n\n                          legislative history\n\n  The reforms that would be implemented with the passage of this \nlegislation have been subject to careful and deliberate consideration \nby Congress. In fact, over the past several years, Congress has held \neight Congressional hearings with over 80 witnesses testifying about \nthe various proposals incorporated in the Patent Bill.\n  Republican and Democratic Administrations alike, reaching back to the \nJohnson Administration, have supported these reforms. Last year, five \nformer Patent Commissioners sent a letter to the President and to the \nmembers of the Senate supporting the Patent Bill.\n  In addition to the thorough consideration that has been given these \nreforms over the years, the Senate has given close scrutiny this \nCongress to the bill before us today. The Senate Judiciary Committee \nheld a hearing on this legislation on May 7, 1997. The Committee heard \ntestimony of Senator Frank Lautenberg, Representative Henry Hyde; \nRepresentative Howard Coble; Representative Dana Rohrabacher; \nRepresentative Marcy Kaptur; the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and \nCommissioner of Patents and Trademarks; the Executive Director of the \nAmerican Intellectual Property Law Association; the Vice President of \nthe International Trademark Association; the President and CEO of a \nsmall business in Utah; and Bill Parker, President of the Vermont \nInventors Association.\n  After the hearing, Senator Hatch and I worked to address the concerns \nof independent inventors, small businesses, universities, the \nAdministration, and other Senators. We made several changes to the \nlegislation, which I think significantly improved the Patent Bill. Let \nme give you some examples of the changes that we made to the \nlegislation: (1) any applicant who does not apply for a patent overseas \ncan elect NOT to have early publication of their patent (2) any \napplicant who diligently prosecutes a patent application will receive a \nfull 17 years of patent protection; (3) non-profit research \nlaboratories or other nonprofit entities such as universities, research \ncenters, or hospitals can petition the Commissioner of Patents and \nTrademarks for additional patent protection; and (4) the United States \nPatent and Trademark Office (PTO) must develop statewide computer \nnetworks with remote library sites to enhance access to information in \nstate patent and trademark depository libraries for independent \ninventors and small businesses in rural states.\n  On May 22, Senator Hatch and I offered a substitute amendment with \nthese changes. Every member of the Committee, save one, voted in favor \nof the Hatch/Leahy substitute amendment.\n  After the markup, the White House Conference on Small Businesses, \nwhich consists of over 2000 delegates elected from hundreds of \nthousands of active small businesses nationwide, made additional \nsuggestions on how to improve the bill. Senator Hatch and I agreed to \nincorporate their suggested changes into a substitute amendment to the \nPatent Bill, and I am pleased to report that as a result, the White \nHouse Conference on Small Businesses, the National Association of Women \nBusiness Owners, the National Venture Capital Association, National \nSmall Business United, and the Small Business Technology Coalition has \nconcluded that, if enacted, this bill would be of great benefit to \nsmall businesses.\n\n\n                        TITLE BY TITLE ANALYSIS\n\n  Unfortunately, because of Republican opposition to this bipartisan \nbill, the Senate will have no opportunity to consider this legislation \nto assist U.S. inventors small and large. I find this particularly \nunfortunate since our Patent Bill was geared toward improving the \noperational efficiency at the PTO and making government smaller and \nleaner. I would like to provide a title-by-title overview of the \nsubstitute amendment to the Patent Bill that Senator Hatch and I were \nprepared to offer as an amendment to the bankruptcy bill.\n     Title I of the amendment: PTO reforms\n  Title I of the amendment would have made some modest, albeit \nimportant, reforms to the PTO. It provides that the PTO shall not be \nsubject to any administratively or statutorily imposed limitation on \npositions or personnel. This should allow the PTO to hire the necessary \nnumber of examiners to review the increasing number of applications \nreceived by the office. Title I also creates a Patent Management \nAdvisory Board and a Trademark Management Advisory Board. Of the five \nmembers of the Patent Management Advisory Board, not more than three \nshall be members of the same political party, at least one member shall \nbe an independent inventor, and the members shall include individuals \nwho represent small and large entity patent applicants located in the \nUnited States in proportion to the number of applications files by such \nmembers.\n     Title II of the amendment: Publication of Patent Applications\n  Title II of the amendment responds to the concerns of independent \ninventors and small businesses regarding the matter of 18-month \npublication. These concerns were articulated at the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee hearing by the President of the Vermont Inventors \nAssociation, Bill Parker. Mr. Parker suggested giving applicants who \nonly file in the United States a choice whether or not to publish \nearly. He also recommended that we enhance the protections granted to \nthose who choose 18-month publication if we wish to encourage them to \ntake that course.\n  Title II does both of these things. In particular, it allows any \napplicant to avoid publication before the granting of the patent simply \nby making such a request upon filing the application and by certifying \nthat their application has not--and will not--be published abroad. The \nsubstitute also provides for the issuance of patents on individual \nclaims in published applications as they are approved, rather than \nwaiting for the disposition of all claims contained in such an \napplication, as now occurs. This allows applicants to gain full patent \nprotection--including reasonable royalties, damages, and attorneys fees \nwhen appropriate--for some of their component inventions earlier than \nthey would have under the original draft of the bill.\n  This new Title II in our substitute amendment will benefit U.S. \nresearchers and manufacturers who will have early English language \naccess to the applications filed with the PTO that are of foreign \norigin. This bill measures the 18-month publication period from the \nearliest patent application date anywhere in the world. Since foreign-\norigin applications typically are filed abroad 12 months before they \nare filed here, those applications will be published 6 months after \nthey are filed in the U.S.; that is a year earlier than domestic-origin \napplications. This will level the playing field with foreign countries \nthat already are publishing our applications in their languages within \n6 months after our applications are filed abroad.\n     Title III of the amendment: Patent Term Restoration\n  In 1995, GATT changed the U.S. patent term from 17 years from \nissuance to 20 years from filing. On average, this new term does not \nresult in loss of patent term. It is still possible, however, that an \nindividual patentee would have\n\n[[Page S10718]]\n\nless patent term under the post-GATT term than under the pre-GATT term. \nTo remedy this situation, Title II of the substitute amendment restores \npatent term lost to ``unusual administrative delay'' by the PTO and \nguarantees all diligent applicants a minimum 17-year term.\n  More specifically, the 1995 law authorizes patent extensions for only \n5 years, and authorizes extensions only for PTO delays occurring in \nthree specific situations: interference proceedings, imposition of \nsecrecy orders, and appellate review. Title II of the substitute \namendment makes extensions available to compensate for any type of \ndelay by the PTO--extensions up to 10 years in the case of appellate \nreview or unusual administrative delay, and unlimited extensions for \ndelays caused by secrecy orders and interference proceedings.\n     Title IV of the amendment: Prior Domestic Commercial Use\n  Title IV of the amendment will provide protection against an \ninfringement suit for anyone who has commercially used an invention for \nmore than a year before another person files for a patent on an \ninvention. In raising this defense, the burden of proof will be on the \nperson claiming the defense, not the patent holder. This provision will \nprotect the unsophisticated entrepreneur from being ruined. Under \ncurrent law, an independent entrepreneur who has invested perhaps his \nor her entire life savings to produce and market an invention can be \nshut down completely by someone else who comes along much later and \ngets a patent on the same invention. A prior use right will protect \nindependent entrepreneurs from this financial disaster.\n\n     Title V of the amendment: Patent Reexamination Reform\n  Although the goal of the original re-examination provisions--reducing \nlegal bills for patent applicants--was laudable, I was concerned that \nthe legislation protect against harassment by third parties. Title V of \nthe amendment now requires that everyone who requests reexamination of \na patent to identify the real party in interest that they represent. It \ncontinues to limit the grounds for patent invalidity that can be raised \nduring a reexamination proceeding to earlier patents and publications. \nGrounds that require evaluation of live testimony cannot be raised. \nParties are prohibited from requesting a second reexamination until the \nfirst reexamination is completed. Parties cannot raise issues during \nreexamination that they raised or could have raised in earlier court \nlitigation. Neither can they raise issues in court litigation that they \nraised or could have raised in an earlier examination. Furthermore, no \nreexamination proceeding can ever be started unless the Commissioner \nmakes a determination that a substantial new question of patentability \nis raised. The Commissioner's determination not to start a \nreexamination is unappealable. In all of these ways, the re-examination \nprovisions in the substitute amendment will provide an alternative to \nthe current costly and time-consuming process of Federal litigation and \nat the same time, protect patent applicants against undue harassment.\n     Title VI of the amendment: Miscellaneous Provisions\n  The final title of the amendment contains several lower-profile, but \nnonetheless important and needed changes to American patent law. A \nmatter of special interest to me is the section I suggested be added in \nthis Title to enhance access to patent information. I have long thought \nthat electronic access should be more widespread and want to work with \nthe PTO to ensure the effective implementation of statewide electronic \naccessibility of patent information in rural states and eventually in \nall areas to make it easier for inventors to study prior art and make \nfurther advances. This should be of particular benefit to Vermont, \nwhich just recently established a patent and trademark depository \nlibrary.\n  Also important is the section that clarifies the authority of the \nCopyright Office. It is intended to codify the traditional role of the \nCopyright Office and to confirm the Register's existing areas of \njurisdiction. The new subsection 701(b)(1) reflects the Copyright \nOffice's longstanding role as advisor to Congress on matters within its \ncompetence. This includes copyright and all matters within the scope of \ntitle 17 of the U.S. Code. The new subsection (b)(2) reflects the \nCopyright Office's longstanding role in advising federal agencies on \nmatters within its competence. For example, the Copyright Office \nadvises the U.S. Trade Representative and the State Department on an \nongoing basis on the adequacy of foreign copyright laws, and serves as \na technical consultant to those agencies in bilateral, regional and \nmultilateral consultations or negotiations with other countries on \ncopyright-related issues. The new subsection (b)(3) reflects the \nCopyright Office's longstanding role as a key participant in \ninternational meetings of various kinds, including as part of U.S. \ndelegations as authorized by the Executive Branch, serving as \nsubstantive experts on matters within the Copyright Office's \ncompetence. Recent examples of the Copyright Office acting in the \ncapacity include its central role on the U.S. delegation that \nnegotiated the two new WIPO treaties at the 1996 Diplomatic Conference \nin Geneva, and its ongoing contributions of technical assistance in the \nTRIPS Council of the World Trade Organization and the Register's role \nas a featured speaker at numerous WIPO conferences. The new subsection \n(b)(4) describes the studies and programs that the Copyright Office has \nlong carried out as the agency responsible for administering the \ncopyright law and other chapters of title 17. Among the most important \nof these studies historically was a series of comprehensive reports on \nvarious issues produced in the 1960's as the foundation of the last \ngeneral revision of U.S. copyright law, enacted as the 1976 Copyright \nAct. Most recently the Copyright Office has completed reports on the \ncable and satellite compulsory licences, legal protection for \ndatabases, and the economic and policy implications of term extension. \nThe reference to ``programs'' includes such projects as the conferences \nthe Copyright Office co-sponsored in 1996-97 on the subject of \ntechnology-based intellectual property management, and the \nInternational Copyright Institutes that the Copyright Office has \nconducted for foreign government officials at least annually over the \npast decade, often in cooperation with WIPO. The new subsection (b)(5) \nmakes clear that the functions and duties set forth in this subsection \nare illustrative, not exhaustive. The Register of Copyrights would \ncontinue to be able to carry out other functions under her general \nauthority under subsection 701(a), or as Congress may direct.\n  Today's inventors and creators can be much like those of Thomas \nJefferson's day--individuals in a shop, garage or home lab. They can \nalso be teams of scientists working in our largest corporations or at \nour colleges and universities. Our nation's patent laws should be fair \nto American innovators of all kinds--independent inventors, small \nbusinesses, venture capitalists and larger corporations. To maintain \nAmerica's preeminence in the realm of technology, which dates back to \nthe birth of this republic, we need to modernize our patent system and \npatent office. Our inventors know this and that is why they support \nthis legislation.\n  I have received letters of endorsements of S. 507, which I placed \ninto the Congressional Record on June 23, July 10 and July 16, from the \nfollowing coalitions and companies: the White House Conference on Small \nBusinesses, the National Association of Women Business Owners, the \nSmall Business Technology Coalition, National Small Business United, \nthe National Venture Capital Association, the 21st Century Patent \nCoalition, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America; the \nPharmaceutical Research and Manufactures of American (Parma), the \nAmerican Automobile Manufacturers Association, the Software Publishers \nAssociation, the Semiconductor Industry Association, the Business \nSoftware Alliance, the American Electronics Association, the Institute \nof Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., the Biotechnology \nIndustry Organization, the International Trademark Association, IBM, \n3M, Intel, Caterpillar, AMP, and Hewlett-Packard.\n  In addition, I have letters of support of the Patent Bill from the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, TSM/Rockwell International, \nObsidian, and Allied Signal.\n\n[[Page S10719]]\n\n  I am deeply disappointed that the Senate is being prevented from \nconsidering this important legislation by Republican recalcitrance. \nAmerican inventors deserve better and America's future is being short \nchanged.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10716-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE MEDICARE REHABILITATION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nReinstatement of the Medicare Rehabilitation Act of 1998, introduced by \nSenators Reid and Grassley. I have always been a strong advocate for \nthe senior citizens of our nation and I believe this bill will help \nprovide a safety net for some of our sickest seniors. I was pleased to \nrecently join my colleagues as a cosponsor of this bill for two \nreasons--it repeals an unnecessary $1,500 cap on Medicare outpatient \nrehabilitation services and will allow seniors to receive treatment \nservices that are essential to their health.\n  Every year our elderly are threatened by strokes, multiple injuries, \nand diseases. Seniors who suffer from strokes and multiple diseases in \na given year often have complex health care needs that require costly, \ncomprehensive treatment. One study has estimated that almost 13% of all \nMedicare beneficiaries or 635,000 seniors who receive rehabilitative \nservices outside of a hospital setting will exceed the $1,500 cap. The \ntreatment that they desperately need would exceed the $1,500 cap and \nrequire seniors to pay out of pocket for services or seek treatment in \na hospital outpatient department in order for Medicare to cover their \ntreatment.\n  How could our senior citizens be treated this way? How did this come \nto be? Well let me tell you, in 1997 Congress passed the Balanced \nBudget Act. Within that Act we placed a $1,500 cap on outpatient \nrehabilitation services. Limits on the cap were adopted without \nadequate committee hearings and a detailed analysis was not conducted \nby HCFA to determine the likely effects on beneficiaries' ability to \nobtain medically necessary services.\n  This was a mistake, but fortunately we can correct it by passing this \nlegislation. The Reinstatement of the Medicare Rehabilitation Act \nensures senior citizens the right to receive the medical services they \nneed to recover. Under this bill, senior citizens will no longer be \nhindered by financial limitations on rehabilitation services and \nseniors who don't live near a hospital won't be forced to travel there \njust to have Medicare pay for their treatment services. I don't want an \n85-year-old woman who has had a stroke and is trying to regain her \nability to speak or eat to have to travel to a hospital 30 minutes away \nto receive treatment.\n  I want to let those who depend on Medicare know that we are working \nto protect their health. While we must continue to work diligently to \nprotect the solvency of Medicare, we can't let seniors who need \nrehabilitation services fall through the cracks. I salute the sponsors \nof this bill and urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10719-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from President of the United States were communicated to the \nSenate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10719-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  AT 12:23 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agrees \nto the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 1856) to amend the \nfish and Wildlife Act of 1956 to direct the Secretary of the Interior \nto conduct a volunteer pilot project at one national wildlife refuge in \neach United States Fish and Wildlife Service region, and for other \npurposes.\n  The message also announced that the House has agreed to the following \nconcurrent resolution, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.

A resolution adopted by the Council of the City of \n     Cincinnati, Ohio, relative to proposed legislation on \n     children's gun violence; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n       POM-545. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of Guam; \n     to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                           Resolution No. 303\n\n       Whereas, historically the United States has protected its \n     shipping industry through maritime cabotage laws, including \n     Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, commonly known \n     as the Jones Act, the Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886 \n     and the statutes referring to towage and dredging; and\n       Whereas, these maritime cabotage laws strictly limit the \n     carriage of passengers and merchandise between the U.S. \n     mainlaind and the offshore jurisdictions of Guam, Hawaii, \n     Alaska, and Puerto Rico to United States built and flag \n     ships, which are crewed, owned and controlled by United \n     States citizens; and\n       Whereas, Ninety Percent (90%) of the goods consumed in Guam \n     are imported and virtually all of these goods arrive by sea; \n     and\n       Whereas, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico are similarly \n     dependent on ocean shipping for the operation of their \n     economies; and\n       Whereas, there are only 122 deep-draft, self-propelled \n     ships of 1,000 gross registered tons and over in the active \n     oceangoing domestic commercial fleet of the United States \n     with an average age of 31 years, of which 89 are tankers. \n     While in the world fleet there are more than 25,000 deep-\n     draft, oceangoing ships with an average age of 18 years. The \n     world fleet includes many kinds of specialist ships not \n     available in the domestic United States fleet yet needed for \n     transportation in the domestic non-contiguous trades and \n     economic development in the offshore jurisdictions of the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, due to their geographic isolations, the offshore \n     jurisdictions are uniquely dependent on ocean shipping for \n     surface transportation, unlike the forty-eight contiguous \n     states that have access to alternative forms of interstate \n     surface transportation including rail, road, and inland \n     waterways; and\n       Whereas, maritime cabotage laws of the United States \n     severely and unfairly limit the access to needed shipping \n     services by artificially restricting the supply of ships, \n     which is translated into higher freight rates and the non-\n     availability of certain kinds of carriage for the offshore \n     jurisdictions; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. domestic fleet is continuing to decline, \n     only one containership has been built in the United States \n     during the past decade, and just last year, the privately-\n     owned, United States flag, deep-draft fleet decreased by 29 \n     vessels and the fleet carrying capacity decreased by \n     1,358,000 deadweight tons; and\n       Whereas, the offshore American jurisdictions need access to \n     efficient, competitive and modern shipping to compete in the \n     global economy, especially as competing countries have ready \n     access to the world's shipping fleet for their transportation \n     requirements; and\n       Whereas, the highly-competitive Transpacific containership \n     trade offers some of the lowest deep-water ocean freight rate \n     in the world, especially Westbound from the United States \n     West Coast to Asia, while the rates from the U.S. Mainland to \n     Guam are some of the highest. With more that two dozen \n     regularly scheduled lines, there has long been excess \n     capacity available Westbound in the Transpacific container \n     trade to promptly carry all of Guam and Hawaii's cargo \n     requirements at internationally competitive rates; and\n       Whereas, while there are over 5,000 bulk carriers in the \n     world fleet, there are none in the domestic United States \n     fleet available to carry Alaskan coal to the United States \n     West Coast, Hawaii, and Guam, which impedes the utilization \n     of a potential domestic fuel source; and\n       Whereas, while there are over 6,000 tankers in the world \n     fleet averaging 16 years of age, there are only 89 in the \n     domestic United States fleet averaging over 30 years. The \n     United States International Trade Commission reports that \n     domestic tanker freight rates are double world rates; and\n       Whereas, in the trade between Guam and the mainland, over \n     96 percent of all liner and neo-bulk cargoes are carried by \n     self-propelled oceangoing ships of over 1,000 gross \n     registered tons, and all interstate petroleum cargoes in the \n     Guam trade are carried by deep-draft tanker ships; and\n       Whereas, an important driver of the high costs of living \n     and doing business in Guam is the artificial domestic \n     shortage of deep-draft oceangoing ships and the higher cost \n     of domestic shipping imposed by maritime cabotage laws; and\n       Whereas, such costs and non-availability of deep-draft \n     oceangoing ships impose a significant and unfair burden on \n     the residents of Guam, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico; and\n       Whereas, the offshore jurisdictions suffer a far greater \n     negative impact from the restrictions of the maritime \n     cabotage laws of the United States than do the contiguous \n     states; and\n       Whereas, an exemption from the cabotage laws allowing \n     foreign ships to participate in the non-contiguous trades \n     would foster competition in ocean shipping services, provide \n     substantial economic benefits to the offshore jurisdictions, \n     increase consumer welfare, and make the offshore economies \n     more globally competitive; and\n       Whereas, the President and Congress have already recognized \n     the unique aspects of the other offshore American \n     jurisdictions when they exempted American Samoa, the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. \n     Virgin Islands from the applicability of the maritime \n     cabotage laws; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Twenty-Fourth Guam Legislature \n     respectfully requests the Congress of the United States to \n     pass legislation granting an exemption from the maritime \n     cabotage laws of the United States to benefit Guam, Hawaii, \n     Alaska, and Puerto Rico, to allow:\n       (1) Foreign flag vessels to engage in the interstate sector \n     only of the noncontiguous\n\n[[Page S10722]]\n\n     trades under the supervision of the United States Customs \n     service, and, in Guam, in coordination with the Guam Customs \n     and Quarantine Agency; and\n       (2) Foreign built United States flag vessels to freely \n     engage in the interstate and intrastate sectors of the non-\n     contiguous trades under a coastwise (non-contiguous) \n     endorsement; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Twenty-Fourth Guam Legislature \n     respectfully requests the President of the United States and \n     his Administration to support the Congressional request in \n     this Resolution; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Guam's Congressional Delegate request \n     Congress to exempt Guam, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico from \n     maritime cabotage; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Speaker certify to, and the Legislative \n     Secretary attests, the adoption hereof and that copies of the \n     same be thereafter transmitted to the President of the United \n     States; to the President of the United States Senate; to the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives; to the \n     Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation; \n     to the Guam Congressional Delegate; and to the Honorable Carl \n     T.C.

A bill to establish a National Commission on Terrorism; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              national commission on terrorism legislation\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, terrorism, both domestic and \ninternational, will regrettably, continue to be a threat to United \nStates citizens and, indeed, to humanity into the millennium. It is the \nweapon of choice for those nations, entities, and individuals bent on \npursuing myriad aims through the cowardly, cold-blooded sacrifice of \ninnocents.\n  In his remarks to the opening session of the United Nations General \nAssembly yesterday, President Clinton focused on the reality of \nterrorism in the world community. ``This is a threat,'' he said, ``to \nall humankind.'' At the end of this statement, I include excerpts of \nthe President's speech.\n  Terrorism is one of the principal threats to global economic and \npolitical stability and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. \nAs such, U.S. foreign and economic policies designed to foster peace \nand prosperity through stability will be weakened.\n  U.S. policies, citizens and interests continue to be prime targets \nfor international terrorism. The April 1998 Department of State report, \n``Patterns of\n\n[[Page S10723]]\n\nGlobal Terrorism,'' noted that approximately 33% of all terrorist \nincidents worldwide were committed against U.S. citizens or property. \nThese attacks were by and large perpetrated outside of the continental \nUnited States.\n  The Congress will soon be considering appropriations to increase the \nphysical security to United States missions abroad. Of the 260 \ndiplomatic posts overseas, only 40 are determined to be safe against \nterrorist attack.\n  While it is clear that the safety and stability of the world \ncommunity continue to be threatened, terrorist activity and the \nperpetrators of that activity require leaders to reexamine our \nunderstanding of terrorism and develop policy to continue to combat the \nthreat.\n  The motivation to commit acts of terrorism are no longer viewed as \nthose with simply political ends. No longer are these senseless acts of \ndeath and destruction purely the domain of those with a political \nagenda. Increasingly, terrorists are motivated by religious goals, by \nthe pursuit of financial profit, by long-standing racial, ethnic or \ntribal divisions and animosities, or by a mix of all of the above.\n  The age of information technology and proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction threaten to increase the potential arsenal for terror. \nIn testimony before the Armed Services Committee, witnesses have \nexplained, as you can well imagine, the possible devastation which \ncould be inflicted through skilled use of modern technologies. What \nhave been violent attacks with rudimentary car bombs, may very well \nsoon be attacks of apocalyptic proportions.\n  A few days ago, Representative Frank Wolf, an outstanding Member of \nthe House from just across the Potomac and able member of the \nCommonwealth's delegation, presented to me this legislation to address \nthe challenges of the terrorism threat. His bill has been accepted by \nthe House of Representatives and will be a conference item by the \nAppropriations Committee. I present this legislation to my colleagues \nin the Senate for consideration and deliberation.\n  The legislation assembles 15 distinguished experts in the field of \nterrorism, including three Congressmen and three Senators. Their goal \nwill be to review and assess United States policies on terrorism, from \nbasic understanding to appropriate response, and recommend changes as \nwarranted. This initiative is not intended as an attack on existing \npolicy, but a means to enhance our understanding of one of the \nprincipal threats to stability in the millennium and focus every \navailable resource to eliminate the threat.\n  I urge my colleagues to review this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that excerpts from President \nClinton's address to the United Nations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the excerpts where ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Remarks by the President to the Opening Session of the 53rd United \n                        Nations General Assembly\n\n       The President. * * * We still are bedeviled by ethnic, \n     racial, religious and tribal hatreds; by the spread of \n     weapons of mass destruction; by the almost frantic effort of \n     too many states to acquire such weapons; and, despite all \n     efforts to contain it, terrorism is not fading away with the \n     end of the 20th century. It is a continuing defiance of \n     Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which \n     says, ``Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security \n     of person.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Obviously this is a matter of profound concern to us. In \n     the last 15 years our citizens have been targeted over and \n     over again--in Beirut, over Lockerbie, in Saudi Arabia, at \n     home in Oklahoma City by one of our own citizens, and even \n     here in New York in one of our most public buildings, and \n     most recently on August 7th in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, \n     where Americans who devoted their lives to building bridges \n     between nations, people very much like all of you, died in a \n     campaign of hatred against the United States.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       If terrorism is at the top of the American agenda--and \n     should be at the top of the world's agenda--what, then are \n     the concrete steps we can take together to protect our common \n     destiny. What are our common obligations? At least, I believe \n     they are these: to give terrorists no support, no sanctuary, \n     no financial assistance; to bring pressure on states that do; \n     to act together to step up extradition and prosecution; to \n     sign the Global Anti-Terror Conventions; to strengthen the \n     Biological Weapons and Chemical Convention; to enforce the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention; to promote stronger domestic \n     laws and control the manufacture and export of explosives; to \n     raise international standards for airport security, to combat \n     the conditions that spread violence and despair.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Burns, and Mrs. \n        Hutchison):\n  S. 2507. A bill to stimulate increased domestic cruise ship \nopportunities for the American cruising public by temporarily reducing \nbarriers for entry into the domestic cruise ship trade; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n           The United States Cruise Ship Tourism Act of 1998\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I, with Senators Thurmond, \nBurns, and Hutchison, introduce the United States Cruise Ship Tourism \nAct of 1998. The purpose of this bill is to stimulate increased \ndomestic cruise vessel opportunities for the American cruising public \nby temporarily reducing barriers for entry into the domestic cruise \nship trade.\n  The oceangoing cruise ship industry offers the American cruising \npublic with a multitude of itineraries in international trade. However, \ndue to barriers to entry such as the Passenger Vessel Services Act, \nlarge cruise ship domestic trade options are limited to one oceangoing \ncruise ship in Hawaii. Also, the U.S. port calls of these international \nitineraries are heavily concentrated in Florida and Alaska due to the \nproximity of these states to neighboring countries. This means that \nAmerica's cruising public is denied the opportunity to cruise to many \nattractive U.S. port destinations, and those ports are denied the \neconomic benefits of those visits, due to these domestic cruise ship \ntrade barriers to entry.\n  Three separate bills addressing the domestic cruise ship trade have \nbeen referred to the Commerce Committee this Congress: S. 668, S. 803, \nand S. 2290. Each of these bills takes a different approach to removing \nbarriers and stimulating growth in this area. Senator Hutchison, the \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant \nMarine, held a hearing last year on this subject. I would prefer we \ntake the approach proposed in S. 803, of which I am a cosponsor, but I \nunderstand that bill does not address the concerns of some other \nmembers. We have been working with representatives of all industries \nconcerned with this legislation for several months in an attempt to \nreach a consensus on this issue.\n  While a consensus has not yet been achieved, I believe it is time to \ntake another step forward in the legislative process. My bill would \nallow the Secretary of Transportation to waive certain current \ncoastwise trade restrictions on a limited basis to stimulate the \ndomestic cruise ship trade. I expect some of my colleagues on the on \nthe Commerce Committee may want to make additional changes to this bill \nin Committee. I look forward to working these issues out with them in \nthe next week so that we may report this bill to the Senate later this \nmonth.\n  I believe it is important for this Congress to take action on this \nissue this year. We should maximize the economic growth potential of \nthe domestic cruise ship trade and the cruising opportunities for \nAmerica's public.\n                                  ____\n\n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 2509. A bill to provide further protections for the watershed of \nthe Little Sandy River as part of the Bull Run Watershed Management \nUnit, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n                   LITTLE SANDY WATERSHED PROTECTION\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am today, along with Congressman \nBlumenauer in the U.S. House, introducing legislation to make sure that \nin the next century the children of Portland can go to their kitchen \nfaucet and take a glass of drinking water that is as safe and pure as \nany that the pioneers found when they got here.\n  Why protect the Little Sandy? The answer is as clear as the water in \nthat stream. Essentially, what we are proposing is to finish the job \nbegun two years ago with passage of the Oregon Resources and \nConservation Act of\n\n[[Page S10724]]\n\n1996, which brought statutory protection to the Bull Run Watershed.\n  Portland's city fathers acted in 1890 to protect Bull Run, and it is \nfitting that we continue that effort today. More than one-third of the \nLittle Sandy watershed has already been logged; clearly, this drainage \nhas already been pushed, and pushed hard, in terms of past timber \nharvest.\n  The protection our bill would offer will not only affect clean \ndrinking water, but salmon recovery as well. I am hopeful that this \nlegislation will become an important part of our region's approach to \nrestoring steelhead habitat.\n  Finally, I want to commend the leadership of Mayor Vera Katz, \nCommissioner Erik Sten, and former Commissioner Mike Lindberg, whose \nvision for Portland's future laid the foundation for the introduction \nof this bill.\n  I first introduced legislation to protect the Little Sandy when I was \nin the House. In passing the Oregon Resource Conservation Act of 1996, \nI made a compromise with Senator Hatfield in which we would designate \nthe Bull Run Watershed Management Unit as a protected area that is off \nlimits to commercial timber harvest, and designate the Little Sandy as \na study area. I am now asking the Congress to approve the addition of \nthe Little Sandy study area to the Bull Run Management Unit, and to be \nsubject to the management prescriptions which were established under \nthe ORCA governing the Bull Run.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2509\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to pay \nemployees of the Food Safety and Inspection Service working in \nestablishments subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the \nPoultry Products Inspection Act for overtime and holiday work performed \nby the employees; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n           federal meat and poultry employees pay act of 1998\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation, by \nrequest, to modify the overtime pay for meat inspectors who are \nveterinarians. Senator Harkin, the ranking minority member of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, has joined as a cosponsor.\n  This legislation was transmitted to Congress by the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture earlier this year. As drafted, the bill would provide \nthe Secretary of Agriculture with the authority to pay Food Safety and \nInspection Service employees, working in plants subject to federal meat \nor poultry inspection, for overtime and holiday work at rates \ndetermined by the Secretary.\n  Due to an anomaly in current law, meat inspectors who are \nveterinarians receive lower pay for overtime hours than they receive \nfor regular hours. These veterinarians are seeking true overtime pay of \n1\\1/2\\ times their hourly rate without a cap on the rate.\n  While the Federal Meat Inspection Act allows the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture (USDA) to provide overtime pay at rates determined by USDA, \nthe Poultry Products Inspection Act does not provide this authority. \nThe legislation introduced today would allow USDA to pay overtime for \nveterinarians at rates determined by USDA. Clearly an inequity exists \nfor veterinarians who work overtime.\n  I am pleased to introduce this legislation at the request of the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. I look forward to hearing the views of my \ncolleagues about this legislation and will seek opportunities to move \nthis bill through the legislative process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a \ncopy of the transmittal letter from the Secretary of Agriculture.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S10725]]\n\n\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 1998.\n     Hon. Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: This letter transmits, for the \n     consideration of the Congress, a draft bill ``To provide the \n     Secretary of Agriculture with the authority to pay employees \n     of the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) working in \n     establishments subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act and \n     the Poultry Products Inspection Act for overtime and holiday \n     work performed by such employees at rates the Secretary deems \n     appropriate'' that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) \n     recommends be enacted.\n       The proposed legislation would provide the Secretary of \n     Agriculture with the discretion to pay employees of FSIS, \n     working in establishments subject to the Federal Meat \n     Inspection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act \n     (PPIA), for overtime and holiday work at rates determined by \n     the Secretary.\n       Under current authorities, the Secretary is authorized to \n     pay employees performing inspection under the FMIA for \n     overtime work at rates the Secretary determines. However, no \n     similar authority exists for employees performing inspection \n     under the PPIA. Further, because current law caps overtime \n     rates for Federal veterinarians working in poultry \n     establishments, those at the higher steps of the Federal pay \n     scale receive an hourly overtime rate less than their hourly \n     rate of basic pay.\n       The draft bill will eliminate the potential inequity \n     between FSIS veterinarians providing inspection services \n     under the FMIA and the PPIA and will provide the Secretary \n     with the authority to compensate appropriately FSIS \n     veterinarians performing inspections in meat and poultry \n     establishments.\n       Enactment of the legislation would cost FSIS approximately \n     $300,000 per year to cover situations when the veterinarian \n     is on overtime but the establishment is not. The Department \n     believes that it will be able to absorb these additional \n     costs within current budgetary levels. When an establishment \n     is in an overtime status, it must reimburse USDA for the \n     overtime at rates determined by the Secretary.\n       Enactment of this proposed legislation would have no \n     significant effect on the quality of the human environment.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the presentation to Congress of this proposed \n     legislation from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n       A similar letter is being sent to the Speaker of the House.\n           Sincerely,\n                                  Dan Glickman, Secretary.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN:\n  S. 2508. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimpose conditions on the implementation of the interim payment system \nfor home health services furnished by home health agencies under the \nMedicare Program and to modify the standards for calculating the per \nbeneficiary payment limits under such payment system, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            homebound elderly relief opportunity act of 1998\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Homebound \nElderly Relief Opportunity Act of 1998'' (HERO). This measure addresses \na very serious concern: the future of home care within the Medicare \nsystem.\n  For Mississippians, home health has had a two-fold benefit: Home care \nserves to reduce costly hospitalization stays while enhancing the \npatient's quality of life through continued stay in the familiar home \nsetting.\n  Additionally, in a rural state like Mississippi, home health has \nenabled health care to be delivered to the immobile and elderly who are \noften miles and hours from the nearest hospital or clinic.\n  Despite these obvious benefits, home health is very expensive, \nhowever. With Medicare and government expenditures, it is not always a \nquestion of ``What we should afford?'' but ``What we can afford?''\n  Congress answered these questions with the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997, which has brought fiscal responsibility back to government. BBA \n97 dealt with among other issues, Medicare, and in turn home health, \nprobably the fastest growing expenditure within the program. The work \nof Senator Roth and the Finance Committee has helped insure some \nstability in home health expenditures, so that a good thing does not \nquickly become a bad thing and bankrupt the trust fund. However, \ninstead of saving this vital Medicare benefit, HCFA's application of \nthe Balanced Budget Act to home health--through the use of the Interim \nPayment System--has threatened its very existence. In so doing, HCFA \nhas ignored both equity and the elderly, particularly in rural America.\n  The Senate has not completely ignored the home health crisis: Sixty-\neight of my colleagues have made statements which appear with their \nphotographs on a recent industry poster proclaiming the ills of HCFA's \ninterim payment system and its threat to the continuation of home \nhealth services.\n  Five of my colleagues--Senators Grassley and Breaux; Senator Bond; \nSenator Collins; and Senator Kennedy have each introduced bills to \nadjust or eliminate IPS. Senator Bond has been the Senate champion of \nsaving home health. His Senate Bill 2354, of which I am cosponsor, \nprovides a direct, honest response to the HCFA-created nightmare. His \nbill would impose a moratorium on IPS from fiscal year 1998 forward \nuntil HCFA develops the prospective payment system, the only sure way \nto solve the home health expenditure issue in a fair manner. However, \nthe Moratorium Bill's cost has been scored by CBO to be in the many \nmany billions. While we must save home health, we cannot do so in a way \nthat jeopardizes all of Medicare. We must find a compromise. That is \nthe purpose of introducing HERO today.\n  The HERO Bill is an effort to correct the essential problems with the \ninterim payment system and to create a better bridge to the prospective \npayment system which we all hope will be developed and implemented \nsoon. I believe it provides the best opportunity for success with \nrespect to Government spending, Medicare reimbursement, and protecting \nbeneficiaries.\n  It establishes budget limits for Medicare home health expenditures \nfor 1999-2002 with the same savings levels currently projected by the \nCongressional Budget Office under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \nprovisions. If expenditure estimates exceed the budget limits, payments \nto providers will be limited to regional levels on an equitable basis. \nFinally, it insures access to home care for all qualified Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Overall, this bill provides one last opportunity in this session for \nall home health beneficiaries to receive the Medicare benefit to which \nthey are entitled and for the providers of those services to be fairly \nreimbursed. It corrects the essential flaw in the original payment \nreform which rewarded the inefficient and punished the efficient \nproviders and failed to account for the variation in the types of \npatients served by home health agencies. However, this bill operates \nwith budgetary and operational safeguards to insure that the home \nhealth benefit stays on its steady course.\n  Mr. President, Congress must reform IPS immediately before even more \nreputable home health agencies are forced out of business and more \nseniors are forced to go without care or leave their homes for more \nexpensive hospital or nursing home care. I urge Senators to support \nthis bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Con. Res. 119\n\n       Whereas the American Red Cross is a nonprofit humanitarian \n     organization of 32,000 paid staff, 1,300,000 volunteers, and \n     4,300,000 blood donors which considers its role in the \n     provision of blood services to be a public trust;\n       Whereas the American Red Cross Blood Services began by \n     collecting and distributing blood to help save the lives of \n     soldiers on the battlefields of World War II, and has evolved \n     to become a leader in the healthcare industry;\n       Whereas following World War II the American Red Cross \n     created the first national civilian blood program, opening \n     its first blood center in 1948;\n       Whereas through the generosity of over 4,300,000 voluntary \n     blood donors the American Red Cross is able to provide half \n     the Nation's blood supply, and every day, in communities \n     throughout this country, many thousands of people receive \n     lifesaving blood in the 3,000 hospitals served by the 38 \n     American Red Cross Blood Regions;\n       Whereas in May 1991, the American Red Cross announced its \n     ambitious ``Transformation'' program, a 7-year, $287,000,000 \n     comprehensive modernization of every aspect of the American \n     Red Cross Blood Services blood collection, testing, \n     processing, and distribution systems;\n       Whereas one of the most massive undertakings of \n     Transformation was the Manufacturing and Computer \n     Standardization (MACS) initiative which integrated 28 \n     different computer systems into a single, national system \n     linking American Red Cross Blood Regions nationwide to the \n     world's largest blood information database for transfusion \n     medicine research, and standardized manufacturing processes;\n       Whereas under Transformation the more than 50 individual, \n     nonstandardized laboratories operated by local American Red \n     Cross Blood Regions were replaced by 8 state-of-the-art \n     National Testing Laboratories, which effectively implement \n     the latest medical technology to perform the testing of \n     approximately 6,000,000 units of blood annually, serving both \n     American Red Cross blood centers and several non-American Red \n     Cross blood centers as well, and are located in Atlanta, \n     Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dedham, Massachusetts; \n     Detroit, Michigan; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Portland, \n     Oregon; St. Louis, Missouri; and St. Paul, Minnesota;\n       Whereas the American Red Cross Blood Services has created a \n     Quality Assurance program recognized throughout the world as \n     a leader in assuring quality in the manufacture of blood \n     products;\n       Whereas the creation of the Charles Drew Biomedical \n     Institute has allowed the American Red Cross to provide \n     training and other educational resources to American Red \n     Cross Blood Services' personnel through ``One Touch'' which \n     is an interactive, distance learning system that allows \n     instructors to train personnel across the country from the \n     institute's location at American Red Cross Biomedical \n     Headquarters in Rosslyn, Virginia;\n       Whereas Transformation saw the development of a centrally \n     managed blood inventory system to ensure the consistent \n     availability of blood and blood components in every American \n     Red Cross Blood Services Region throughout the country, and \n     the creation of the new centralized organizational structure \n     within American Red Cross Blood Services;\n       Whereas the American Red Cross Jerome H.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of the American Red Cross Blood Services. The Red Cross \nBlood Services has been saving lives since its inception during World \nWar II. Today, in a rapidly changing health care environment, with ever \nincreasing challenges, the Red Cross continues to serve patients \nthroughout our country.\n  The Red Cross is America's first nationwide, volunteer blood \ncollection and distribution system. During World War II, the Red Cross \nsaved soldiers' lives by collecting and distributing blood. This led to \nthe first National Civilian Blood Program, with the opening of the \nfirst blood center in 1948. Today, the Red Cross serves over 3,000 \nhospitals nationwide by supplying almost half of the nation's blood for \ntransfusion. This life-giving service is made possible by volunteers \nwho generously donate nearly six million units of blood each year.\n  In 1991, the Red Cross began a comprehensive technology and systems \nreview, to ensure the organization entered the next century with state-\nof-the-art programs, systems, and facilities. This program, entitled, \n``Transformation,'' is a $287 million modernization of every aspect of \nblood collection, processing, and distributing. According to Red Cross \nPresident Elizabeth Dole, it is the most ambitious project that the Red \nCross has ever undertaken. Transformation's goals included the creation \nof a new centralized management structure, a new information system, \nand a program of the highest quality. Without objection, I'd like to \nsubmit a copy of Mrs. Dole's remarks at the 50th Anniversary \nBicentennial Celebration of the Red Cross, which includes comments on \nTransformation, for the Record.\n  Transformation successfully consolidated 50 individual, non-\nstandardized labs operated by local Blood Regions into eight state-of-\nthe-art National Testing Laboratories that perform 70 million \nlaboratory tests each year. These new labs serve the Red Cross as well \nas several non-Red Cross blood centers. As part of this Transformation, \nthe American Red Cross has undertaken a Manufacturing and Computer \nStandardization initiative. This program has integrated 28 different \ncomputer systems into one national system, linking Red Cross Blood \nRegions across the nation to the world's largest information database \nfor transfusion medical research.\n  In addition, Transformation has led to standardized manufacturing \nprocesses throughout the Red Cross system, thereby promoting a \nconsistent standard of high quality blood services. A centrally managed \nblood inventory system operated by the Red Cross was designed to \nfacilitate consistent availability of blood in every region of the \ncountry. Transformation has also created the Quality Assurance Program \nand a new Charles Drew Biomedical Institute which provides training and \nother education to personnel, using state of the art technology which \ndoes not require staff and volunteers to travel for training. \nInstructors can now train personnel in a wide range of fields across \nthe country.\n  Through the American Red Cross Jerome H. Holland Laboratory, a \npremiere blood research facility, significant progress has been made in \nimproving transfusion safety, and fostering the development of new \nblood products. Red Cross has shared the knowledge and expertise gained \nthrough studies conducted by Holland Laboratory scientists and \nphysicians with the transfusion services of countries throughout the \nworld. The Red Cross translates research into life-saving products for \npatients because of its tremendous investment in research and \ndevelopment. Let me just note that the risk of becoming infected with \nHIV through a blood transfusion has been reduced from one in 220,000 in \n1991, to one in 676,000 today--a tremendous improvement in the safety \nof the blood supply.\n  I congratulate the 32,000 paid staff and 1.3 million volunteers on \ntheir first fifty years of providing blood services, and especially \nwant to recognize Mrs. Elizabeth Dole and her tremendous management \nteam for their vision in the implementation of the Transformation \nprogram.\n  In recognition of their accomplishments, I am submitting the \nfollowing concurrent resolution, with ten of my colleagues, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Lott, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Coats, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nMcConnell, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Collins, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Bingaman, to \ncommemorate the 50th anniversary of the American Red Cross Blood \nServices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10726-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10727-S10728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 120--TO REDESIGNATE THE UNITED STATES \n CAPITOL POLICE HEADQUARTERS AS THE ``ENEY, CHESTNUT, GIBSON MEMORIAL \n                               BUILDING''\n\n  Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Warner) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a \nconcurrent resolution to redesignate the United States Capitol Police \nHeadquarters as the ``Eney, Chestnut, Gibson Memorial Building'' in \nhonor of the three brave United States Capitol Police Officers who have \nbeen killed in the line of duty since the inception of the Capitol \nPolice.\n  The United States Capitol Police are a very special breed. They have \na very special duty and a special trust. They guard our nation's \nCapitol and keep it safe and secure for the citizens of the world. When \nOfficers Gibson and Chestnut were killed on July 24, 1998, I joined my \ncolleagues on the floor to express my profound shock, and to express my \nvery heartfelt sympathies to their families. I quoted an editorial in \nRoll Call then and I want to read from it again because I think it sums \nup the nature of our Capitol Police Force:\n\n       Sometimes, given the comparative low level of violence \n     around the Capitol complex and given that Capitol Police \n     Officers are usually seen cheerfully directing traffic or \n     gently herding tourists, it's forgotten that ours--meaning \n     the Capitol Hill Police Force--is a real police force. We who \n     live and work around the Capitol know--but others don't--that \n     our police also fight crime in the neighborhood as well as \n     watch the Capitol. But now all America understands that the \n     Capitol Police do not just stand guard, but\n\n[[Page S10728]]\n\n     also stand ready to be heroes. That knowledge was derived \n     last week at a heartrending cost.\n\n  So Mr. President, the purpose of this concurrent resolution is not \njust to memorialize these three officers, but to honor in perpetuity \nthe bravery, and acknowledge the sacrifice of the men and women who put \ntheir lives on the line daily to protect this symbol of democracy. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in support of this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10727-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REED AMENDMENT NO. 3610\n\n  Mr. REED proposed an amendment to amendment No. 3559 proposed by Mr. \nGrassley to the bill (S. 1301) to amend title 11, United States Code, \nto provide for consumer bankruptcy protection, and for other purposes; \nas follows:\n\n       On page 5, line 10, insert ``(i)'' after ``(A)''.\n       On page 5, line 15, strike ``or'' and insert ``and''.\n       On page 5, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n       ``(ii) when any party in interest moves for dismissal or \n     conversion, whether the party in interest dealt in good faith \n     with the debtor; or''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10728-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TORRICELLI AMENDMENT NO. 3611\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. TORRICELLI submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill (S. 1645) to amend title 18, United States Code, to \nprohibit taking minors across State lines to avoid laws requiring the \ninvolvement of parents in abortion decisions; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend \nand colleague, Senator Enzi, to recognize the Proclamation of the \nGovernor of Wyoming declaring September 18 as ``POW/MIA Recognition \nDay'' in Wyoming.\n  I have come to this floor several times in my Senate career to extol \nthe\n\n[[Page S10729]]\n\ngreat sacrifices that our fighting men and women have made to protect \nthis country and the ideals of freedom and democracy that we hold so \ndear. We owe these men and women a huge debt of gratitude. And I \nbelieve, Mr. President, that debt continues until we have brought home, \nor accounted for, all our missing service men.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the proclamation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The proclamation follows.\n\n                        Governor's Proclamation\n\n       Two thousand eighty-six Americans are still missing and \n     unaccounted for from the Vietnam War, including 6 from the \n     State of Wyoming, and their families, friends, and fellow \n     veterans still endure uncertainty concerning their fate.\n       United States Government intelligence and other evidence \n     confirm that Vietnam could unilaterally account for hundred \n     of missing Americans, including many of the 446 still missing \n     in Laos and the 75 still unaccounted for in Cambodia, by \n     locating and returning identifiable remains and providing \n     archival records to answer other discrepancies.\n       The President has normalized relations with Vietnam, \n     believing such action would generate increased unilateral \n     account for Americans still missing from the Vietnam War, and \n     such increased results have not yet been provided by the \n     Government of Vietnam.\n       Now, therefore, be it resolved that the State of Wyoming \n     calls on the President to reinvigorate United States efforts \n     to press Vietnam for unilateral actions to locate and return \n     to our nation remains that would account for hundreds of \n     America's POW/MIA's and records to help obtain answers on \n     many more.\n       For these significant reasons, I, Jim Geringer, Governor of \n     the State of Wyoming, do hereby proclaim September 18th, \n     1998, to be ``POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY'' in Wyoming, and \n     encourage all citizens to observe this day with appropriate \n     ceremonies.\n       In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused \n     the Great Seal of the State of Wyoming to be affixed this \n     29th day of July, 1998.\n                                                     Jim Geringer,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the action of my \nState's Governor in proclaiming September 18, 1998, as Wyoming's POW/\nMIA Recognition Day. Over 2,000 Americans are still missing in Vietnam, \nCambodia, and Laos, and over 8,000 on the Korean peninsula. Those heart \nrending facts make this a most fitting gesture indeed. These men gave \neverything they had to give in causes whose worthiness can be \nempirically verified: By comparing the prosperity of South Korea with \nthe evil devastation to its North; By comparing the poverty and tyranny \nof Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia with what might have been as evidenced \nin Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore. We must never forget the \nsacrifice of those who have no headstones in our national cemeteries. \nHence the importance of efforts such as Governor Geringer's, which \nremind the Nation of our continuing and unfulfilled responsibility to \naccount for the remains of these men for the sake of their families and \nour national conscience. I commend Governor Geringer for his \nproclamation and I urge the President to intensify his efforts at \nretrieving the remains of America's missing-in-action. In comparison \nwith their sacrifice, this gesture is humble indeed, but sincere and \nimportant nonetheless. Surely a grateful America can perform this small \ntask.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10728-6", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10729-S10730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO GOODLOE AND JEAN SUTTON\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President I rise today to pay tribute to an \nAlabama couple who, in their persistent pursuit of justice, \nsuccessfully raised awareness of illegal activities taking place in \nMarengo County in some of the highest levels of county government. \nGoodloe and Jean Sutton, who together head The Democrat-Reporter--\nGoodloe serves as editor and publisher and Jean as chief reporter--\nremind us of what the Fourth Estate is all about. Through their \nthorough and diligent coverage of questionable activities in the \nMarengo County Sheriff's office, former Sheriff Roger Davis was \nconvicted on federal extortion charges; Sonny Breckenridge, who had \nbeen appointed by Sheriff Davis to lead the county's drug enforcement \nunit, was sentenced to life without parole for conspiring to protect \ndrug dealers. Another deputy was also arrested. All are serving jail \ntime for the deeds the Suttons helped to uncover.\n  Goodloe and Jean Sutton are to be commended. Not only have they \nhelped to rid the Marengo County Sheriff's office of misdeeds and \nrampant corruption, but they have helped to restore the public faith in \nlocal government. They have also set an exemplary standard for others \nin the profession of journalism where truth should always be the \nhighest and most important pursuit and consideration.\n  In addition to my statement, Mr. President, I believe it is fitting \nto include the following article about the Suttons, entitled ``Paper \nTigers,'' that appeared in the September 28, 1998 edition of People \nMagazine.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                 [From People Magazine, Sept. 28, 1998]\n\n  Paper Tigers--Newshounds Goodloe and Jean Sutton Get the Goods on a \n                          Lawbreaking Sheriff\n\n                  (By Peter Ames Carlin and Grace Lim)\n\n       From where they sat in the tiny newsroom of The Democrat-\n     Reporter in rural Linden, Ala., Goodloe and Jean Sutton \n     sensed there was something wrong about Roger Davis. Not only \n     did the sheriff of Alabama's rural Marengo County (pop. \n     25,000) sell jewelry out of the trunk of his police car but \n     he seemed to enjoy throwing his weight around. ``Davis \n     thought being sheriff made him all-powerful,'' says Jean. \n     ``He was impressed with himself.''\n       But the Suttons were not, so when they learned that Davis \n     had skimmed money from the county, they featured the story in \n     their family-owned weekly newspaper. Ignoring threats and \n     boycotts by the sheriff's cronies for more than three years, \n     the couple kept on writing until Davis and two of his \n     deputies had earned jail terms and the modest, six-employee \n     paper had earned Pulitzer Prize consideration and a wall full \n     of journalism trophies. ``To take on the sheriff, the most \n     powerful political leader in a rural county, is beyond \n     gutsy,'' says Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor, who \n     investigated the crooked sheriff.\n       Sheriff Davis, now 57, started dipping into the county till \n     in 1991, a year after the retired Alabama state trooper was \n     elected to his $35,000-a-year post. First he used public \n     money to buy his teenage daughter a $3,000 all-terrain \n     vehicle for Christmas, only later returning to the dealer to \n     pay with his own money. Davis funneled county dollars into \n     his account for several years, then extorted more than \n     $20,000 from bail bondsmen who had been operating illegally \n     without the required financial reserves. He wasn't subtle \n     about it. ``If he could control you by fear, he'd do it,'' \n     says Goodloe. ``Or if he could do you a favor, he'd expect \n     you to repay him. And he charmed people too.''\n       Operating on a tip in early 1994, Jean Sutton first dug \n     into the county financial records and discovered that $9,000 \n     in public funds delivered to Davis had never made it to the \n     office account. The Suttons ran the story as front-page news, \n     eliciting a denial from the sheriff. ``He told people he was \n     a good Christian,'' says Jean. ``When they asked why he \n     didn't sue us for libel, he'd say, `I prayed over it, and it \n     wasn't the right thing to do.' ''\n       Although Davis (who declined People's request for an \n     interview) dodged those first editorial bullets, battle lines \n     were drawn. Many of his supporters canceled their \n     subscriptions to The Democrat-Reporter, cutting its \n     circulation 20 percent from 7,500 to 6,000, and some local \n     businesses pulled their advertisements. ``As far as I know, \n     he did a good job sheriffing while he was in office,'' says \n     retired store owner Gaines Williamson, who once backed the \n     sheriff. ``Everybody knew him. We'd chitchat over a couple of \n     coffee.'' Some Davis partisans felt so strongly they even \n     phoned the Suttons, threatening to blow up the family van. \n     ``Remember,'' one letter assured them, ``your day will \n     come.''\n       For Goodloe, 59, the chance to take down a crooked sheriff \n     was worth the tension. The youngest of three kids born to \n     publisher Robert Sutton, who bought The Democrat-Reporter in \n     1917, and his wife, Lorie, Goodloe first set type at the \n     family newspaper when he was 12. He met aspiring writer Jean \n     Rodgers, daughter of Will and Mary, while studying journalism \n     at the University of Southern Mississippi, and the couple \n     married after graduating in 1964.\n       Moving home to Linden, Sutton succeeded his father as \n     editor and publisher of The Democrat-Reporter and installed \n     Jean, now 57, as chief reporter. The couple--who have two \n     sons, Goodloe Jr., 27, who works for the state Republican \n     Party, and William, 14, a high school freshman--gained a \n     reputation as uncompromising journalists. ``Goodloe can sell \n     a paper, that's for sure,'' says cement-company foreman Jerry \n     Stewart. ``There's a lot of controversy, which makes for \n     interesting reading.''\n       The Democrat-Reporter became even more interesting in May \n     1997, when two sheriff's deputies were arrested by federal \n     and state agents for conspiring to protect drug dealers--one, \n     Sonny Breckenridge, who was sentenced to life without parole, \n     had been appointed by Davis to lead the county's drug \n     enforcement unit. Meanwhile, with the Suttons' articles \n     pointing the way, the state and federal authorities began \n     closing in on the sheriff. By August of last year, Davis too\n\n[[Page S10730]]\n\n     was behind bars, caught in a joint state and FBI sting while \n     squeezing a $975 payoff from an illegal bondsman. Two months \n     later, he pleaded guilty to federal extortion charges; he was \n     assessed $30,000 in fines and restitution. ``I would like to \n     apologize to my family, my friends and my church and to the \n     people of Marengo County,'' the sheriff said en route to \n     prison, where he'll serve 27 months. ``I'm sorry.''\n       Although their circulation has yet to rebound fully, the \n     Suttons vow to continue in Marengo County whether their \n     future holds trophies or threats. ``We're just humble \n     scribes,'' says Goodloe, who is also running to represent the \n     region in Alabama's House of Representatives. ``And we have \n     the best turkey hunting, the best deer hunting and the best-\n     looking women in the country. Why would anybody want to go \n     anywhere else?''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10729-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING ILANA G.

She is a shining example of an American youth \nwho has made a deep impact on the lives of her fellow citizens.\n  This young Staten Island resident has not only graced her immediate \ncommunity with her good deeds, but the New York City area as a whole. \nShe is an active participant at Project Hospitality, a Staten Island \nshelter that works with the area's homeless, hungry and sick. Each \nweek, Ilana prepares and serves dinner to the homeless population this \nprogram services. Yet, her role is not just that of a server; Ilana \ntakes it upon herself to befriend these people in need, readily lending \na supportive ear and establishing relationships with them. Ms. Possner \nalso devotes her time to entertaining Staten Island senior citizens \nthrough volunteer signing for the hearing impaired. Ilana has performed \nat fifteen different nursing homes and senior citizen centers \nthroughout the past two years. Aside from these very demanding \nactivities, she is also an active and enthusiastic volunteer worker for \nthe American Cancer Society and the Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n  Ms. Possner has put her leadership skills to work to help the \ncommunity, as well. She organizes numerous food and clothing drives for \nthe homeless, which provide people with the basic necessities of life \nthat otherwise would not have been available to them. Moreover, Ilana \npresides over youth groups which bring together Staten Island youth \nfrom different racial, socioeconomic, religious and ethnic backgrounds. \nThrough these groups, she works to promote harmony among the citizens \nof Staten Island.\n  Ilana's hard work has brought her great recognition and awards over \nthe past few years. She currently attends St. John's University on an \nacademic scholarship, where she wishes to pursue studies in \nCommunications and Education. Furthermore, she has received the \nNational Service Scholarship and the MCS/Canon New York Knicks Team Up \nCommunity Service Scholarship. The New York State Assembly has also \ncommended Ms. Possner for her work and achievement through a citation, \nas well.\n  As we all know, today's youth is the future of America. In order to \nsolve the problems America is facing now and in the future, it is \nimperative that we have leaders dedicated to the American people. Ilana \nPossner is an excellent example of a person who has put forth her \nleadership skills and time to the American public. It is through people \nsuch as Ilana Possner that the future problems and issues facing \nAmericans will be confronted. Thus, I wish to commend Ilana for her \nselfless acts that have helped to make her community a better \nplace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10730-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10730-S10731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         BISHOP LEE'S SERMON ON ``FAITH, FREEDOM, AND VIRTUE''\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on Sunday, September 20, I joined \nMembers of the Virginia Congressional delegation--Senator Robb, \nCongressman Bliley, Congressman Scott, and Virginia's Lieutenant \nGovernor Hager, and many other Virginians at ``Virginia Day'' at the \nWashington National Cathedral. I was privileged, together with Senator \nRobb, to read the scripture lessons.\n  My family and I have had a long association with this great Cathedral \nwhich stands on the highest promontory in the Nation's Capital and \nserves as living symbol of religious freedom the world over. Over 70 \nyears ago, I was baptized, later confirmed, and then served on the \ngoverning chapter of the Cathedral. My uncle, the Reverend Charles T. \nWarner started his career in the ministry here with Bishop Freeman and \nthen worked with the Cathedral in his capacity as Rector of nearby St. \nAlban's Parish for 40 years.\n  The Right Reverend Peter James Lee, the 12th Episcopal Bishop of \nVirginia, delivered an inspiring sermon. As the Senate, and indeed all \nAmericans, look to the difficult decisions facing us, we should examine \nBishop Lee's important reflections on ``Faith, Freedom, and Virtue.'' I \nask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The sermon follows:\n\n                       Faith, Freedom and Virtue\n\n(A sermon preached by the Rt. Rev. Peter James Lee, Bishop of Virginia, \non Virginia Day at the Washington National Cathedral, Sunday, September \n                               20, 1998)\n\n       It takes less than a minute, except during rush hour, to \n     cross from Washington into Virginia. The Potomac River is not \n     much of a barrier. But over the centuries, the distance \n     between the national capital and the Commonwealth of Virginia \n     has varied dramatically. In the earliest days, there was \n     hardly any distance at all since Virginia was a primary \n     leader of the intellectual and political ferment that led to \n     the birth of the nation. But contemporary with the \n     establishment of the capital on the Potomac, the tension \n     between Virginia and the nation began to increase, until it \n     led to open rebellion in the Civil War. The Potomac became a \n     hostile boundary. Virginia has shaped our nation's history, \n     rebelled against national authority, in this century resisted \n     the movement for racial justice, and yet has contributed so \n     very much to the making of America. Today, Virginia is a \n     beneficiary of many federal dollars, thanks in no small \n     measure to the energy and leadership of our two lay readers \n     today, the distinguished United States Senators from \n     Virginia.\n       Virginia's ambivalent relationship with the nation, \n     sometimes formative and leading, sometimes hostile and \n     resistant, has been matched on occasion by Washington's \n     dismissal of its historic neighbor across the river.\n       I experienced that shortsighted Washington view not many \n     years ago. My first assignment as a new priest was on the \n     staff of St. John's Church, Lafayette Square, across from the \n     White House. Twenty years later, as the Bishop of Virginia, I \n     was asked back to St. John's to speak to a dinner of former \n     lay leaders. A distinguished Washington lawyer whom I had \n     known when I was a young priest came up to me, and with \n     generosity and unintended Washington arrogance, said, \n     ``Peter, we are very proud of you. You are a bishop somewhere \n     now, aren't you?''\n       When the Potomac is a great divide, from Virginia--and the \n     rest of the nation--everyone suffers.\n       In just a few years, Virginia will mark 400 years since the \n     first English settlers brought to these shores their version \n     of the Christian faith. The religious life of Virginia across \n     these centuries has been dominated by a tension between faith \n     and freedom, a tension defined in the decades of the \n     eighteenth century when a few well-educated Virginians were \n     influenced by the European enlightenment and thousands of \n     Virginians were swayed by evangelical revivals across the \n     Commonwealth. In the 1730's, the majority Christian group in \n     Virginia was Episcopalian. By the 1790's, the majority was \n     Baptist. Ever since, Virginia Christian life has been marked \n     by a tension between the spiritual descendants of Thomas \n     Jefferson and the spiritual descendants of the great \n     evangelical revivals of the same era. Thomas Jefferson was \n     derided by his opponents as godless and dangerous. \n     Evangelical preachers were dismissed by the followers of \n     Jefferson as ignorant and prejudiced.\n       Today, in this well-ordered cathedral that speaks \n     eloquently of rationality and mystery both joined in the \n     service of God, it is difficult for us to grasp the \n     significance of the break between the Jeffersonian and the \n     evangelical traditions. And yet, the failure of Virginia to \n     bridge the gap between the two traditions is one of the great \n     and tragic might-have-beens of history. In England, in about \n     those same years, the late eighteenth and early nineteenth \n     centuries, personal, evangelical piety, stirred by John and \n     Charles Wesley, contributed mightily to the movement for the \n     abolition of slavery. In Virginia at the time, voices against \n     slavery were rare. Thomas Jefferson wrote persuasively about \n     inalienable human rights, but he held on to his slaves. What \n     might have happened in Virginia if the humanist sense of \n     enlightenment had been nourished by a Christian conversion \n     experience that led to a passion against slavery? It didn't \n     happen, or at least it happened among so few that it made \n     little difference in Virginia. What might have been.\n       Even to this day, two communities exist side-by-side in \n     Virginia--one of independent, Bible-centered congregations \n     with inherited suspicion of cities, universities, and \n     contemporary culture. And the Jeffersonian tradition in \n     Virginia, while admirably zealous for\n\n[[Page S10731]]\n\n     the separation of church and state, often treats religion as \n     so much a private matter that it should have little to say in \n     the public realm. It is an overstatement, but not much of \n     one, to say that one community, the Jeffersonian tradition, \n     holds as an unexamined doctrine that religion is entirely a \n     private matter, while the other tradition of evangelical \n     piety, affirms that America is a Christian nation whose \n     values should be those of the Bible, interpreted in the most \n     conservative light.\n       Both traditions have held on to one dimension of personal \n     values shaped by Judeo-Christian standards. Virginia has a \n     powerful and priceless tradition of expecting high standards \n     of personal honor among its leaders. When Robert E. Lee was \n     President of Washington College in Lexington, the institution \n     that now bears his name along with Washington's, General Lee \n     was asked by a student for a book of rules. He responded, \n     famously, ``We have but one rule: our students are gentlemen \n     and a gentleman does not lie, cheat or steal.'' That rule, \n     adapted to the happy reality of coeducation, and spread from \n     a 19th Century elite to the whole of the Commonwealth, \n     reflects the heritage of personal honor that is still a \n     cherished value of all Virginians.\n       Contemporary Virginia needs to offer the rest of the nation \n     an example of joining its twin legacies of faith and freedom, \n     which includes its respect for personal honor and public \n     virtue.\n       Faith is nurtured in a climate of freedom. We have learned \n     that faith imposed by state authority is corrupting and \n     oppressive. The French philosopher Pascal once wrote that \n     ``people never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when \n     they do it from religious conviction.'' Religious zealots \n     from the great religions of the world who deny the freedom of \n     others betray the highest values of their own creeds. Faith \n     and freedom may be in tension but they need not be in \n     conflict.\n       We are in danger in America, and even across the world, of \n     dismissing serious commitment to religious faith as \n     irrelevant to public virtue or even dangerous to civic peace. \n     The crisis surrounding the President of the United States is \n     in part the inevitable result of the rupture between personal \n     faith and public life, between faith and freedom, the break \n     between personal honor and political values.\n       As this most violent century draws to an end, as race and \n     ethnicity and religion continue to divide people and to lead \n     to their slaughter, the world needs people of faith who honor \n     freedom; people committed to freedom who respect the \n     integrity of faith, people who can build societies that value \n     personal honor and public virtue.\n       The great religions of the world have much to say about our \n     life together. They cannot be relegated simply to the realm \n     of private preference. In the lesson from the Hebrew \n     scriptures today,\\1\\ the prophet Amos condemns those who take \n     shortcuts with the law that forbids commerce on the Sabbath. \n     The behavior condemned by the prophet may be ``legally \n     accurate,'' but those who engage in behavior that oppresses \n     the poor are corrupt. Paul, in his first letter to \n     Timothy,\\1\\ insists that the Christians hold their rulers in \n     their prayers--assuming that the public good requires leaders \n     of personal honor but since they are flawed human beings like \n     the rest of us, they need the support of our prayers. And in \n     the parable of the dishonest steward,\\1\\ Jesus warns that the \n     distinction between private and public virtue is artificial. \n     The one who is dishonest in very little things will also be \n     dishonest in much. The ancient Bible stories are right on \n     target for the issues of today.\n       This cathedral stands on the highest hill in the District \n     of Columbia. Its towers dominate the Washington skyline, not \n     with the power to oppress, but with the powers to inspire and \n     to call a people to personal integrity and public virtue. \n     That does not mean our leaders must be saints. Many of us \n     know our senators, other leaders, and our bishops well enough \n     to know that sainthood has eluded all of us. We are all \n     flawed, fallible persons, but that does not suggest that our \n     quest for private and public virtue is in vain. We need to \n     reaffirm the integrity of faith, faith in God who empowers \n     each one of us to become the person God intends us to be; the \n     God who lifts us up when we fall, and who redeems our \n     failures with new hope. We need to recover a personal \n     faith that sustains both private honor and public virtue. \n     We need to bridge the gap between the sacred and the \n     secular, not by a diminution of freedom, but with an \n     expansion of faith that respects freedom and the freedom \n     that protects the nurture of faith and the privacy of \n     individuals.\n       This nation is engaged in a great public conversation about \n     the crisis in the Presidency. President Clinton's moral \n     authority is severely compromised. Whether this crisis ends \n     with resignation, impeachment, or censure and a crippled \n     presidency for the remaining two years of the term, it is \n     important for the well being of the nation to consider what \n     we can learn about ourselves in this crisis. That in no way \n     absolves the President from his responsibility. But have we \n     separated personal, private morality from public life so \n     extensively that this was a crisis waiting to happen? Do we \n     have a system of raising up leaders in public life that \n     encourages and rewards honor, integrity, and personal \n     commitment to our shared values? Or, do we separate faith and \n     freedom, personal honor and public virtue, so extensively \n     that our moral life together is imperiled? Our moral life is \n     now endangered by excessive public intrusion into private \n     life and dishonorable private behavior that erodes public \n     trust. With our traditions, Virginians can make a difference \n     in the national conversation.\n       Virginia is a Commonwealth where faith and freedom have \n     competed but have flourished; we are a commonwealth that \n     demands of our leaders personal honor and service to public \n     virtue. Let those great traditions come together again in a \n     new and mutually respectfully union so that our people may be \n     strengthened.\n       In his farewell address in 1796, our first President, \n     George Washington, said, ``Of all the dispositions and habits \n     which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are \n     indispensable supports . . . a volume could not trace all \n     their connections with private and public felicity . . . let \n     us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be \n     maintained without religion . . . reason and experience both \n     forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in \n     exclusion of religious principle.''\n       Virginia is the birthplace of English speaking Christian \n     faith in America. Virginia is the birthplace of Thomas \n     Jefferson's statute for religious freedom. We are a community \n     that offers to a nation the union of personal honor serving \n     public virtue, of personal faith in a climate of freedom that \n     restricts intrusive government.\n       In New Testament Greek, the word ``crisis'' means a time of \n     judgment, a time of separation, a time of clarification. A \n     crisis in the view of the Bible is often created by the word \n     of God, proclaimed by the prophets, exposing the gap between \n     where people are and where they ought to be. We are living at \n     such a time and that time, the Bible teaches us, can be one \n     of hope and of new beginning. May the traditions of Virginia, \n     of faith and freedom, of private piety and public virtue, of \n     personal honor and public service, come together again in \n     this great nation so that future generations will look back \n     on our day as a time of moral renewal and refreshing new \n     hope, a time when God called this nation to a rebirth of our \n     spiritual strength.\n\n     \\1\\ Amos 8:4-7, I Timothy 2:1-8, and Luke 16:1-13.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10730-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ACC'S NEW DETROIT HEADQUARTERS AND OFFICIAL DEDICATION\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \naward-winning Alabama journalist and author\n\n[[Page S10732]]\n\nwho has written the definitive history of the World War II military \ncareer of Hollywood-great Jimmy Stewart. Mr. Smith, who served with \nStewart in WWII, wrote ``A Retrospective of the World War II Military \nCareer of Hollywood's James M. (Jimmy) Stewart'' for the James M. \nStewart Museum Foundation, located in Stewart's hometown--Indiana, PA. \nI believe excerpts from this article are a fitting tribute to both the \nlife and legacy of a true American hero: Jimmy Stewart, as well as to \none of Alabama's fine authors: Starr Smith. In compliance with the \nCongressional Record text-length rules, only excerpts of Mr. Smith's \narticle could be placed in the Record; however, I encourage my \ncolleagues and the American people to obtain a complete copy of this \nimportant article from either the James M. Stewart Museum or the \nSeptember 1998 edition of The Retired Officers Magazine.\n  In addition to his many accomplishments, Smith is a travel columnist \nfor the Montgomery Advertiser and is a retired Air Force Reserve \ncolonel. He lives in Montgomery, AL.\n  Mr. President, the following are excerpts from ``A Retrospective of \nthe World War II Military Career of Hollywood's James M. (Jimmy) \nStewart'' by Starr Smith:\n\n       When the melancholy news came of Jimmy Stewart's death I \n     was in Montreal, Canada. I thought it singular that I was out \n     of my own country at the time because my relationship with \n     this remarkable American had taken place on foreign soil--\n     wartime England. Much has been said and written since \n     Stewart's death about his extraordinary life and career as a \n     film actor of the first rank, but little has been said about \n     Stewart's brilliant and brave record as an Army Air Force \n     combat pilot and commander in World War II.\n       I served with Stewart on a windswept and cold bomber \n     station, called Old Buckingham, near the North Sea between \n     Cambridge and Norwich in England's East Anglia in 1943-1944. \n     Our outfit was the 453rd Bomb Group. The commander, Colonel \n     Ramsay Potts, was a battle-tested B-24 specialist who had \n     been on the historic and pivotal Ploesti mission and earned \n     the Distinguished Service Cross. Stewart, then a major, was \n     the group's operations officer and I was an intelligence \n     officer who handled much of the briefings for the air crews \n     prior to their mission over Nazi Germany. It was in this \n     capacity that I worked with Stewart, night after night, \n     preparing the details of the mission. I have never known a \n     more intelligent, knowledgeable, hardworking, conscientious \n     and dedicated officer.\n       In my book, ``Only the Days Are Long: Reports of a \n     Journalist and World Traveler,'' I wrote of Stewart: ``At \n     night, working with me preparing the mission, Stewart was \n     crisp and business-like; reserved, but he knew his job and \n     was a keen student of daylight precision bombing. (The \n     Americans bombed in daylight, the RAF at night). It was \n     interesting to see Stewart at the bar of the Officer's Club \n     after a tough day and hear his discussion of the mission with \n     the returning pilots. But even then he was always slightly \n     aloof. He was never one of the boys. This is not to say \n     Stewart was unfriendly. Rather, he went about his work with a \n     cool professional detachment--a single purpose approach that \n     did not allow for personal involvement. This, I think, was \n     the reason for this success in the war. He was determined to \n     prove that he was more than an actor, more than a Hollywood \n     star. He was determined to prove that now he could measure up \n     as a man doing a really important job in the military \n     crucible and not just a celluloid hero.\n       Almost a year before Pearl Harbor, Jimmy Stewart had a deep \n     feeling that his country would soon be at war. Stewart also \n     knew that if war came he wanted to be in uniform and overseas \n     on combat duty.\n       At the beginning of the new year of 1941, Stewart was at \n     the top of his career as a movie actor and international \n     star. His 1939 picture, ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' has \n     made him a folk hero throughout America and he was destined \n     for an Academy Award for his role as the reporter in \n     ``Philadelphia Story'' later in the year. His life was \n     blissful, romantic, flawless, and ahead was the golden \n     promise of infinite stardom as one of the premier movie \n     players of all time.\n       . . . but with England fighting Hitler since 1939, Edward \n     R. Murrow's bleak broadcasts from London, the Pacific war \n     against the Japanese going badly for the British . . . Jimmy \n     Stewart decided to join the fight. But, he faced two major \n     roadblocks: his boss and his country. Louis B. Mayer, the \n     forceful and dictatorial head of MGM used every persuasive \n     tactic at his command--choice roles, contract revisions, free \n     time to help with the war effort as a civilian. The other \n     matter was different.\n       In September of 1940, the Selective Service Act became law, \n     and men between the ages of 21 and 36 were required to \n     register. Being 32, Stewart registered . . . when he was \n     called up for a physical in late 1940, he was turned down: \n     underweight. That could have ended the whole affair. . . . \n     perhaps thinking of his father's fierce patriotism and his \n     service in two wars, plus his own fervent love of country, \n     Stewart favored the volunteer route. He appealed the Army's \n     underweight decision, embarked on an eating binge, made the \n     weight requirements and reported for induction on March 22, \n     1941 at Fort McArthur, California.\n       Stewart was among the very few officers in American \n     military history to rise from private to full colonel in \n     slightly over four years. Moreover, Stewart was actually on \n     combat duty all the time he was overseas, performing vital, \n     demanding and dangerous jobs: squadron operations officer, \n     squadron commander, group operations officer, wing operations \n     officer, and later at the end--Second Bomb Wing Commander. \n     And, all the while, he was flying combat missions as a B-24 \n     pilot and command pilot.\n       . . . Stewart spent all of his service in England assigned \n     to the 2nd Combat Wing. . . . in late August of 1945, he \n     returned to New York on the Queen Elizabeth. And on September \n     29th of that year, Stewart was discharged at Andrews Air \n     Force Base in Washington. He was immediately appointed a full \n     colonel in the Air Force Reserve. In his war years, Stewart \n     had flown 20 combat missions, among them the tough ones: \n     Brunswick, Bremen, Frankfort, Schweinfut, and I recall that \n     he was on Berlin twice--once leading the entire 1,000 plane \n     8th Air Force. His wartime decorations include: Distinguished \n     Flying Cross, with Oak Leaf Cluster; four Air Medals, and the \n     French Croix de Guerre with Palm. He was promoted to \n     Brigadier General in the Air Force Reserve in 1959 and \n     retired in 1968. After Stewart died in July of 1997, Air \n     Power History published a memoriam . . . (which) contained \n     this little-known fact: ``In 1966, during his annual two \n     weeks of active duty, Stewart requested a combat assignment \n     and participated in a bombing strike over Vietnam.''\n       . . . With all the myriad honors of a celebrated and \n     eclectic career, including the highest in his profession--the \n     Academy Award--it is not too much to believe that Jimmy \n     Stewart reached the blue lawn of his life in those eventful \n     and dangerous years of World War II. A small town boy who \n     grew up with strong family values and a bed-rock foundation \n     in honesty and integrity, intertwined with a fervent \n     patriotism--Stewart served his country with dedication and \n     distinction, and, like F. Scott Fitzgerald, his fellow \n     Princetonian--he lived his life with an unbending \n     determination, subtle style and a certain mystique.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10731-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF LA SALLE ACADEMY\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am honored to be invited to such \na landmark event and I rise to offer my congratulations to the La Salle \nAcademy in celebrating its 150th anniversary of educating New York \nCity's youth. Founded in 1848, the Catholic, college-preparatory school \nof La Salle Academy currently serves more than 540 young men who \nrepresent over 60 nationalities. La Salle Academy seeks to educate \nyoung men of New York City from different cultural, racial, and social \ngroups with special outreach programs for those most in need. This \nenables students to grow intellectually, morally, and physically in a \nracially diverse setting while encouraging them to contribute to their \ncommunities. This fine Academy consistently molds young men into \nvaluable members of society and sends over 90% of its students to \npursue higher education. Institutions, such as La Salle, are key assets \nfor introducing our young adults to the many different aspects of our \ndiverse society. Both the graduates and students of La Salle Academy \nact as model citizens for others to emulate and I praise this \ninstitution and other organizations of its kind for its countless \ncontributions to society. We are fortunate to have such a valuable \ninstitution reside in New York State. I sincerely hope that La Salle \nAcademy will continue to serve its students and the members of this \ncommunity in such an important fashion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/22/senate-section/article/S10732-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10732-S10733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           USE OF THE ROTUNDA FOR THE NELSON MANDELA CEREMONY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.
