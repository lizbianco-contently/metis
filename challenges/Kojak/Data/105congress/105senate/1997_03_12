There will now be 30 minutes under the control \nof the Senator from Minnesota, [Mr. Grams].\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, before I begin my statement dealing with \nthe nomination today, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from Colorado, \nSenator Campbell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I appreciate being \nable to speak on behalf of Mr. Pena for a couple of minutes.\n  I have known Federico Pena personally and professionally for over 15 \nyears, Mr. President. I know him first as a friend and I know him as a \nprofessional with the highest integrity. He was that kind of a \nlegislator when he was the minority leader of our State legislature. He \nwas that kind of a mayor, as the mayor of our largest city of Denver. \nHe was that kind of person when he was Secretary of the Department of \nTransportation.\n  His resume reflects an unsurpassed commitment and dedication to \npublic service. His achievements display remarkable leadership, vision, \nand hard work.\n  Mr. Pena leaves an indelible mark on every project he undertakes. The \nnow famous Denver International Airport was a product of his foresight \nand leadership. The Department of Transportation, where he served as a \nSecretary for 4 years, is now leaner and more effective than it once \nwas--success in taming and trimming a vast bureaucracy that can only be \naccomplished with discipline, determination, and hard work that \nFederico Pena was willing to put in.\n  Despite the many professional attributes Mr. Pena has, and the many \ndimensions of professionalism he brings to public service, perhaps none \nare so important in our work as his honesty and integrity. This is a \nquality the Federal Government cannot afford to turn down.\n  Having known him for the many years that I have, I am convinced that \nFederico Pena will bring to the Department of Energy the same \nintegrity, honesty, and leadership for which he is known. That is his \nindelible mark that he has left on our State and our U.S. Government.\n\n[[Page S2158]]\n\n  I simply urge my colleagues to support the nomination when it comes \nup this afternoon, and I thank the Senator for yielding these couple of \nminutes. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I take a few minutes this morning to talk \nabout today's pending nomination, and also some of the problems that \nare surrounding one of our most important issues, and that is the \nstorage of this country's nuclear waste.\n  Mr. President, as the full Senate takes up the nomination of Federico \nPena to become the next Secretary of Energy, I rise today to discuss an \nissue of critical importance that has become necessarily linked to the \nPena nomination again, that is our Nation's nuclear waste storage \nproblem.\n  I say the two are linked because it has been the failure of the very \nagency Mr. Pena has been appointed to lead--the U.S. Department of \nEnergy--to carry out its legal obligations that has led to the nearly \ncritical situation in which we currently find ourselves. It is this \nvery failure on the part of the DOE which threatens utility ratepayers \ntoday and taxpayers in the future.\n  For the Senate to fully appreciate the gravity of the situation, I \nbelieve that a brief summary of the history of this problem is in \norder.\n  Since 1982, utility ratepayers have been required to pay the Federal \nGovernment nearly $13 billion of their hard-earned dollars in exchange \nfor the promise that the Department of Energy would transport and store \ncommercially generated nuclear waste in a centralized facility by \nJanuary 31, 1998.\n  However, with this deadline less than a year away and with over $6 \nbillion spent by the Department of Energy, there has been very little \nprogress to date toward keeping this 15-year-old promise of \nestablishing a centralized Federal storage facility.\n  In fact, though there has been measurable progress at the Yucca \nMountain, NV facility, a permanent repository will not be completed \nuntil well into the next century. Mr. President, the 80 nuclear \nwastesites on this chart graphically illustrate the extent of this \ngrowing problem.\n  Clearly, if the DOE is to meet the January 31, 1998 deadline, it must \nbegin accepting nuclear waste at an interim storage facility, yet, that \nhas not happened. In fact, the DOE recently notified States and \nutilities that it would not accept their commercial nuclear waste \ndespite the law and the Federal court's effort to enforce it. Worse \nyet, even in the face of significant taxpayer liability for such \nirresponsible behavior by the Federal Government, the DOE has failed to \noffer a single constructive proposal to even begin the process of \nfulfilling its responsibility to the American people.\n  Despite those facts, utility ratepayers are still being required to \npay for a mismanaged program. In fact, over $630 million from the \nratepayers go into the nuclear waste fund each year--without any \ntangible benefits or results to show for them.\n  Our Nation's utility consumers and their pocketbooks aren't just hit \nonce, either. Because of the DOE's failure to act, ratepayers are \ncurrently being forced to pay their hard-earned dollars to store waste \nonsite at commercial utility plants--a burden that would not be \nnecessary had the Energy Department lived up to its legal obligations.\n  Take, for example, the situation facing ratepayers in my home State \nof Minnesota. Since 1982, Minnesota's nuclear energy consumers have \npaid over $250 million into the nuclear waste fund believing that the \nFederal Government would fulfill its obligation to transport nuclear \nwaste out of the State of Minnesota. But as time went on and the DOE \ncontinued to ignore their responsibilities, utilities in Minnesota and \naround the country were forced to temporarily store their waste within \nthe confines of their own facilities. When it became clear to many \nutilities that storage space was running out and the Department of \nEnergy would not accept waste by the established deadline, then the \nutilities had to go to their States to ask for additional onsite \nstorage or else be forced to shut down those operations.\n  For example, ratepayers in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and \nWisconsin were forced to pay for onsite storage in cooling pools at \nPrairie Island in southeastern Minnesota. In 1994, with storage space \nrunning out, the Minnesota Legislature--after a bruising battle--voted \nto allow for limited onsite dry cask storage until the year 2002.\n\n  Mr. President, the cost associated with this onsite storage is simply \nstaggering--ratepayers in our service area alone have paid over $50 \nmillion for these costs and are estimated to pay another $111 million \nby the year 2015, in addition to the required payments to the Federal \nGovernment, the nuclear storage fund.\n  To make matters worse, storage space will run out at Prairie Island \nin 2002, forcing the plant to close unless the State legislature once \nagain makes up for the DOE's inaction. This will threaten over 30 \npercent of Minnesota's overall energy resources and will likely lead to \neven higher costs for Minnesota's ratepayers. In fact, the Minnesota \nDepartment of Public Service estimates that the increase in costs could \nreach as high as 17 percent, forcing ratepayers to eventually pay three \ntimes: Once to the nuclear waste fund, again up to $100 million for \nonsite storage and yet again for increased energy costs.\n  And Minnesota is not alone in facing this unacceptable situation. \nThirty six other States across the Nation will be facing similar \ncircumstances of either shutting down their energy-generating capacity \nor continuing to bail out the Federal Government and its failure to \nact.\n  Ratepayers are not the only ones who face serious consequences \nbecause of inaction by the DOE; taxpayers are threatened as well.\n  Last year, the Federal courts ruled that the DOE will be liable for \ndamages if it does not accept commercial nuclear waste by January 31, \n1998. Under current law, these damages will not be paid for by anyone \nat the DOE, it will go to the American taxpayers--at an estimated cost \nof somewhere between $40 and $80 billion. Such a tremendous liability \nburden on taxpayers would make the public bailout of the savings and \nloan collapse seem small in comparison.\n  What's worse is that while our States, utility ratepayers, and \ntaxpayers are being unfairly punished by the Department of Energy's \ninaction, the Federal Government has been active in meeting the interim \nnuclear waste storage needs of foreign countries.\n  Under the Atoms for Peace Program, the DOE's has resumed collecting \nnuclear spent fuel from a total of 41 countries. In fact, since last \nSeptember, the DOE Savannah River facility had already received foreign \nspent fuel from Chile, Columbia, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, and \nCanada.\n  Ultimately, as I learned during a recent trip to the Savannah River \nsite, up to 890 foreign research reactor cores will be accepted by the \nDOE over a 13 year period.\n  In addition, our Government is actively helping other countries \nreduce their nuclear waste stockpiles. With the Department of Defense \nspending up to $400 million on designing and constructing an interim \nnuclear waste storage facility in Russia to help dismantle the cold war \nthreat, the world will certainly be a safer place.\n  Now, Mr. President, as a Senator who is concerned about our national \nsecurity needs, I understand the rationale behind reducing our \ninternational nuclear dangers.\n  But, what I, and many others cannot comprehend is how our Government \nhas made it a priority to help foreign countries with their nuclear \nwaste problems while simultaneously ignoring the concerns right here in \nour own country; not only that, but denying it has the responsibility \nand is going to court to stop it.\n  It seems clear to me that while States, utilities, and ratepayers \nhave kept their end of the bargain, the DOE has not done its part. And \nthat sends the wrong message to the American people about trusting the \npromises of the Federal Government.\n  Maybe that's why the National Association of Regulatory Utility \nCommissioners, 46 State agencies and 36 utilities have joined forces in \na lawsuit to stop ratepayers' payments into the nuclear waste fund and \nto escrow $600 million that will soon go into the fund.\n  For too long, our States, utilities, and ratepayers have acted in \ngood faith, relying upon the Federal Government to live up to its \nobligations. Evidently, they have had enough of the\n\n[[Page S2159]]\n\nDOE's excuses for inaction and have proposed their own recourse.\n  This issue has created strange bedfellows as well. In a recent \ninterview, former DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary agreed that action on \ninterim site is needed as soon as possible.\n  It's unfortunate that Secretary O'Leary waited until she was free \nfrom the administration to openly support interim storage, but I think \nher comments point not only to the need to resolve the interim storage \nimpasse but also the political nature of this issue--again, I say the \npolitical nature of this issue. It is not science or technology, it's \npolitics. She specifically stated that certain high-ranking officials \nconnected with Vice President Al Gore see this issue in terms of \npolitics, not policy.\n  In addition, the former head of the Office of Civilian Radioactive \nWaste Management under the Clinton administration, Daniel Dreyfus, \nbelieves the DOE must move to meet the January 31, 1998, deadline.\n  Key labor unions have even joined the fight to restore the DOE's \npromises.\n  J.J. Barry, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical \nWorkers, recently wrote me, saying\n\n       I am calling on you and your colleagues to put partisan \n     politics aside for the good of our nation and America's \n     workers and their families. We must address this problem now \n     or else face serious economic and environmental consequences \n     later. Please support passage of S. 104.\n\n  I am also pleased that we have received the support of the Building \nand Construction Trades Union in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters of labor \nsupport be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAMS. Despite this widespread, bipartisan support for our \nefforts to resolve the storage problem, the White House, under the \ndictates of Vice President Al Gore, still has not offered an \nalternative to either our bipartisan legislation, which they oppose, or \nthe failed status quo.\n  The American people deserve leadership from the Clinton-Gore \nadministration, not just the consequences of Presidential aspirations.\n  If such leadership will not come from the Clinton-Gore \nadministration, then it will come from Congress. Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, Senator Larry \nCraig and I crafted a bipartisan proposal, S. 104, identical to \nlegislation supported last year by 63 Senators.\n  We have put this proposal forward as a good faith effort to help \nresolve this situation for the sake of protecting our environment and \nthe legitimate interests of our ratepayers and taxpayers.\n  As I've stated, Congress has an obligation to protect the American \npublic from the estimated $40 to $80 billion they face in liability \nexpenses.\n  Our bill will reform our current civilian nuclear waste program to \navoid the squandering of billions of dollars of ratepayers' and \ntaxpayers' money. It will make our environment safer, eliminate the \ncurrent need for on-site storage at our Nation's nuclear plants, keep \nplants from shutting down prematurely due to lack of storage space, and \nkeep energy prices stable.\n  Our legislation also assures that transportation of nuclear waste \nwill continue to be conducted in a safe manner. In fact, there have \nalready been 2,400 shipments of high-level nuclear waste in our Nation, \nincluding numerous shipments of naval spent fuel. The safety record of \nthese shipments speaks for itself.\n  There are many other aspects of this bill which will help resolve the \ncrisis facing the American public. Today, we on the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee will take a giant step forward in moving \nthat bill closer to Senate passage.\n  I applaud my distinguished colleague from Alaska, Chairman Murkowski, \nfor his efforts in moving ahead with this much-needed, historic \nlegislation.\n  Keeping in mind the Clinton-Gore administration's stated opposition \nto our legislation, I took the opportunity to ask Secretary-designate \nPena for any specific, constructive alternatives he would propose to \nresolve this issue and help the Federal Government meet its legal \nobligations.\n  Mr. Pena's failure to offer specific responses during an Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee hearing prompted me to send a letter to him \nasking for a detailed response outlining the specific steps he would \nurge to meet the January 31, 1998, deadline.\n  After exchanging a series of letters with Mr. Pena, I have become \ncompletely unsatisfied with the lack of specificity in his responses to \nmy questions. While I appreciate Mr. Pena's stated willingness to work \nwith us toward an eventual resolution of this issue and his belief that \nthis is a federal problem worthy of a Federal solution, I believe the \nAmerican people deserve more.\n  They deserve specific answers from an administration that has buried \nits head in the sand and an independent leader at the helm of the DOE \nwho will affect a change in policy.\n  I have concluded that at this point in time, no one recommended by \nthe Clinton-Gore administration to head the DOE will be allowed to \nlead.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to read a portion of \nMr. Pena's letter dated March 6 that best illustrates my point.\n  Mr. Pena writes:\n\n       I cannot, however, outline for you specific steps for \n     meeting the January 31, 1998 date. The Department of Energy \n     has indicated to the court and in responses to the Congress \n     that there is no set of actions or activities that could be \n     taken under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to enable the \n     Department to begin receiving spent fuel at an interim \n     storage facility or a repository on that date.\n\n  Frankly, Mr. President, as an elected representative of the \nratepayers who have had over $6 billion thrown away by a department \nwithout a single answer to their problems and as an elected \nrepresentative of the taxpayers who will ultimately assume tens of \nbillions of dollars in liability if progress is not made, I find that \nanswer insufficient and devoid of the leadership we so desperately need \nat the DOE.\n  I believe that Mr. Pena is a decent and honorable man, but I also \nbelieve that he has not provided the needed answers or displayed the \nleadership necessary to help resolve this pressing national issue.\n  Even though I shall do my best in working with him in the future, I \ncannot, in good conscience, today vote to confirm Mr. Pena to be our \nnext Secretary of Energy.\n         International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Rod Grams,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grams: I am writing on behalf of the 750,000 \n     members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical \n     Workers (IBEW), to ask you to support S. 104, the Nuclear \n     Waste Policy Act of 1997. Nuclear energy cleanly produces 20 \n     percent of our nation's electricity, reduces our reliance on \n     foreign energy sources, and provides quality jobs for \n     thousands of Americans, including 15,000 of our members at 46 \n     commercial nuclear plants.\n       The IBEW is concerned that the government's program to \n     manage used nuclear fuel at these plants is woefully out of \n     touch with reality. I am sure that you are aware of the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals' ruling last July in favor of a lawsuit by \n     states and utilities, which stated in clear and unambiguous \n     terms that the federal government must keep its contractual \n     obligation to begin removing used fuel by 1998.\n       The Department of Energy (DOE), however, says it will not \n     begin accepting used fuel for storage before 2010 at the \n     earliest. By that date, 80 nuclear stations will have rune \n     out of existing storage space. This could result in premature \n     plant closings, loss of jobs, and other devastating economic \n     consequences. By providing for central storage by the turn of \n     the century, S. 104 gives the DOE a framework for meeting its \n     legal obligation.\n       The Congress has been debating the storage issues for years \n     without reaching a conclusion. It is time for a decision. \n     Yucca Mountain is the best possible choice that is available. \n     Unless Congress acts now to select Yucca Mountain, the wastes \n     will continue to be stored near communities around the \n     country, with all of the dire ramifications that such a \n     decision can pose.\n       I am calling on you and your colleagues to put partisan \n     politics aside for the good of our nation and America's \n     workers and their families. We must address this problem now \n     or else face serious economic and environmental consequences \n     later. Please support passage of S. 104.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       J.J. Barry,\n                                          International President.\n\n[[Page S2160]]\n\n         American Federation of Labor, Building and Construction \n           Trades Department,\n                                Washington, DC, February 10, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: I write to urge you to vote for S. 104, the \n     Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. It will be considered by \n     your Committee this week. Unless the Congress votes to \n     approve this measure now, the terrible nuclear waste problem \n     that confronts communities across America will soon be \n     intolerable. Every town in the United States is vulnerable to \n     the possibility of sudden and uncontrollable disaster. This \n     issue must be given priority by the members of the Committee.\n       In testimony last week, the Committee heard Undersecretary \n     of Energy, Thomas P. Grumbly, reveal the Department has more \n     than 100 million gallons of high-level radioactive waste \n     residing at facilities in the States of Washington, Idaho and \n     South Carolina. And, additional and significant nuclear waste \n     is being stored in varying degrees of safety by commercial \n     power companies around the nation.\n       The Congress has been debating the storage issue for years \n     without reaching a conclusion. It is time for a decision. \n     Yucca Mountain is the best possible choice that is available. \n     Unless the Committee acts now to select Yucca Mountain, the \n     wastes will continue to be stored up in communities around \n     the country, with all of the dire ramifications that such a \n     decision can pose.\n       The Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO, \n     the 15 national and international unions it represents, urge \n     you to let our safe and well-trained members begin the hard \n     work that needs to be done to make Yucca Mountain the most \n     secure storage area for nuclear fuel that is available on the \n     face of the earth. If the Committee allows this opportunity \n     to pass, it is estimated that within the next decade, some 55 \n     sites in 30 states will be filled with spent nuclear fuel \n     totaling some 11,000 metric tons of uranium.\n       Chairman Murkowski expressed concern during the hearing \n     with the thought of letting spent fuel accumulate at reactor \n     sites. That concern is justified, and, possibly is \n     understated. Despite the reluctance of the Administration to \n     take action on this controversial issue, it is clear that the \n     time for debate is long past, and a courageous decision by \n     the Congress is necessary if the nation is to avert a serious \n     environmental disaster of its own making.\n       Please vote S. 104 out of committee so that the full Senate \n     can debate this critical issue as soon as possible.\n       With kind personal regards, I remain\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Robert A. Georgine,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield my remaining time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me wish the occupant of the chair, \nmy good friend from Utah, a good morning. I extend my good wishes.\n  Mr. President, I will proceed in accordance with the anticipated vote \nthis afternoon on the Pena nomination, and I believe both the chairman \nof the Energy Committee, myself, and Senator Bumpers, the ranking \nmember, have 10 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I heard the comments expressed by my good friend, the \nSenator from Minnesota, Senator Grams, relative to his concern and the \nconcern of his State over the disposition of high-level nuclear waste \nthat is in some 80 locations in 41 States throughout the country, and \nthe inability of the current administration to address its \nresponsibility and hence the responsibility of Congress to meet the \ncontractual commitments made some years ago to take that nuclear waste \nnext year, in 1998.\n  The reality is that the ratepayers in this country have paid over \nthat period of time some $12 billion which has gone into the general \nfund. And, as consequence, we are facing a reality that next year we \nare not going to be able to meet the obligation of taking that waste. \nSo we can anticipate an opportunity for full employment for the lawyers \nthat are associated with this issue because there is going to be a \ngiant liability that is coming to the American taxpayer. It is \nestimated to be somewhere in the area of $40 billion to $80 billion. \nThe current estimate is about $59 billion. But usually it goes up from \nthere. This is the liability, or at least a portion of it, which the \nFederal Government will be subjected to as a consequence of its \ninability to perform on its contractual commitment. I do not take that \nlightly. As a consequence, as we address on the floor later on today \nthe nomination of the Secretary of Energy, Federico Pena, I think this \nis a significant question.\n  I rise today in support of that nomination. I also rise to advise my \ncolleagues that the delay in considering the nomination has not been \nabout the nominee's qualifications. The nominee is qualified. The \ncommittee has held hearings on the nomination. We have investigated \nmatters brought to our attention. We found him to be qualified and \nreported the nomination favorably on a 19-to-0 vote with one Member \nvoting ``present.'' But there has been an issue, and that issue has \nbeen whether the new Secretary is going to have the ability, the \nflexibility, and the authority to work with Congress to solve the \nlooming nuclear waste storage problem. As I indicated earlier, this \nwaste is stacking up in our towns and in our communities near our homes \nand schools at 80 locations in 41 States.\n  Some have said, ``How important is nuclear energy?'' Well, nuclear \nenergy is contributing about 22 percent of the total power generated in \nthe United States today. People look at power. They take it for \ngranted. They expect it to work. It is always there. It is almost an \nentitlement. But it has to come from somewhere. It has to come from \ninvestment and from transmissions. It has to come from some kind of \nenergy source, and nuclear is an important contributor. Nearly a \nquarter of the energy produced in the United States. But the waste, as \na consequence of these nuclear power plants, has been stacking up. A \nFederal court has said that the Government must take that waste by \n1998.\n  As I have said before, Americans put $12 billion into the nuclear \nwaste fund. What do we have to show for it? Nothing. The problem that \nis unique about this is that nobody wants it. Absolutely no State wants \nto have this waste. You can throw it up in the air. It has to come down \nsomewhere. It will not stay up there. That is the basic problem. The \nStates in question are running out of space. These are the States that \nhave reactors, and the storage that they have is not permanent storage. \nIt wasn't designed for long-term storage. It was designed for short-\nterm storage. That space is filling up. As a consequence, they may have \nto limit the construction of new storage capacities. States might not \nlicense for new storage capacity.\n  Mr. President, I ask for another 4 minutes under the time remaining \non the 30 minutes that was given to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  The reality is that the final repository won't be ready until the \nyear 2015. That is where we are; the permanent repository. We need \nthat. But it will not be ready.\n  We have a 50-50 chance of taking that waste. This poses an \nenvironmental and public safety challenge. I have indicated the risk to \nthe taxpayers--currently $59 billion. Some electricity production may \nbe shut down.\n  Mr. President, we simply need the action now. However, we had a \nproblem when the administration, in a communication by the Vice \nPresident, told a congressional leadership group this was not a matter \nthat was up for consideration at that meeting. He inferred that we \ncould leave the waste where it was until Yucca Mountain was built.\n  After I heard about that statement, I postponed consideration of S. \n104 and the vote on Mr. Pena so we could begin a process of attempting \nto work with the administration to get this back on track. In a meeting \nwith the White House Chief of Staff, Erskine Bowles, I asked him to \nempower the new Energy Secretary to work with us. I said the Senate \ncannot accept the Vice President's ``leave it there'' policy. I asked \nMr. Bowles to send down a nominee who had flexibility. I have had \nseveral conversations with Mr. Pena, Mr. Bowles, and the White House, \nand judging from those conversations and a recent letter from Mr. \nBowles, it seems that the administration has now decided to choose \ndialog over the Vice President's stonewalling, which is the only way I \ncan put it. I am glad to see that the new Energy Secretary will now \nhave a portfolio to work with the Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Mr. Bowles to me be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S2161]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  The White House,\n\n\n                              Chief of Staff to the President,\n\n                                                February 27, 1997.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: The Administration is committed to \n     resolving the complex and important issue of nuclear waste \n     storage in a timely and sensible manner, consistent with \n     sound science and the protection of public health, safety, \n     and the environment. The Federal government's long-standing \n     commitment to permanent, geologic disposal should remain the \n     basic goal of high-level radioactive waste management policy.\n       The Administration believes that a decision on the siting \n     of an interim storage facility should be based on objective, \n     science-based criteria and should be informed by the \n     viability assessment of Yucca Mountain, expected in 1998. \n     Therefore, as the President has stated, he would veto any \n     legislation that would designate an interim storage facility \n     at a specific site before the viability determination of a \n     permanent geological repository at Yucca Mountain has been \n     determined.\n       Following confirmation, Secretary Pena has the portfolio in \n     the Administration to work cooperatively with the Committee \n     and others in Congress on nuclear waste disposal issues \n     within the confines of the President's policy as stated \n     above. Secretary Pena will also be meeting with \n     representatives of the nuclear industry and other \n     stakeholders to discuss DOE's response to a recent court \n     decision on the Department's contractual obligations \n     regarding nuclear waste.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Erskine B. Bowles.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In light of that, I am prepared to urge my colleagues \nto vote favorably on Mr. Pena's nomination this morning, and I look \nforward to working with him and members of my committee on the nuclear \nwaste issue as well as other issues facing the Department of Energy.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I strongly support the President's \nnomination of Federico Pena as Secretary of Energy. He comes before the \nSenate today with 4 years of experience as Secretary of Transportation. \nThis experience will stand him in good stead in his new position since \nthe Department of Transportation has a number of features that are in \ncommon with the Department of Energy.\n  Both agencies were formed by fusing organizational elements taken \nfrom various other departments and agencies.\n  Both agencies currently have responsibility for a wide range of \ndivergent issues and programs, and in recent years both agencies have \nhad to square the desires of their traditional core constituencies with \nnew environmental considerations and sensitivities.\n  Only two of Secretary Pena's predecessors, James Schlesinger and \nJames Watkins, were able to come before the Senate at the time of their \nnomination with comparable credentials as managers of large and complex \nFederal organizations. The Department of Transportation's budget is \nmore than $30 billion, nearly twice the budget of the Department of \nEnergy. It employs nearly 100,000 Federal employees compared to the \n20,000 employed at the Department of Energy.\n  Secretary-designate Pena has faced some important challenges as \nSecretary of Transportation. He will face even more important \nchallenges as Secretary of Energy.\n  As the first order of business, he will need to develop a close \nworking relationship with the Department of Defense. Cooperation with \nthe Department of Defense is essential to the success of the Department \nof Energy in carrying out its national security missions. His track \nrecord at the Department of Transportation is very encouraging in this \nrespect. Secretary Pena went out of his way while at the Department of \nTransportation to establish constructive partnerships with the \nDepartment of Defense on issues of mutual concern, such as shipbuilding \ntechnology. He also worked closely and successfully with DOD on \ncommercialization of global positioning satellite systems.\n  A second major challenge for the new Secretary is to preserve and \nenhance the research and development capabilities of the Department. \nOur nominee's track record at the Department of Transportation is also \nimpressive in this area. Under Secretary Pena's leadership, the \nDepartment of Transportation posted a 60-percent increase in research \nand development spending, with substantial growth in nearly every part \nof the Department. Few Federal agencies over the last 4 years can make \nthe same claim.\n  Secretary Pena also reorganized and improved the coordination of the \nDepartment of Transportation research and development programs, \nestablishing joint program offices cutting across internal departmental \nboundaries. I am looking forward to Secretary Pena's strong leadership \nin this area in the future.\n  A final challenge facing Secretary-designate Pena will be to carry \nout the Department's missions in an environmentally responsible manner. \nThe Department of Energy lost public trust and credibility in some \nprevious years by pursuing its programs without sufficient regard to \nhuman and environmental consequences and to the need for public \nparticipation in decisionmaking. Recovering that public trust has been \na slow and difficult process. It is essential to maintain momentum in \nthis direction if the Department is to regain that public trust. \nSecretary Pena has a track record here that augers well.\n  At the same time that he accelerated progress at the Department of \nTransportation on the construction of new highways and transportation \nprojects, he also increased the speed of the Department of \nTransportation's response to natural disasters and he brought new \nemphasis to environmental considerations in transportation management \nplanning.\n  Mr. President, the Senate's action on this nomination is long \noverdue. It should have occurred a month ago. The committee's delay in \nbringing the nomination to the floor, as the chairman of the committee \nhas said, had nothing to do with Secretary Pena's integrity or \nqualifications for the job. The delay resulted from Senators trying to \nhold his nomination hostage to attempt to persuade the President to \nchange his position on nuclear waste legislation.\n  The President has stated serious and well-founded concerns about the \nnuclear waste bill which is being marked up in the Energy Committee \ntoday and the effect that bill would have on the long-term solution to \nthe nuclear waste problem. I share many of those concerns, as do other \nSenators. To his credit, the President has not been bullied into \nchanging his mind on the substance of that bill, but he has agreed that \nSecretary Pena, once confirmed, can work with those of us in Congress \nto try to find a solution to this very difficult and complex problem.\n  Ironically, we are going forward today in the Energy Committee to \nmark up the nuclear waste bill. This is at a time, of course, before \nSecretary Pena will be sworn into office and before he will have had a \nchance to work with us to resolve some of the differences which have \narisen with regard to this legislation.\n  I believe Secretary Pena will be a great Secretary of Energy. I hope \nwe will confirm him today. I am looking forward to working with him on \nall the important issues--national security, energy policy, \nenvironmental protection and technological competitiveness, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support his nomination.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Mr. Pena has an impressive set of \nchallenges ahead of him. From our meetings as well as his committee \nhearing, I'm confident that he understands the responsibilities of this \nnew assignment and that he is willing to make key changes in the \nDepartment to enable future success.\n  Mr. Pena listed the key priorities for the Department, including the \nneed to ensure a safe and reliable nuclear weapons stockpile while \nreducing the global nuclear danger. He spoke to the importance of \ncleanup of former nuclear weapons sites and to finding a timely path \nfor disposing of nuclear waste. He emphasized the importance of using \nand leveraging science and technology throughout the Department. Those \nare appropriate priorities.\n  Responsibility for the Nation's nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons \ntechnologies was rightly prominent on\n\n[[Page S2162]]\n\nhis list. Perhaps no other challenge requires as much of his personal \nattention. The safety and security of the Nation's nuclear arsenal must \nbe assured. The Nation will place this responsibility squarely on his \nshoulders.\n  We talked about the importance of avoiding over dependence on his \nstaff and about moving forward with some key recommendations of the \nGalvin Commission to minimize micromanagement by the Department.\n  He assured me that the nuclear weapons program will receive annual \nbudget support above $4 billion for the foreseeable future. Below that \nlevel I doubt we can maintain the stockpile at the level of confidence, \nsafety, and security that the nuclear weapon responsibilities demand. \nHe assured me that the Department will continue to fully meet the \nrequirements of the Department of Defense, including weapons production \ncapabilities and a reliable tritium supply, and that the Science Based \nStockpile Stewardship Program will remain a cornerstone of the nuclear \nweapons programs.\n  He assured me that the Department will continue to pursue strong \nnonproliferation programs with the former Soviet Union, and seek \nopportunities for the Department to increase its contributions.\n  He assured me that the Department will move forward with stronger \ncoordination of policy and budgets, and that an independent review of \nthe Department's overdependence on the NEPA process will be \nforthcoming. He assured me that he will explore rapid movement away \nfrom the Department's self-regulation toward outside regulation. And he \nassured me that the Department will support not only opening of WIPP \nthis November, but also release of funds to construct the WIPP bypass \nsystem in New Mexico.\n  Based on these assurances of appropriate support for the Department's \nprograms of critical national and global importance, as well as those \nprograms that directly impact on the State of New Mexico, I look \nforward to working with Secretary of Energy Pena on these challenges \nover the next 4 years.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the pending nomination \nof Mr. Federico Pena, who has been nominated to serve as Secretary of \nEnergy.\n  The Armed Services Committee held a hearing on Mr. Pena's nomination \nlast February to assess his views and positions on the Department of \nEnergy's programs that fall within the jurisdiction of the Armed \nServices Committee. We felt this hearing was necessary because Mr. Pena \nhas no background in national security matters and, until very recently \nhad no identifiable position on defense issues that Senators could use \nto assess his suitability to manage the Department's diverse national \nsecurity activities.\n  I, and other members of the Armed Services Committee, continue to \nhave some concern about the Department's plans to certify the safety \nand reliability of nuclear warheads, restore tritium production in a \ntimely manner, and maintain the capabilities of the Department's \nproduction plants. We also want to see more progress in environmental \ncleanup at DOE's former defense facilities. These are critical issues \nthat the Secretary of Energy will have to address. I must say that we \nhave not reached complete agreement with Mr. Pena on all of these \nissues. I intend to work very closely with Mr. Pena to resolve our \ndifferences once he is confirmed and I am hopeful that we can make \nprogress on these difficult issues.\n  Another area of concern that Mr. Pena will be required to address is \nhow to move forward with a permanent repository for the Nation's \ngrowing stockpile of spent nuclear fuel. Mr. Pena must avoid playing \npolitics with this issue. He should engage the Congress and work \ncooperatively to develop a credible solution to this mounting problem. \nI am hopeful that he will do so.\n  There is an inconsistency in the Department's actions with regard to \nspent fuel. The Department has refused to accept U.S. commercial spent \nnuclear fuel, even after collecting billions of dollars from U.S. rate \npayers and being ordered to do so by the courts. However, the \nDepartment has paid to ship foreign research reactor fuel back to the \nUnited States--to the Savannah River Site in South Carolina--where it \nwill likely be stored indefinitely at U.S. taxpayers' expense. Mr. \nPresident, this is an outrage. If the Department of Energy can pay to \nship spent fuel from First World countries such as Germany and Sweden, \nwhy can't they find a way to accept spent nuclear fuel from Minnesota \nand California. There is no reason President Clinton should not support \nthe legislation pending in the Senate to fix this problem. I strongly \nencourage the President to allow Mr. Pena to work with the Congress to \nmove forward with a solution to this problem before more taxpayer's \ndollars are wasted.\n  Mr. President, despite my remaining concerns, Mr. Pena impresses me \nas a highly capable manager and I intend to vote favorably on his \nnomination today. I also want to offer to sit down with Mr. Pena in the \ncoming months to jointly address the issues I have raised. My hope is \nthat he will accept this offer and that we will be able solve these \nproblems for the benefit of the American people.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the recent \ndecision of the Justice Department regarding a qui tam lawsuit filed \nunder the false claims act against Energy Secretary-designate Federico \nPena. Now, as a Senator I will not comment on the merits of an on-going \ncourt case. However, I do believe that it is appropriate to comment on \nwhat may be considered an unusual circumstance.\n  As many of my colleagues may know, when someone files a qui tam \nlawsuit, the Department of Justice has to make a decision as to whether \nto intervene in the case or to decline to intervene in the case. Now, \nthis time period is generally from 6 months to 1 year because qui tam \nlawsuits can be so complex.\n  With regard to the Pena case, the Justice Department has had the \nlawsuit for about 1 month and they have already made a decision--to ask \nthe court to dismiss Secretary Pena from the lawsuit. Now, I realize \nthat Secretary Pena is a cabinet nominee and a former Cabinet Member \nand this case might warrant expedited consideration. But this seems \nlike a rush to judgment. It seems unwise and it raises questions in my \nmind as to whether the Justice Department's decision in this case is \ndue more to political pressure than to a genuine desire to protect \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  There are several troubling questions which remain regarding the role \nof the Department of Transportation, Secretary Pena and other top \nTransportation Department officials in seeking the reinstatement of a \nGovernment contract with the D.M.E. Corp. which the Coast Guard had \nterminated in March 1994. According to documents supplied to me by the \nCoast Guard, the D.M.E. Corp. was simply unable to satisfy the \ncontract. Also, according to a memo prepared by the legal adviser to \nthe Coast Guard, a financial audit revealed such serious irregularities \nthat the FBI recommended that D.M.E. be prosecuted for fraud. Did \nDepartment of Transportation officials know of the FBI's recommendation \nwhen they pressured the Coast Guard to sign a memorandum of \nunderstanding committing the Coast Guard to reinstate the D.M.E. \ncontract?\n  As it happens, Ms. Lus Hopewell, who was Mr. Pena's top aid for the \naffirmative action programs for the Transportation Department had been \nthe executive director of the Latin American Management Association \nimmediately prior to working for the Transportation Department. Mr. \nLuis Mola who was the president of D.M.E.--the company whose contract \nwas terminated--sat on the board of directors for the Latin American \nManagement Association. Should Ms. Hopewell have recused herself? Did \nshe disclose to her superiors that she had in effect worked for Mola \nonly months before at her previous job as she was working to get D.M.E. \nreinstated?\n  So far, as I understand it, Secretary Pena's defense has been that \nCoast Guard officials somehow got the mistaken impression that he had \nmet with D.M.E. officials and was involved in reinstating the contract. \nSo, in essence the revealing documents which I have received, which \nwere created contemporaneously and by people with no apparent motive to \nlie, are mistaken. This explanation is almost identical to a an \nexplanation supplied by Secretary\n\n[[Page S2163]]\n\nPena when he was the mayor of Denver. According to a March 26, 1995 \narticle in the Denver Post newspaper, Alvarado Construction Co. \nreceived a $13 million contract to build an administration at the new \nDenver airport. Alvarado got the bid, however, even though its first \nbid was disqualified. In order to ensure that Alvarado got the bid, \nsomeone voided the first round of bidding for the contract and set up a \nnew round of bidding. Alvarado got the contract on the second round. \nAccording to George Doughty, who was the Aviation Director at the time, \nPena made the ultimate decision to void the first round of bidding. \nSecretary Pena said he wasn't involved and he didn't even know that \nAlvarado had received the bid. Finally, Alvarado was a strong financial \nbacker of Secretary Pena when he was the mayor of Denver as well as a \nmember of the Latin American Management Association. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, Mar. 26, 1995]\n\n                     Mr. Pena and a Pair of Probes\n\n                            (By Gil Spencer)\n\n       At the top of the Sunday, March 12, front page was this \n     Denver Post headline: ``Probe Zeros in on Pena.''\n       At the top of the Friday front page just six days later, \n     was this Denver Post headline: ``Pena Inquiry Dropped.''\n       With Commerce Secretary Ron Brown under investigation, with \n     former Agricultural Secretary Mike Espy under investigation, \n     with Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros under investigation, \n     and with the president himself under investigation for \n     financial dealings while he was governor of Arkansas, it is \n     worth more than a mere mention that Transportation Secretary \n     Federico Pena has been cleared by Attorney General Janet \n     Reno, who is not under investigation.\n       I last talked to Federico Pena almost exactly three years \n     ago. The topic was his integrity, which, if pushed, he might \n     liken to a cross between the Hope Diamond and the Holy Grail. \n     He thinks very highly of his integrity, and not very highly \n     of anyone who might question it, which he said The Denver \n     Post did.\n       Keeping Mr. Pena's opinion of his integrity in mind, \n     imagine his reaction when some blabber-mouths in Los Angeles \n     started making noises about Pena's former investment firm, \n     which he founded after he left the mayor's office and which \n     he sold in 1992, still bearing his name. The firm, Pena \n     Investment Advisors, was awarded a rather succulent contract \n     to manage a $5 million Los Angeles transit pension fund.\n       Pena Investment Advisors got the transit contract less than \n     three weeks after its namesake became transportation \n     secretary. The timing of the contract award and the \n     investment firm's pedigree intrigued certain parties in Los \n     Angeles and inspired an intriguing comment by the manager of \n     the transit pension fund, one Melvin Marquardt.\n       Marquardt, a candid soul, was quoted as saying the \n     investment firm would not have been retained if President \n     Clinton hadn't made Pena secretary of transportation.\n       Enter Janet Reno. Investigation opens. Investigation \n     closes. Federico and his integrity ride on.\n       That seems about right. There may possibly have been a \n     case. If so, it was hardly visible to the naked eye. In the \n     other words, the only thing on the table was timing: Pena \n     gets a big job and his old firm gets a big contract. If the \n     firm had been a hopeless loser, Ms. Reno's alarm would have \n     gone off. It would have had to. As it was, the firm seemed \n     qualified and, of course, richer. Life in big-time politics.\n       Incidentially, in dismissing the contract allegation, Janet \n     Reno also closed down a Justice Department investigation into \n     whether the city--both Pena and Webb--was illegally diverting \n     revenue from Stapleton and using it for non-airport services.\n       Pena's own department is continuing to investigate that \n     charge, for what it may or may not be worth. And because I \n     know you're absolutely on the edge of your chair, we'll keep \n     you advised.\n       So Federico Pena is in the clear and has issued a statement \n     that he is pleased but not surprised, adding that his focus \n     has been and remains on serving the president and the \n     American people.\n       In that spirit, he might turn back the calendar to May \n     1991. He was mayor Denver and the Alvarado Construction Co. \n     had been awarded a $13 million contract to build the \n     administration building at the new airport. That contract \n     drew political fire 10 months later, when it was learned that \n     Alvarado's first-round low bid had been defective and thus \n     was disqualified.\n       Standard procedure would have had the contract awarded to \n     the second low bidder, which in this case appeared fully \n     qualified. Didn't happen. The city rejected all bids, saying \n     it did so in the city's best interest, and Alvarado wound up \n     with the contract.\n       Alvarado got the contract on the second bounce. Mayor Pena \n     said he didn't even know Alvarado had the contract. Aviation \n     Director George Doughty said it was Pena's ultimate decision. \n     Pena said somebody must have had the impression that he made \n     a decision he didn't make.\n       There's a fat lie in there somewhere.\n       Pena said he didn't know Alvarado had a $13 million city \n     contract? Pena's world was alive with Alvarados--enjoying his \n     support before the city council, contributing to his '87 \n     campaign and his post-mayorial investment firm (Linda \n     Alvarado became a director of that firm in 1993). He didn't \n     know?\n       It's been three years since Pena damned The Denver Post for \n     questioning his integrity in connection with the Alvarado \n     contract--three years since the issue was buried whole. This \n     isn't the first time I have written about the issue and it \n     isn't the second. There may be a fourth. That contract has a \n     certain fragrance. Then there was the lying. But maybe we're \n     got it all wrong. Care to straighten us out, Mr. Secretary?\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would also like to point out that \nD.M.E. has received approximately $30 million in contracts with the \nTransportation Department. Roughly one-half of those contracts were \nentered into after the Coast Guard audit detected financial \nirregularities. Did the questionable practices of D.M.E. at least cause \nconcern within the Transportation Department?\n  Now these concerns shouldn't necessarily prevent Secretary Pena's \nnomination from going forward at this time, but there are serious \nquestions about public integrity which require serious answers--not \npolitically expedient ones.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased that we have finally arrived \nat this point in the process to confirm Federico Pena as the new \nSecretary of Energy. In my view, it has already taken too long to bring \nthis nomination to the floor of the Senate and I hope and expect that \nhe will be confirmed overwhelmingly today.\n  The delays in bringing this nomination to the floor have had nothing \nto do with Secretary Pena's qualifications for the job. His reputation \nand integrity are unblemished. Through his long and distinguished \ncareer in public service, Secretary Pena has established an outstanding \nreputation as a creative and able administrator, including his work as \nmayor of Denver, CO, and more recently as Secretary of Transportation.\n  The questions that have been raised about his fitness for this job \nhave all been answered through extensive questioning before the Senate \nEnergy and Armed Services Committees. No one can argue credibly that \nSecretary Pena does not have the experience or leadership to head the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  The delay in bringing this nomination to the floor has resulted from \nefforts to force the administration into accepting an ill-conceived \nplan to establish an interim nuclear waste depository in Nevada. This \neffort to link this confirmation to changes in administration policy \nhas been unfair to the administration and to Secretary Pena, who has \npledged to work with Congress to try and find a solution to this \ncomplex and daunting problem in a manner that is acceptable to all \ninvolved.\n  The Energy Department needs a Secretary now to address the range of \nissues and challenges that lie before it, including nuclear waste \ndisposal, electric utility deregulation, hazardous materials cleanup, \nand the broad questions about our Nation's future energy supply. \nFederico Pena will be an excellent Secretary of Energy and I fully \nexpect that he will guide that Department through these many challenges \nin a decisive and competent manner.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the nomination of \nFederico Pena to be Secretary of Energy and to work cooperatively with \nhim in the future to address responsibly the challenges that face our \ngreat Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been asked to chair the \nsubcommittee of the Judiciary Committee on juvenile violence. It is an \nissue and a problem that I have dealt with for many years. I have been \na Federal and State prosecutor for 17 years. I know juvenile judges, I \nknow sheriffs, I know police chiefs, I know juvenile probation officers \nand those who work with them. I have been involved in organizations \nthat have dealt with youth crime for many, many years. I think it is a \nrare opportunity to have the possibility of contributing to an issue as \nimportant as this one.\n  I am particularly pleased that we have a bipartisan interest in real \nreform of juvenile justice in America. Not long ago, the Republican \nconference of this body listed juvenile violence as one of its top 10 \npriorities. The President has made it so in his remarks and in his \nrecent address to the Nation. Just a few weeks ago, the majority \nleader, Trent Lott, met with the President, and they agreed to work to \npass a good and effective juvenile reform bill. Senator Lott had the \noccasion to talk with me about that, and his instructions to me were: \n``Jeff, we want the best crime bill that we can get, something that \nwill effectively reduce juvenile violence in America.''\n  Mr. President, let me discuss with you what our problems are. \nUnderstanding the situation we are in is important. The incidence of \nadult crime in America, since the early 1980's, has essentially been \nflat. During that time, we have doubled, tripled, and in some areas of \nthe country, quadrupled the prison capacity for adult offenders in \nAmerica. Many States have quadrupled their capacity. We have \neffectively targeted these repeat and dangerous offenders. Those \noffenders are not now out on the street, committing additional crimes, \nand we have, at great cost and at great pain, and I regret to say great \nloss of productivity, incarcerated people who needed to be \nincarcerated. But we have maintained more safety on our streets than \nwould have been the case.\n  During this same period of time we have observed that juvenile \nviolence has increased rapidly. We have not dealt with that in any \neffective way. Since 1982, violent crime committed by juveniles in \nAmerica has doubled. Murder rates have increased 128 percent since \n1982. This violent crime rate has been projected by the Department of \nJustice to double again by the year 2010. Indeed, by the year 2000 we \nwill have 500,000 more crime-prone males, age 14 to 17. Many experts \npredict that these numbers alone will drive the juvenile violence rate \neven higher.\n  I think we must systematically and deliberately confront this \nproblem, find real solutions to it, and deal with what I consider to be \nthe real problem, which is a juvenile justice system that is simply not \nworking. Those who have seen it, who have worked in it, who have been a \npart of it, know that. We care about it. We want to improve it. But we \nhave to be honest: It is simply not working.\n  Let me tell you what is happening in America today. Recently, in \nMontgomery, AL, a night watchman was killed. I had one of my staff \ncheck to see about the three juveniles who had been arrested for that \noffense. One had 8 prior arrests, another had 8 prior arrests, and the \nthird had 15 prior arrests. That is the kind of thing that is happening \nall over America. We do not effectively deal with juvenile violence and \nserious juvenile crime. We act as if it is the same kind of crime that \nexisted 30 or 40 years ago when juvenile crime primarily involved \nvandalism or petty theft.\n\n  Can we do anything about it? Can we, as a nation, effectively deal \nwith these instances of ever increasing violence by young offenders, \nand make the system work better? As somebody who has been in it, I \nbelieve sincerely that we can. It strikes me that we have a system \nwhich is so badly constituted that we have great opportunities to make \nit more productive and work better.\n  Mr. President, let me give you an outline of some of the proposals \nthat will be in our bill and I think will be supported by the \nDepartment of Justice and the President. Senator Joseph Biden, the \nranking Democratic member on our subcommittee, and others should be in \ngeneral agreement with the proposals I am going to make. I certainly \nhope they will be.\n  First, we do have to make the Federal system work better. It is as a \npractical matter impossible at this time to effectively prosecute a \njuvenile offense in Federal court. The prosecutor must certify that the \noffender cannot be prosecuted in State court. Then the prosecutor must \ncertify the offender as an adult. Then the offender has a right, at \nthat point, to appeal the certification, to the U.S. Circuit Court of \nAppeals, which delays the trial as much as a year while the public \nwaits on the results of that appeal. That is not necessary.\n  We believe that our bill, with the support of the President, and the \nDepartment of Justice, can eliminate those problems and allow the \nFederal prosecutors to effectively be engaged in prosecuting \nappropriate violent juvenile cases. But we have to be honest with \nourselves: 99.9 percent of juvenile crime cases--99.99 percent--are \nbeing tried in State court. Overwhelmingly, those cases ought to \ncontinue to be in State court. We do not need to have the Federal \nbureaucracy, here in Washington, DC, taking over the prosecution of \njuvenile crime in the States.\n  What we need to do in this Nation, and what this Senate needs to do, \nand what our Federal Government needs to do, is develop ways to assist \nthe juvenile systems throughout America to be more productive in \nprosecuting cases within their own counties, cities and localities. \nThis is the most important thing. First, we need to fix the Federal \nsystem, but we do not need to ever think for one moment that that is \ngoing to be a serious detriment to the overall growth and threat of \nviolence in our young offenders.\n  How do we improve the States' systems? We have to deal with it \nsystemically, addressing the day-to-day things that are happening \nthere. I would like to share with you some proposals that will be \nincluded in our bill, and share with you some of the problems that we \nface. First, let me tell you what is happening today all over this \ncountry, when young offenders are arrested.\n  Let us take this example. A young offender in a stolen car is \narrested at 2 a.m. by a local deputy sheriff, caught flat-footed. What \ntypically happens is, if there is not a juvenile facility nearby--and \nnormally there are only a few approved juvenile facilities within the \nState--that offender cannot be kept overnight in a separate part of a \nlocal or city jail. Those offenders cannot be kept at the local jail \nbecause Federal mandates say they cannot be housed in any institution \nin which adults are housed. They cannot even be in an institution that \nshares the same dining facility. So they either have to be released \nthat night, or they have to be taken to a juvenile facility that may be \nin a distant locality and may be at full capacity. So, routinely what \nhappens is that young offender, caught flat-footed in a stolen \nautomobile, is released that night to his parents. He is back on the \nstreet that night.\n  It is not just bad for him, that he receives a horrible message, but \nit is also bad for his younger brothers, perhaps, or his running \nbuddies, his would-be criminal associates, because they know Billy got \ncaught. They know the police caught him in a stolen car. They see him \nback on the street that very night or the next morning. They see him \nlaughing about it. They do not respect the system, and that procedure \nundermines the moral authority of the police and the legal system in \nAmerica. It encourages crime and it does not deter crime, and we have \nto deal with that fundamental problem. We can do so, and I have some \nideas I would like to share with you.\n\n  As a matter of fact, as I traveled the State of Alabama as attorney \ngeneral, talking to local police, that is the single most frustrating \nsituation for local police officers throughout Alabama, and I think the \nNation, in juvenile crime, because these officers say to me over and \nover, ``Jeff, they are laughing at us. They don't think we can do \nanything to them, and we can't.'' This creates crime by sending a clear \nmessage to all involved that these young offenders are getting away \nwith their crimes.\n\n[[Page S2165]]\n\n  How do we deal with that? We need to end these irrational Federal \nmandates that require total separation. We do not need to have young \noffenders in the same cell with hardened criminals. Nobody proposes \nthat. But on separate floors, in separate wings, separate parts of \njails can be carved out where young offenders can be kept, at least for \nshort periods of time, totally apart from adult offenders. That can and \nshould be done, and it is the only sane and logical thing to do. I \nbelieve there is a growing consensus in America to do that, and our \nbill will do that. I think we can have bipartisan support to end these \nregulations. This will free up, at little or no cost, significant \namounts of bed space for juvenile offenders.\n\n  In addition, we need to put some money into juvenile facilities. \nAdult facilities, as I have said, have doubled and tripled and \nquadrupled in America, but facilities for young offenders have not \nincreased. In fact, in some States, their jail space for juveniles has \ndecreased. Florida, after decreasing juvenile jails for a number of \nyears, has now recognized the need to increase their available space. \nOur bill will provide financial support to State and local governments \nwho need to undertake to expand their existing facilities, such as by \nputting on a separate wing for juvenile offenders. That way, at a \nreasonable cost, we can add jail capacity.\n  A sheriff in Alabama told me just a few weeks ago that he was \narresting and incarcerating people under a new Alabama law that our \nAttorney General's office helped get passed, but he did not realize he \nwas also in violation of Federal mandates and he was called on the \ncarpet by Federal officials who forced him to stop. His policy was to \nhold young offenders for several days when the charges were serious, \ntaking them promptly to court, and having prompt hearings. As a result \nof that tough approach, his juvenile crime rate dropped significantly. \nHe was just furious that he could no longer carry out that policy, \nbecause he was absolutely convinced that if he was given the capacity \nto identify the serious offenders, take them to court, and detain them, \nthen he could make progress in reducing crime. That is what we want. We \nwant to deter criminal conduct. We want to have a system that does, in \nfact, cause juveniles to think about the consequences of their actions \nbefore they are tempted to commit a crime. I am convinced that our plan \nwill do that.\n  Some of these matters I will be talking about on the floor in the \nfuture in more detail, but I want to mention several other parts of \nthis program that I think will have bipartisan support and which will \nbe effective in thousands of everyday criminal cases in juvenile court, \nso that we can deter these young offenders from going further along. We \nneed to make that first brush with the law their last.\n  Drug testing. I have always thought it was virtually irrational or \ninsane for us to arrest offenders, when we know statistically as high \nas 60 and 70 percent of serious offenders test positive for an illegal \nsubstance in their body at the time of their arrest, and not drug test \nthem to determine whether or not they have a drug problem. They will \nsay they do not. Routinely, they will deny it, but through regular drug \ntesting, we can identify those young offenders who are using drugs. We \ncan identify those who can, through their own willpower and the \ndiscipline of the court get off drugs, and those who are seriously \naddicted and need treatment. We can involve their families, if they \nhave families, in that process. We can give the judge the kind of \ninformation he needs to know. When he is crafting an appropriate \nsentence, he needs to know whether or not this person standing before \nhim, the one he is about to sentence, has a serious drug problem, and \nthe sure way to do that is drug testing. It is relatively inexpensive.\n  So we will be proposing legislation that will provide money for State \nand local juvenile courts to test young offenders. If they test \npositive, they can put them on a very intensive drug-testing program, \nand if they continue to flunk, they will either go to jail or some \nserious treatment facility. We need to stay on them. We do not do them \na favor to act as if their drug problem does not exist and allow them \nto continue life as usual. We need to work on that very hard.\n  Another matter that is extremely important is recordkeeping. For \nyears, we have had in the National Crime Information Center the \ncapacity to put every adult person's criminal history in our national \ncomputer system, so when they are arrested, a law officer can call up \nthe National Crime Information Center from any police department in \nAmerica, and, indeed, many police officers have today in their vehicles \nthe capacity to tap into that system to find out if the person they \njust stopped out on the highway is a fugitive from justice for a \nserious offense. It is one of the most worthwhile, productive criminal \njustice innovations this Nation has ever implemented. It is not being \ndone for juveniles.\n\n  The greatest predictor of adult violence is a history of violence and \ncrime as a youngster. We know that. That makes common sense. Yet, with \nregard to the young people who are being arrested, because of the \nsecrecy laws around the country and an aversion for putting these \nrecords in the NCIC, the judges may not know about a history of \nviolence and crime. They may know it if the offender committed a crime \nin their local community, but they will not know it if they committed \nit in another community.\n  Additionally, in the case of a 24-year-old, for example, who the \njudge is about to sentence, that judge would need to know, in crafting \nan appropriate sentence, whether that offender standing before him had \ncommitted two armed robberies as a juvenile in a distant city. We have \nmade a serious mistake over the years in not putting those records in \nthe National Crime Information Center, and our bill will end that \npolicy. I think it is something long overdue.\n  I think it is appropriate for the Federal Government to provide \ntraining for State and local officials. It would be good to provide a \nnational center, that no one State could afford to put together, to \ntrain probation officers who will be working with young offenders, to \ntrain sheriff deputies and police officers who will be working with \nyoung offenders, to train prosecutors who will be working with young \noffenders and, yes, provide the latest and finest training for juvenile \njudges so that they can be effective. I would love to see us establish \ntraining centers and scholarship programs so that virtually every young \nprosecutor, every new probation officer for juvenile offenders could \nhave 1 week or 2 or 3 weeks in intensive training on what it means to \nhave their job and how to best conduct themselves in it.\n  We also need, and it is appropriate for the Federal Government who \nhas all 50 States under its jurisdiction, to provide a research center \nto study what programs work and what programs don't work, to give \nauthoritative data to local officials as they struggle to decide what \nto do about juvenile violence in their community.\n  I sense, as I travel Alabama--and I know this is true nationally--\nthat people in local communities are very concerned about juvenile \ncrime, and they want to develop programs to do something. They are \nwilling to invest money in that. They are just not certain what to do.\n  For example, a number of years ago, Congress developed a boot camp \nprogram in America. We had one of those in my hometown of Mobile. I was \ninvolved in helping to get it established. We had great expectations \nfor it. The U.S. Department of Justice did an intensive study of the \nboot camps around and the studies produced, unfortunately, mixed \nresults. The studies concluded that whereas many young offenders appear \nto be quite changed when they finish their short-term incarceration and \nintensive military-like discipline and really seem to be better, once \nthey were released and went back into the community from which they \ncame, they developed the same friends and same associates and the \nrecidivist rates, the rearrest rates, did not change very much.\n  So since then, boot camps, because of that study and others, have \nadopted an aftercare program where the graduates have to come back to \nthe training center with their parents or parent and go through a \ncounseling and intense monitoring program. This has helped expand the \nproductivity of the boot camp system and has helped keep more of these \npeople from going back into a life of crime.\n\n[[Page S2166]]\n\n  That is the kind of thing that is difficult for a State to do on its \nown. It is appropriate for the Federal Government to do that. That is \nnot a Federal takeover of juvenile justice, but a Federal helping hand \nto give States the information that they need.\n  So, Mr. President, I would just say that we are dealing with an issue \nof great national importance. I cannot tell you how delighted I am that \nthe President, that the Department of Justice, that the Democratic \nleadership of this body and the Republican leadership of this body are \nunited in being committed to developing a workable plan that will \nactually and realistically improve our ability to deal with this \njuvenile crime problem, because if we don't, it will get worse. And I \nam excited about our prospects.\n\n  This proposal that I have outlined for you today will provide more \njail space so that when young offenders violate their probation, so \nthat when they commit crimes, they can be immediately incarcerated and \ndisciplined by their judge. If the judge has no capacity to do that, \nthen that judge is losing control of his courtroom; and the police \nofficers who went out and made the arrest, their moral authority is \nundermined.\n  We need drug testing to find out which ones of these young people are \naddicted to dangerous drugs which may be the accelerant to their \ncriminal activity.\n  We need better recordkeeping to identify serious dangerous offenders \nthroughout this Nation as they move throughout this Nation.\n  We need a training center to train local and State law enforcement.\n  And we need a research center to identify the greatest and best ways \nto fight juvenile crime so that we can assist Federal and State \nactivity in improving that effort.\n  Mr. President, I am excited about the potential for doing something \ngood for America, for making our streets safer. I must point out that \nin some areas of this country almost the leading, if not the leading, \ncause of death of young people is murder. That is a horrible thing to \nsay, because it is not just the young people who are committing crimes, \nthey are also the victims of young criminals. It is something we have \nto put an end to if we care about our country.\n  It is a core function of government that we make our streets safe. \nThis bill will help take us a long way toward that goal.

Mr. President, we wanted to come to the floor today \nbecause we have watched for a number of weeks a discussion on the floor \nof the Senate about changing the United States Constitution to require \na balanced budget. In fact, for a good many weeks we had a stack almost \n5-foot tall of books. Apparently they represented budget books and \nbudgets that were submitted by Presidents to Congress and described \nvarious budget deficits over many years. And that 5-foot stack of books \nresided on the desk over there for I think 3 or 4 weeks in the Chamber. \nThe discussion was: ``Let us change the Constitution to require a \nbalanced budget.'' We had that vote. Those books are now gone. Now, of \ncourse, comes the real work. Altering the Constitution of the United \nStates is one thing. Balancing the budget by writing a yearly budget, \nwhich the Congress is required to do following the submission of a \nbudget by the President, is quite another thing. I made the point \nduring the debate on the constitutional amendment to balance the budget \nthat we could alter the Constitution at 12 o'clock noon that requires a \nbalanced budget and at 12:01 there would be no difference in either \nFederal debt or Federal deficit. Why? Because that is required to be \ndone in the individual yearly choices of taxing and spending decisions \nhere in the Congress.\n  I do not see anybody out here on the floor on the other side with \nnearly as much energy on the proposition of writing a budget that will \nreally balance the budget. In fact, no one is here now, and there \nhasn't been for some long while anyone here to address the question of \nwill there be a budget brought to the floor of the Senate? The deadline \nfor the Budget Committee to act on a budget is April 1. That is not \nvery many days away. The deadline for the adoption of a budget \nresolution by the Congress is April 15, about a month away. That leaves \nonly 7 working days here in the Senate between now and the deadline by \nwhich the Budget Committee shall have acted to comply with its \nresponsibilities. And it is only 14 working days in the Congress to \nactually pass a conference report on the floor of the Senate and the \nHouse to comply with the requirements of the budget act. But, contrary \nto 5 feet of documents when we discussed altering the Constitution, you \ncan't find a single page scavenging anywhere in this Chamber. Not in \nthe darkest recesses of the deepest drawer in these Senate desks will \nyou find a page that explains what the plan is for actually balancing \nthe budget--not altering the Constitution; the plan for actually \nbalancing the budget.\n  We say we are ready. We want a plan to balance the budget. The \nPresident has submitted a plan. Now let's see the alternatives, and \ntalk about them and describe the choices and what are the priorities.\n  Why do we not see a plan? And why do we see so little energy on this \nissue of actually dealing with the budget on the floor of the Senate?\n  I want to hold up a chart that describes why I think we are in this \nsituation. The Joint Tax Committee disclosed to us that in the first 5 \nyears of the coming budget the cost of the proposed tax cuts by the \nRepublicans here in Congress will mean $200 billion in lost revenue but \nthat in the first 10 years the lost revenue will be $525 billion. In \nother words, you lose a couple hundred billion dollars in the first 5 \nyears, and then much, much more than that in the second 5 years; in 10 \nyears, nearly half a trillion dollars.\n  What does that mean? It means, if you have that much less revenue--\nand, incidentally, most all of this tax cut\n\n[[Page S2167]]\n\nwill be borrowed and will be added to the Federal debt--every dollar of \ntax cut proposed before the budget is balanced is going to be borrowed. \nBut the point is when you are proposing very deep cuts in your revenue, \nthen what happens? You have to make deeper and deeper and deeper cuts \nin some of the programs that people rely on. Then you have to answer \nthe question that people in this Chamber ask and people around the \ncountry ask. What does this mean in terms of the programs that affect \nme, such as the Medicare Program? What does it mean in terms of the \ninvestments in education? What does it mean in terms of building and \nrepairing highways and roads? What does it mean in terms of funding of \nthe National Institutes of Health?\n  Those are the questions that you have to ask in order to construct a \nbudget that will balance the budget, and those are the questions that \nare not being asked. I guess the reason is there are not answers.\n  So we come to the floor of the Senate today to say we are 7 working \ndays in the Senate away from the requirement in law that the Budget \nCommittee act on a budget resolution. It appears no such action will \ntake place. The majority leader on the other side of this Capitol said \nthey may act on some kind of a plan in May. He was unclear about that. \nThat is not what the law requires. The law doesn't require anything \nother than that on April 1 a budget resolution be adopted by the Budget \nCommittees and by April 15 adopted by the Congress.\n\n  As I said previously, it is easy enough to come to the floor of the \nSenate and breeze on about altering the Constitution of the United \nStates, apparently allowing some people to believe that, if you can \nalter the Constitution, you would have balanced the budget. Of course, \nnothing could be further from the truth. Altering the Constitution will \nnot alter the deficit by 1 cent. That will be done by making individual \ntough choices in taxing and spending decisions. Why are those choices \nnot now being made? Why does there appear that there is no preparation \non the part of those who anguished so hard to change the Constitution? \nWhy does there seem to be no preparation on their part to anguish as \nhard and toil as long to create a budget that will actually balance the \nbudget? Because I think that they have with their cans and brushes \npainted themselves into a corner promising tax cuts to the tune of $200 \nbillion in 5 years, and $500 billion in 10 years; tax cuts undoubtedly \nthat are popular but tax cuts that they know will require them to make \nenormously deep cuts in a wide range of programs that are very \nimportant in this country.\n  I believe they simply don't want to describe what those cuts will be \nand which programs those cuts will come from.\n  Mr. President, I would be happy to yield such time as may be consumed \nto the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague for \nyielding, and I join him in this statement this morning.\n  For the last several weeks we have listened to the Republican leaders \nstanding next to stacks of budget books in full-throated pride for \nbalanced budgets, the key to America's economic future, the rallying \npoint for this Nation to come together to balance the budget.\n  Their call for a constitutional amendment did not pass. It failed by \none vote. I voted against it. And what I said then I will say now. The \njob before us is not to amend the Constitution but to balance the \nbudget. And the two are not the same. Amending the Constitution is no \nguarantee that we will have a balanced budget tomorrow or the next day. \nThe only guarantee that we can offer the American people is to our \nactions, actions in this Chamber and the House coming together with the \nPresident and reaching an agreement.\n  Many years ago, there was a Senator from Illinois whose name was \nEverett McKinley Dirksen. He served with my colleague from West \nVirginia. Senator Dirksen, in the early 1960's, made a momentous \ndecision and decided to support civil rights legislation for the first \ntime in his career. When Senator Dirksen was asked why, after years of \nresistance, he came to the point where he supported this legislation, \nhe said, ``There is nothing more pregnant than an idea whose time has \ncome.''\n  If the idea of a balanced budget has come, the obvious question is \nwhy the Republican leadership in control of the Senate and the House \nhas not met their responsibility under the law to put together a \nbudget, to bring it forward so the American people can see what their \npriorities are. Why in the name of all that is holy would they hold \nback from this responsibility?\n  I can tell you why. It is fairly clear. They have a serious problem. \nThe Republicans have overpromised. They have promised tax cuts that \ncreate serious problems in balancing the budget. These tax cuts that \nhave been promised by the Republicans this year are in excess of the \ntax cuts promised in the heralded Contract With America, which was \npresented for 2 years before Congress. Do you remember that scenario? \nAt that time, the Republicans came forward and said, in the Contract \nWith America, we are going to make the following tax cuts. And in order \nto pay for those tax cuts, we are going to cut programs.\n  When you took a close look at those tax cuts, you realized that they \nprimarily went to wealthy people. A lot of us on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle said, now, is that fair, to propose a package of tax cuts at \na time when we are trying to balance the budget, when the tax cuts go \nto the wealthiest people in America? Then we took a look as well and \nsaid, well, how will they pay for them?\n  The proposals coming from the Republican side suggested deep cuts in \nMedicare, in Medicaid, in environmental protection programs, and \ncollege student loan programs, to name but a few. The President said: I \nwill not buy it; it is not fair; we have to balance the budget, but we \ncannot do it at the expense of these critical programs like Medicare \nand college student loans and protection of the environment. So the \nPresident vetoed their bill.\n  They said, if that is what the President wants, we will close down \nthe Government, and they did--two separate occasions, the longest \nshutdowns in the history of U.S. Government occasioned because of the \ninability of Democrats and Republicans to reach an agreement on \nbalancing the budget.\n  After that experience came an election, and the American people, I \nthought, were given one of the clearest choices in our history--on one \nside, the Dole and Gingrich approach, and on the other side the \nClinton-Gore approach and that supported by many of us as Democrats.\n  I think those were two sharply contrasting views of the world, and I \nexpected the American electorate to speak in one voice and say, given \nthis fork in the road, this is the course we want to travel.\n  The American people made a decision in the election last November, \nand they decided they wanted both. They wanted to preserve the \nDemocratic leadership in the White House with the President, but they \nwanted to preserve Republican leadership in Congress.\n  Now this odd couple comes together, a Republican Congress and a \nDemocratic President, trying to divine exactly what is the message sent \nby the American people. I think the message is easy to divine, and here \nis what I think it is. Balance the budget. Be fiscally responsible. But \ndo it in a way that does not harm the most important programs to \nAmerican families.\n  I do not think that is an unreasonable request, and I think it \nreflects where most Americans stand when they look to our future. Now \nthe President has stepped forward and met his share of the burden. He \nhas produced a budget which comes to balance by 2002, a budget which \nmakes cuts and makes changes that he believes and I believe will reach \nbalance without cutting important programs, and the President adds a \nsafety valve. If he is wrong, if 5 or 6 years from now he has guessed \nwrong and we end up out of balance, the President has a trigger \nmechanism that comes in and makes an across-the-board cut to reach \nbalance. Even the Congressional Budget Office, which has not been \nfriendly to many Democratic proposals recently, has had to concede that \nis a way of balancing the budget. It is a trigger mechanism which will, \nin\n\n[[Page S2168]]\n\nfact, make certain that the budget comes to balance.\n  So the President put his proposal on the table, and if you follow \nrecent history, in the natural course of events it is now the turn of \nthe Republican leadership in Congress to come forward with their \nproposal. As was said by my friend from North Dakota, after viewing for \nweeks stacks of budget books that were viewed with derision by those \nwho supported a constitutional amendment, we cannot find a single sheaf \nof paper on the Republican side suggesting how they will reach a \nbalanced budget.\n\n  The reason? They have painted themselves in a corner. They find \nthemselves in an impossible position. They have overpromised on tax \ncuts for wealthy people, even more than in the Contract With America, \nand they cannot figure out how to pay for it and balance the budget. So \nthey have stepped back, removed themselves from the fray, and have \nbasically said to the President, give us another budget now. You gave \nus one. Let us see a second one.\n  I am sorry, but the legislation that we have passed involving the \nbudget and the history of these institutions suggests the President has \nmet his responsibility and now it is the responsibility of the \nRepublican leadership to come forward. They understand that if they are \ngoing to protect and preserve the tax cuts they have called for, it \nwill force even deeper cuts in Medicare, even deeper cuts in college \nstudent loans, even deeper cuts in environmental protection than they \nsuggested 2 years ago. They are in that corner and do not know the way \nout.\n  Let me suggest there is a way out. Reduce these tax cuts to those the \nPresident has targeted to help working families, make certain they are \ntax cuts we can afford, make certain as well that we preserve basic \nprograms like college student loans and environmental protection. Let \nus work together in a bipartisan fashion to chart a course for Medicare \nthat will bring it not only solvency but stability for years to come, \nand we can come up with this balanced budget. But it is time for the \nRepublican leadership to step forward and to meet their responsibility.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield to my colleague from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for yielding. I wanted to make some of \nthe same points. I see my colleague from California here as well.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about budgets, Mr. President. \nThere has been an additional request now that the President submit yet \nanother budget. Let me just suggest that I think the reception of the \nPresident's budget was, initially, encouraging. Our Republican \ncolleagues can be commended for not declaring it ``dead on arrival,'' \nas we have seen all too often in past budgets. But as has been pointed \nout, year in and year out there is a dual responsibility not only for \nthe executive branch to submit budgets, but also for those of us in the \ncoequal branch of Government, the legislative branch of Government, \nwhich has control over the purse strings, to respond. We must respond \nin a way that gives the American public an opportunity, one, to either \nendorse what the President has suggested or, two, to offer alternatives \nthat can be identified and seen so comparisons can be made.\n  I hope at this juncture the majority here would demonstrate \nleadership. The Budget Act requires that budgets be sent to the full \nCongress; that we then submit a budget, have our own budget here, that \neither duplicates the President or offers some alternatives so that we \ncan then debate out the process and move in the direction that I think \nall of us have endorsed regardless of where anyone stood on the \nproposed constitutional amendment. I didn't hear a single Member of \nthis body indicate anything but strong support for achieving a balanced \nbudget as soon as possible, hopefully by the year 2002, for all of the \nvery obvious reasons that the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nand others articulated during that lengthy debate. Our colleague from \nIllinois has already pointed out--and these charts here, I think, give \nsome indication of what we are looking at--the tax breaks that are \nbeing proposed. They are actually even larger than last year's \nproposals.\n\n  There are Members who endorse last year's proposals and I presume are \nin favor of having even larger ones. But I think the American public \nought to know what the implications are. As it is right now, over the \nnext 5 years we will be looking, here, at additional tax breaks that \nare relatively large even over the first 5 years, but then move up \nconsiderably over a 10-year period. That ought to be a concern to \neveryone here. Because, obviously, if we find ourselves again in a \ndeficit situation, even a larger one than we were in the past 10 years, \nthen we will be right back again debating, I presume, constitutional \namendments and the like. So we have an obligation to be fiscally \nresponsible.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. DODD. Of course. The Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Naturally, every politician wants to propose a tax cut. \nIs there anything that draws more applause in a town meeting than the \nline that ``we want to cut your taxes''?\n  Mr. DODD. Of course not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. But think of what happened when Senator Dole proposed a \nsubstantial tax cut as the keystone of his campaign. It fell flat. The \nAmerican people are skeptical. They want to make sure we keep our eye \non the ball, and we have to move toward balancing the budget. Tax cuts \nare important, but if they are at the expense of balancing the budget, \nor at the expense of important programs, the American people say, \n``Wait.''\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague is absolutely correct. They not only say \n``wait,'' but they also ask the basic question that we all have to ask. \nIf I were to stand here before you and suggest spending increases of \n$200.5 billion in the first 5 years, and spending increases of $525.8 \nbillion over 10 years, the words would not be out of my mouth before \none of my colleagues, either on this side or the other side, would ask \nme the very fundamental question, the steely-eyed question we are all \nasked to address today of, ``Senator, how do you intend to pay for \nthis?'' And, if you cannot answer that threshold question, then you \nhave to go back to the drawing boards.\n  All we are suggesting here is to put our constituencies and the \nAmerican public on notice of what we are looking at here, that \ncomparing these numbers over the next 10 years, the requests are even \nlarger than they were before, and that we ought to be asking that \nquestion, without getting into the specificity of particular tax \nproposals here, how do we pay for them so we do not find ourselves in \nthe situation that we have been placed in over the last 10 or 15 years \nwith huge deficits?\n  Let me draw my colleagues' attention as well to this next chart which \nlays it out exactly. These numbers, by the way, are prepared by the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Joint Tax Committee. They are not \nprepared by some partisan group. This is a nonpartisan analysis, a \nbipartisan analysis. It says, if you took these tax cuts and carried \nthem out to the year 2007, given the baseline deficits already \nprojected, that you are looking at these huge new deficits. This year \nit is about $120 billion. But if unchecked and unpaid for, those \ndeficits rise to $348 billion, exceeding by almost $50 billion the \nhigh-water mark for deficits in the last year, 4 years ago, of $290 \nbillion. So those deficits continue to climb. By the year 2007, or \nbefore, we will be right back in the situation we were before. So, I \ndraw the attention of my colleagues to that because I think it needs to \nbe addressed.\n  How do you pay for these? Again, Members can offer their own \nsolutions. But we are not talking about small change here. These are \nhuge items. Obviously, if you look at the budget, where are the big \nticket items that could pay for those kinds of proposals? It has been \nsuggested that Medicare, Social Security, health, education, training, \nveterans, agriculture, infrastructure--these are the big ticket items, \nparticularly up in this part of the bracket, the Medicare, Social \nSecurity, natural resources, health and education. Those are the larger \nitems--veterans as well. Defense could fall into this area, obviously. \nSo we ought to be addressing those issues that are before us.\n\n  So we raise this today because we think it is important that we \nengage in\n\n[[Page S2169]]\n\nthis debate. We are a legislative body. It is deliberate, it is slow, \nit can be ponderous. But we are trying to prepare, now, a budget, in \nthe wake of the proposed constitutional amendment to try to get us into \nbalance, to keep those interest rates down so businesses can grow and \nexpand and hire people. We have enjoyed 6 years of sustained economic \ngrowth now, in no small measure because we collectively have made \nprogress. And I will not engage in the finger-pointing about who \ndeserves credit or who is responsible--but the fact of the matter is, \nwe have brought those deficits down, now, from $290 billion to $120 \nbillion, actually down to $107 billion at one point. And we ought to be \ndoing everything in our power to see to it we continue on that \nglidepath so those interest rates do not spike up again, costing \nAmerican families and this Nation the burdens those increases would \nbring.\n  So we are suggesting here today, let us begin work on these. Making a \nrequest of the President on a daily basis or hourly basis, ``submit yet \nanother budget, yet another budget, yet another budget'' is not \nproductive. We bear the responsibility as legislators, those who \ncontrol the purse strings, to respond to the budget the President has \nsent to us, either by rejecting it and submitting our own, or by \nproposing, in a clear way for the American public to see, exactly what \nthe priorities will be and how you will pay for them.\n  Whether it is a spending increase or a tax expenditure, the American \npublic wants to know the simple answer to the question: How do you \nintend to pay for this? So we are here today to urge our colleagues, \nwho are in the position to most specifically respond to these matters, \nthat in the coming days, rather than spending time by issuing press \nreleases challenging the President to submit yet another budget, to \nfulfill our constitutional obligations here and to step forward and \nexplain to the American public exactly what our proposals are.\n  Let me just conclude by saying there are a number of these tax cut \nproposals that are being suggested which I support. I am not opposed to \nthem. Just as there are spending proposals of which I am in favor. But \nwhether it is a spending proposal I am in favor of or a tax cut I am in \nfavor of, the same question must be asked of either point: How do you \npay for them?\n  So, whether it is capital gains tax cuts, estate tax cuts, or child \ncare credits--there are all sorts of things people are proposing. \nWhatever it is, what the bulk of it is, the question must be raised: \nHow do you pay for it? If, in fact, these tax cut proposals, as some \nhave suggested, would drive us back into the very situation we found \nourselves in only a few short years ago, then I think we have to meet \nour responsibility, that has not yet been met, of following our \nlegislative mandates and responsibilities.\n  With that, I see my colleague from California here. I will leave \nthese charts here for her to peruse, and for others who may want to \ncome over and take a look at them. I know she shares similar concerns \nand thoughts, coming from the largest State in our Union, a State which \nhas contributed much to the general welfare and health of our country. \nObviously, whether you live in a small State like mine, Connecticut, or \na large State like California, people on the respective coasts and \neveryone in between in this country want to know the answers to these \nquestions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before the Senator from Connecticut leaves \nthe floor, I just wanted to thank him, because we are really running \ninto some statutory deadlines here, and, as he pointed out, because we \ndo sit on the Budget Committee together, these are not just written \ndown for fun. They are serious.\n\n  By April 1, the Budget Committee is statutorily required to vote out \na budget. On April 15, the Congress is statutorily required to vote out \na budget. We, on this side of the aisle, do not control the agenda \naround here. That is one very strong power of the majority. And believe \nme, we are sad that we do not have the ability to move an agenda, \nbecause if we did, we would have this budget on the floor today. We \nwould be debating it.\n  Why do I say that? It is because the budget of the United States of \nAmerica is, in fact, the priorities of this Nation. What we spend on \nreally says to us what we are about as a country. Do we invest in \neducation? The President in his budget says yes.\n  Do we make sure that our seniors are protected from deep, deep cuts \nin Medicare and Social Security? Yes, we care. The President cares.\n  Does the President think we should do more to clean up the toxic \nwaste sites and enforce environmental laws? Yes, he does.\n  Does he think we ought to invest in NIH, the National Institutes of \nHealth, so we can find cures for diseases, be it breast cancer or \nprostate cancer or Alzheimer's or scleroderma, all of these things \nwhich cry out for attention? The President says yes.\n  The President says we should put more police on streets into \ncommunity policing. That is all in his budget.\n  A budget reflects the priorities of a nation. It tells the country \nwho we are, what we think is most important, and, by the way, all in \nthe context of a balanced budget, so certified by the Congressional \nBudget Office. So the President has put forward his effort. It is \ncertified by the Congressional Budget Office to balance in 5 years. We \nhave it in writing. We have the letter.\n  Now we are saying to our Republican friends who control this--they \nhave 55 Senators, we have 45; they are in charge--that it is their \nresponsibility now to bring to the Budget Committee their budget. They \ndo not like the President's budget. They have criticized the \nPresident's budget. They have done it day after day. Where is their \nbudget? They are playing hide and seek with their budget, and I think \nit is time for show and tell. Show us your budget. Where are your \npriorities?\n  We only know one thing from Republicans. We know that they want to \ninstitute a huge tax cut. The President has a tax cut proposal, and it \nis modest. It is $98 billion over 5 years. That is what it costs, and \nit is paid for. What does he do? He calls for tax relief to help \nmiddle-income Americans. He calls for a $500 tax credit for dependent \nchildren, a $10,000 deduction for post-secondary education, and a \nproposal to allow married taxpayers to exclude from capital gains taxes \nup to $500,000 in gains from selling a home. Single taxpayers could \nexclude up to $250,000. This would exempt about 99 percent of home \nsales from capital gains taxes. These are the President's tax \nproposals.\n  The Republicans have said they want to do $200 billion of tax-cut \nproposals. So we are saying, ``How are you going to pay for it? Where \nare your priorities?''\n  There are two ways to do it in the Budget Committee. One way is for \nthe Republicans to offer their own budget. They have talked for weeks \nabout a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Where is their \nbalanced budget? They want an amendment to the Constitution, but where \nis their actual budget? They don't have it. We don't know what it is. \nWe only know they want to cut taxes over 5 years by $200 billion, over \n10 years by $500 billion. Are they going to go back to the big cuts in \nMedicare, big cuts in education that we fought off last year? Remember? \nThe Government shut down over these very proposals because President \nClinton and the Democrats in Congress said, ``Absolutely not, we're not \ngoing to do that to benefit the very wealthy.''\n  A recent study shows that the top 1 percent of taxpayers would get an \naverage tax break of more than $21,000, and that is extraordinary--the \ntop 1 percent.\n  Mr. President, I reiterate that right now, the Senate has only 7 \nworking days prior to the April 1 deadline for the Budget Committee to \nbring a budget to the floor--7 working days--and the Budget Committee, \non which I am proud to serve, does not even have a markup scheduled. \nWhy is this? The President put his budget forward. The CBO has \ncertified that it does reach balance in 5 years. June O'Neill signed \nthe letter. I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2170]]\n\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: You asked whether the alternative set of \n     policies proposed by the President in the event that \n     Congressional Budget Office projections are used in the \n     budget process would achieve unified budget balance in fiscal \n     year 2002.\n       As we described in our March 3 preliminary analysis of the \n     President's 1998 budgetary proposals. ``the alternative \n     policies proposed by the President were designed to fill \n     exactly any size deficit hole that CBO might project under \n     the basic policies.''\n       I hope that this answer meets your needs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the President has submitted a balanced \nbudget. In that balanced budget, he protects Medicare and he protects \nSocial Security. He moves forward with an investment and commitment in \neducation and the environment and health research and transportation \nand putting more community police on the streets. This is a good \nbudget, and if the Republicans don't like it--and I don't expect them \nto like it, that is why there is a difference in the parties here, we \nknow we have different priorities--let them come forward with a budget \ninstead of playing hide and seek.\n  We only know one thing they want, and that is tax breaks to the very \nwealthy. They have put that out there. The President calls for $98 \nbillion of tax cuts over a 5-year period. Those are targeted to the \nmiddle class so that when you sell your home, you will not have to pay \ncapital gains taxes; so if you send your child to college, you can \nwrite off $10,000; so if you have children, you can exercise tax \ncredits. These are modest tax breaks for the middle class.\n  The Republicans, on the other hand, have a tax break that is so huge \nthat it is going to cost $200 billion. A recent study shows the top 1 \npercent of taxpayers would get an average tax break of more than \n$21,000 while 99 percent of the rest of us do not get that benefit. So \nit seems to me we are going back to the battle that we had last year \nwhen the Government shut down.\n  But this is even worse. They will not show us their budget. Where is \nit? We know the tax cut part. Where is the spending part? Where are we \ngoing to get the money to balance in the year 2002 to pay for those tax \ncuts? Are you going to do what you did the last time, take $200 billion \nout of Medicare? I hope not. That brought the Government to a shutdown.\n  So I just am very confused. I can understand why my Republican \ncolleagues would not like the President's budget. I can understand \nthat. Frankly, I think the budget the President put forward is an \nexcellent product, and it makes the investments we need to make while \nprotecting our priorities. It has tax breaks for the middle class. It \nbalances by 2002. I think it is a budget that the American people will \nget behind. But I know that my Republican colleagues criticize \neverything this President does, and they are going to find some things \nin that budget they do not like. It is fair. It is absolutely fair for \nthem.\n  But I will tell you what is unfair. It is unfair for them to point \nthe finger at this President, by the way, and tell him to go back and \nredo it. That is what they are telling him to do. ``Go back and do a \nsecond budget,'' they say, when they have not even put a first budget \nforward. Let us see their first budget. Let us see their first budget. \nMaybe if they do a first budget, they will have some authority to say \nthey want a second budget from the President.\n  But the President has put his best case forward, certified by the CBO \nto balance, that protects Medicare, protects Medicaid, invests in our \nchildren, invests in the environment, invests in health research, puts \nmore cops on the beat. And it is being ridiculed and criticized, and \nthey say, go back and do it all again. Look, it is irresponsible at \nthis point that we do not have a markup of a budget.\n  If they do not want to produce a budget, I have another scenario. Let \nthem take the President's budget, which they do not like, and amend it.\n  If they want to make the tax cuts bigger, make the tax cuts bigger. \nOffer an amendment to make the tax cuts bigger, and show us how you are \ngoing to pay for it.\n  You want to cut education? Have the guts to do it. Write an \namendment. Tell the American people you do not think it is a priority.\n  You want to cut out Environmental Protection Agency enforcement? Have \nthe guts to offer an amendment.\n  You want to spend less on health research, transportation? That is \nfine. That is your right. But what I do not think is your right is to \ncriticize and point fingers at the President, tell him he has to go \nback and write a new budget before you even put your budget out there, \nall but your tax cuts--all but your tax cuts.\n  Well, that is the easy part, folks. I love to talk about the tax cuts \nin the President's budget because I have to think they are very helpful \nto our society. But at the same time we have to make some tough choices \nin the budget, some tough choices all the way across the board. And \nthat is what the President has done.\n  So we have 7 working days to meet the April 1 deadline for the Budget \nCommittee. We have only 14 working days before the deadline for final \ncongressional passage. And the Republicans have no budget, or if they \nhave a budget, it is in somebody's pocket or it is in some back room. \nIt has not been brought out yet. I just think we are asking for \ntrouble. We are going to miss these deadlines and are not going to do \nour work.\n  As I said when I listened to the debate on the balanced budget \namendment, I believed that people on both sides of that issue wanted to \nbalance the budget. They had disagreements over whether you need to put \nit in the Constitution, but I surely believed once we disposed of that \nissue, we voted on it, we would get to the hard business of balancing \nthe budget. But it is awfully difficult to do it when the only one who \nhas put out a balanced budget is President Clinton, and the other side \nis poking holes at it, pointing fingers at it, telling him to go back \nand do it again. They have yet to come out with a budget. This is not a \nlevel playing field around here. It just does not make sense. It is not \nfair. And I think the American people will understand.\n  There is a lot of time around here to dedicate yourself to lots of \nother issues--finger pointing and all the rest on campaign \ncontributions and all of that. And I say, campaign finance reform is \nvery important. We ought to bring that to the floor, too. That would \nprobably be a real step forward for the American people. Bring forward \nthe budget debate, bring forward the debate on campaign finance reform, \ntwo issues that are important to the country. But I do not see either \nof these headed for the Senate floor. I think that is most unfortunate.\n\n  There is lots of time for other things, but not the things that I \nbelieve are very pressing matters. Certainly the most pressing is the \nbudget, because the budget is what our priorities are about.\n  When you sit down with the family and go over the monthly \nexpenditures, you make some very important decisions, don't you? If we \nbuy a new car, how much do we need to set aside for that car payment? \nGee, maybe we should put that off a year and do something else. Maybe \nit is time that the family took a family vacation. So you decide to put \noff the new car, take the family vacation. We make these decisions in \nour families.\n  The American family needs to make its decisions, and it is called a \nbudget. It is where we make the very important decisions. How much do \nwe need to defend this country against all enemies foreign and \ndomestic? How much do we need to get our children ready for that work \nforce?\n  Today, we had a wonderful east-west initiative, a very bipartisan \ninitiative. It included Senator Hatch, Senator Faircloth, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Murray and myself; Massachusetts, California, Utah, \nWashington State, and North Carolina. This was a great bipartisan \ninitiative. It is about job creation, and it is about our working \ntogether to make sure that in this country we make the investments we \nneed in new technologies, we make the investments we need in education, \nwe make the investments we need at the FDA so new drug approvals move \nswiftly. These are the issues that Republicans and Democrats alike came \ntogether around today.\n\n[[Page S2171]]\n\n  I will tell you, if we do not get moving on a budget, Mr. President, \nif we do not come together as Republicans and Democrats and work \ntogether, we are just going to come to a dead stop because out in the \nreal world they meet deadlines--they meet deadlines.\n  If you have a new product and you have to get it out to the \nmarketplace, you better not have delays, because if you have delays in \ngetting that product out to market, you can go bankrupt.\n  Well, around here, statutory deadlines do not seem to mean much. \nMaybe I am wrong. Maybe my budget chairman right now is preparing to \noffer the Republican budget. He will lay it down next to the Democratic \nClinton budget. We will look at the similarities. We will join hands. \nWe will look at the differences. We will fight those out. We will look \nat the tax cuts. We will come together and move on.\n  But I would say--and the reason several of us came over here today to \ntalk about this--that time is moving, the clock is ticking. We have not \nseen the budget. We know what your tax cuts are. Where are your cuts? \nWhat are your priorities?\n  I just hope that we can get back to why we were sent here. I mean, \neverybody said after this election it is time to put behind the rancor. \nBut I think there is rancor when you point the finger at the President, \nin spite of the fact that the CBO said his budget balances, and tell \nhim first, it does not balance, and second, do it again, when you have \nnot even put your product on the table, except for your tax cuts, which \nbenefit 1 percent, the top 1 percent of the people in this country \ninstead of the middle class.\n  We have a lot of work to do. I look forward to seeing the Republican \nbudget, finding those areas of agreement, working on those areas of \ndisagreement, getting this budget down to the floor by the statutory \ndeadline and moving forward.\n  Mr. President, I have the honor of not only serving on the Budget \nCommittee but serving on the Appropriations Committee. This is, really, \nan extraordinary opportunity for the Senator from California to have \nboth those assignments. I have an opportunity to debate the large \npriorities and then get it down to within those priorities--what is the \nmost important investment to make, and in the context of a balanced \nbudget, I might add. And I voted for several of those, one that Senator \nConrad wrote, and one that former Senator Bill Bradley wrote.\n  I am ready to make those tough choices. I like to believe my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are ready to make those tough \nchoices. We should come together. The clock is ticking. So, we should \ndo it, Mr. President. I hope we will back off this finger pointing at \nthe White House. I hope we will look at this President's budget. I hope \nthe Republicans will present their budget and we proceed to mark it up \nand proceed down the path of bipartisan cooperation so this country has \na budget which is, in fact, our priorities.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The galleries will refrain from any \ndemonstration of clapping, please.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair for calling the attention of the Senate \nrules to the galleries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/12/senate-section/article/S2166-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--PERMISSION FOR COMMITTEE TO MEET\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources be granted permission to meet during \nthe session of the Senate on Wednesday, March 12, for the purpose of \nconducting a full committee business meeting which is scheduled to \nbegin at 9:30 a.m. The purpose of this business meeting is to consider \nS. 104, to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I object on behalf of two Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could be further heard on this, and I \nwill be relatively brief, I must say, I think this objection is, at the \nvery least, very unfortunate. It has been my understanding that we are \noperating in good faith with respect to the confirmation of Mr. Pena \nand the markup of the nuclear waste bill.\n  I have made a special effort to get this nomination up this morning. \nWe had a lot of communication with the ranking member, the chairman and \nother Members interested in the confirmation of the Secretary of Energy \ndesignee, with the understanding, clearly, that the nuclear waste bill \ncould go forward.\n  Since this objection has now been raised, the Energy Committee cannot \ncomplete its business with respect to reporting out the nuclear waste \nbill today. It is my understanding they will reconvene tomorrow at 9:30 \nin order to take action on this very important nuclear waste bill.\n  I say again, I have been trying to be cooperative in trying to move \nnominations. I worked with those who had objections in the committee. I \nhelped work out a process where the chairman could schedule this \nnominee for a vote, and then I worked with the other objections we had \non this side of the aisle from the Senator from Minnesota, Senator \nGrams. He was able to make his remarks this morning.\n\n  We agreed that we would have a vote at 12:30, or quarter to 1, I \nbelieve, now, all this under the assumption that we were working in \ngood faith. Now we have an objection to the committee meeting to report \nout a bill which has overwhelming support of the full Senate and will \nhave overwhelming support in the committee.\n  This is not a good sign, but it is just one of many bad signs that we \nare seeing, in my view, from the standpoint of being able to work \ntogether for the good of the country. So it is a very unfortunate \ndecision, and it will not be without consequences. I yield the floor, \nMr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as the majority leader knows, every \nSenator has a right to make such an objection, and two of our Senators \ndecided to exercise their right. I think that has to be put into \ncontext that every Senator is sent here primarily to represent his or \nher constituency in his or her own State.\n  I don't think the majority leader would suggest that Senators do not \nhave the right to protect their constituency. I wanted to make that \npoint because two Senators, who believe that this is not in the best \ninterest of their State, had asked us to exercise their full and given \nrights as Senators to object to this meeting.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I understand that the Senate will vote at \n12:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may speak until \n12:45 as if in executive session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to voice my support for the \nnomination of Federico Pena to be Secretary of Energy during President \nClinton's second term in office.\n  Mr. Pena served ably as Secretary of Transportation during the first \nClinton Administration, and I look forward to working with him as he \nassumes new responsibilities at the Department of Energy. The \nchallenges at DOE are vast, and Mr. Pena's management skills and \nability to work with different groups should prove very useful in \nresponding to the complex issues which are the responsibility of the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  Prior to joining the Clinton Administration, Mr. Pena served as Mayor \nof Denver from 1983 to 1991, and as a Colorado legislator. During his \ntenure as mayor, Mr. Pena played an active role in reviving the Denver \neconomy from its mid-1980s decline through a series of bold \ninitiatives. At a time when major new international airports were not \nbeing built in this country, he gained approval for one of the largest \nand most technological advanced airports in the world. As Secretary of \nTransportation, Mr. Pena proudly participated in the dedication of \nDenver International Airport in February, 1995.\n  While he served as Secretary of Transportation, I worked closely with\n\n[[Page S2172]]\n\nSecretary Pena regarding the transportation issues in my home state of \nWest Virginia. He now moves to a department that has responsibility for \na different set of issues, but issues that are very important to the \ncurrent and future economic prosperity of my state. Coal is not only a \nmajor economic and employment influence in West Virginia, but coal is a \ncritical component of our national energy picture. At the present time, \nand projected into the future, fossil fuels remain the dominant source \nfor our energy supply picture. At present, fossil fuels supply 85 \npercent of our energy requirements. Coal is the source of 55 percent of \nour nation's electricity. So policies that affect coal and the role of \nfossil fuels in our energy picture are of great interest--not just to \nthe states that are the source of these fuels but also to the nation as \na whole because of the potential for significant disruption if abrupt \nchanges are recommended without giving the economy a chance to prepare \nand adjust.\n  As Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I \nlook forward to working with Secretary-designate Pena on our energy \npolicy issues. In addition to serving as the Ranking Member on the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee, I also serve on the Energy and \nWater Development Subcommittee--both of which have jurisdiction over \nparts of the DOE budget. At a time of constrained budgets and pressure \nto downsize the Federal workforce, we must also be attentive to the \nrealities of our energy supply picture. Thus, I have been, and will \ncontinue to be, supportive of investments in technology development \nthat will contribute to our using and producing energy more \nefficiently, as well as producing energy in more environmentally-\nsensitive ways. The Department of Energy has a visible physical \npresence in West Virginia at the Federal Energy Technology Center \nfacility in Morgantown, which employs some 550 persons directly and \nunder contract. I look forward to working with Mr. Pena to ensure a \ncontinued future for this important part of our Federal technical \ninfrastructure.\n  There is a need within the Administration for a strong voice on \nbehalf of fossil energy, and particularly coal, and I believe Mr. Pena \nis capable of meeting this challenge. I wish him well in his new job, \nand urge my colleagues to support his confirmation. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we extend for \n2 minutes the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator may proceed for 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I want to say I do support the nomination of Secretary \nPena. However, I think it is very important that this new Secretary \ntake the opportunity to set an energy policy in this country that says \nto the American people that energy self-sufficiency is our goal. We \nshould be able to create energy through our own natural resources, not \nonly to create jobs in America, but also to make sure that our country \nis strong with energy self-sufficiency.\n  I am going to work with Senator John Breaux, my cochair of the Oil \nand Gas Caucus, to try to make sure that we take the duplication of \nregulation off of our oil and gas industry. Where State regulators are \nable to handle the issues, we should let it happen at the State level \nrather than the Federal Government duplicating the regulations which \nbecome costly and burdensome to our oil and gas industry. Why not put \nthat money into new capital creations, to create new jobs in our \ncountry, rather than going through more bureaucratic morass that so \nhampers our businesses?\n  I also want to give incentives, incentives to drill and explore for \nour own natural resources, especially marginal drilling that is more \nexpensive. Why not give incentives so we can create the jobs in America \nand also create energy resources for our country that would make us \nmore able to be sufficient?\n  Mr. President, it is very important that the new Secretary come with \nthe full support of the Senate. I hope that he will be committed to a \nstrong energy policy for our country and that he will also take \nseriously the requirement that we work for the new alternative MOX \nfuels that will, I hope, come from the nuclear weapons that we are in \nthe process of dismantling. I hope he will take the opportunity to \nvisit Pantex in Amarillo to see what can be done with this great MOX \nfuel opportunity, to use the aging nuclear weapons in our arsenal.\n  In supporting this nomination, I would like to briefly discuss two \nissues of importance to my State of Texas and the Nation.\n  Mr. President, a healthy and competitive oil and gas industry--\ncapable of producing adequate and affordable energy supplies--is \ncrucially important to the U.S. economy and to the welfare of the \nAmerican people. This is especially the case at a time when U.S. \ncompanies and workers face growing competition in the global economy.\n  As cochairman, of the Congressional Oil and Gas Caucus, I am \nconcerned that U.S. policy, taken as a whole, has overtly encouraged \nincreasing oil imports over expanding domestic production. I look \nforward to working with Secretary Pena to reverse this trend and to \ncreate conditions that foster a competitive and healthy oil and gas \nindustry.\n  This year, I will be working with my colleagues in the House and \nSenate to continue our goal of reducing or eliminating redundant or \nunnecessary regulations on this industry. For example, there are many \nregulatory requirements to address the same concern imposed at both the \nStatese co- and Federal level. Where possible, we should eliminate one \nlevel of identical regulations, which have destroyed jobs, raised \nconsumer prices, and sent American business to foreign countries. I \nlook forward to working with Secretary Pena on these objectives.\n  I believe in most cases the State regulations should be given the \ngreater deference.\n  I will also be working with my colleagues to provide tax incentives \nwhich encourage oil and gas drilling and production, especially for \nmarginal wells and formations which are difficult to develop.\n  I know all the members of the Congressional Oil and Gas Caucus look \nforward to working with Secretary Pena on these issues and to ensure \nthat Government policies which affect the oil and gas industry are the \nresult of sound and informed decision making.\n  Mr. President, I would like to turn briefly to a second and final \nissue of concern to Texans and the Nation--the continued transformation \nof our Nation's nuclear weapons complex and the important work being \nperformed at he Pantex Plant near Amarillo, TX.\n  Our victory in the cold war signaled the end of the arms race, but it \nhas focused our current efforts on arms reductions. A benefit from \nthese reductions is the potential energy source of special nuclear \nmaterials from dismantled weapons.\n  Just a few months ago, Department of Energy officials announced their \nintention to process excess plutonium into mixed-oxide, or MOX, fuel \nfor use in commercial nuclear reactors.\n  Pantex has been the Nation's premiere nuclear weapons production site \nsince 1951. Today, it is the only authorized site to assemble and \ndisassemble weapons. Currently, the plant stores all the plutonium \nremoved from dismantled weapons.\n  The 3,400 workers at Pantex played a key role in our cold war victory \nand their expertise in safety and security handling and storing \nplutonium should not be ignored as the Department searches for a MOX \nfuel fabrication site. The excellent safety record, cost savings and \nefficiencies established at Pantex over the last 40 years make it the \nideal candidate for new DOE work.\n  As DOE proceeds with its assessments of potential sites, I invite \nSecretary Pena to visit Pantex so he can see firsthand the world class \nfacilities and professionals available to the Department of Energy near \nAmarillo and in the Texas Panhandle.\n  I also ask Secretary Pena to take a close look at the safety and \nreliability of our nuclear stockpile. I am concerned that with an end \nto our nuclear testing, computer modeling alone will not be sufficient \nto maintain our deterrent nuclear capability. I hope that together with \nthe Secretary of Defense, Secretary Pena will take a close look at how \nwe manage and maintain this critical capability.\n\n[[Page S2173]]\n\n  I look forward to working with Secretary Pena on these and other \nimportant issues. The next Secretary of Energy has a great opportunity \nto give our country an energy policy that values energy sufficiency for \nour country.\n  I thank you for this opportunity to speak on behalf of Secretary \nPena. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Regarding soon-to-be-confirmed Secretary of Energy \nPena, I want to tell the Senate I know him and his family very well, in \nparticular his wife, who went to school with my children. We are good \nfriends. I do not support him on that basis only. I think he is ready \nto undertake this very difficult job. I wish him well.\n  I think we can work together to make the Department of Energy a \nbetter department under his administration. I look forward to working \nto that end. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/12/senate-section/article/S2171-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF FEDERICO PENA, OF COLORADO, TO BE SECRETARY OF ENERGY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in accordance with the unanimous-consent \nagreement, I call up Senate Joint Resolution 18 on behalf of myself, \nMr. Specter, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Byrd, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Biden, \nMrs. Feinstein, Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Ford, \nand Mr. Harkin, and ask the clerk to report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 18, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 18) proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States relating to \n     contributions and expenditures intended to affect elections.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the joint resolution.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in a line, what we say is that the \nCongress is hereby authorized to regulate or control expenditures in \nFederal elections.\n  Let me say that I come now to this particular subject of a \nconstitutional amendment, which we have been on for over 10 years, with \nsome hope, because I noticed on yesterday, Mr. President, we had a fit \nof conscience. We were about to pass a resolution that said Congress \nwas only going to look at illegal contributions and not at improper \nones, and, finally, in a fit of conscience, the Congress, particularly \nhere in the Senate, decided that was not going to fly. It would appear \nto be, if we took that course, a coverup whereby we did not want to get \ninto soft money and all of these other extravaganzas, legal as they \nare, says the Supreme Court, but as improper as can be.\n  That is what is causing the headlines and the consternation and the \nmoney chase that we read in the headlines and news stories. We had a \nfit of conscience when we passed the 1974 act. This act came about due \nto the untoward activity in the 1967 and 1971 Presidential races. In \nthe 1967 race, President Nixon had designated Maurice Stans, later the \nSecretary of Commerce, to collect the money.\n  And I will never forget; he came to the State of South Carolina, and \nhe told our textile friends, ``your fair share is $350,000,'' almost \nlike the United Fund or Community Chest. Well, I had been their \nGovernor and everything else and had never gotten $350,000 out of the \ntextile industry, and they were all my friends. But the ten of them, at \n$35,000 apiece, got up the money, and more than that. There were other \nlarge contributions, including one of $2 million from Chicago.\n  The fact was, after President Nixon took office, Treasury Secretary \nJohn Connally went to the President and said, ``Mr. President, you have \ngot a lot of good support and you have not even met these individuals \nmuch less thanked them. Why not come down to the ranch and we will put \non a barbecue and you can meet and thank them.'' President Nixon said, \n``fine business,'' and they did. But as they turned into the weekend \nranch barbecue on the Connally Ranch in Texas, there was a big Brinks \ntruck. Dick Tuck, the prankster from the Kennedy campaign, had \nstationed a truck with signs out there. A picture of it was taken. And \nwe in Washington, Republican and Democrat, said, ``heavens above, the \nGovernment's up for sale.'' Thereafter, you had the extremes of \nWatergate, which everyone is familiar with. So, in 1974 we had a fit of \nconscience. Yes, everybody thought they had advantages with respect to \ngetting the money. They had gotten here on the ground rules as they \nthen appeared, and said ``Why change? I can operate as the rules are.''\n\n  But, with that fit of conscience, we came and passed the 1974 act. I \nwant to remind everyone that this was a very deliberate, bipartisan \neffort at the time. It set spending limits on campaigns, limited \ncandidates' personal spending on their own behalf, limited expenditures \nby independent persons or groups for or against candidates, set \nvoluntary spending limits as a condition for receiving public funding, \nset disclosure requirements for campaign spending and receipts, set \nlimits on contributions for individuals and political committees, and \ncreated the Federal Election Commission.\n  When you hear the debates, some of the new Members will come on the \nfloor talking about what we really need is disclosure. That is what we \nhave, still, under that 1974 act. I am required to record every dollar \nin and out with both the Secretary of the Senate on the one hand and \nthe secretary of state back in the capital of my State, Columbia, SC, \non the other. We have complete disclosure. You cannot take cash.\n\n[[Page S2174]]\n\n I had always thought it was illegal to take a contribution on \nGovernment property. And we thought we had soft money and independent \ncontributions regulated.\n  But, in Buckley versus Valeo they stood the original intent of the \nCongress on its head. It is this original intent of limited \nexpenditures in Federal elections that our constitutional amendment is \noffered, in a bipartisan fashion, with the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, and myself in the lead, along with the \nstrong support of those I have enumerated.\n  Now, back to the fit of conscience. I initiated this particular \napproach, in frustration, over 10 years ago, after realizing, like a \ndog chasing its tail, we were not getting anywhere. We had \nvoluntariness prescribed by giving certain amounts of money if you \nvoluntarily limited. There was free TV. You had public financing. You \nhad all the different little tidbits of the different bills that have \ncome around.\n  Necessarily, I support them for the simple reason I am looking for \nvotes. I am looking to finally get a concurrent majority of 67 \nSenators, so I do not want to turn off any of these sponsors, even \nthough I know there are constitutional questions under the Buckley \nversus Valeo decision. But the real opposition is not the freedom of \nspeech under the first amendment in the Bill of Rights to the \nConstitution. The real opposition, if you please, is a small group \namong us Senators who feel like this money is a tremendous advantage \nand they are not going to give it up.\n  I know where the opposition lies. It is in the very thought that we \nare not spending enough. As was said in the debates here on the floor: \n``On Kibbles and Bits cat and dog food we spend $4 billion; why don't \nwe spend $4 billion on national elections?'' So I hope we can flush \nthose who really believe this to come up and debate this idea on its \nmerits.\n  They will come under the cover of the freedom of speech. It is very \ninteresting that what we have under consideration is paid speech, not \nfree speech. Heavens above, we have all the free speech that you can \nthink of.\n  I remember for 20 years in politics we had more or less a one-party \nsystem in my State. We would go around stump speaking, as we call it, \nfrom county to county. In some of the larger counties several speeches \nwere made. Each of the candidates would come and get up on the stump \nand say what they stood for. The battle was not in the financial arena; \nthe battle was in the political arena. It was not who had the most \nmoney but who had the better ideas, the better initiatives, the better \nvision, the better programs. But they have tried, following the Buckley \ndecision, to equate just exactly that. What you pay for is free.\n  It amuses me when they come up here and read the Washington Post \neditorials. Go down to the Washington Post and say, ``Now I want some \nof that free speech. I would like about a quarter page of that free \nspeech, or a half page of that free speech you just editorialized \nabout.'' And they will say, ``Son, bug off. There is nothing free down \nhere in this newspaper. You are going to have to pay for it, and you \nare going to have to pay for it under our rules and our regulations and \nour limits.'' The very crowd editorializing about free speech is the \nvery crowd that is demanding their pay--paid speech. So let us not come \nhere with an adulteration of the first amendment.\n\n  As Judge J. S. Wright stated in the Yale Law Journal, ``Nothing in \nthe first amendment commits us to the dogma that money is speech.'' \nThat was their finding. But, unfortunately, the Supreme Court found \nthat you should have total freedom with respect to spending, speech, \nand politics. But when it came to the contributions, the court's \nBuckley decision amended them. They may come now and say the first \namendment has never been amended in 200 years. They are very \nauthoritative, but Buckley versus Valeo amended the first amendment. It \nlimited speech of those who contribute.\n  What did Chief Justice Burger say about that? I will quote from the \nBuckley versus Valeo dissent of the Chief Justice.\n\n       The Court's attempt to distinguish the communications \n     inherent in political contributions from speech aspects of \n     political expenditures simply will not wash.\n\n  That was Chief Justice Burger. And, as everybody with common sense \nknows, here was the original intent. Here were the big ads. Here were \nthe big contributors. Here was all the cash and the corruptive \ninfluence of large amounts of money. And after Congress acted in a \nbipartisan fashion in 1974, here came the United States Supreme Court, \nin a 5-to-4 decision, if you please, and by a 1-vote margin, with this \ndistortion, this more or less amendment of the first amendment.\n  Certainly it is an amendment with respect to contributors' speech. If \nI am a contributor and I want to contribute to the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, I am limited in my speech, my political expression. \nI can only give him $1,000 in his primary and $1,000 in his general \nelection. That is the limit in Buckley versus Valeo, amending, if you \nplease, the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n  We act as if, Mr. President, there is some sanctimony or sanctified \nposition of the first amendment, and, of course, the Senator would \nagree in a breath that there should be. We should really approach \namending the Constitution of the United States with trepidation. I know \nsome of the arguments are: Wait a minute, the President's got one on \nvictims rights, and others have one on prayer in school. Somebody else \nhas a constitutional amendment about the flag. Someone else has another \nconstitutional amendment. This is an exception, already written in the \nConstitution and recognized in the Constitution in the 24th amendment, \nthe influence of money on political expression, the influence of money \non the freedom of political speech.\n  I have to emulate the distinguished leader from West Virginia, the \nHonorable Senator Robert Byrd, who says he carries his contract up here \nin his left-hand pocket, and I find that is a pretty good habit.\n  Let me read amendment 24, section 1:\n\n       The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any \n     primary or other election for President or Vice President, \n     for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator \n     or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or \n     abridged by the United States or any State by reason of \n     failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.\n       Section 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this \n     article by appropriate legislation.\n\n  So they said, if you are going to put a financial burden on the voter \nthat he can't participate in the freedom of political expression \nbecause of a tax, that is unconstitutional, and we have expressed \nalready in that 24th amendment our abhorrence of the financial \ninfluence and corruption, so to speak, upon political expression.\n  In a sense, it gives us one man, one vote. The poorest of the poor \ncan cancel out the richest of the rich. I can take Bill Gates and say, \n``Ha-ha, I vote the other way,'' and his vote is gone. I can take Steve \nForbes and say, ``Ah, yeah, you can pay your own $35 million,'' or \nwhatever it was, ``to get in the race at the last minute and mess up \nBob Dole.'' I better not get off on too candid a delivery here this \nafternoon. But, in any event, Steve Forbes cannot only buy a vote, he \ncan buy several States in the primaries. He has proven that. But when \nit comes down to one vote, I can cancel him. That is the greatness of \nour democracy, our republic form of Government.\n  Here we are coming around and talking totally out of mystery and \nnonsense about the unlimited freedom of speech, that it has never been \namended in 200 years. I want the Senator from Kentucky to come, because \nwe are going to read those amendments. One, obviously, is with respect \nto public safety. You can't walk into a theater and shout, ``Fire.'' \nThat is a limit on your freedom of speech and an amendment of the first \namendment.\n  You have the exemption for national security with respect to \ndisclosing secrets of the Government itself. Senator Moynihan just sent \naround a book this thick about secrets and classifications and \neverything else. Perhaps the distinguished Senator is correct, we ought \nto do away with at least half of them, because when you see that book, \nyou say, ``We are overwhelmed now with the so-called classified, the \nso-called eyes only, the so-called top secret.''\n  Although we have the best of the best intelligence systems, we didn't \neven know about the fall of the wall. It happened, and we all got the \nnews within 24 hours. The intelligence community\n\n[[Page S2175]]\n\n--and I was on the Intelligence Committee at the time--had nothing to \nsay. We were talking about all the other extraneous things, but nothing \nabout the greatest happening, in a sense, in the last generation of our \ntime.\n  So we have the exception, too, for fighting words, where they would \nprovoke retaliation or cause retaliation. We know about that one.\n  We know about the exception for obscenity. In fact, the FCC has been \ngiven the authority--we had the seven or eight little dirty words on a \nradio station out on the west coast, and that decision, Pacifica, went \nall the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, and we found out that, yes, \nthe Federal Communications Commission, the entity and agency of the \nexecutive branch, the administrative body, could determine whether or \nnot it was a violation on the public airwaves of obscene talk and \nspeech, and that is limited. We said it could be limited. We legislated \nthat it could be limited.\n\n  False and deceptive advertising. If you want to come up to just 2 \nweeks ago, Mr. President, they had the buffer zone--I hate to raise the \nquestion of abortion--but by legislation, they put a buffer zone around \nthese abortion clinics, and those who demonstrate and say, ``Wait a \nminute, we have the freedom of speech,'' the Supreme Court ruled 2 \nweeks ago, ``No, you don't, not in that buffer zone, keep your mouth \nshut, stay out of that zone, your freedom of speech is limited.''\n  Mr. President, I certainly want to hear from the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada. He has been a strong supporter and leader in this \nparticular cause, and he has other commitments. So, at the present \ntime, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend for his courtesy and \nhis most generous remarks and to say, again, as I have on previous \noccasions, that I am very pleased to be a supporter of this \nconstitutional amendment that he has authored each and every Congress \nthat I have been here since 1989. I believe what we are discussing \ntoday is central to the issue of meaningful campaign reform, and I want \nto publicly commend him for his leadership and express my admiration \nfor him and my conviction that I share with him that this is the \nessence of what we need to do.\n  Let me just say that I believe that the most corrosive force in our \npolitical culture today, and what lies at the heart of many problems in \nour political system, is the amount of money required to run a campaign \nfor elective office. Money has become the dominant factor in deciding \nwho runs, who wins and, too often, who has the influence and power in \nthe halls of Government.\n  Mr. President, I don't say that with a partisan vein. That is true \nwith respect to the system that we are all a part of--Democrats, \nRepublicans and Independents alike.\n  Every year, the expense of campaigning increases, and the pressure to \nseek financial support, wherever it can be found, intensifies. Clearly, \ngood people are trapped in a system where the amount of money needed to \nrun a campaign can overshadow their views and the issues. Too often, \ncandidates are forced to spend as much time raising money as going out \nand meeting the voters or to develop responsible solutions to the \ncritical issues that face our society.\n  It is a fact that all of us would acknowledge that every night here \nin Washington someone has a political fundraiser, either a Democrat or \na Republican running for office, running for reelection.\n  And much like an ever-escalating arms race, the cost of Senate \ncampaigns have increased sixfold over the last 20 years, from $609,100 \nin 1976, to $3.6 million in 1996.\n  The average cost for a winning House candidate during that same \nperiod of time increased from $87,000 in 1976, to $661,000 in 1996.\n  And between 1992 and 1996, fundraising by political parties increased \n73 percent.\n  Simply put, Mr. President, there is too much money in the political \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, the recently concluded Presidential and congressional \ncampaigns were the most costly ever in American political history, with \ncombined amounts of more than $2 billion. The two parties raised $263.5 \nmillion in soft money in the 1996 campaign, almost three times the \namount raised in the 1992 election.\n  Unless the rules are changed, candidates and their parties will \ncontinue to pursue the money chase and the amount of money involved in \nfuture campaigns will continue to grow exponentially.\n  Mr. President, I might make an aside here, if the distinguished \nprimary sponsor has a moment for me to expand for just a moment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Sure.\n  Mr. BRYAN. And I say that we all lament the declining participation \nin the political electoral process in America. The 1996 election \nturnout was said to be the lowest since 1920. I would offer this as at \nleast a significant contributing factor. There is no question the folks \nback home are pretty upset with those of us who serve in the Congress. \nI believe that that is their thought, seeing each party and each of us \nwho are part of this system--I want to be clear, Mr. President, I \ninclude myself as being part of this system--who are forced to go out \nthere and raise these inordinate, scandalous amounts of money to be \ncompetitive--to be competitive.\n  In the State of Nevada, it was about $3.5 million for my last \ncampaign for reelection to the U.S. Senate. They see this. And I think \nit has engendered a sense of public cynicism that all of this money \nthat is involved--I believe in the public mind, they frequently link \nthe big money, the big contributors to the political system that we \nhave today. And because most of them are not in the category of being \nbig money contributors, they have been turned off. The system no longer \nworks for them, the system is no longer responsive to their needs, is \ntheir perception.\n  So, as a result, I hear good people, Democrats and Republicans alike, \nin increasing and in alarming numbers saying, ``I'm not going to vote. \nI'm not going to vote.'' I do not agree with that proposition and get \ninto spirited discussions. ``What difference does my vote make? Look, \nthe folks who have got the money, they're the ones who really control \nthe electoral process in America today. Why should I get involved?'' \nAnd I must say, as we see these campaign expenditures continue to \nmount, I believe that we provide the evidence for their rising levels \nof cynicism.\n  I was a young man in the State legislature in the 1970's, and the \ncenterpiece to the Watergate reform was, as the distinguished junior \nSenator from South Carolina has pointed out, the concept of controlling \nand limiting the amount of money that is spent in running for office.\n  The other provisions which continue to survive--individual campaign \ncontribution limits and the Federal Election Commission disclosures, \nthe distinction between soft money and hard money--which are still very \nmuch a part of the political environment, have survived, to some \nextent, successive legal challenges in the courts.\n  But the centerpiece, limiting the amount of money spent for running \nfor office, has essentially been eviscerated by the Buckley versus \nValeo decision. I was in the legislature and responding to some of the \nreforms that came out of the Watergate Congress. We adopted, in the \nState of Nevada, a series of campaign limitations. Those, too, fell by \nthe wayside by the Supreme Court's decision in the Buckley versus Valeo \ncase in 1976, which I believe to be an ill-considered decision, but \nwhich, as everybody in this Chamber knows, essentially equated \npolitical expenditures on behalf of the individual candidate as being \ntantamount to free speech, and any attempt to limit the amount of money \nthat a candidate can spend is constitutionally infirm.\n  I must say, recent decisions in the Court, and the recent Colorado \ndecision, give us no hope to believe that the Court is about to \nreconsider its position. It is my humble opinion that the Colorado case \nhas made matters even more difficult and has continued to shred what \nvestiges remain of a comprehensive and, I think, carefully thought-out \ncampaign finance reform legislation in the aftermath of the Watergate.\n  Amending the Constitution is not something that should be undertaken \nlightly. That admonition is frequently given by our colleagues. And \nthey are\n\n[[Page S2176]]\n\nright. We ought not just to do that. We ought not to think of the \nConstitution as a rough draft that we can improve upon with a wholesale \nseries of amendments. I agree with that admonition.\n  But I would say, Mr. President, with great respect, that our \nforefathers could never have anticipated the consequences of the \nelectoral system they put in place, with all of its checks and balances \nand with the genius that we all revere, Democrat and Republican alike, \nthat this has increasingly become a money chase. So it seems to me we \nhave two choices: To either do nothing and to allow a situation which I \nbelieve to be appalling to get measurably worse, or we can take \ncorrective action.\n  The American people want us to take corrective action. The American \npeople do not fully understand that it is the Court's decision itself \nthat prevents us from legislative action to impose a limit on the \namount of money as candidates we spend in running for the Congress and \nin other elective offices in America.\n  I believe one of the most important steps we can take to restore \npublic confidence in our political process is to pass the amendment, \nwhich I am proud to cosponsor with my friend and colleague from South \nCarolina, and to give the Congress and to give State legislatures power \nthat they thought that they possessed in the 1970's and to impose \nlimitations on the amount of money that is spent in running for public \noffice.\n  Individuals who want to run for Congress and other elective offices \nought to be able to run on the basis of the ideas that they represent, \nthe vitality that they bring to the process, not as is so often the \ncase, ``Can I raise $3 million or $4 million or $10 million or, in some \ninstances, $20 million?''\n  Unless we can find a way to limit the amount of money spent on \nFederal campaigns and place a greater emphasis on getting support from \nthe people back home that we represent, we will fall short of real \nreform. Any serious reform proposal must start with the constitutional \namendment to allow the States and Congress to craft measures that would \ntake Government out of the pockets of the special interests and back in \nthe hands of the American people who we represent.\n  Mr. President, I am not unmindful of the fact that our task is \ndifficult. Many of our colleagues do not agree. But I must say that as \nI talk with my own constituents, I think there is an overwhelming \ninterest across a broad spectrum, Republican, Democrat, liberal and \nconservative, to do something about this political process that we are \nall a part of.\n  In the Nevada legislature this year there is a proposal that will \nrequire further disclosure on the amount of campaign contributions. \nThat, so far, the Supreme Court has said is legal, and that enjoys \nbipartisan support and is likely to pass overwhelmingly.\n  A ballot proposition on the Nevada ballot this past fall which sought \nto further limit the amounts of individual campaign contributions in \nstatewide and local races passed by 71 percent.\n  I understand if you ask people about things that concern them most in \nlife, they are not going to list campaign finance reform. They are \ninterested in crime, in schools, in drugs, and those kinds of issues, \nwhich I understand. But I have yet to be in an audience of any size in \nwhich you ask people about this system that we are part of, and they do \nnot say, ``I hope that you will do something to reform it. Campaign \nfinance reform is something that you should undertake.'' They \nunderstand, as do each of us in this Chamber, it will not come about \nwithout bipartisan support.\n\n  Mr. President, let me again commend my friend and colleague, who has \nreally been the laboring force on behalf of this constitutional \namendment, for his courage and tenacity and, I think, the wisdom of his \nproposal. I am proud to support in this Congress, as I have previous \nCongresses, such a constitutional amendment.\n  I thank him for his courtesy in allowing me to speak, as I need to \nreturn to a committee hearing.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The distinguished Senator from Nevada made a very \nvaluable contribution to the consideration of this all-important \ninitiative.\n  Our democracy has cancer. It has to be excised. As I explained in my \nopening remarks, and as has been emphasized by the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada, all of these little things that come about--\nwhether you get the money from the State, whether you get the money \nfrom bundling, soft money, hard money, voluntarism, free TV--just go \naround and everybody has an eye on it. But if you put a limit, as the \n1974 act said, of so much per registered voter, then you have stopped, \nonce and for all, that problem, because with disclosure you can see \nexactly what you have on top of the table.\n  I remember in one of the debates we had with the distinguished then-\nSenator from Louisiana, Senator Russell Long, and we both agreed that \nif I appeared, by my disclosure, to get a substantial sum of \ncontributors from the textile industry, call me the textile Senator. \nThere it is. I defend it. I frankly brag about it. If he gets the \ncontributions all from the oil industry and is known as the oil \nSenator, so be it. The distinguished Presiding Officer, the farm \nSenator, the agriculture Senator, because his leading talent has been \nin that field over the years.\n  But by disclosure you can see it, and by the limit you cut out all of \nthe shenanigans of the soft money, hard money, bundling and all of the \nroundabout end course taken to get around the law.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, is absolutely neutral. My friend from \nKentucky, Senator McConnell, who has been the leader in opposition, can \nstill prevail under the amendment. The amendment says Congress is \nauthorized to limit. It does not say limit; it does not say not to \nlimit. It just gives the authority to Congress to act so that when we \ndo get out here, we can have a majority vote so without going through \nthe legal hurdles and delay and put off that we have been going through \nnow for 30 years. That is why I say a constitutional amendment is our \nonly recourse.\n  I got into a debate on this in 1967 when we passed an act. It is now \n1997. We have been trying to get our hands around this problem of \ncampaign finance without a constitutional amendment. Having made the \ngood college try now over the many, many years and listened to all the \nothers, and analyzed as they put up McCain-Feingold and the many other \nfine initiatives, you can look at the Supreme Court, particularly in \nthe Colorado case, not just the Buckley case, and you can say you are \nwasting your time. The voluntarism we know in politics means temporary. \nYou saw this in the race up in Massachusetts. They voluntarily said \nthey would have a limit. They got down to the wire and that limit went \nout of the window.\n  What we are trying to do is give everybody back their freedom of \nspeech. Namely, that I may not be extinguished by money. When I say \nthat I say that advisedly. I know the mechanics of political campaigns, \nand when you have an opponent with $100,000 and I have $1 million, all \nI need do is just lay low. He only has $100,000 and I know that he \nwants to wait until October when the people finally turn their interest \nto the general election in November. Say he is only in print, in polls, \nand what have you, he spent over $25,000 and you cannot get a good poll \nfor less than $26,000 or $27,000, but he only has $50,000 to $75,000 \nleft, and then I let go, come October 10. That is 3 to 4 weeks leading \ninto the campaign, and I have yard signs, billboards, newspapers, TV, \nradio for the farmer in the early morning, I have early morning \ndriving-to-work radio, I have radio for the college students. I know \nhow to tailor make with my million bucks, and I can tell you by \nNovember 1, after 3 weeks of that, my opponent's family has said what \nis the matter? Why are you not answering? Are you not interested \nanymore?\n\n  I have, through wealth, taken away his speech. I know that, you know \nthat, that is the reality, the political game. That is what we are \ntalking about, making it so that you cannot take away that freedom of \nspeech, so that you can reinstill the meaning of the first amendment. \nIt was adult rated by the five-vote majority against the four minority \nin Buckley versus Valeo.\n  We will see what the Court said and go to some of the expressions, \nMr. President. Here is not what politician Hollings said, but what a \nSupreme Court Chief Justice says, ``The Court's result does violence to \nthe intent of\n\n[[Page S2177]]\n\nCongress.'' Can I say that again for all those who are listening? That \nis exactly the belief of this Senator. I am not saying because I need \nmoney or want money or I think I have a financial advantage or whatever \nit is.\n  Incidentally, I can get on to the point of incumbency. We just swore \nin some 15 new Senators about 6 or 8 weeks ago. All my incumbents, \nfriends I used to sit around with, are just about gone. I know it is \nless than 10 years average in the House of Representatives, and I think \nit is exactly that on the Senate side. What did incumbent minority \nassistant leader Senator Wendell Ford of Kentucky say just the day \nbefore yesterday about money? He said, ``I neither have the time nor \nthe inclination to collect that $14,000 to $20,000.'' He has to get $5 \nmillion in Kentucky. I think he mentioned $100,000. But he said ``Look, \nin order to qualify as a candidate, I have to defend my incumbency \nrole, and my incumbency role involves thousands of votes.'' I can say \nto the other side of the aisle, I have been in the game. They are very \nclever. They know how to put up and force-feed votes on very, very, \ncontroversial amendments or subjects.\n  How do you explain in this day and age in a 30-second sound bite, a \nparticular vote? You take 5 minutes, and you can go down to WRC, right \nhere in Washington, with all the money they talk about, or freedom of \nspeech as they call it, with the wealth of Bill Gates, and say I want \nto buy an hour on the eve of the election, the night before the \nelection. They will tell him to bug off, it is not for sale. It is \nlimited. It is paid speech.\n  Free speech--I am trying to reinstill a freedom of speech among those \nwho are financially limited so we make certain that our democracy is \nnot imperiled.\n  I read again what Chief Justice Burger said. ``The Court's result \ndoes violence to the intent of Congress.'' He is exactly right. I was \nthere in 1974.\n\n       In the comprehensive scheme of campaign finance, the \n     Court's result does violence to the intent of Congress. By \n     dissecting bit by bit and casting off vital parts, the Court \n     fails to recognize the whole of this act is greater than the \n     sum of its parts. Congress intended to regulate all aspects \n     of Federal campaign finances but what remains after today's \n     holding leaves no more than a shadow of what Congress \n     contemplated.\n\n  Now, I cannot say it any better. That is exactly what we had in mind, \nto limit the spending. And that is exactly what they did not do. They \nlimited the contributions on the premise that it gave the appearance of \ncorruption, or was corruption itself, but not the expenditures. Let's \nsee what Byron Raymond White, the Associate Justice said:\n\n       Congress was plainly of the view that these expenditures \n     also have corruptive potential, but the Court strikes down \n     the provision, strangely enough, claiming more insight as to \n     what may improperly influence candidates than is possessed by \n     the majority of Congress that passed this bill and the \n     President who signed it. Those supporting the bill undeniably \n     included many seasoned professionals who have been deeply \n     involved in the elective processes and who have viewed them \n     at close range over many years. It would make little sense to \n     me--and apparently made none to Congress--to limit the \n     amounts an individual may give to a candidate or spend with \n     his approval, but fail to limit the amounts that could be \n     spent on his behalf.\n\n  There, again, I could not say it better. That was Justice Byron \nWhite.\n  I quote him further:\n\n       The judgment of Congress was that reasonably effective \n     campaigns could be conducted within the limits established by \n     the act and that the communicative efforts of these campaigns \n     would not seriously suffer. In this posture (section 264 of \n     the case) there is no sound basis for invalidating the \n     expenditure limitations so long as a purpose is served or is \n     legitimately and sufficiently substantial, which, in my view, \n     they are.\n\n  We might get into the debate, Mr. President, about the word \n``reasonable.'' That word appears, if you please, because of the \nsuggestion by the commission on the constitutional system. They wanted \n``reasonable'' limits. I think they were right. I am going back to the \nCourt's decision, trying to aim the gun barrel down the \nconstitutionality of the better constitutional thought in these \ndissenting opinions.\n\n       Expenditure ceilings reinforce the contribution limits and \n     help eradicate the hazard of corruption.\n\n  That is exactly what common sense would indicate. Here is a court \nfinding that expenditures do not contribute at all to any kind of \ncorruption whatsoever and, therefore, spend to the ceilings. We will \nhave a chart here and put it up and show you how, as the Senator from \nNevada said, a Senate race used to be. In 1980, it was about $1 \nmillion. By 1986, it was $2 million. By 1990, it was $3 million. By \n1994, the average one was $4 million. So it keeps going up, up and \naway. Expenditures in the Presidential race are up around $670 million. \nIt has gone through the roof.\n  Now, Mr. President, I will quote further Justice White:\n\n       I have little doubt that, in addition, limiting the total \n     that can be spent will ease the candidate's understandable \n     obsession with fundraising and so free him and his staff to \n     communicate in more places and ways connected with the \n     fundraising function. There is nothing objectionable, and \n     indeed it seems to me a weighty interest in favor of the \n     provision, in the attempt to insulate the political \n     expression of Federal candidates from the influence \n     inevitably exerted by the endless job of raising increasingly \n     large sums of money. I regret that the Court has returned \n     them all to the treadmill.\n\n  Here, this was written 20 years ago. How pathetic. ``Treadmill.'' \nWhen I was first here in the U.S. Senate, from time to time we would \nrearrange the fundraisers in accordance with the schedule that we had. \nYou would not dare go up to a leader on either side of the aisle and \nsay: Mr. Leader, I hope we can get a window, or whatever it is, because \nI have a fundraiser. He would look at you and--if nothing else, I guess \nit was unethical. They ought to refer that to the Ethics Committee. But \nwe have given up on that now. It is like the tail is wagging the dog. \nIt is now turned around, and we schedule the Senate around the \nfundraising schedules--what 20 years ago Justice White called the \ntreadmill. You are just constantly having a fundraiser to get on TV, to \nhave a fundraiser to get on TV, to have a fundraiser to get on TV; all \npaid speech, not free. I haven't seen anything free yet out of that TV \ncrowd. They will charge you for it one way or the other.\n\n  I will quote Justice Marshall, and then I will yield. I see that my \ncolleague is prepared to comment. Justice Marshall said:\n\n       It would appear to follow that the candidate with a \n     substantial personal fortune at his disposal is off to a \n     significant head start. Of course, the less wealthy candidate \n     can potentially overcome the disparity and resources through \n     the contributions from others. But ability to generate \n     contributions may itself depend upon a showing of a financial \n     base for the campaign or some demonstration of preexisting \n     support, which in turn is facilitated by expenditures of \n     substantial personal sums. Thus, the wealthy candidate's \n     immediate access to a substantial personal fortune may give \n     him an initial advantage that his less wealthy opponent can \n     never overcome. And even if the advantage can be overcome, \n     the perception that personal wealth wins elections may not \n     only discourage potential candidates without significant \n     personal wealth from entering the political arena, but also \n     undermine public confidence in the integrity of the electoral \n     process.\n\n  And here we continue and oppose, willy-nilly, any effort, really, to \nexcise this cancer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is a very important debate, which \nI always enjoy with my distinguished colleague from South Carolina, who \nfully admits that the various campaign finance reform bills we have \ntried to pass here in the last few years are unconstitutional. He is \nright, and I commend him for his observation.\n  That having been stated, clearly, the only way you can do the kinds \nof reform bills that have been proposed around here in the last 10 \nyears is to amend the Constitution--amend the first amendment for the \nfirst time in history, to give the Government the power to control the \nspeech of individuals, groups, candidates, and parties. The American \nCivil Liberties Union calls that a recipe for repression. It clearly \nis, and I am happy today that we are finally having the debate on this \namendment, which is indeed a recipe for repression.\n  I see my good friend, the Senator from Kansas, here, who is anxious \nto speak on this. I yield to the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I come to this issue not only as a Member \nof\n\n[[Page S2178]]\n\nthe Senate, but also as a former newspaperman. So when we get to the \nfreedom-of-speech issue, I have some pretty strong feelings. In saying \nthat, I want to make it abundantly clear--very clear--that I do not, in \nany way, question the intent of the supporters, but I do question their \npractical effect.\n  When I was presiding, I listened intently to the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina, whom I respect. I was very interested in \nhis comments with regard to the kind of political debate that he would \nlike to go back to, that I would like to go back to. He calls it a \nstump speech. In South Carolina, it is a stump speech. My wife is from \nSouth Carolina. Many times I have listened to the distinguished \nSenators from South Carolina. It is a privilege to hear them discuss \nthe issues--old-style campaigning and politics, grassroots politics. In \nKansas we call it ``listening tours.'' I had the privilege before \nserving in this body to be in the lower body. I represented 66 \ncounties. I went on a listening tour every August. It took about 5,000 \nmiles and about 3 weeks. That is the old style of discussing the issues \nfor people where they come to the courthouse and the sale barn or the \nRotary Club. And we would discuss the issues. I enjoyed that. The \nSenator from South Carolina is a master. That is why the people \ndoubtless send him back to represent that outstanding State.\n\n  In entering this debate I am reminded that America has been here \nbefore. It seems to me that our task today is a moral and ethical and \nphilosophical exploration of free speech, and its role in the political \naffairs of mankind. It is that serious. It is that encompassing.\n  ``Tyranny, like Hell, is not easily conquered,'' said the patriot \nThomas Paine in ``Common Sense.''\n  This resolution--not the intent, but this resolution--in terms of \npractical effect is tyranny. Adopt it and wonder whether ``Common \nSense'' could exist in our time in terms of public distribution and \ndissemination and understanding.\n  This resolution is tyranny of the worst kind: Government tyranny. \nAdopt it and wonder whether ``The Federalist Papers,'' written by James \nMadison and John Jay to influence voters in New York to adopt a new \nConstitution, could, in fact, exist in our time.\n  Listen carefully to this resolution where Congress and the States are \ngiven unlimited power to set limits. Limits on what? Limits on ``* * * \nthe amount of contributions that may be accepted by, and the amount of \nexpenditures that may be made by, in support of, or in opposition to a \ncandidate for nomination for election to, or for election to * * *'' \nFederal, State, and local offices.\n  Now my colleagues, I urge you. Do not be misled. The debate today is \nnot about elections. It is not about campaign finance reform. We are \nall for that, more especially in regard to public disclosure, as the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina certainly has described in \nhis remarks. It is not about Republicans, or Democrats, or what party \ncontrols the Congress. That is not what it is about.\n  It is, rather, about the most basic right of individuals guaranteed \nby our Constitution--the right of free speech, the right written first, \nthe right without which no other right can long exist.\n  Listen carefully again to the language of the first amendment, which \nwe proposed to change:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \n     abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the \n     right of the people to peaceably assemble, and to petition \n     the government for a redress of grievances.\n\n  My colleagues, those words have magic. They are among the most \nimportant accomplishments of mankind. Democracy is an experiment in \nprogress. Yet, the rights guaranteed in the first amendment have stood \nfor more than 200 years. Seldom have legislative assaults on the first \namendment been so far-reaching and so onerous as the resolution that we \ndebate today.\n  Columnist George Will has called this effort more dangerous than the \ninfamous Alien and Sedition Acts passed in 1798. Those laws placed \nGovernment controls on specific kinds of speech. This resolution \nproposes general Government controls on both the quantity and the \nquality of political speech.\n  The Alien and Sedition Acts were passed by a young country that had \nadopted, but did not fully appreciate, the first amendment rights of \nfree speech. They were passed because some in the Government didn't \nlike what some of its citizens were saying about politicians, politics, \nand Government.\n  Like we are today, some in the Government were worried, of course, \nabout the national security. But it is instructive to note that \nGovernment's attempt to limit free speech is like walking in a swamp--\nyour good intentions are tugged and pulled simply from all sides.\n\n  Abigail Adams, for example, urged passage of the acts to deal with \nBenjamin Franklin Bache. He was an editor who had referred to her \nhusband as ``old, querulous, bald''--I can sympathize with that--\n``blind, crippled, toothless.''\n  He was arrested but died before he could be prosecuted, according to \nhistorians Jean Folkerts and Dwight Teeter in their book, Voices of a \nNation.\n  Twenty-five persons were charged under the sedition laws. Included \nwas one unlucky customer in a Newark tavern who staggered into the \nsunlight to make a negative comment about John Adams' anatomy as the \nPresident's carriage passed by.\n  Only after the rights of American citizens to speak freely were \ntrampled by their Government did our young country come to appreciate \nthe real meaning of the first amendment.\n  James Madison and Thomas Jefferson objected to the attack on free \nspeech with their Virginia and Kentucky resolutions.\n  Madison presented the importance of free speech to democratic \ngovernment. His argument has great relevance to our discussion today as \nhe drew the connection between free speech and elections.\n  ``Let it be recollected, lastly, that the right of electing members \nof the government constitutes more particularly the essence of a free \nand responsible government. The value and efficacy of this right \ndepends on the knowledge of the comparative merits and demerits of the \ncandidates for public trust; and on the equal freedom, consequently of \nexamining and discussing these merits and demerits of the candidates \nrespectively.''\n  That is the essence of free political speech. That is the essence of \nthe philosophy advanced by the great philosophers like John Milton, \nJohn Locke, John Stuart Mill: The consent of a marketplace of ideas \nbased on unfettered speech and thought.\n  Mill argued that people could trade their false notions for true ones \nonly if they could hear the true ones. And he denounced all government \nattempts to censure expression.\n  One of America's great jurists, Louis Brandeis, warned us to ``be \nmost on guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are \nbeneficent * * *''\n  We could substitute ``reform'' for ``beneficent.''\n  ``* * * the greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious \nencroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.''\n  Well, the advocates of this resolution want us to believe that the \nneed for Congress to limit campaign spending is so great that the first \namendment's rights are secondary. Well, first let me lay to rest any \nnotion that virtually everybody in this distinguished body is somehow \nagainst campaign reform. It is the definition of campaign reform in the \npractical effect that is exceedingly important. But the proponents of \nthis legislation further argue that limits on campaign spending are \nreally not limits on speech at all. I think that is the point that was \nmade by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n  The Supreme Court, in its Buckley decision, dispensed with that \nargument in this way: Yes. It was a 5-to-4 vote. Yes. I know it is \ncontroversial. But listen.\n  ``A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on \npolitical communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the \nquantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, \nthe depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.\n  I can go to 66 counties or 105 counties in Kansas, and I can meet \nwith every\n\n[[Page S2179]]\n\nfarmer, businessman, any member of a civic group, and I can discuss the \nissues. And when I am done, I have probably touched 1 percent of the \npopulace.\n  This decision by the Supreme Court certainly applies.\n  ``This is because,'' and I am quoting again, ``virtually every means \nof communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure \nof money.''\n  I wish it was not so but that is the case.\n  ``The distribution of the humblest handbill or leaflet entails \nprinting, paper, and circulation costs. Speeches and rallies generally \nnecessitate hiring a hall and publicizing the event.''\n  ``The electorate's increasing dependence on television, radio''--and \nI am quoting again from the Buckley decision--``and other mass media \nfor news and information has made these expensive modes of \ncommunication indispensable instruments of effective political \nspeech.''\n  Now, in Kansas, Mr. President, a full-page advertisement in the \nTopeka Capital Journal costs $4,400. One 30-second television ad to \nreach across the State costs more than $33,000. Too much? Well, I would \nthink it would be too much. Of course, if you are the publisher of the \nCapital Journal, or the advertising manager, or the same in regard to \nthe TV station and you look at your costs and the comparative costs of \nwhat is happening in today's mass communications, it might not be too \nmuch. That is the going rate. I do not think we can legislate that \nrate. Even speech via the Internet or the Postal Service requires the \nspending of resources.\n  Now, suppose we adopt this resolution and that it is ratified by the \nStates. What will we tell the Kansas business owner who wishes to \npetition his Government either for a redress of any kind of a grievance \nor to criticize a candidate or to urge the election of another \ncandidate? Will we say that free political speech is only a half-page \nof advertisement? In our infinite wisdom as incumbents in office, will \nwe say free speech only applies to 15 seconds at one TV station?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would be delighted to yield to the distinguished \nSenator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reading from the Hollings amendment, it says, ``A \nState''--this is referring to the power given to the States. Same power \nto the Federal Government. ``A State shall have the power to set \nreasonable limits.'' I say to my good friend, the Senator from Kansas, \nput another way, the Government would decide how much speech is \nreasonable. Is that the interpretation of my good friend?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. The incumbents of the Government, whether it be State, I \nsuppose county, or in the Congress of the United States, would decide \nwhat is appropriate in terms of spending limits not only for themselves \nbut for their challengers.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would be delighted to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So it would not be inconceivable then that all of us \nin the Senate and House might decide that what is a reasonable amount \nof speech for a challenger could be $5,000 in the next election.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. That might be a little harsh.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We have total power to do that under the amendment.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my good friend from Kansas, if the candidates \nin the next election in a typical race were limited to spending $5,000, \nwho does my good friend from Kansas think would win?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I think probably the incumbent would have an edge.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Just might. So the Government here has the power to \ndetermine how much speech there may be. I thank my good friend from \nKansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his contribution \nand his leadership.\n  If this resolution is adopted, what will we tell the local citizens \ngroup working to elect a new mayor or a city council? Will we say that \nfree speech extends no further than the classified advertisements? \nRemember, we have full-page ads costing x and we have 30-second \ntelevision ads costing x but you put a limit on it: Sorry, no TV. Maybe \nit will get on the news, maybe not.\n  The Supreme Court in Buckley put it this way: ``Being free to engage \nin unlimited public expression subject to a ceiling on expenditures is \nlike being free to drive an automobile as far and as often as one \ndesires on a single tank of gasoline.'' You can't get there from here \nto Kansas on a single tank of gasoline--whether it is traveling the \nState or in regards to any kind of expression in regard to any kind of \npolitics or any kind of campaigning.\n  The tyranny of this resolution, like tyranny forever, is based on a \nfalse assumption that somehow we have too much, too much political \nspeech and it should be limited. How much political speech in a \ndemocracy is too much?\n  Last year, millions of Americans gave $2.6 billion to fill 476 \noffices. Again, columnist George Will points out they still had enough \nleft over to spend $4.5 billion on potato chips. We spent more on \nyogurt in this year than we spent on political discourse, discussing \nthe great issues of the day. Or put another way, one Super Bowl ad \ncould finance two campaigns for Congress. One Super Bowl ad, 2\\1/2\\ \ndistricts in the Congress. How much is enough? I submit we need more \npolitical speech, not less. And further, what will be the chilling \nimpact of this resolution on citizen involvement in the election and \nthe governmental process?\n  The Senator from Nevada said people are sick and tired of politics \nand business as usual and they are not choosing to vote. I submit it is \nnot because we need to give more power to the Federal Election \nCommission and limit political debate. The problem is, in my view, that \ntoo many candidates do not speak out on the issues in candor and say \nthey are for something that identifies with the individual who is going \nto vote.\n  Our democracy survives solely on the consent of the governed. That is \npretty basic. That consent is given as long as the governed have \nconfidence in the men and women they elect to public office.\n  We have in place a number of filters through which candidates must be \nsifted to ensure those who survive receive a consensus. These filters \ngive the electorate opportunities to eliminate candidates, many \ncandidates who aspire to public office but quite frankly, judged in the \neyes of the public, are not serious candidates, they sift out those who \ncannot attract a consensus. We do this in order that our form of \ngovernment can so long exist.\n  I want to ask the question. There is a feeling here in this body that \nSenators feel put upon that they have to sit, hopefully in another \noffice, and raise campaign funds. My word, what a terrible chore. What \na condescending, elitist point of view, that we should be free of \nasking people for their trust and their support, their investment in \ngood government, their partnership in good faith so we can shine the \nlight of truth in the darkness and discuss these issues free from that \nterrible burden. What a terrible burden.\n  Is a candidate's ability to attract campaign funds--let me repeat \nthis. Is a candidate's ability to attract campaign funds any less \nimportant to this process than his or her ability to attract votes? How \ncan a candidate expect to get the consent of the governed if he or she \ncannot attract their support in funds to wage a campaign?\n  Make no mistake. Our debate today is important. It is about freedom. \nSaid the distinguished Hugo Black: ``There are grim reminders all \naround this world that the distance between individual liberty and \nfiring squads is not always as far as it seems.''\n  The great men and women who debated this issue before us arrived at a \nsimple but eloquent conclusion--to limit political speech is to limit \nand lose freedom. We are called again to reach this same conclusion. I \nurge rejection of the resolution. Said the statesman George Mason: ``No \nfree Government, or the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any \npeople, but by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles.''\n  First amendment freedoms are fundamental principles. Let us preserve \nthe blessings of liberty.\n  I thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from\n\n[[Page S2180]]\n\nKansas for an excellent speech. I ask him if he has just one more \nmoment here before he leaves the floor?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I will be delighted to respond.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Kansas, in looking at the \nHollings amendment, in addition to giving to the Government the power \nto control the speech of candidates, as we just discussed in our \nearlier colloquy, which could be, presumably, $5,000, which would \ncertainly guarantee the election of every incumbent, I would also ask \nmy good friend how he would interpret the following power given to the \nGovernment. It says the Government could limit the amount of \nexpenditures that may be made ``by''--I assume that is the candidate--\n``in support of the candidate, or in opposition to the candidate.''\n  Now, let me ask my good friend from Kansas, since we would be making \nthe rules here in Congress, and since we would be given the permission \nto make these rules since this is an amendment to the first amendment \nof the Constitution of the United States for the first time in history, \nI ask my good friend from Kansas, might it not be a shrewd move on the \npart of all incumbents to say that those in support of or in opposition \nto a candidate cannot speak at all?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I really had not thought of that proposal because it is \nso farfetched from democracy as we know it and participation in the \nelection process as we know it. It could happen. It could happen. I \nhave confidence it would not happen, but, then, one never knows.\n  Could I ask the distinguished Senator a question? And that is this: \nRight now, in the campaign process, we have regular contributions. As \nthe distinguished Senator from South Carolina has pointed out, there \nare limits in terms of giving; in terms of individuals it is $1,000 an \nindividual, et cetera. And he uses that as a reference point from which \nto control the total spending.\n  But in the real world, what we have found, more specifically in this \nlast election cycle, those regular contributions are reported. If there \nis one thing I agree very strongly with the Senator from South Carolina \non, it is we need full public disclosure. He referred to Steve Forbes. \nAs a matter of fact, he was very candid with regard to Mr. Forbes' \ncandidacy, and what happened to my dear friend and former senior \nSenator from Kansas, Bob Dole, in his campaign. So, public disclosure, \nI think, is very important. I think the American people are six jumps \nahead of the whole process. If they discover where the money comes from \nand the amount of money spent, they make the appropriate decision.\n  But we have other contributions. We have independent expenditures, \nand in the Colorado case it is very clear where the court is. So here \nis the challenger and the incumbent limited in terms of spending, and \nthen in comes a ``independent expenditure,'' which we all know in some \ncases are not quite so independent.\n  Then, second, we have other expenditures. They are called \n``educational ads.''\n  How on Earth do we control those expenditures with the campaign \nlimits envisioned in many of the alleged campaign reform bills? I can \ntell you, we have colleagues who subscribe to State campaign limits, \nonly to find we have these other contributions coming in, these other \nexpenditures, and, frankly, they were beaten about the head and \nshoulders so much in the last part of the campaign, they had to violate \nthat campaign limit or they would have been defeated, paying a fine, \nfilling out paperwork. It is a very unfair system. I do not see \nanything in this particular endeavor that would prevent that.\n  That is a long question for the Senator to answer.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Kansas, most of us in \nthe political arena do not like independent expenditures. But the court \nhas made it quite clear that it is constitutionally protected speech. \nNo matter how much we do not like it when people criticize us, these \nindividuals and groups have a constitutional right to engage in these \nindependent expenditures. As a result of the Colorado case, parties do \nas well.\n\n  In looking at the Hollings amendment, it seems to me that Congress \nwould be given the power to completely shut up these groups. They could \nsay, ``No longer can you speak at all.'' That way, we would be able to \nsilence all of these people who do not like what we stand for, \ntotally--totally--under this. If Congress is given the power to control \nthe amount of expenditures that may be made ``by''--I assume that is \nthe candidate--``in support of,'' referring to outside groups, or ``in \nopposition to,'' referring to outside groups, why, by golly, under this \namendment we could shut them up entirely. Our lives would be a lot \neasier. We could just limit spending in the campaign to about $5,000, \neliminate all the speech of these outside groups. Boy, you would never \nhave any turnover here, would you?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If I could ask one other question of the Senator, I \nthink an additional two questions that people should be asking are: Who \ndecides? Who decides what the limit is?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We do.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. That is the incumbency, with all due respect. And \nsecond, who is going to enforce all this? We are going to need a SWAT \nteam down at the Federal Election Commission.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I may say to my friend, I often say the FEC would \nsoon be the size of the rest of the administration. There would be \nbattalions of auditors and lawyers crawling all over the books, not \njust of candidates for public office but every organized group out in \nAmerica seeking to express itself in the course of the campaign. They \nwould be crawling all over them. Let some little group in Kansas utter \na peep in the next race against Senator Roberts, and the FEC could come \ndown on them like a house of bricks saying, ``Shut up. Congress has \nsaid you don't get to speak. You don't get to say how you feel in the \nelection--or any other time. Shut up.''\n  All of that is possible under this amendment, to amend the first \namendment for the first time in history, to give this Congress the \npower to quiet the voices; quiet the voices, not just of Members of \nCongress and the people who may oppose them, but anybody else who may \noppose it, any individual, any group, anybody. We could shut them all \nup. And in what way would America be better for that?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator for his contribution and again would \nonly summarize by saying that we could get at much of the problem here \nwith real campaign reform legislation that centers on public \ndisclosure. I repeat my remarks that I think the American people are \nsix jumps ahead of the process here. It has been my experience, if they \nknow how much money is being spent and where the money is coming from, \nthey make a pretty good decision. Candidates cannot--well, in some \ncases it might work --but in most cases they cannot buy elections. It \nworks against them. I will put my money on the free press and free \nspeech and public disclosure, and I urge rejection of this resolution.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, once again I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas for an outstanding speech. I appreciate his \ncontribution to this debate.\n  The question before us, as I have said, as we all know, is whether to \namend the first amendment for the first time in history to give to the \nGovernment the power to control the political discourse in this country \nacross the board; the political speech of candidates, political speech \nof individuals, the political speech of groups--all of this, because we \nhave concluded that there is too much political discourse in this \ncountry.\n  Senator Roberts mentioned, and others are familiar with, some of the \nstatistics. Of all the commercials run in the previous year, 1 percent \nof them were about politics; 1 percent of them. The notion that we have \nan excessive amount of political discussion in this country is absurd \non its face. It is absurd on its face.\n  The good thing about the debate that we are having is it is an honest \ndebate. The Hollings amendment concedes that there is very little you \ncan do, consistent with the first amendment, in the campaign finance \nreform field that the Supreme Court will not strike down. The measure \nmost commonly referred to by the reformers, the McCain-Feingold \nproposal, is unconstitutional at least 12 different ways. It would be \ndead on arrival in the Federal courts.\n\n[[Page S2181]]\n\n At least this debate helps sum up what is really needed if Senators \nbelieve that there is too much political discussion in our country.\n  It should not be surprising, Mr. President, that this amendment has \nalmost no constituents. Common Cause, the group most often thought of \nwhen you think of the subject of campaign finance reform, opposes this \nconstitutional amendment. The Washington Post, which writes a story on \nthese kinds of issues virtually daily, opposes this amendment. The New \nYork Times opposes this amendment. The American Civil Liberties Union \nopposes this amendment.\n  In short, even the proponents of some kind of effort to restrict the \nspeech of people who are involved in the American political process \nlook at this particular effort to carve a big hunk out of the first \namendment for the first time in history as an overreaching and ill-\nadvised step in the wrong direction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter I received from the ACLU dated March 6, 1997, in opposition \nto the constitutional amendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n\n                                   Washington National Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: The American Civil Liberties Union strongly \n     opposes S.J. Res. 18, the proposed constitutional amendment \n     that permits Congress and the states to enact laws regulating \n     federal campaign expenditures and contributions.\n       Whatever one's position may be on campaign finance reform \n     and how best to achieve it, a constitutional amendment of the \n     kind here proposed is not the solution. Amending the First \n     Amendment for the first time in our history in the way that \n     S.J. Res. 18 proposes would challenge all pre-existing First \n     Amendment jurisprudence and would give to Congress and the \n     states unprecedented, sweeping and undefined authority to \n     restrict speech protected by the First Amendment since 1791.\n       Because it is vague and over-broad, S.J. Res. 18 would give \n     Congress a virtual ``blank check'' to enact any legislation \n     that may abridge a vast array of free speech and free \n     association rights that we now enjoy. In addition, this \n     measure should be opposed because it provides no guarantee \n     that Congress or the states will have the political will, \n     after the amendment's adoption, to enact legislation that \n     will correct the problems in our current electoral system. \n     This amendment misleads the American people because it tells \n     them that only if they sacrifice their First Amendment \n     rights, will Congress correct the problems in our system. Not \n     only is this too high a price to demand in the name of \n     reform, it is unwise to promise the American people such an \n     unlikely outcome.\n       Rather than assuring that the electoral processes will be \n     improved, a constitutional amendment merely places new state \n     and federal campaign finance law beyond the reach of First \n     Amendment jurisprudence. All Congress and the states would \n     have to demonstrate is that its laws were ``reasonable.'' \n     ``Reasonable'' laws do not necessarily solve the problems of \n     those who are harmed by or locked out of the electoral \n     process on the basis of their third party status, lack of \n     wealth or non-incumbency. The First Amendment properly \n     prevents the government from being arbitrary when making \n     these distinctions, but S.J. Res. 18 would enable the \n     Congress to set limitations on expenditures and contributions \n     notwithstanding current constitutional understandings.\n       Once S.J. Res. 18 is adopted, Congress and local \n     governments could easily further distort the political \n     process in numerous ways. Congress and state governments \n     could pass new laws that operate to the detriment of dark-\n     horse and third party candidates. For example, with the \n     intention of creating a ``level playing field'' Congress \n     could establish equal contribution and expenditure limits \n     that would ultimately operate to the benefit of incumbents \n     who generally have a higher name recognition than their \n     opponents, and who are often able to do more with less \n     funding. Thus, rather than assure fair and free elections, \n     the proposal would enable those in power to perpetuate their \n     own power and incumbency advantage to the disadvantage of \n     those who would challenge the status quo.\n       S.J. Res. 18 would also give Congress and every state \n     legislature the power, heretofore denied by the First \n     Amendment, to regulate the most protected function of the \n     press--editorializing. Print outlets such as newspapers and \n     magazines, broadcasters, Internet publishers and cable \n     operators would be vulnerable to severe regulation of \n     editorial content by the government. A candidate-centered \n     editorial, as well as op-ed articles or commentary printed at \n     the publisher's expense are more certainly expenditures in \n     support of or in opposition to particular political \n     candidates. The amendment, as its words make apparent, would \n     authorize Congress to set reasonable limits on the \n     expenditures by the media during campaigns, when not strictly \n     reporting the news. Such a result would be intolerable in a \n     society that cherishes the free press.\n       Even if Congress exempted the press from the amendment, \n     what rational basis would it use to distinguish between \n     certain kinds of speech? For example, why would it be \n     justified for Congress to allow a newspaper publisher to run \n     unlimited editorials on behalf of a candidate, but to make it \n     unlawful for a wealthy individual to purchase an unlimited \n     number of billboards for the same candidate? Likewise, why \n     would it be permissible for a major weekly news magazine to \n     run an unlimited number of editorials opposing a candidate, \n     but impermissible for the candidate or his supporters to \n     raise or spend enough money to purchase advertisements in the \n     same publication? At what point is a journal or magazine that \n     is published by an advocacy group different from a major \n     daily newspaper, when it comes to the endorsement of \n     candidates for federal office? Should one type of media \n     outlet be given broader free expression privileges than the \n     other? Should national media outlets have to abide by fifty \n     different state and local standards for expenditures? These \n     are questions that Congress has not adequately addressed or \n     answered.\n       Moreover, the proposed amendment appears to reach not only \n     expenditures by candidates or their agents but also the truly \n     independent expenditures by individual citizens and groups--\n     the very kind of speech that the First Amendment was designed \n     to protect.\n       If Congress or the states want to change our campaign \n     finance system, then it need not throw out the First \n     Amendment in order to do so. Congress can adopt meaningful \n     federal campaign finance reform measures without abrogating \n     the First Amendment and without contravening the Supreme \n     Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo. Some of these reform \n     measures include: public financing for all legally qualified \n     candidates--financing that serves as a floor, not a ceiling \n     for campaign expenditures; extending the franking privilege \n     to all legally qualified candidates; providing assistance in \n     some form for broadcast advertising through vouchers or \n     reduced advertising rates; improving the resources for the \n     FEC so that it can provide timely disclosure of contributions \n     and expenditures; and providing vouchers for travel.\n       Rather than argue for these proposals, many members of \n     Congress continue to propose unconstitutional measures, such \n     as the McCain/Feingold bill that are limit-driven methods of \n     campaign finance reform that place campaign regulation on a \n     collision course with the First Amendment. Before Senators \n     vote to eliminate certain first Amendment rights, the ACLU \n     urges the Congress to consider other legislative options, and \n     to give these alternatives its considered review through the \n     hearing process.\n       The ACLU urges Senators to oppose S.J. Res. 18.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Laura W. Murphy.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Also, I ask unanimous consent that a Washington Post \neditorial of Monday, December 2, 1996, in opposition to the \nconstitutional amendment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Wrong Way on Campaign Finance\n\n       Campaign finance reform is hard in part because it so \n     quickly bumps up against the First Amendment. To keep offices \n     and officeholders from being bought, proponents seek to limit \n     what candidates for office can raise and spend. That's \n     reasonable enough, except that the Supreme Court has ruled--\n     we think correctly--that the giving and spending of campaign \n     funds is a form of political speech, and the Constitution is \n     pretty explicit about that sort of thing. ``Congress shall \n     make no law * * * abridging the freedom of speech'' is the \n     majestic sentence. So however laudable the goal, you end up \n     having to regulate lightly and indirectly in this area, which \n     means you are almost bound to achieve an imperfect result.\n       As a way out of this dilemma, Senate Minority Leader Tom \n     Daschle added his name the other day to the list of those who \n     say the Constitution should be amended to permit the \n     regulation of campaign spending. He wasn't just trying to \n     duck the issue by raising it to a higher level as some would-\n     be amenders have in the past. Rather, his argument is that \n     you can't win the war without the weapons, which in the case \n     of campaign finance means the power not just to create \n     incentives to limit spending but to impose spending limits \n     directly.\n       But that's what everyone who wants to put an asterisk after \n     the First Amendment says: We have a war to fight that we can \n     win only if given the power to suppress. It's a terrible \n     precedent even if in a virtuous cause, and of course, it is \n     always in a virtuous cause. The people who want a flag-\n     burning amendment think of themselves as defenders of civic \n     virtue too. These amendments are always for the one cause \n     only. Just this once, the supporters say. But having punched \n     the one hole, you make it impossible to argue on principle \n     against punching the next. The question becomes not whether \n     you have exceptions to the free speech clause, but which \n     ones?\n       Nor is it clear that an amendment would solve the problem. \n     It would offer a means but not the will. The system we have \n     is a system\n\n[[Page S2182]]\n\n     that benefits incumbents. That's one of the reasons we \n     continue to have it, and future incumbents are no more likely \n     to want to junk it than is the current crop.\n       The campaign finance issue tends to wax and wane, depending \n     on how obscene the fund-raising was, or seemed, in the last \n     election. The last election being what it was, Congress is \n     under a fair amount of pressure to toughen the law. The \n     Democrats doubtless feel it most, thanks to the revelations \n     of suspect fund-raising on the part of the president's \n     campaign, though the Republicans have their own sins to \n     answer for--not least their long record of resistance to \n     reform. with all respect to Mr. Daschle, a constitutional \n     amendment will solve none of this.\n       The American political system is never going to be \n     sanitized nor, given the civic cost of the regulations that \n     would be required (even assuming that a definition of the \n     sanitary state could be agreed upon), should that be anyone's \n     goal. Rather, the goal should be simply to moderate the role \n     of money in determining elections and of course the policies \n     to which the elections lead. The right approach remains the \n     same: Give candidates some of the money they need to run, but \n     exact in return a promise to limit their spending. And then \n     enforce the promise. Private money would still be spent, but \n     at a genuine and greater distance from the candidates \n     themselves. It wouldn't be a perfect world, and that would be \n     its virtue as well as a flaw.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Roberts referred to the recent George Will \ncolumn entitled ``Government Gag,'' which appeared in the Washington \nPost of February 13, 1997. I ask unanimous consent that that also be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                             Government Gag\n\n       To promote the fair and effective functioning of the \n     democratic process, Congress, with respect to elections for \n     federal office, and States, for all other elections, \n     including initiatives and referenda, may adopt reasonable \n     regulations of funds expended, including contributions, to \n     influence the outcome of elections, provided that such \n     regulations do not impair the right of the public to a full \n     and free discussion of all issues and do not prevent any \n     candidate for elected office from amassing the resources \n     necessary for effective advocacy.\n       Such governments may reasonably define which expenditures \n     are deemed to be for the purpose of influencing elections, so \n     long as such definition does not interfere with the right of \n     the people fully to debate issues.\n       No regulation adopted under this authority may regulate the \n     content of any expression of opinion or communication.--\n     Proposed amendment to the Constitution\n       Like the imperturbable Sir Francis Drake, who did not allow \n     the Spanish Armada's arrival off England to interrupt a game \n     of bowling, supposed friends of the First Amendment are \n     showing notable sang-froid in the face of ominous \n     developments. Freedom of speech is today under more serious \n     attack than at any time in at least the last 199 years--since \n     enactment of the Alien and Sedition Acts. Actually, today's \n     threat, launched in the name of political hygiene, is graver \n     than that posed by those acts, for three reasons.\n       First, the 1798 acts, by which Federalists attempted to \n     suppress criticism of the government they then controlled, \n     were bound to perish with fluctuations in the balance of \n     partisan forces. Today's attack on free speech advances under \n     a bland bipartisan banner of cleanliness.\n       Second, the 1798 acts restricted certain categories of \n     political speech and activities, defined, albeit quite \n     broadly, by content and objectives. Today's enemies of the \n     First Amendment aim to abridge the right of free political \n     speech generally. It is not any particular content but the \n     quantity of political speech they find objectionable.\n       Third, the 1798 acts had expiration dates and were allowed \n     to expire. However, if today's speech-restrictors put in \n     place their structure of restriction (see above), its anti-\n     constitutional premise and program probably will be \n     permanent.\n       Its premise is that Americans engage in too much \n     communication of political advocacy, and that government--\n     that is, incumbents in elective offices--should be trusted to \n     decide and enforce the correct amount. This attempt to put \n     the exercise of the most elemental civil right under \n     government regulation is the most fundamental principle of \n     the nation's Founders.\n       The principle is that limited government must be limited \n     especially severely concerning regulation of the rights most \n     essential to an open society. Thus the First Amendment says \n     ``Congress shall make no law * * * abridging the freedom of \n     speech,'' not ``Congress may abridge the freedom of speech \n     with such laws as Congress considers reasonable.''\n       The text of the proposed amendment comes from Rep. Richard \n     Gephardt, House minority leader, who has the courage of his \n     alarming convictions when he says: ``What we have is two \n     important values in conflict: freedom of speech and our \n     desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy. You \n     can't have both.''\n       However, he also says: ``I know this is a serious step to \n     amend the First Amendment. * * * But * * * this is not an \n     effort to diminish free speech.'' Nonsense. Otherwise \n     Gephardt would not acknowledge that the First Amendment is \n     an impediment.\n       The reformers' problem is the Supreme Court, which has \n     affirmed the obvious: Restrictions on the means of making \n     speech heard, including spending for the dissemination of \n     political advocacy, are restrictions on speech. It would be \n     absurd to say, for example: ``Congress shall make no law \n     abridging the right to place one's views before the public in \n     advertisements or on billboards but Congress can abridge--\n     reasonably, of course--the right to spend for such things.''\n       Insincerity oozes from the text of the proposed amendment. \n     When Congress, emancipated from the First Amendment's \n     restrictions, weaves its web of restraints on political \n     communication, it will do so to promote its understanding of \n     what is the ``fair'' and ``effective'' functioning of \n     democracy, and ``effective'' advocacy. Yet all this \n     regulation will be consistent with ``the right of the people \n     fully to debate issues,'' and with ``full and free discussion \n     of all issues''--as the political class chooses to define \n     ``full'' and ``free'' and the ``issues.''\n       In 1588 England was saved not just by Drake but by luck--\n     the ``Protestant wind'' that dispersed the Armada. Perhaps \n     today the strangely silent friends of freedom--why are not \n     editorial pages erupting against the proposed vandalism \n     against the Bill of Rights?--are counting on some similar \n     intervention to forestall today's ``reformers,'' who aim not \n     just to water the wine of freedom but to regulate the \n     consumption of free speech.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a couple of years ago, George Will, in \nhis Newsweek column, wrote an article in opposition to the \nconstitutional amendment. The headline is, ``So, We Talk Too Much?''\n\n       The Supreme Court's two-word opinion of the Senate's reform \n     bill may be, ``Good grief.''\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that that also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, June 28, 1993]\n\n                         So, We Talk Too Much?\n\n                            (By George Will)\n\n       Washington's political class and its journalistic echoes \n     are celebrating Senate passage, on a mostly party-line vote, \n     of a ``reform'' that constitutes the boldest attack on \n     freedom of speech since enactment of the Alien and Sedition \n     Acts of 1798. The campaign finance bill would ration \n     political speech. Fortunately, it is so flagrantly \n     unconstitutional that the Supreme Court will fling it back \n     across First Street, N.E., with a two-word opinion: ``Good \n     grief!''\n       The reformers begin, as their ilk usually does, with a \n     thumping but unargued certitude: campaigns involve ``too \n     much'' money. (In 1992 congressional races involved a sum \n     equal to 40 percent of what Americans spent on yogurt. Given \n     the government's increasing intrusiveness and capacity to do \n     harm, it is arguable that we spend too little on the \n     dissemination of political discourse.) But reformers eager to \n     limit spending have a problem: mandatory spending limits are \n     unconstitutional. The Supreme Court acknowledges that the \n     First Amendment protects ``the indispensable conditions for \n     meaningful communication,'' which includes spending for the \n     dissemination of speech. The reformers' impossible task is to \n     gin up ``incentives'' powerful enough to coerce candidates \n     into accepting limits that can be labeled ``voluntary.''\n       The Senate bill's original incentive was public financing, \n     coupled with various punishments for privately financed \n     candidates who choose not to sell their First Amendment \n     rights for taxpayers' dollars and who exceed the government's \n     stipulated ration of permissible spending/speech. Most \n     taxpayers detest public financing. (``Food stamps for \n     politicians,'' says Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky \n     Republican who will lead the constitutional challenge if \n     anything like this bill becomes law.) So the bill was \n     changed--and made even more grossly unconstitutional. Now it \n     limits public funding to candidates whose opponents spend/\n     speak in excess of government limits. The funds for the \n     subsidy are to come from taxing, at the top corporate rate, \n     all contributions to the candidate who has chosen to exercise \n     his free speech rights with private funding. So 35 percent of \n     people's contributions to a privately funded candidate would \n     be expropriated and given to his opponent. This is part of \n     the punishment system designed to produce ``voluntary'' \n     acceptance of spending limits.\n       But the Court says the government cannot require people \n     ``to pay a tax for the exercise of that which the First \n     Amendment has made a high constitutional privilege.'' The \n     Court says that the ``power to tax the exercise of a right is \n     the power to control or suppress the exercise of its \n     enjoyment'' and is ``as potent as the power of \n     censorship.''\n       Sen. Fritz Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat, is a \n     passionate advocate of spending limits but at least has the \n     gumption to attack the First Amendment frontally. The Senate \n     bill amounts, he says candidly, to ``coercing people to \n     accept spending limits while pretending it is voluntary.'' \n     Because ``everyone knows what we are doing is \n     unconstitutional,'' he proposes to make coercion \n     constitutional. He would withdraw First\n\n[[Page S2183]]\n\n     Amendment protection from the most important speech--\n     political discourse. And the Senate has adopted (52-43) his \n     resolution urging Congress to send to the states this \n     constitutional amendment: Congress and the states `'shall \n     have power to set reasonable limits on campaign expenditures \n     by, in support of, or in opposition to any candidate in any \n     primary or other election'' for federal, state or local \n     office.\n       Hollings claims--you have to admire his brass--that carving \n     this huge hole in the First Amendment would be ``a big boost \n     to free speech.'' But by ``free'' he means ``fair,'' and by \n     ``fair'' he means equal amounts of speech--the permissible \n     amounts to be decided by incumbents in Congress and state \n     legislatures. Note also the power to limit spending not only \n     ``by'' but even ``in support of, or in opposition to'' \n     candidates. The 52 senators who voted for this included many \n     who three years ago stoutly (and rightly) opposed carving out \n     even a small exception to First Amendment protections in \n     order to ban flag-burning. But now these incumbents want to \n     empower incumbents to hack away at the Bill of Rights in \n     order to shrink the permissible amount of political \n     discourse.\n       Government micromanagement: The Senate bill would ban or \n     limit spending by political action committees. It would \n     require privately funded candidates to say in their broadcast \n     advertisements that ``the candidate has not agreed to \n     voluntary campaign limits.'' (This speech regulation is \n     grossly unconstitutional because it favors a particular point \n     of view, and because the Court has held that the First \n     Amendment protects the freedom to choose ``both what to say \n     and what not to say.'') All this government micromanagement \n     of political speech is supposed to usher in the reign of \n     ``fairness (as incumbents define it, of course).\n       Incumbents can live happily with spending limits. \n     Incumbents will write the limits, perhaps not altogether \n     altruistically. And spending is the way challengers can \n     combat incumbents' advantages such as name recognition, \n     access to media and franked mail. Besides, the most important \n     and plentiful money spent for political purposes is dispensed \n     entirely by incumbents. It is called the federal budget--$1.5 \n     trillion this year and rising. Federal spending (along with \n     myriad regulations and subsidizing activities such as \n     protectionist measures) often is vote-buying.\n       It is instructive that when the Senate voted to empower \n     government to ration political speech, and even endorse \n     amending the First Amendment, there was no outcry from \n     journalists. Most of them are liberals and so are disposed to \n     like government regulation of (other people's) lives. \n     Besides, journalists know that government rationing of \n     political speech by candidates will enlarge the importance of \n     journalists' unlimited speech.\n       The Senate bill's premise is that there is ``too much'' \n     political speech and some is by undesirable elements (PACs), \n     so government control is needed to make the nation's \n     political speech healthier. Our governments cannot balance \n     their budgets or even suppress the gunfire in America's \n     (potholed) streets. It would be seemly if politicians would \n     get on with such basic tasks, rather than with the mischief \n     of making mincemeat of the First Amendment.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Finally, Mr. President, in terms of insertions into \nthe Record, I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated March 12, by \nCommon Cause, opposing the constitutional amendment which is before us, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 Common Cause,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: The Senate is expected to vote later this \n     week on a proposed constitutional amendment to provide \n     Congress with the ability to impose mandatory limits on \n     campaign spending, thus overriding a portion of the Supreme \n     Court's 1976 decision in Buckley versus Valeo.\n       Common Cause opposes the constitutional amendment because \n     it will serve as a diversionary tactic that could prevent \n     Congress from passing campaign finance reform this year. We \n     believe that a constitutional amendment is not necessary in \n     order to achieve meaningful and comprehensive reform.\n       Under existing Supreme Court doctrine, Congress has \n     significant scope to enact tough and effective campaign \n     finance reform consistent with the Court's interpretation of \n     the First Amendment in Buckley.\n       The McCain-Feingold bill, S.25, provides for significant \n     reform within the framework of the Buckley decision. The \n     legislation would: ban soft money; provide reduced postage \n     rates and free or reduced cost television time as incentives \n     for congressional candidates to agree to restrain their \n     spending; close loopholes related to independent expenditures \n     and campaign ads that masquerade as ``issue advocacy''; \n     reduce the influence of special-interest political action \n     committee (PAC) money; strengthen disclosure and enforcement.\n       A recent letter to Senators McCain and Feingold from \n     constitutional scholar Burt Neuborne, the Legal Director of \n     the Brennan Center for Justice and a past National Legal \n     Director of the ACLU, sets forth the case that the McCain-\n     Feingold bill is constitutional. Professor Neuborne finds \n     that the key provisions of the bill are within the Court's \n     existing interpretation of the First Amendment, and he thus \n     demonstrates that a constitutional amendment is not necessary \n     to enact reform.\n       Professor Neuborne concludes that the voluntary spending \n     limits the McCain-Feingold bill are consistent with the \n     Supreme Court's ruling in Buckley. He further concludes that \n     ``Congress possesses clear power to close the soft money \n     loophole by restricting the source and size of contributions \n     to political parties. . . .'' He also concludes that efforts \n     to close loopholes relating to independent expenditures and \n     so-called ``issue ads'' are also within Congress' existing \n     authority.\n       It is, therefore, not necessary to amend the Constitution \n     in order to enact meaningful campaign finance reform. \n     Congress has the power, consistent with the First Amendment, \n     to enact comprehensive reform by statute.\n       A constitutional amendment for campaign finance reform \n     should not be used as a way to delay reform legislation. \n     Typically, amending the Constitution takes years. After both \n     Houses of Congress adopt an amendment by a two-thirds vote, \n     it has to be approved by three-quarters of the state \n     legislatures. Even then, the Congress would still have to \n     take up enacting legislation. This is a lengthy and arduous \n     process.\n       Congress needs to act now to address the growing scandal in \n     the campaign finance system. Congress can act now--and \n     constitutionally--to adopt major reforms. Congress need not \n     and should not start a reform process that will take years to \n     complete by pursuing campaign finance reform through a \n     constitutional amendment. Instead, the Senate should focus \n     its efforts on enacting S.25, comprehensive bipartisan \n     legislation that represents real reform. It is balanced, \n     fair, and should be enacted this year to ensure meaningful \n     reform of the way congressional elections are financed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ann McBride,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the question before us, the resolution \nby the junior Senator from South Carolina to amend the Constitution, \ngrounds the campaign finance debate right where it needs to be and \nwhere it is, in the first amendment. That is where this debate should \nbe centered. Lest anyone outside of the Senate construe this as an \nendorsement, I hasten to clarify that I regard this proposal as totally \nabhorrent. However, this is a debate we needed to have. This is an \nimportant discussion which clarifies that the campaign finance issue is \nreally about political speech and about participation in our democracy. \nThat is what this is about. That is the whole discussion.\n  In an effort to pave the way for restrictive legislation, such as the \nMcCain-Feingold campaign finance bill, the amendment before us would \namend the Constitution to grant Congress and the States the power to \n``set reasonable limits on the amount of contributions that may be \naccepted by, and the amount of expenditures that may be made by, or in \nsupport of, or in opposition to, a candidate.''\n  When Senator Roberts was here a few minutes ago, we talked about just \nwhat that means. Clearly, this amendment would give incumbent Members \nof Congress the ability to make it impossible to lose, short of some \ncommission of a felony or some outrageous act on the part of an \nincumbent that brought total disfavor upon his or her head in their \nconstituency. It would give to the Congress the power to totally mug, \nmuzzle, shut up critics out in our constituencies who may have \norganized together. In fact, about the only group it leaves untouched \nare our friends in the gallery, the press, who would have enhanced \npower as a result of an effort to shut up everybody else. If you are \ngoing to go down this route, some would even advocate telling the press \nhow much they can criticize us.\n  While we are messing with the first amendment, if we wanted to make \nit totally impossible for us to be defeated, why not, in addition to \nshutting up our challengers in the next election and muzzling all of \nthe groups outside that may or may not like what we do, let's just go \non and trash some of the rest of the first amendment. We can get rid of \nthose nasty editorials that all of us despise, put some restrictions on \nthose pesky little reporters who tend to point out our shortcomings, as \nthey see them.\n  In short, there is no end to how much of this speech we could contain \nif we really wanted to do it. I mean, it is a short step, it seems to \nme, from amending the first amendment to give the Government the power \nto shut up its critics in a campaign to giving the Congress the power \nto shut up its critics in the gallery, and pretty soon, of\n\n[[Page S2184]]\n\ncourse, the first amendment doesn't have any resemblance whatsoever to \nwhat it has today.\n  This amendment that we are debating applies to Federal, State, and \nlocal elections. Any future Congress would have a free hand to \nregulate, restrict, or even prohibit any activity which is perceived by \nthe Government--perceived by the Government--to constitute an \nexpenditure by, in support of, or in opposition to a candidate.\n  Mr. President, the words are few; their ramifications are simply \nstunning. Quite simply, this amendment empowers future Congresses to \nseverely restrict--I would argue eliminate--the universe of political \nspending/speech which is deemed by Congress or some Government \nbureaucracy to effect an election. Candidate spending, independent \nexpenditures, even issue advocacy by private citizens and groups, all \nof it could be muzzled under this amendment.\n\n  Senate Joint Resolution 18, which is the amendment before us, is a \nblank check for a Congress 10, 50, 100 years from now, or maybe \ntomorrow, the day after this is approved, to gag American citizens, \ncandidates, groups, and parties. They could do it with a Constitution \naltered by this resolution. And some call this reform.\n  Mr. President, maybe some people believe that the 105th Congress or \nthe 106th Congress would not do much damage with the power granted by \nthis resolution, but I ask our friends on the left: Are you confident \nthat some Republican-controlled Congress in the future with a 60-plus \nmajority, with a Republican in the White House, will not seize the \noccasion to limit political activities by liberal-leaning groups, labor \nunions, the media, and others? Would you not like the Court to be able \nto stop such an effort on the grounds that it violated the first \namendment?\n  My conservative friends, I ask you: Are you not relieved the Supreme \nCourt was able to strike down the draconian restrictions on independent \nexpenditures in campaigns in the 1978 campaign finance law?\n  I say to my conservative friends: Are you confident that liberal \nDemocrats would never be in a position to enact into law a regulatory \nscheme on campaign finance that restricts your ability to communicate \nwhile leaving the media and labor unions unfettered and even more \npowerful than they already are? All of that, Mr. President, would be \npossible under this amendment.\n  No campaign finance bill will pass this or any Congress that was not \ndrafted and amended by people fully cognizant of the partisan \nimplications. That is why it is so important to have the impartial \nreasoning of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the backstop. It \nsaves the country from legislative excess, ignorance, and mischief.\n  Having said that, it doesn't mean I agree with all the Supreme \nCourt's decisions or I will not scrutinize Supreme Court nominees, but \nI do recognize that the Court, be it of liberal or conservative \nleaning--it is interesting to note in the Buckley case there were many \nliberals on the Court at that time. The Court was much more liberal \nthan it is now when the Buckley case was rendered, a very sound \ndecision, which the Court has only expanded in the direction of more \npermissible speech during the years, including the Colorado case last \nsummer.\n\n  The Court is an essential check on legislative and executive \nbranches. This amendment seeks to take the Court out of the picture \nwhere campaign finance is concerned so that those who desire campaign \nspending limits and restrictions on independent expenditures and issue \nadvocacy will not be inconvenienced, will not be inconvenienced by \nCourt action such as the Buckley decision.\n  The Supreme Court got in the way. The Supreme Court got in the way \nand said you cannot do that, that it is impermissible for the \nGovernment to dole out political speech to candidates, individuals, or \ngroups.\n  Revolting as the Clinton reelection team's fundraising practices \nwere, or anybody else's, they do not justify restricting the rights of \nlaw-abiding American citizens in the future to participate in politics \nand spend as much as they want on their own campaigns for office. \nAmerican democracy should not be diminished because a 1996 reelection \neffort violated current laws and flouted commonsense decency out of a \nruthless, ruthless desperation to get reelected or some self-\nrighteousness that their success was essential to the country, that the \nends justified even illegal and unethical means.\n  Freedom should not be negotiable because one political party or other \nbenefits disproportionately at a given point in time from some form of \npolitical speech or participation. Nor should freedom, Mr. President, \nbe dialed back--dialed back--because some level of campaign spending \nviolates somebody's notion of what is proper. The future should not be \nmade to suffer so that some may appear to atone for misdeeds in the \npresent or impose on the country their own view of what is an \nappropriate level of campaign spending.\n  Mr. President, God bless their souls, the Founding Fathers had the \nwisdom and the courage to construct the Constitution of the United \nStates. Though I have much admiration for my colleagues in this Senate, \nI do not think we have the collective wisdom to improve upon the first \namendment ratified by the States in 1791.\n  The amendment says:\n\n       Congress shall make no law [no law] respecting an \n     establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise \n     thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; \n     or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to \n     petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\n  The critical part is ``abridging the freedom of speech.'' That is \nwhat the Buckley case is about. And that is what this amendment seeks \nto revise.\n  Mr. President, reflecting upon the formulation of the Constitution, \nDe Tocqueville observed in the 19th century that:\n\n       The course of time always gives birth to different \n     interests, and sanctions different principles, among the same \n     people; and when a general constitution is to be established, \n     these interests and principles are so many natural obstacles \n     to the rigorous application of any political system with all \n     its consequences. The early stages of national existence are \n     the only periods at which it is possible to make legislation \n     strictly logical; and when we perceive a nation in the \n     enjoyment of this advantage, we should not hastily conclude \n     that it is wise, but only remember that it is young.\n\n  I would contend that our Nation 200 years ago was both young and its \nleaders wise. I have also considered the environment in which the \nFounding Fathers toiled, free of the harsh glare of our modern media, \nunfettered by the influence of present-day polling, and blissfully \nunacquainted with grassroots lobbying machines.\n  Absent those factors, I suspect much in the legislation in this body, \nmost especially campaign finance reform, would have a different \noutcome. Then again, we did not have to face down the Red Coats, and I \nam confident that the confluence of greatness which gave us the \nConstitution would have done so by candlelight or klieg lights.\n  The first amendment has served our Nation well for over 200 years. If \nthis Senate will resist the temptation to scale it back, it can serve \nour descendants for 200 years more. The first amendment's speech \nprotections are a legacy we are extremely fortunate to have inherited. \nIt is the one we most certainly ought to bequeath, in turn, to \ngenerations to come.\n  The first amendment is America's premier political reform. It is at \nthe heart of the campaign finance debate. This is not just my view. It \nis the opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court and the American Civil \nLiberties Union--America's specialists on the first amendment. As the \nCourt stated in the 1976 Buckley case:\n\n       The first amendment denies government the power to \n     determine that spending to promote one's political views is \n     wasteful, excessive or unwise.\n\n  That gets right to the heart of it. The first amendment prohibits the \nGovernment from determining ``that spending to promote one's political \nviews is wasteful, excessive or unwise.'' In other words, when it comes \nto our political speech, we can be wasteful, we can be excessive and we \ncan be unwise, and it is none of the Government's business.\n\n       In the free society ordained by our Constitution it is not \n     the government but the people--individually as citizens and \n     candidates and collectively as associations and political \n     committees--who must retain control over the quantity and \n     range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.\n\n  So the proponents of this amendment look at that decision and say we \nneed\n\n[[Page S2185]]\n\nto cut a niche out of the first amendment and hand over to the \nGovernment the power to determine what is reasonable speech. In short, \nthey could determine that no speech was reasonable under this \namendment.\n  The Court has been clear and consistent on campaign finance, stating \nfurther in Buckley:\n\n       A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can \n     spend on political communication during a campaign \n     necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting \n     the number of issues discussed, the depth of their \n     exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is \n     because virtually every means of communicating ideas in \n     today's mass society requires the expenditure of money.\n\n  It just does. The Court observed that even ``distribution of the \nhumblest handbill'' costs money. Further, the Court stated that the \nelectorate's increasing dependence on television and radio for news and \ninformation makes ``these expensive modes of communication \nindispensable [the Court said ``indispensable\"] instruments of \neffective political speech.''\n  ``Indispensable.'' Under this amendment there would be nothing to \nkeep the Congress from saying you do not get to use television at all--\nat all.\n  Quite simply, the Government may no more ration the political speech \nof an American citizen via campaign spending regulations than it can \ntell the Washington Post how many newspapers it may distribute or how \nmany hours a day CNN may broadcast. Nor can the Government dictate the \ncontent of campaign ads, just as it cannot control the content of \ntelevision news programs.\n  Mr. President, there is no reason sufficient to justify, in the eyes \nof the Court, campaign spending limits. Not to alleviate the appearance \nof corruption: The Court held there is ``nothing invidious, improper or \nunhealthy'' in campaigns spending money to communicate--nothing. Not to \nstem the growth in campaign spending. Again, the Court was clear:\n\n       . . . the mere growth in the cost of federal election \n     campaigns in and of itself provides no basis [no basis] for \n     governmental restrictions on the quantity of campaign \n     spending. . .\n\n  And not to level the political playing field, a notion flatly \nrejected by the Court in Buckley.\n\n       . . . the concept that the government . . .\n\n  This is in response to the level playing field argument, Mr. \nPresident. In the Buckley case the Court said:\n\n       . . . the concept that government may restrict the speech \n     of some elements of our society in order to enhance the \n     relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First \n     Amendment.\n\n  ``Wholly foreign.''\n  So, Mr. President, the Government cannot, by congressional edict or \nregulatory fiat, impede or impair the ability of candidates, groups, \nindividuals or parties to communicate with the electorate. Nor can \nCongress, as the American Civil Liberties Union has observed, coerce \nwhat it cannot command. In other words, spending limits that are \nvoluntary in name only, such as in the McCain-Feingold bill, would have \nin the Court a half-life of an ice cube on a sun-baked Constitution \nAvenue on the 4th of July. That is about how long that would last.\n\n  There is nothing in Buckley, or any subsequent Supreme Court \ndecision, upon this to pin hope that McCain-Feingold or any similarly \ncoercive bills would be upheld. Buckley was not an aberration. In fact, \nthe Court is increasingly of a deregulatory mind on campaign finance, \nas evidenced by last June's Colorado decision allowing the political \nparties to make independent expenditures.\n  Now, some seek to nullify the Court, and thereby pave the way for \nbills like McCain-Feingold, by amending the first amendment, and that \nis the issue before us--amending the first amendment for the first time \nin two centuries and thus make the unconstitutional, constitutional. \nThey would rewrite the first amendment, a frontal assault on American \nfreedom that the ACLU has characterized as ``a recipe for repression.''\n  That is what is before the Senate today. What is before us today has \nno constituency. Common Cause is against it. The New York Times is \nagainst it. The Washington Post is against it. The ACLU is against it. \nImportantly, an overwhelming number of Senators will be against it.\n  I personally recoil at the prospect of a Constitution so altered, \nwhile I relish the debate itself. This is an honest debate because it \nshows what you have to do to carve a big hunk out of the first \namendment, if you will try to achieve the result that some are trying \nto achieve. This is an honest debate. It draws a clear line between \nthose like myself who look on last year's record election spending as \nillustrative of a robust national debate over the future of the Nation, \nand those who believe you cannot have both freedom of speech and a \nhealthy democracy.\n  Looking upon the first amendment as an impediment to reform, rather \nthan reform, itself steers even well-intentioned reformers on a path of \nGovernment regulation, restriction, and even prohibition of fundamental \npolitical freedoms. A myopic determination to restrict campaign \nspending can result, as it has today, in an effort to essentially \nrepeal the first amendment's protection of political speech. That is \nwhat is before the Senate today.\n  The Court stated in the 1937 case Palko versus Connecticut that \nfreedom of speech ``is the matrix, the indispensable condition, of \nnearly every other form of freedom.''\n  Whatever one believes about the current state of campaign finance or \nthe validity of the Buckley decision, surely it is not cause to carve \nout of the first amendment fundamental protection for core political \nspeech by American citizens. The first amendment was borne of \nextraordinary people in an extraordinary time. Let us not diminish that \nfreedom, 200 years later, out of frustration with Court decisions.\n  The campaign finance reform debate is necessarily difficult. It is \ndifficult because the ramifications of any significant change in this \narea are serious. A ban on soft money, for instance, will have serious \nrepercussions, because--like it or not--the political parties do some \ngood things. For one, they are the only entity in the system that will \nsupport challengers without regard to ideology.\n  The Democratic Party committees support challengers--pro-choice or \npro-life, or pro-gun control or con-gun control, you name the issue and \nthey have supported candidates of their side. In the case of the \nDemocratic committee, because they are Democrats; in the case of the \nRepublicans, because they are Republicans.\n  Our criteria is, first and foremost, a candidate's party affiliation. \nThen we consider their ability and the availability of money to help \ntheir candidates. The political party's helping challengers is often \nall that stands between an incumbent having real competition and not \njust a coronation on election day.\n  Much is said about independent expenditures and issue advocacy. The \ntruth is, politicians hate independent expenditures because by \ndefinition they are out of our control. We do not get to control them. \nA group that thinks your reelection is the most important goal may make \nindependent expenditures that are intended to help you but, in fact, \ninject into the election an issue you wish was not going to be \ndiscussed. In other words, a group can love you to death with \nindependent expenditures. That is why politicians would like to have \ncomplete control of elections. That is what they would be given under \nthis amendment--complete control.\n  Mr. President, the candidates do not own the elections. They are the \npeople's elections, not the candidates. They are the people's elections \nto influence through independent expenditures, issues advocacy, and \nthrough the support of candidates and political parties of their \nchoosing. These reform bills would take elections away from private \ncitizens, groups, and parties and hand them over, exclusively, to the \ncandidates and to the media.\n  Issue advocacy is a recent addition to the reform lexicon. Some \nreformers profess to be horrified by all the issue advocacy that \noccurred last year because--news flash--they affected the election. \nThey decry issue advocacy as another loophole that has been blasted \nthrough allowing groups to circumvent campaign finance restrictions.\n  A funny thing about citizens, groups, and parties who wish to make \nthemselves heard in a democracy: They always seem to find a way around \nGovernment speech roadblocks.\n  If Congress ever does impose Government regulations on issue advocacy\n\n[[Page S2186]]\n\nand the courts do not strike them down, the first amendment will be a \nhollow shell. Soft money limits, independent expenditure limits, issue \nadvocacy regulations, spending limits, PAC limits--these are all \neuphemisms for speech limits.\n  Under this amendment before the Senate--by carving out a huge chunk \nof the first amendment--Congress could succeed in imposing all of these \nspeech limits. America would then spend less on elections. Elections \nwould be quieter, politics--at least, on the surface--would be more \ncivil because dissent would be tightly regulated by this Congress and \nincumbents would be less bothered by fundraising. And we will have \ngutted American democracy.\n  Mr. President, I am confident this amendment is not going to be \napproved. I hope it will be rejected overwhelmingly. It is one of the \nmost frightening proposals we have had before this body in the 13 years \nI have been here. The first amendment should be the touchstone of \nreform, and the Buckley case, its guide.\n  Within those parameters, we could enact bipartisan reform to \nstrengthen, rather than diminish, our democracy. I hope at some point \nthat is what we will be doing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Collins).

The decision did not declare a valuable principle \n     that we should hesitate to challenge. On the contrary, it \n     misunderstood not only what free speech really is but what it \n     really means for free people to govern themselves.\n       We the undersigned call for the reconsideration and \n     reversal of the Buckley decision.\n\n     Bruce Ackerman, Professor of Law and Political Science, Yale \n         Law School\n     Ellen Aprill, Professor, Loyola Law School\n     Peter Arenella, Professor of Law, UCLA Law School\n     Robert Aronson, Professor of Law, University of Washington \n         Law School\n     Robert Benson, Professor of Law, Loyola Law School\n     Steve Bachmann, General Counsel, ACORN\n     Gary L.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 24 \nState attorneys general also asking for reversal of Buckley versus \nValeo be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Twenty-four State Attorneys General Issue Call for the Reversal of \n                          Buckley versus Valeo\n\n       Des Moines, Iowa--The attorneys general for twenty-four \n     states released a joint statement Tuesday calling for the \n     reversal of a 1976 Supreme Court decision which struck down \n     mandatory campaign spending limits on free speech grounds. \n     The attorneys general statement comes amidst a growing \n     national debate about the validity of that court ruling; \n     Buckley v. Valeo.\n       Former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley has denounced the decision \n     and has helped lead the recent push in the U.S. Congress for \n     a constitutional amendment to allow for mandatory spending \n     limits in federal elections. The City of Cincinnati is \n     litigating the first direct court challenge to the ruling, \n     defending an ordinance passed in 1995 by the City Council \n     which sets limits in city council races. And, in late October \n     1996, a group of prominent constitutional scholars from \n     around the nation signed a statement calling for the reversal \n     of Buckley.\n       The attorneys general statement reads as follows:\n       ``Over two decades ago, the United States Supreme Court, in \n     Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), declared mandatory \n     campaign expenditure limits unconstitutional on First \n     Amendment grounds. We, the undersigned state attorneys \n     general, believe the time has come for that holding to be \n     revisited and reversed.\n       ``U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis once wrote \n     `[I]n cases involving the Federal Constitution, where \n     correction through legislative action is practically \n     impossible, this court has often overruled its earlier \n     decisions. The court bows to the lessons of experience and \n     the force of better reasoning * * *' Burnet v. Coronado Oil & \n     Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 406-408 (1932) (Brandeis, J., \n     dissenting).\n       ``As state attorneys general--many of us elected--we \n     believe the experience of campaigns teaches the lesson that \n     unlimited campaign spending threatens the integrity of the \n     election process. As the chief legal officers of our \n     respective states, we believe that the force of better \n     reasoning compels the conclusion that it is the absence of \n     limits on campaign expenditures--not the restrictions--which \n     strike `at the core of our electoral process and of the First \n     Amendment freedoms.' Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 39 (1976) \n     (quoting Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 32 (1968).''\n       The United States has witnessed a more than a 700% increase \n     in the cost of federal elections since the Buckley ruling. \n     The presidential and congressional campaigns combined spent \n     more than $2 billion this past election cycle, making the \n     1996 elections the costliest ever in U.S. history.\n       Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, Nevada Attorney General \n     Frankie Sue Del Papa, Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, \n     and the National Voting Rights Institute of Boston initiated \n     Tuesday's statement. The Institute is a non-profit \n     organization engaged in constitutional challenges across the \n     country to the current campaign finance system. The Institute \n     serves as special counsel for the City of Cincinnati in its \n     challenge to Buckley, now in federal district court in \n     Cincinnati and due for its first court hearing on January 31.\n       ``Buckley stands today as a barrier to American \n     democracy,'' says Attorney General Del Papa. ``As state \n     attorneys general,\n\n[[Page S2187]]\n\n     we are committed to helping remove that barrier.'' Del Papa \n     says the twenty-four state attorneys general will seek to \n     play an active role in efforts to reverse the Buckley \n     decision, including the submission of friend-of-the-court \n     briefs in emerging court cases which address the ruling.\n       ``Maybe it wasn't clear in 1976, but it is clear today that \n     financing of campaigns has gotten totally out of control,'' \n     says Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller. ``The state has a \n     compelling interest in bringing campaign finances back under \n     control and protecting the integrity of the electoral \n     process.''\n       Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods adds, ``I believe that \n     it is a major stretch to say that the First Amendment \n     requires that no restrictions be placed on individual \n     campaign spending. The practical results, where millionaires \n     dominate the process to the detriment of nearly everyone who \n     cannot compete financially, have perverted the electoral \n     process in America.''\n       The full listing of signatories is as follows:\n\n     Attorney General Grant Woods of Arizona (R)\n     Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut (D)\n     Attorney General Robert Butterworth of Florida (D)\n     Attorney General Alan G.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the rollcall of May 1993, of the majority of the \nU.S. Senate expressing the sense of the Senate that the Congress should \nbe empowered constitutionally, the Constitution should be amended to \nauthorize the Congress to regulate or control expenditures in Federal \nelections.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Rollcall Vote No. 129, May 27, 1993\n\n\n                               YEAS (52)\n\n       Democrats (46 or 85%): Akaka, Biden, Bingaman, Boren, \n     Bradley, Breaux, Bryan, Bumpers, Byrd, Campbell, Conrad, \n     Daschle, DeConcini, Dodd, Dorgan, Exon, Feingold, Feinstein, \n     Ford, Glenn, Graham, Harkin, Hollings, Inouye, Johnston, \n     Kennedy, Kerry, Lautenberg, Levin, Lieberman, Mathews, \n     Metzenbaum, Mitchell, Moseley-Braun, Murray, Nunn, Pryor, \n     Reid, Riegle, Robb, Sarbanes, Sasser, Shelby, Simon, \n     Wellstone, Wofford.\n       Republicans (6 or 15%): D'Amato, Hatfield, Kassebaum, \n     Pressler, Roth, Specter.\n\n\n                               NAYS (43)\n\n       Democrats (8 or 15%): Boxer, Kerrey, Kohl, Leahy, Mikulski, \n     Moynihan, Pell, Rockefeller.\n       Republicans (35 or 85%): Bennett, Bond, Brown, Burns, \n     Chafee, Coats, Cochran, Cohen, Coverdell, Craig, Danforth, \n     Dole, Domenici, Durenberger, Faircloth, Gorton, Gramm, \n     Grassley, Gregg, Helms, Jeffords, Kempthorne, Lott, Lugar, \n     Mack, McCain, McConnell, Murkowski, Nickles, Packwood, \n     Simpson, Smith, Stevens, Wallop, Warner.\n\n\n                             NOT VOTING (5)\n\n       Democrats (3): Baucus, Heflin, Krueger.\n       Republicans (2): Hatch, Thurmond.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  When you sit up limply and say there is no constituency for this, the \nconstituency is building. There is no question about that.\n  It is bipartisan. It is very clever in trying to say that the \nHollings resolution is the Hollings-Specter, when it is bipartisan. \nThey will talk with conviction that McCain-Feingold is bipartisan, but \nnot Hollings-Specter. The fact of the matter is, Madam President, that \nwe had a news conference--we have had various ones over the 10-year \nperiod--and hardly anyone attended. On yesterday, the room was \noverflowing, in the context that they realize now that after all the \nendeavors made to try to reconcile this situation, the only route left \nfor us now to correct this cancer that imperils our democracy is \nauthority for the Congress to act.\n  Now, they, in sanctimony, stand and talk about Buckley versus Valeo, \nand in the same breath, ``200 years,'' ``the first amendment,'' \n``loopholes,'' ``let's don't have a loophole or gut out the first \namendment''-- my opponent is very erudite, a very learned Senator, and \nhe has been working on this particular subject for quite some time, and \nhe has to know that Buckley versus Valeo does exactly that.\n  Buckley versus Valeo limited the speech, the first amendment rights, \nof contributors. Say I make a contribution to the Senator from Utah for \nonly $1,000 in the primary and $1,000 in the general election; my \nfreedom of speech has gutted a hole in the first amendment by Buckley \nversus Valeo, because my freedom of speech to contribute and \nparticipate has already been limited by Congress, of all people, and \nupheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. I gave example after example of the \nsafety measures with respect to not being able to shout ``fire'' in a \ntheater. I went to the national security. I went to the obscenity \nprovisions. I wish I had the time and disposition here this afternoon \nto put in Laurence Tribe's restatement of the freedom of speech, and \nyou would have a powerful grasp of what is in order and what is not in \norder. You can bet your boots that this has been building.\n  In 1993, we had a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, and a majority of \nthe U.S. Senate said that they should have a constitutional amendment, \nsuch as is here now introduced. The Senator comes and limply says, ``I \nhave Common Cause, the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the \nACLU, and the Senator from South Carolina has no constituency.'' We \nhave the constituency. We know about the newspapers. They don't want to \nrecognize the fact that we are talking about ``paid'' speech in this \nconstitutional amendment--expenditures--not ``free\" speech. ``Limit the \namount of contributions that may be accepted by and the amount of \nexpenditures that may be made by''--expenditures for speech, paid \nspeech, not free speech.\n  A State shall have the power to set reasonable limits on the amount \nof expenditures made. So they don't have to go to the straw man. I got \ninterested in the straw man. They said Congress could come around and \nlimit you to $5,000 in a campaign and get rid of all of these groups. I \nhadn't thought of that. That would probably be a pretty good idea, \nbecause we know all the groups are really not interested, except in \nbeating those candidates, getting over them.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle very cleverly got out \nin Saturday's Washington Post--I will have to get a copy of that \narticle about all of these different groups. You wonder where their \nnames come from. I remember one out in California, with some spurious \nname, and they found out that Philip Morris, the tobacco folks, were \nbehind it. Upon that being discovered, they said they had to take \ncredit for that particular group. But you have them all bouncing up and \ndown. The gimmick today is to get a group for ``free Government,'' or \nfor ``free speech,'' or ``for clean politics,'' or anything that sounds \npretty. You will find out that it is politically motivated by either \nnational party.\n  I can tell you, our national groups are there and they are really \nruining the political process. But the Senator from South Carolina just \nsays ``expenditures.'' Once you limit the expenditures, you can get \nthose groups, you can get the bundling, you can get the soft money, you \ncan get the direct money, you can get whatever you are going to get. If \nyou have the wrong kind of support, then your opponent is going to be \nquick to point it out and expose it because you have disclosure. That's \nwhat we had in the 1974 act, and that's what we must continue.\n\n  But this has to do with expenditures and paid speech. Of all people \nto really talk--let me comment, Madam President, about the limits of \nspeech. We know that there is good reason to limit speech. The U.S. \nSenate, the U.S.\n\n[[Page S2188]]\n\nHouse of Representatives, the U.S. Congress knows better than any that \nyou must limit speech in order to get a good product. Over on the House \nside, you are given, under the rule, 1 minute or 3 minutes, and over \nhere, we have bragged about the unlimited speech. But the fact of the \nmatter is that we can cut off the filibuster, and we further limit it. \nRather than the two-thirds--you need the accepted large majority of a \n60-vote majority to limit the speech, cut it off.\n  I was at a committee hearing and we had a 5-minute rule. We accept \nthat. So all the Senators limit speech. You are not allowed to stand up \nand say: Wait a minute, the first amendment, we can't gut a hole in \nthis first amendment for the first time in 200 years.\n  That is hogwash. Buckley versus Valeo limits speech--the very \nauthority that the opposition uses here to maintain and oppose the \njoint resolution to amend the Constitution, so that we can reinstill \nthe freedom of speech that is robbed by way of financial power from an \nindividual trying to express himself. That is the nature of the \ncampaign financing now.\n  As I explained earlier, you could take an individual with $100,000 \nand me with $1 million. I can tell you that any candidate who is going \nto start anywhere to get recognition, he is going to spend half of his \nmoney on polls. Then he is going to come in in October with $50,000 for \nTV. I will have a million, and I will squash him; I can tell you that \nright now. I could come in there and take over the airwaves and \nbillboards and newspapers, and radio at various times, for the various \ngroups, and his family will wonder why he is not interested in his \ncampaign. He is not interested for the simple reason that he is not \nfinancially capable of responding. That is what Buckley versus Valeo \nprovides.\n  That is why Chief Justice Burger, in the dissenting opinion, said \nthis differing of contributions, where it can be limited from \nexpenditures, which cannot be limited, ``simply won't wash.'' That is \nChief Justice Burger's expression. You can go right on down the various \ncomments I have given. But them there is the same argument, the same \nstraw man, what the Congress might do. They assume the actions of \nCongress. That is why we put ``reasonable limits.''\n  They talk about, I think, the ACLU. I could not get the copies of the \nother ones just inserted into the Record, but I have the ACLU letter. \nIt says, reasonable limits is vague and overbroad.\n  That is why we said ``reasonable'' because of the straw men that have \nbeen erected back in all of these elections. They could limit here, \nthey could do this, or they could do that. We assume that the Congress \nis going to be reasonable and that the Congress and the courts are not \ngoing to stand for any egregious conduct on the part of the Congress \nthat would do as they threaten this particular constitutional amendment \nwould. These straw men that they put up and knock down: Who is going to \nenforce? We are going to have to put a SWAT team down there, and \neverything else of that kind. And that, oh, horrors, this applies not \nonly to the Federal but the States and the local elections.\n  Madam President, I can tell you that the State elections are included \nbecause they requested the Senator from South Carolina that they be \nincluded. There is no question in my mind that this would be ratified \nin the 1998 elections in November of next year; no question. I will bet \nanybody on it. You come and put this before the American people. They \nhave been denied the right by the Senator from Kentucky and others who \ncome around and try to erect straw men talking about 200 years of \nfreedom of speech, when the very authority, the Supreme Court, already \nhas in Buckley versus Valeo. But they said, ``please include State \nelections.'' I have already inserted the statement of the States' \nattorney generals in the Record. There is a driving force that this \nCongress has prohibited now for the last 10 years because we put it in. \nWe have had a majority vote. The majority of the Senators themselves \nexpressed the sense of the Senate. They now say that the majority of \nthe Senate is not any constituency. I don't know of a better \nconstituency, if I can get the 67. That is what we need; not just the \nmajority. If I can get the 67, we would really be in a good state.\n  The Washington Post says we should have limits on advertising, but a \nconstitutional amendment is a bad idea. ``It would be an exception to \nthe free speech clause.'' Oh, no. It is an exception to the paid speech \nclause. ``And once that clause is free for one purpose, who is to say \nhow many others may follow?'' That is a misgiving. That is a concern. \nThat is a concern in this Senator's mind. It was after 10 years was \nwasted--from 1976 to 1987. We tried all of these things and got nowhere \nthat you could see, by the way the Court was talking, and particularly \nnow with the Colorado decision. There is no question in my mind that \nthe Court is not going to reverse Buckley versus Valeo. They have \npretty well thrown all caution out of the window, and said, ``So long \nas it is not coordinated, these separate groups can come in and come to \nthe national parties,'' and, by Jove, they spend the money, and, \nobviously, it is going to be to the benefit of this particular \ncandidate.\n  That is what we call soft money. It has adulterated the process so \nthat I have business friends at fundraisers when that occurred that \nsaid, ``My heavens, Senator. I gave the $1,000, and I am willing to \ngive the second $1,000. But I am getting calls on the phone now to \nraise $100,000. What in the world? They are calling and asking for \n$50,000 and $100,000, and so forth, for soft money to give to the \nparty.'' They say that you will benefit from it. They might under oath \nsay something differently. But everybody knows what the national \nparties are doing, and that is why we have this investigation going on.\n  It says here again in that particular Washington Post editorial that \n``The Congress may enact laws regulating the amounts of contributions \nand expenditures intended to affect elections in Federal offices. But \nthat is much too vague.'' It says ``vague.'' I do not think it is vague \nat all. I think it has worked out in accordance with the wording of the \nBuckley versus Valeo decision. It is not vague at all--not as the ACLU \nwould state it, and not my good friend George Will. We have his \nparticular comments. That is the gentleman who believes that we ought \nto have term limits for Senators but not for editorial writers. I think \nwe ought to have term limits for these editorial writers. It is sort of \ngetting boring. You can look at the name, and you pass over it because \nyou know what is going to be written. They are hired hands for a \nparticular viewpoint, and on and on again.\n\n  I am quoting from the editorial by George Will:\n  ``Hollings claims--and you have to admire his brass--that carving \nthis huge hole in the first amendment''--that is where they get the \n``carving,'' the pejorative expressions without any real substantive \nargument--``would be a big boost to free speech.''\n  Mr. Will says there isn't any question that ``by `free' I mean \n`fair.' '' No; I mean ``free.'' I do not mean ``paid speech.'' I mean \nwhat I say: ``Free speech.'' By limiting contributions you have come in \nand stated that they are going to have a corruptive influence and that \nis why contributions need to be limited. If that is the case, most \nassuredly the amount of spending, not just the contributions, in \ncampaigns is most corrupt.\n  When Mr. Will refers to ``amounts of speech,'' he means the \npermissible amounts to be decided by incumbents in Congress and State \nlegislatures. Well, when he says ``incumbents in Congress'', he is \nspeaking in the pejorative again because he doesn't like incumbents. He \njust likes incumbent news editorialists but not incumbent Congressmen \nor incumbent Senators.\n  Will continues, ``Note also the power to limit spending not only by \nbut even in support of or in opposition to candidates.''\n  That is exactly right.\n  ``The 32 Senators who voted for this include many who 3 years ago \nstoutly opposed carving out a small exception to the first amendment \nprotections in order to ban flag burning.''\n  I am going to come back to that. He jogs my memory.\n  ``But now these incumbents want'' --that is the third time he has \nused ``incumbent'' in this passage--``to hack away at the Bill of \nRights'' --this is not to hack away at the Bill of Rights; we are \ntrying to restore the Bill of Rights freedom of speech for the \nimpoverished individual in this country in order to strengthen the \npermissible amount.\n\n[[Page S2189]]\n\n  ``Government micromanagement,'' Will says. Well, that is exactly what \nBuckley versus Valeo sustains. It says you can only give $1,000. A PAC, \nno matter how large the organization, can only give $5,000. We had \nindividuals at the time we passed this in 1974 giving $500,000, giving \n$1 million, and giving $2 million in cash. Now we know with the \nColorado decision and the investigation that will ensue, that we all \nvoted for yesterday, that we are back to the millions, the $500,000, \nthe $100,000 contributions. It destroys the confidence of the people in \ntheir representative government. They think ``representative.'' It is, \nby gosh, bought-and-paid-for government. Whoever has the money is going \nto control.\n  Going back to the Will writings,\n\n       Government micromanagement: The Senate bill would ban or \n     limit spending by political action committees. It will \n     require privately funded candidates to say in their broadcast \n     advertisements that the candidates have not agreed to \n     voluntary campaign limits.\n\n  Well, that is not in any Hollings joint resolution whatsoever.\n  ``All this Government micromanagement of political speech is supposed \nto usher in the reign of `fairness' as incumbents define it, of \ncourse.'' Here is a strawman. Vote against incumbents. If you read \nthis, get rid of the incumbents. He is back to term limits again. Let \nme read the next paragraph.\n  ``Incumbents,'' it starts off--this is the sixth time in 10 lines \nthat he has used the word ``incumbents.'' He knows how to get a \ndrumbeat going. ``Incumbents can live happily with spending limits. \nIncumbents will write the limits, perhaps not altogether \naltruistically, and spending is the way challengers can combat \nincumbents advantages such as name recognition, access to media and \nfranked mail. Besides, the most important and plentiful money spent for \npolitical purposes is dispensed entirely by incumbents. It is called \nthe Federal budget--$1.5 trillion and rising * * * Federal spending \noften is vote buying.''\n  Now, he even blames us for passing a budget, and he calls that \npolitical. Why can't we get a vote on the budget? We have been here \nsince January. It is the middle of March. We cannot even get the \nRepublicans to put up a budget. I remember back on December 18, 1994, \non ``Meet The Press,'' they had Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Kasich and Mr. \nDomenici, the two budget chairmen and the Speaker, and they said we are \ngoing to have three budgets. We do not care about the President. We are \ngoing to pass them and he is going to sign them or else, that the \nPresident is irrelevant.\n  That was the argument in the first part of 1995. They came on on \n``Meet The Press'' and they had three budgets. Now I cannot get one of \nthem. But George Will says it is a political document and an advantage \nto the incumbents. The incumbents do not think so. Nobody wants to \nsupport any budget because nobody wants to pay for it. It is not \ncomplicated at all. But so much for the Mr. ACLU and Mr. George Will \nand Mr. Washington Post and Mr. New York Times.\n  I want these gentlemen talking about free speech to go to the New \nYork Times and say I want a half-page. See how free it is. Go to the \nWashington Post and say I want a quarter-page, I want to put this ad in \nhere. There is nothing free about it.\n  From time to time they will take an editorial, but they will have to \nreview it and like it or else they will not take it. I can tell you \nthat, because I have been trying to point out one that has been refused \nfor many years as to the matter of now having to spend $1 billion a day \njust on interest costs on the national debt. It amounts, in essence, \nbecause you add it to the debt, to increasing taxes $1 billion a day. \nWe are on that particular treadmill of a $1 billion-a-day increase in \ntaxes.\n  The American people have no idea of it. They have no idea that the \ndeficits for the past 15 years on an average have been $277 billion. It \nhas been $277 billion in Government that we are giving them but we are \nnot willing to pay for. But the American public, depending on the free \npress, does not know that because the free press does not report that.\n  And back now to their so-called freedom of speech and first \namendments, you are not going to get any freedom of speech there at \nall. It will be ratified by the States. It is not the first time, in \nall candor, for the strawman that they have been proposing here. But \nlet me read this that was stated in ``Politics and Money'' by Elizabeth \nDrew. I quote:\n\n       Until the problem of money is dealt with, it is unrealistic \n     to expect the political process to improve in any other \n     respect. It is not relevant whether every candidate who \n     spends more than his opponent wins, though in races that are \n     otherwise close this tends to be the case. What matters is \n     what the chasing of money does to the candidates and to the \n     victor's subsequent behavior. The candidate's desperation for \n     money and the desire to effect public policy provide a mutual \n     opportunity. The issue is not how much is spent on elections \n     but the way the money is obtained. The point is what raising \n     money, not simply spending it, does to the political process. \n     It is not just that the legislative product is bent or \n     stymied. It is not just that well armed interests have a head \n     start over the rest of the citizenry, for that often is \n     not even a contest. It is not even relevant what interest \n     happens to be winning. What is relevant is what the whole \n     thing is doing to the democratic process. What is at stake \n     is the idea of representative Government, the soul of this \n     country.\n\n  That is 15 years ago now, Madam President, by the distinguished \nwriter Elizabeth Drew in ``Politics and Money.''\n  I think that is what we have to get our media to have, is that fit of \nconscience developed that we saw developed on the floor of the Senate \non yesterday afternoon. In that fit of conscience, we got together in a \nunanimous vote, a unanimous vote--one Senator abstained under the \nrules, but the other 99 Senators, Republican and Democrat, Conservative \nand Liberal, all joined in to not only investigate the illegal but the \nimproper.\n  Now, there was a little band over there that fought that. They fought \nChairman Thompson's idea that he was going after not only the illegal \nbut the improper. Under the Klieglight of the free press, not the paid \nor the expenditures but the free press and the free speech, not the \npaid speech, under the free press and the free speech, they realized \nthat it was going to be tremendously embarrassing, appear as a coverup.\n  That is the kind of fit of conscience that must be developed if we \nare really going to come to grips with this cancer on the body politic. \nAs Justice Jackson says, ``The Constitution is not a suicide compact.'' \nWe do not have to look at the Constitution in a casual way, but we do \nnot have to look upon it as having any relation to this particular \npredicament. The Founding Fathers had no idea of television. They had \nno idea of the expense. They had no idea of the time. They had no idea \nof the effort. They had no idea of the corruption. There is no better \nword for the process than what is demanded now, as you can see, is \ngoing up, up and away. As Justice Byron ``Whizzer'' White said, ``We \nare going on a treadmill and you can see its direction.'' All election \nspending back in 1976--I have it all here estimated--was only $540 \nmillion. Now, by 1996, in 20 years, it has gone up 641 percent, to $4 \nbillion.\n\n  Necessarily, the newspapers who are looking for these paid ads are \ngoing to say, ``free press, free press.'' No: Paid speech. ``Free \nspeech, free speech,'' they will caterwaul. The truth of the matter is, \nwe are talking about expenditures, and paid speech. There it is. It is \ngoing up, up, and away. I do not know how we are ever going to get a \ngrip on that unless we give Congress the authority.\n  Once again, I emphasize not what, ipso facto, will happen under these \nstraw men that the Senator from Kentucky puts up. I have no idea of \nthose things he talked about, of limiting the campaign to $5,000, and \nonly the incumbents could run, and do away with all the committees and \neverything else of that kind. He just arranged a hall of horrors with \nrespect to an amendment. It simply does just exactly what that 24th \namendment did when they found the freedom of speech, namely the most \nsolemn act of political speech, voting, was adulterated by money, \nnamely a poll tax. The Congress came immediately back in the 24th \namendment to the Constitution and said thou shalt not exact a poll tax \nor any other kind of tax, as a financial burden on that vote.\n  Here, now, we have a financial burden on the entire political \nprocess. The decision is not being made in the political marketplace, \nthe marketplace of\n\n[[Page S2190]]\n\nideas and vision and programs. The decision is being made in the \nfinancial marketplace. And then we go around and ask each other, why \ndon't the people have more confidence in the Congress and the \nGovernment up here in Washington?\n  I see my colleague is momentarily wanting to speak. Madam President, \nI thank the Senators for listening and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to visit \non this subject. My mind goes back to a little history lesson, which \nmany probably know but I would like to rehearse, just as a background \nfor this.\n  The Constitution was written primarily by one man, James Madison. \nAfter it went through the convention in Philadelphia, James Madison \nwent back home to Virginia to campaign for its ratification.\n  Ratification of the Constitution really depended on two States. Yes, \nit required that it be ratified by three-fourths of the States, but if \nNew York and Virginia had not ratified, it would not have mattered if \nevery other State did because those were the two dominant States in the \nconfederacy and without their ratification and joining the new \nfederation, created by the Constitution, the country would not have \nsurvived.\n  So, Madison's role in getting ratification by Virginia was as \nimportant to the survival of the Constitution as his role in writing \nit. He had a significant opponent in the State of Virginia, arguably \nthe most popular and powerful political figure in that State, five \ntimes, I believe, Governor of that State, a man named Patrick Henry. \nPatrick Henry took the stump in opposition to the Constitution, put his \nfull prestige and oratorical powers behind the forces that were in \nopposition, and his reason was, among others, that the Constitution did \nnot include a list--or, in 18th century language, a bill--of rights.\n  It is not necessary, said Madison in the debates, because the rights \nof the individuals of this new country, created by this Constitution, \nare all implied in the Constitution itself. They do not need to be \nlisted. If they are listed, they will be limited only to those rights \non the list. So the best thing we can do, said Madison, is ratify the \nConstitution as it stands, rather than talk about a list or Bill of \nRights.\n  Patrick Henry wasn't buying it. And he was powerful enough in the \nState of Virginia, that he could have blocked ratification of the \nConstitution by virtue of his political power. Well, Madison being the \npractical politician he was, as well as the theoretician, said to the \nvoters of Virginia: I'll make a deal with you. If you will ratify this \nConstitution, I will run for Congress and in my first term as a Member \nof the House of Representatives, I will propose a Bill of Rights. And \nMadison prevailed in that debate, Virginia ratified the Constitution, \nit became the basic document upon which this country was built, and \nMadison was true to his political promises. He came to the House of \nRepresentatives and Representative James Madison of Virginia proposed \n12 amendments to the Constitution, every one of them outlining rights \nof individuals. Ten of those were adopted and have come to be known as \nthe Bill of Rights.\n\n  As a historical footnote, the 11th one that was lost to history for \nover 200 years got discovered a few years ago and ratified. So that the \nso-called Madison amendment now, which was No. 11 of his 12 listed \namendments to the Constitution, as the Bill of Rights, is now also part \nof the Constitution. The 12th one is gone and deserves to be gone, it \nis so tied to that period of time it has no relevance to us today and \nnobody wants to revive it.\n  The first of those amendments offered by Representative Madison was, \nof course, the amendment outlining freedom of speech, freedom of \nreligion, freedom to petition the Government for redress of your \ngrievances. That is his generation's term for lobbying, Madam \nPresident--lobbying is a protected, constitutionally recognized \nactivity that is a key part of our democracy. I like to remind people \nof that, as they stand up and talk about the evils of lobbying. Heaven \nhelp us if the day ever comes when citizens are denied the right to \npetition the Government for redress of their grievances or are told \nthat they cannot hire an advocate more articulate than they are, to do \nit for them. That would diminish our constitutional rights.\n  That is all in that first of those amendments offered by Madison. \nPatrick Henry lost the battle in terms of the ratification, but this \ncountry owes Patrick Henry a tremendous debt of gratitude for his \nforcing James Madison into that political deal and putting down on \npaper those rights that we have listed for us in the Bill of Rights.\n  What does that have to do with this debate? What does that have to do \nwith this discussion about campaign finance reform? I stand here, not \nas a lawyer, but I hope as one who can read the English language and \none who has made something of a study of the Constitution throughout \nhis life. I put myself in the context of that debate between Madison \nand Henry, and I say: Mr. Henry, would you be satisfied with the \nreassurance of the following words:\n\n       Congress shall have the power to set reasonable limits on \n     the amount of contributions that may be accepted by, and the \n     amount of expenditures that may be made by, in support of, or \n     in opposition to, a candidate for nomination for election to, \n     or for election to, Federal office.\n\n  I think Mr. Henry would say, ``I will accept James Madison's \nassurances that all of our rights are, by implication, in the \nConstitution, before I will accept the notion that Congress has the \nright to set reasonable limits on what people do in support of or in \nopposition to a candidate.''\n  Now, it is presumptuous of me to try to put words in Patrick Henry's \nmouth. I don't think any of us in this body is a good enough orator to \nmake that attempt. But I, for one, feel that the spirit of Patrick \nHenry says we have to be a whole lot more specific than this, if we are \ngoing to amend the fundamental document that stands as the basis of \nthis Nation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Given the general anxiety that candidates for public \noffice experience when independent expenditures, constitutionally \nprotected speech, is directed for or against us, could my friend from \nUtah not envision a situation in which the Congress would conclude that \nthere should be none, no expenditures in support of, or in opposition \nto, a candidate? Might not the Congress, in its wisdom, conclude that \nit was reasonable to have no such expressions by outsiders in the \ncourse of the campaign under this amendment?\n  Mr. BENNETT. As I read the language of this amendment, the \ndetermination of what is reasonable and what is not reasonable is left \nto the Congress. And under those circumstances, I can see a Congress of \nincumbents deciding that it was eminently reasonable not to allow \nanyone to oppose them.\n  Indeed, if I may quote, to the Senator from Kentucky the rationale \ncurrently being given by the White House for the excesses to which they \nwent in extracting expenditures which now have had to be returned in \nthe millions of dollars. Their rationale was that they were facing the \npossibility that the Republicans would win the election, and that that \npossibility was so overwhelmingly devastating to the future of the \ncountry that they had no choice but to go to the absolute limits of \npropriety and, on occasion, beyond in order to prevent that from \nhappening.\n  If someone believes that is reasonable, certainly I agree with the \nimplications of the question from the Senator from Kentucky that \nMembers of Congress might agree that it is reasonable to put such low \nlimits on the amount that could be spent in opposition to an incumbent \nthat, in fact, the net result would be zero in support.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask my good friend from Utah, might not the \nCongress, full of incumbents, by arguing that the expenditure of money \nis such a tainting thing in our democracy, conclude that maybe there \nshould be a $10,000 or a $20,000 limit on expenditures by candidates in \nthe next election, thereby virtually guaranteeing the reelection of \nevery one of these incumbents?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I agree completely that the Congress might do that. Now, \nto be honest, I would have to say to my\n\n[[Page S2191]]\n\nfriend from Kentucky, the outcry that would arise from the press, the \ngroups who watch what we do, would be very, very severe if Congress \nwere to do that, and they would scream that that was not reasonable and \nwould demand that the limit be raised.\n  But you would create, in that circumstance, a political thicket, to \nuse a phrase that the Supreme Court, I understand, has used on \noccasion, wherein the threads of intelligent debate would be lost \ncompletely. You would spend all of your time in that election arguing \nwhether a $5,000 limit or a $10,000 limit or a $100,000 limit, or \nwherever it might be, was the right limit, and you would never spend \nyour time talking about the important issues facing your country.\n  Frankly, we are in a microcosm of that right now. We are arguing \nabout the things that get in the way, I think, of more substantive \nissues.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator will yield, I wonder if the press would \nargue for more spending. They seem to believe--most of them--that \nspending is a tainting thing in our democracy. To the extent the \ncampaigns are, basically, out of business, in terms of their own \nexpenditures, to convey their own message to their own constituencies, \nwould that not enhance the power of the press enormously?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I think it would enhance the power of the press \nenormously, but I say this to my friend from Kentucky. If we had those \nkinds of limits, I think the people on the editorial page would begin \nto hear from the people on the business page, or, that is, on the \nmanagement side of the paper, saying Congress has just prevented us \nfrom selling ads to anybody on any public issue--and there is very \nsignificant revenue connected with this--and we think you editorial \nwriters ought to ease up to the point where we can begin to get some of \nthe advertising dollars back that we used to have.\n  In that circumstance, I agree with my friend from South Carolina, \nthat as a practical matter in a campaign, this speech is not monetarily \nfree. I draw a distinction between ``monetarily free'' and \n``philosophically free.'' I believe when I buy an ad in a newspaper, as \nthe purchaser of that space, I am, therefore, philosophically free to \nsay whatever I want. Indeed, I have heard radio ads where, in advance \nof the ad, the radio commentator has come on and said, ``The ad you are \nabout to hear contains language which this radio station is forbidden \nto broadcast under normal circumstances, but it is a political ad, and, \ntherefore, the station cannot censor it in any way,'' and people are \nwarned that the ad they are about to hear comes under the freedom of \npolitical candidates to say whatever they want.\n  The ad then used words that, in fact, the station would never \notherwise allow. I can say, the candidate who purchased the ad got \nabout 2 percent of the vote, but he was out for the shock value, and he \ngot it in the State of California. Then after the ad was run, the \nstation announcer came back, once again, to disclaim any connection \nwith this but to say we had no choice, since this was a political \nspeech, to allow it to go forward untrammeled and unchanged.\n\n  If you want free speech, the Senator from South Carolina is right, in \ntoday's world, you have to buy space on the media in order to have it, \nbut if we put limits on the amount of money that can be spent, the net \neffect of that is to destroy my right to have free speech and to turn \nthe debate over to the commentators who have access to the airwaves and \nthe newsprint without any limitation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. One final question for my friend from Utah, following \nup on the observations he astutely made about the transfer of power to \nthe media when you mandate less speech by the candidates and by groups \nin support of candidates. Might it not then be the next step for \nCongress to conclude that since now the press has all the power, that \nmaybe we ought to amend the first amendment a little further and give \nthe Congress the power to maybe say how many hours a day a station may \nbroadcast, because we might conclude that they were engaging in an \nexcessive amount of discussion of our issues, or we might conclude that \nthe circulation of a newspaper might be limited to a certain number, \nbecause there was an excessive amount of news out there, an excessive \namount of discourse about daily events?\n  That is also part of the first amendment, is it not, and that is also \npart of the discourse that goes on in this free society. That would be \npotentially the next step, might it not?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Certainly it would be a logical extension of the \nreasoning behind this. I agree with my friend from Kentucky that would \nbe the case.\n  My friend from Kentucky raises another issue with respect to the \nlanguage of this amendment, when it refers to expenditures that may be \nmade in support of, or in opposition to, a candidate.\n  Let us suppose this circumstance, Madam President. Let us suppose \nthat a corporation--we will call it the ABC Corporation so as to not \ntaint any existing company--purchases half an hour of television time \nfor a news broadcast; in other words, it becomes the sponsor of ``The \nMcConnell-Bennett Hour,'' assuming for just a moment that both my \nfriend from Kentucky and I have concluded our service in the Senate \nhonorably and are looking to extend our careers in the public \narena. And McConnell-Bennett, sponsored by the ABC Corp., has a half-\nhour news show.\n\n  In that, McConnell proceeds to say nice things about the Senator from \nTexas, who has joined us on the floor. And the Senator from Texas has \nan opponent who immediately calls the network and says, by putting \n``The McConnell-Bennett Hour'' on, the ABC Corp. has made an \nexpenditure in support of the Senator from Texas. If the ABC Corp. \nwould just pull their support and sponsorship of that program, \nMcConnell would not have the opportunity to say all those nice things \nabout Gramm. And Gramm's opponent says the expenditures made by the ABC \nCorp. in sponsoring that program are in violation of the Constitution.\n  If this sounds somewhat silly, Madam President, it is because it is.\n  I yield to my friend from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator, and think the Senator from Texas \nwould be interested in this as well.\n  The ACLU, in a letter to me dated March 6, says that this language \nbefore us may well give the Congress the power to interfere with \neditorializing in newspapers. Let me just read this observation for my \ncolleagues and for those who are interested.\n\n       Senate Joint Resolution 18 [referring to the resolution \n     before us] would also give Congress and every state \n     legislature the power, heretofore denied by the First \n     Amendment, to regulate the most protected function of the \n     press--editorializing. Print outlets such as newspapers and \n     magazines, broadcasters, Internet publishers and cable \n     operators would be vulnerable to severe regulation of \n     editorial content by the government. A candidate-centered \n     editorial, as well as op-ed articles or commentary printed at \n     the publisher's expense are most certainly expenditures in \n     support of or in opposition to particular political \n     candidates. The amendment, as its words make apparent, would \n     authorize Congress to set reasonable limits on the \n     expenditures by the media during campaigns, when not strictly \n     reporting the news. Such a result would be intolerable in a \n     society that cherishes the free press.\n\n  So what we have here, America's experts on the first amendment--\nsometimes we agree with them; sometimes we do not--but clearly \nAmerica's experts on the first amendment, the ACLU, say that this \namendment before us gives the Congress, us, the power to control \neditorial comment in this country.\n  Mr. BENNETT. If I may, Madam President. I have just thought of an \nexample that I think is a real-life example and not one of the \ntheoretical examples we have been talking about.\n  I hope I am not offending anyone to say that the new magazine called \nthe Weekly Standard, in my opinion, is not making any money. I know \nenough about the business world to look at the number of ads in the \nWeekly Standard and know what it costs to produce the Weekly Standard \nto say that the Weekly Standard is at the moment a loser financially.\n  I also know enough about the business world to know that Rupert \nMurdoch, who is funding the Weekly Standard, hopes that that will \nchange. I know that he is not doing this strictly out of the goodness \nof his heart. And he has sound past history behind him.\n  Sports Illustrated, published by Time magazine, did not make any \nmoney for\n\n[[Page S2192]]\n\nyears and years and years while it built a constituency for its \nproduct. It is now, I understand, the most profitable publication Time \nmagazine has. Undoubtedly, Rupert Murdoch is hoping for a similar track \nrecord for the Weekly Standard. But as of now, the Weekly Standard is \nnot making any money.\n  Anyone who reads the editorials of the Weekly Standard knows that it \nis in support of candidates for nomination for office. And Rupert \nMurdoch is bankrolling it. He is bankrolling it with corporate funds. \nThese are not his personal dollars. He is bankrolling that magazine \nwith corporate funds.\n  Suppose we pass this amendment and put limits on candidates to the \npoint where they felt they could not get their message out, and a \ncandidate then went, under cover of night, to Rupert Murdoch's office \nand said, ``Rupert, I am in terrible trouble. Will you please \neditorialize in the Weekly Standard on my behalf and reprint 400,000 \ncopies and send them as promotional issues to every voter in my home \nState?''--a corporate contribution made in the name of seeking \ncirculation improvement. It is not an unreasonable scenario.\n  And the point that it illustrates is the point that the Senator from \nKentucky has made since the day I walked in this Chamber and heard him \naddress this issue. And that is this: Somehow, some way, somewhere the \ninventive American mind will find a way to spend money on political \ncampaigns no matter what we do. Somehow, somewhere--I love his analogy: \nLike putting jello on a rock, the thing will find someplace else to go.\n  It seems to me, if we want free, honest, open, fair, direct \nelections, we should focus on the issue of disclosure rather than \nlimits, because the limits have proven time and again throughout our \nhistory never to work.\n  We talk about how terrible this present situation is. Madam \nPresident, I lived through the Watergate era. Indeed, I lived through \nthe Watergate era much closer to the Watergate scandal than I wanted to \nbe.\n\n  When I ran for the Senate in 1992, the entire campaign against me \nmounted by my Democratic opponent was that I was somehow tainted by my \nassociation with all of the figures in Watergate. And there are still \noccasions when I am in these parades on the Fourth of July in the rural \ntowns of Utah where people who are not my political friends holler out, \n``Hey, Watergate'' at me hoping the taint will still stick. Fred \nThompson and I are probably the two Members of this body who know more \nabout Watergate from a personal inside experience than anybody.\n  Virtually the entire system that we have right now was constructed in \nresponse to Watergate. And we were promised at the time it was \nconstructed in a way that it would solve all of our problems. We were \npromised that with the creation of political action committees, special \ninterest money would disappear. We were promised that with limitations \non individuals, we would get democracy like we have never seen it \nbefore in campaigns. We were promised that everything would go away if \nwe would just simply adopt these reforms in the name of clean \nelections.\n  Twenty years later, what do we hear? From the same people who made \nthose promises, we are told if we adopt this constitutional amendment \nall will be wonderful, everything will now suddenly take on a rosy hue \nand there will be no corruption in American politics again.\n  Madam President, I did not believe them then. And I do not believe \nthem now. And I think the track record of the last 20 years indicates \nthat I was right not to believe them then. I hope we do not have a \ntrack record for any of us to find out from actual experience that we \nshould believe them now.\n  Let me conclude with a personal experience. Everybody always says, \nno, you should not tell your personal stories. But this is a story I \nknow the best.\n  I looked at all of the proposals for campaign reform that were around \nwhen I ran. And I realized very quickly they were designed for one \npurpose--to protect incumbents. Of course, you want to have a spending \nlimit if you are an incumbent. The challenger cannot take you on if \nthere is a spending limit. I ran against an incumbent Congressman.\n  What did that mean? That meant when he put out a press release, the \ntaxpayers paid for it because he had a press Secretary that was on his \ncongressional staff. When I put out a press release, I had to pay \nsomebody out of campaign funds in order to write it and disseminate it.\n  When he went to see someone in the home State after traveling to \nWashington, the taxpayers paid for it because he had a travel \nallowance. When I came to Washington to try to see somebody to raise \nsome money for myself, I had to pay for it myself out of my campaign \nfunds because I did not have any travel allowance. And so on down the \nlist.\n  Plus the fact, he had all those years of being invited to Rotary \nclubs and Kiwanis clubs and Lions clubs to be the speaker. I have been \ninvolved with trying to line up speakers for clubs. You are always \ndelighted when you can get someone like a Congressman to come talk to \nyou. I had not been to any of those clubs. None of them was interested \nin talking to me.\n  So you know what I had to do, Madam President, in order to get \nanybody to listen to me in that campaign? I had to buy them lunch. When \nI filed my FEC report, I had $86,000 for food. Because the only way I \ncould get anybody to listen to me: I bought them lunch, I bought them \nbreakfast, I bought them dinner. They would come with no intention of \nvoting for me, but they wanted the free meal. I just hoped if I could \nget in the room long enough and talk to them, maybe I could pry a few \nof them away.\n\n  I started out in that first campaign for the Republican nomination, \nand there were four of us running for the Republican nomination. One \ncandidate was at 56 percent, in first place. I was at 3 percent, in \nfourth place, and there was a 4-point margin of error, so I could \npossibly have been minus 1.\n  Would the incumbents have loved a spending limit faced with the \nopportunity that Bob Bennett might challenge him? Absolutely, \nabsolutely. And a spending limit would be marvelous because then I \ncould not spend all that money for lunch because I simply could not \nhave done it.\n  Now, I have said facetiously to some of my Republican friends around \nhere, look, we were opposed to this when we were in the minority. Now \nthat we are in the majority, why are we not for it, because it will \nreturn our incumbents and hold the other side down, because their \nchallengers cannot beat us. I am afraid I am not that cynical. I still \nremember what it is like to be a challenger and the recognition that if \nwe are going to have free and open elections, we have to give the \nchallengers the opportunities to take on the incumbents, and the \nopportunities to take on the incumbents on the part of the challenger \nmeans that the challengers have to have the opportunity to raise the \nmoney to pay for the press secretary that the taxpayer pays for for the \nincumbents, to pay for the travel budget that the taxpayer pays for for \nthe incumbents, to pay for the lunches so they can get in before the \naudience, that the incumbents get for free. If we put this limit on and \nsay we are going to hold everybody to the same limit, we have just \nautomatically said we are going to take care of the incumbents.\n  The only thing that makes any sense to me in terms of campaign \nfinance reform is to increase the level of disclosure, not put any \nlimits, recognizing the reality of what the Senator from Kentucky says, \nthat the money will find a way to be spent. The more limits you put on \nit, the more you make sure it is the rascals who survive and the naive \nwho get caught. The only way you will get the naive, the fellow who has \nnot figured out all of the ins and outs, who has not worked his way \nthrough all of the labyrinth and opportunity to serve in public office \nis to remove the ins and outs and wipe away the labyrinth.\n  I am sure we will have more to say on this as it goes on. I see my \nfriend from Texas has something to say, as he always does. I will \nlisten with interest, as I always do.\n  I will leave it at this, Mr. President, but I will return at some \nfuture point. I end this as I began.\n  Patrick Henry was right when he said, you nail it down, you put it on \npaper, and you make it very clear.\n\n[[Page S2193]]\n\n James Madison was right when he caved in to Patrick Henry on that \nargument, and did it in writing, the Bill of Rights, instead of \naccepting the assurances that everything would be OK.\n  I cannot accept the assurance that Congress will automatically come \nup with what is the right definition of reasonable. I cannot accept the \nassurance that expenditures made in support of or opposition to a \ncandidate will be reasonably handled by the Congress. I cannot support \nputting that kind of language into the Constitution of the United \nStates and thereby creating a circumstance of uncertainty over which \nlawyers will argue for the next 200 years.\n  I was part of the majority that defeated this amendment the last time \nit came up. I will be part of what I hope will be the majority that \ndefeats it this time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Chair recognizes the very \nhonorable and distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Thank you, Mr. President. I begin my discussion of the \nresolution before the Senate by reading two things. The first thing I \nwill read is the first amendment to the Constitution. I will then read \na statement made by the principal proponent of this amendment as it has \nevolved through the legislative process, the distinguished minority \nleader of the House of Representatives, Richard Gephardt. And then I \nwill discuss the fact that for the first time in the debate on campaign \nfinance reform, for the first time ever, we are debating the real \nissue.\n\n  To this point, as is often so true, even in this greatest of \ndeliberative bodies on the planet, we have not really debated the \nunderlying issue, because often either one side or both sides of an \nargument has an incentive to cloud the real issue so that people do not \nunderstand.\n  The one thing that I am very thankful for, and that I want to \ncongratulate our colleague from South Carolina for in proposing this \namendment, is that for the first time in the debate on campaign finance \nreform, we are finally debating the real issue that is being contested \nhere--I rejoice in having this opportunity to debate.\n  I will debate the issue a little, then I want to talk about the \nunderlying issue, and then I will say something about our distinguished \ncolleague from Kentucky.\n  The first amendment to the Constitution, which has been memorized by \nmost schoolchildren in our country, is one of the most recognizable \npart of the Constitution, and says the following thing:\n\n       Amendment I. Congress shall make no law respecting an \n     establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise \n     thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; \n     or the right of people peaceably to assemble, and to petition \n     the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\n  That is the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, \nand that is the massive thorn in the side, the impediment, and the \ngiant mountain that serves as a barrier to those who want to reform \nAmerican campaigns to limit the ability of people to raise and spend \nmoney. It is this impediment that they face which makes it impossible, \nwithout trampling this amendment into constitutional dust, to achieve \nwhat they want.\n  Today, we are debating this issue in a proposal to amend the \nConstitution and to amend, in particular, the free speech clause of the \nfirst amendment.\n  Now, I want to next read a quote from the distinguished minority \nleader of the House, Richard Gephardt. This is a quote where Mr. \nGephardt is talking about his amendment. He says:\n\n       What we have is two important values in direct conflict: \n     freedom of speech and our desire for healthy campaigns in a \n     healthy democracy. You can't have both.\n\n  Now, let me read that again: ``What we have is two important values \nin direct conflict: freedom of speech and our desire for healthy \ncampaigns in a healthy democracy. You can't have both.''\n  Now, Mr. President, I wish the Founding Fathers could have heard that \nstatement and could have realized that the distinguished leader of the \nDemocratic Party in the House of Representatives, in setting out what \nhe views as desired healthy campaigns and desired healthy democracy, \nbelieves that free speech must die for these healthy campaigns to \noccur. This logic would have rightly been rejected by every single \nFounding Father. I know it because when they wrote the Constitution and \nwhen the first Congress adopted the Bill of Rights, they picked one \namendment to be first, and that amendment is very clear: ``Congress \nshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or \nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of \nspeech * * *''\n  Now, why this amendment is so important, why this debate is so \ncritical to the debate on campaign finance reform is that, for the \nfirst time, we are now discussing the real issue: Do you believe in \nfreedom of speech or not? I do. Therefore, I am opposed to this \namendment, and I am opposed to what is posing as campaign finance \nreform. Or do you believe that Government ought to be given the power \nto circumscribe free speech to achieve the Government's decision of \nwhat, in essence, good elections are? That is what the issue is. For \nthe first time in this long, convoluted debate, we are really now down \nto that key issue.\n  I hope and I believe that we are going to reject this amendment and \nthat we are going to say, once and for all, that we believe in free \nspeech. In fact, how can you have genuine elections without free \nspeech? Ultimately, the speech that our Founding Fathers were most \nconcerned about was political speech. Yet, we have an amendment before \nus that would amend the Constitution and that would limit free speech \nin the name of--to go back to Leader Gephardt's language--``promoting \nhealthy campaigns in a healthy democracy.''\n  Mr. President, what Mr. Gephardt wants to do, and what proponents of \nthis amendment want to do, is to limit free speech because they want to \nchange the balance of power in the political process. Those who believe \nthat the first amendment is a sacred part of the Constitution have to \nreject this amendment out of hand--and I do. And I believe the majority \nwill as well.\n  But let me go one step deeper into the process to try to at least \ngive my view as to what this whole debate is about. If you went out in \nthe public, which is reading all of these stories written by all these \ngroups who are promoting various ideas about campaign finance reform, I \nthink what the American people would be saying is that they are \nconcerned that too many groups exert too much control over Government \nand they would like to fix it. Well, it is interesting, because the \nFramers of this document, the Constitution, were concerned about \nexactly the same thing. But maybe because their world was simpler than \nours, maybe because their vision was clearer than ours, they understood \nthat the solution to bad speech or ineffective speech or speech you \ndisagree with is not limiting speech, but opening speech up and \nguaranteeing free speech.\n  Now, here is the problem. People are worried about interest groups \ninfluencing the Government. But, let me go back one more basic step. \nWhat is it about Government that people want to influence? Well, what \nit is about Government that people want to influence is that Government \ndoes things that are very valuable. Government sets the price of \nthings. Government runs programs where we set interest rates, where we \nset rents, where we set the price of commodities, where we impose \nregulations that benefit some people and hurt others. Government is a \nmajor player in the economy as a setter of prices and regulations that \naccumulate and destroy fortunes. So people want to influence \nGovernment.\n  The second reason people want to influence Government is that \nGovernment spends a lot of money and people want part of it.\n  A third reason people want to influence Government is they care about \nit. They care about the future of their children. They love their \ncountry, and they have philosophies that they believe in. They have a \nvital interest in their children and grandchildren and they take \nseriously either their obligations as a citizen, defined in the \nConstitution, or the biblical admonition, ``Render unto Caesar what is \nCaesar's.''\n\n  Now, nobody wants to limit the third kind of influence, I don't \nthink. If somebody loves America and they want to be involved, or if \nsomebody believes our colleague from North Carolina is the next Thomas \nJefferson and they want to support him because they believe in him, \nnobody in this debate\n\n[[Page S2194]]\n\nclaims they want to interfere with that right.\n  It has always amazed me that never once in the campaign debate has \nanybody proposed eliminating the power that people are trying to affect \nby engaging in campaigns. If we are worried that milk producers are \ngoing to give money to candidates to raise the price of milk, why not \nstop having the Government set the price of milk? Then, if milk \nproducers are involved in the debate, you do not have to worry about \nwhy they are involved. They are involved because they care and they \nhave opinions and they have an interest in the country.\n  If we are worried that people are wanting to sleep in the Lincoln \nbedroom or go to a coffee with the President because they want a \ncontract from HUD, and we think that is the wrong use of political \npower, why not get HUD out of the contract business? Why do we not \nmandate competitive bidding? Why not eliminate all of this discretion? \nIf we are worried that people want a contract or a benefit or \nsomething, why do we not go after that power and eliminate it? That is \nwhat the Founders would have said we should do, yet nowhere is that \nbeing proposed.\n  What is being proposed, then, is not eliminating all the reasons \npeople want to influence the Government for their own benefit, but what \nis proposed is changing who is allowed to intervene in that debate. The \nbasic argument, which on its face is a self-contradiction, always seems \nto be that we want to limit the ability of citizens to contribute to \nthe candidate of their choice so that this candidate can express his \nviews.\n  I have heard nobody object to the AFL-CIO endorsing a candidate, \nwhich is worth millions of votes nationally, is worth hundreds of \nthousands of volunteers, and has the monetary equivalent of millions of \ndollars. Nobody says there is anything wrong with that. Nobody says \nthat there is something wrong with the teacher's union, the National \nEducation Association, endorsing the President and putting thousands of \nteachers into phone banks and doing all kinds of letters to their \nmembers to promote the President.\n  But there is an effort to single out one particular type of \ninvolvement, and that involvement is where a person puts up their time, \ntalent, and especially their money to support a candidate. There is \nsomehow supposed to be something wrong with somebody writing a check to \nsupport their local candidate or their State candidate or their \nnational candidate. But notice that if we ban contributions completely \nso that nobody could spend any money and so that the only people who \nwould have the ability to communicate would be big, powerful \norganizations like the AFL-CIO, organizations that are able to \nmanipulate the media--like environmental groups or Ralph Nader--people \nwho are rich enough to own newspapers, and people who were simply \ninfluential enough to command attention for their ideas. I have a \nconstituent, Ross Perot, who is worth over a billion dollars. When you \nare worth over a billion dollars, people listen to what you have to \nsay.\n  But the point is that this effort to limit the ability of free people \nto contribute does not eliminate what people do not like about the \nsystem; it simply makes other groups more powerful.\n  I would like to establish a principle which I think it is made very \nclear by this proposed amendment. What we are seeing here is an effort \nnot to eliminate political power, but to redistribute it. Limiting the \nability of people to raise money or contribute money or spend money \nwould clearly eliminate part of the competition in the battle for ideas \nin America. But it would leave all the other competitive groups in \nplace and would clearly tilt the balance of power.\n  What is really being said here is that something pretty fundamental \nhas happened in America. It is really the confluence of two forces, and \nif I were on the other side of this political debate, it would scare me \nto death. No. 1, people don't write small checks, by and large, to \nDemocrats. I have had the great honor of heading up the National \nRepublican Senatorial Committee, where we had a power that our \nDemocratic colleagues never had. We could send out a letter to millions \nof people and we could get hundreds of thousands of people to write us \nchecks for $25, $50, or $75. Never was there a day while I was chairman \nof the National Republican Senatorial Committee when the Democrats \naverage donor did not give somewhere between 3 and 10 times as much, in \nterms of the amount of money, as our average donor. The plain truth is, \nif your agenda is more government, more taxes, and less freedom, you \nhave a hard time sending out a fundraising letter and getting people to \ngive. You have to let them sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom. You have to \nhold meetings with them. You have to make them believe they might be \ngetting something for it. So, obviously, if you are on the losing end \nof this battle of free speech, you want to limit free speech.\n  The other force that is coming to bear in this confluence is that \nReconstruction is over. Reconstruction in the South ended in 1994 when \nwe elected a Republican majority of House Members, Senators, and \nGovernors from the Old South. It is hard to believe that the Civil War \nand Reconstruction took that long to work its way through the system. \nBut it did, and it is forever changed.\n  So what we are really seeing here--and, unfortunately, it is aided \nand abetted by those who want the change to occur because it makes them \nmore powerful--is an effort to change the political landscape of \nAmerica to give more power to editorial writers, to unions, to \nteachers, to groups that can manipulate the media, and to take power \naway from working men and women who are willing to voluntarily \ncontribute their time, their talent, and their money.\n  Unfortunately, the people who give report cards on this debate and \nwrite nasty editorials about our dear colleague from Kentucky are \neditorial writers who are probably the biggest beneficiaries of this \nproposed amendment. After all, if we are limited in our ability to \neither spend our own money or to raise money from other people and then \nspend it, then editorial writers become very, very important. On the \nother hand, if you have the ability to raise money and to tell your \nstory, they become far less important. As I have said to those friends \nthat I have had in meetings with editorial boards, ``Endorse my \nopponent on the editorial page, and write a good story about me on the \nfront page.'' Editorial endorsements are not nearly so important when \npeople can engage in free exercise of free speech.\n  The issue here is freedom. You either believe in it or you don't. And \nI do. I have never bought, and I will never buy, the logic that \nsomehow, if you have 88,000 people in your State who have contributed \nto your Senate campaign, which I do, that somehow we ought to have a \nlaw that says we can allow up to 50,000 people to contribute, but when \nwe reach the point of that 50,000th person that has contributed, the \n50,001st person will not be allowed to participate. I totally and \nabsolutely reject that. The whole purpose of this amendment is to limit \nthe free speech of that last person because Congress is going to decide \nwho will have power, who will exercise it, and how that power will be \nexercised.\n  The founders of this nation, in this debate, would rejected this \nproposal. They would have said that if you are worried about Congress \nsetting the price of a product, and you are worried that people will \ngive money to politicians to try to get a higher price to benefit \nthemselves and line their pockets, then take the power to set prices \naway from Congress. If you are worried about construction contracting, \neliminate the discretion in giving contracts and limit the number of \ncontracts that Government is engaged in. But do not limit the ability \nof people to speak and to express their opinion.\n  I think it is interesting to note--and it is not a debate that I want \nto get involved in, but I think it is interesting to note--that in the \namendment before us, when the amendment says that it gives Congress the \npower ``to limit the amount of expenditures,'' it is pretty clear that \nthis is very, very broad language. That language could be interpreted, \nit seems to me, to mean something far more than the authors of this \namendment intended.\n\n  The authors of this amendment intend to limit one particular kind of \nfree speech; that is, free speech by a candidate and by that \ncandidate's supporters. They clearly do not intend to\n\n[[Page S2195]]\n\neliminate free speech by editorial writers, by unions, or by whomever \nelse. But the point is that this amendment is probably so broad that \nultimately it could mean the limitation of that free speech as well.\n  We have to make a choice as to what we are for. I submit that it is \nvery tempting, in looking at these bills, to say, ``What benefits me?'' \nAnd it is very easy for me to devise a campaign finance reform system \nthat benefits me. In fact, I think it is easy for any of us to do that. \nIt might well benefit me to limit contributions because then someone \nrunning against me would have no real opportunity to get the kind of \nexposure I am getting by speaking on television right now with millions \nof people watching C-SPAN. But I think we have to take a longer view of \nwhat these changes are going to mean to people, 20 years from now, who \nare going to be standing right here where we are standing today.\n  Limiting free speech is not in America's interest. This is a very bad \namendment. The intentions of it are basically founded on the principle \nthat free speech and healthy democracy are in conflict. Free speech and \nhealthy democracy can never be in conflict because when free speech \ndies, democracy dies. If dead democracy is healthy democracy, then you \nwould view that as a good thing. But I do not view it as a good thing.\n  The final point on the amendment: We have voted on this as an \namendment to the balanced budget amendment. I believe that we have \ntouched on it with other issues. But today this is a freestanding \nproposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States. I hope \nsome of the people who voted for it, as a way of making it harder for \nus to pass the balanced budget amendment, will today vote against it on \nthe merits. I know no simpler way of defining what it is about than to \nquote its author when he said, as I have already read two previous \ntimes, ``What we have is two important values in direct conflict, \nfreedom of speech and our desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy \ndemocracy. You can't have both.'' If that is the choice--and it is the \nchoice --do we not choose free speech? Do we not believe in the end, to \nquote a biblical admonition, ``Ye shall know the truth, and the truth \nshall set you free\"?\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to say something about our colleague \nfrom Kentucky, Senator McConnell.\n  These issues are very difficult issues. It is not very popular to get \ninto a discussion about these issues, and there is one Member of the \nSenate who, more than anybody else, has been willing to stand up on \nthese issues, and his leadership and his courage have become \nfundamental to protecting our constitutional rights.\n  I just want to say to my colleague from Kentucky that there are \nmillions of Americans who will never know your name, who will never \nknow what you have done, and certainly there are hundreds of editorial \nwriters who will castigate you for it. But I want to tell you in the \nopinion of one of your colleagues, you have earned our great and \npermanent appreciation for the courage you have shown on these kinds of \nissues in standing up for our fundamental constitutional rights. And \nyou have certainly earned our admiration and affection for doing it. \nMillions of people who will never know your name, will never know about \nthis debate, are beneficiaries of the great leadership you have \nprovided.\n  I wanted to say that on the floor of the Senate because I believe it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Texas for his brilliant \ndiscourse on the potential damaging effects of this amendment. I thank \nhim deeply for his comments about my work on this first amendment \nissue. He has been a steadfast ally throughout this debate, and I \nappreciate very much his being there when we all needed the Senator to \nbe there when we needed to protect the first amendment.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Wyoming is here patiently waiting to \naddress the body, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wyoming, Mr. Enzi.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair.\n  I am pleased to be here today and have an opportunity to address \nSenate Joint Resolution 18, the proposed constitutional amendment to \nlimit campaign contributions and expenditures. I am a freshman Senator. \nI came through an election last fall and have a number of things I \nwould like to see addressed on campaign reform, but I have to say that \nI do not think a constitutional amendment is the right forum for \nbeginning that debate.\n  This attempt to exclude core political speech from the first \namendment's protection is a terrible assault on one of the very \ncornerstones of American representative democracy, the freedom of \nprivate citizens to participate in the public forum of political \ndiscourse through freedom of speech.\n  This constitutional amendment is dangerous both in its design and its \nbroad and sweeping scope. This expansive amendment would grant Congress \nthe future power to prohibit independent citizens from distributing \nleaflets, writing editorials, producing independent commercials, and/or \nhanding out voter guides if Congress finds these measures to be ``in \nsupport of or in opposition to a candidate for Federal office.'' This \nis precisely the kind of Government intrusion our Founders feared when \nthey drafted and adopted the first amendment to the Constitution. The \nfirst amendment was designed to protect citizens against the dangers of \na tyrannical Federal Government. It was adopted because our Founders \nrightly realized that there are some freedoms that are so intrinsic to \nthe nature of a representative democracy that they must be protected \nfrom the momentary wishes of a majority in the Federal Congress.\n  When asked what use the Bill of Rights served in our popular \nGovernment, James Madison explained, ``The political truths declared in \nthat solemn manner acquire by degrees the character of fundamental \nmaxims of free Government, and as they become incorporated with the \nnational sentiment, counteract the impulses of interest and passion.'' \nIn other words, it was to protect against such impulses as those now \nsuggested by many of the would-be reformers that the founders drafted \nthe first amendment's protection of speech in broad and unequivocal \nterms. ``Congress shall pass no law abridging the freedom of speech.''\n\n  A brief analysis of the effects of this amendment should terrify even \nthe most ardent reformers. A few examples should show the chilling \neffect this amendment could have on political freedom of speech. This \namendment gives Congress the power to set limits on the amount of \nexpenditures that may be made in support of or in opposition to a \ncandidate for Federal office.\n  I will start with the worst example first. Suppose that one party \nagain gains control of both Houses of Congress and the Presidency. In \norder to maintain its monopoly on Government, this Congress could pass \na law limiting the expenditures of congressional challengers to $5,000. \nWhat sort of possibility would this give any challenger. Such a \nproposal would all but guarantee a perpetual Congress of incumbents. As \noutlandish as such a proposal sounds on its face, it would be legal \nunder this amendment.\n  Again, even the freedom of the press could fall under the vast scope \nof this amendment. Let us consider a proposal which would prohibit any \neditorial against a candidate or a group of candidates. Such a law \ncould well be passed under this amendment if Congress decides that such \neditorials are expenditures by the newspaper ``in opposition to'' a \ncandidate for Federal office. Congress could have the power to limit or \neven prohibit press reports for or against a particular candidate since \nexpenditures must be made to print and distribute a newspaper or \nbroadcast a television or radio news report.\n  Finally, let us consider the case where a private citizen wishes to \nwrite an editorial or hand out leaflets in favor of a particular \ncandidate or his or her positions. Again, this amendment would give \nCongress the power to prohibit such activities. Expenditures must be \nmade to write and publish editorials or hand out handbills. Congress \ncould pass a law outlawing such expenditures in support of candidates \nif it so desired. This amendment would have a drastic and dangerous \nimpact on the free discussion of ideas in this country.\n\n[[Page S2196]]\n\n  Newspapers also might not come under the law but we might come under \nan expenditure law, so they could write things about the candidate to \nwhich they may now not be able to respond in light of not having \nsufficient funds within the limited amounts.\n  Proponents of this constitutional amendment have accepted as their \nfirst premise in the campaign reform debate that the first amendment to \nour Constitution is incompatible with a healthy electoral process. One \nof the original House sponsors of this gutting of the first amendment \nproclaimed unabashedly: ``What we have is two important values in \ndirect conflict: freedom of speech and our desire for healthy campaigns \nin a healthy Democracy. You can't have both.''\n  This remarkable confession by one of the leading reformers is as \nstartling for its boldness as it is for its inaccuracy. We should \nbeware of any campaign reform which can only be achieved by destroying \nthe first amendment. This false conflict between free speech and \ndemocracy was rejected by our Founding Fathers, and it should be \nrejected by the Members of this Senate. Our Founding Fathers rightly \nunderstood that it is precisely the unhindered protection of freedom \nand open political speech that makes democracy possible.\n  I find it fascinating that in the 2 months I have been honored to \nserve in this deliberative body we have debated now two proposed \nconstitutional amendments. These two amendments could not be more \nopposed in their purpose or their effect. The balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment, of which I was a proud cosponsor, would have \nplaced constitutional limits on Congress' power to squander away our \nchildren's economic future. Senate Joint Resolution 18 would give \nCongress expansive and unprecedented new powers of prohibiting core \npolitical speech. The balanced budget amendment would have limited the \nCongress' power by restricting its ability to spend money it does not \nhave. Senate Joint Resolution 18 would constitutionally expand \nCongress' power to regulate the speech of candidates, businesses, \nprivate citizens, and perhaps the press and media.\n  I support the balanced budget constitutional amendment because I \nbelieve that by forcing Congress to live within its means, we give our \nStates, our communities and, most important, our families more freedom \nto make the decisions which most affect their lives and their futures. \nI have to oppose this constitutional amendment because it would grant \nFederal and State governments the power to stifle one of the most basic \npolitical freedoms: the freedom of individual citizens to express \nthemselves freely and without restraint in the public forum.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in affirming the time-honored wisdom \nof the first amendment of the Constitution by rejecting Senate Joint \nResolution 18.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished junior \nSenator from Wyoming for his very articulate, knowledgeable speech in \nsupport of the first amendment. He has made an important contribution \nto this debate, and I am very much appreciative, as are my colleagues \nwho feel this is a step in the wrong direction. I very much appreciate \nhis contribution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nconstitutional amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from \nSouth Carolina. Allow me to say how much I respect my friend Senator \nHollings and the years of service he has given to this great body and \nto America. During this time he has seen more than his share of \nscandals and has surely grown tired of and frustrated with what seems \nto be almost daily revelations of political wrongdoing. My argument is \nnot with the Senator's motives or his quest for a better campaign \nfinance system. I think we all agree with that. My argument is with \nthis particular solution.\n  In many ways it could not be more fitting for this body to begin the \nimportant debate over campaign finance reform than with this proposed \nconstitutional amendment. As my colleague Senator Enzi said, by \nproposing a constitutional amendment, my distinguished colleague from \nSouth Carolina concedes what many who support restricting political \nspeech fail to recognize: that denying an American citizen his or her \nconstitutional right to contribute to a candidate of choice requires a \nfundamental rewriting of our country's most sacred document, our \nConstitution.\n  I hope that my colleagues who support this measure will take pause \nand recognize the significance of what they intend to do. In \nparticular, I hope that my colleagues who support this measure will \nrealize, as Senator Enzi noted, the irony of the fact that less than 2 \nweeks ago this body killed a constitutional amendment that would have \nensured our citizens and future generations a balanced Federal budget. \nNow, some of my colleagues wish to pass a constitutional amendment that \nwould restrict one of our most basic constitutional rights--freedom of \nspeech.\n  The people know that we do not need to amend our Constitution, we \nneed to amend our ways. We need to amend ourselves.\n  Mr. President, I, like all of my colleagues, am concerned about \ncorruption in our political system. And I believe this Congress will \nfind ways to improve upon our campaign finance system. But, like \ncorruption in any organization or system, it is the people who are \ncorrupt, not the system. Why do we blame the system and excuse the \nviolators?\n  Where is the outrage with those who subvert the system and \ndeliberately break the rules and laws already in place?\n  The fact is, we already have campaign finance laws. We have a Federal \nElection Commission to enforce those laws. We do not need to \ncontinually add more layers of laws, regulations, and bureaucracy and \npass those off to the American people as solutions to the problem. We \nneed to deal severely with those who break the law and violate the \ntrust and confidence the people have placed in them. We need to make \ncertain those who seek public office and their campaign teams follow \nthe current law and we need full and complete disclosure of all \ncampaign receipts and expenditures for and against candidates, by \ncandidates' campaigns, and by all political bodies.\n  I do not believe we need to pass a constitutional amendment \nrestricting the rights of our citizens. We need to focus on individual \nviolations of current law. We need to focus on individual conduct and \nbehavior, individual responsibility and accountability. I have often \nsaid to my colleagues, if each of us in public office conducted our \ncampaigns--every aspect of our campaigns--in a manner that our \nconstituents could be proud of, then we would not be engaged in this \ndebate about campaign finance reform.\n  I listened with interest to the political posturing and spins of the \nWhite House over the weekend and was amused but, more honestly, \ndismayed by what seemed to be an attitude of the end justifying the \nmeans. As the Wall Street Journal rightly noted in an editorial \nyesterday:\n\n       Public life . . . is about mainly one thing--the law--the \n     rules that all consent to abide by and enforce so that life \n     can be civil.\n\n  The role of a public servant, Mr. President, is to protect the laws \nand make sure they are being followed for the good of society. Our role \nis not to bend, mold, stretch or interpret the law to our own benefit \nor arrogantly disregard it in order to achieve a goal of our own making \nthat we may find more noble than others. That is not what we are about.\n  If it seems that we have heard this all before it's because we have. \nSenator Hollings knows that. That is why Senator Hollings has taken the \nfloor, trying to resolve this issue. For decades, we have debated \nimportant social issues such as crime and welfare, and that violations \nof our laws were really not the responsibility of individuals--it was \nthe system that we needed to fix. Individual accountability really was \nnot very important. Life was unfair. ``If we truly want to find a \nsolution to all of our problems,'' many argued ``then we should glide \nover individual responsibility and focus on how we can change the \nsystem.'' More laws, more rules, more regulation.\n  Where is the outrage with men and women who have gained the public \ntrust but violated it by not being held to the highest ethical and \nmoral standards? What we are too often lacking is\n\n[[Page S2197]]\n\nleadership and doing the right thing. We have the laws, we have the \nregulations, we have the enforcement mechanism. But we do not always \nhave leaders who do the right thing.\n  Mr. President, have we so lowered our standards and expectations in \npolitics and society that the only way we can think to curtail \nindividual wrongdoing is by amending the constitution? I refuse to \naccept that. I think we are better than that. This country, this \nsociety, our people are better than that.\n  Where is the outrage over individuals who break the law and refuse to \ntake responsibility for their actions? Where are the voices demanding \npersonal responsibility and accountability? I believe that for too long \nwe have been creating a society less dependent on the voluntary rule of \ngood behavior by the citizen than on the oppressive mandate of \nGovernment.\n  We must not be swayed by the emotion of the moment, or the pundits \nand politicians who would rather lead us down a dangerous path of \nrestricting everyone's rights than have the courage to just do the \nright thing. The proposed constitutional amendment before us today \nwould be an enormous step in the wrong direction for a society that has \nalready become too dependent on regulation and procedure, and too \nlittle influenced by the behavior of its individual citizens.\n  The goal of meaningful campaign finance reform should be to involve \nmore people in the political process--not to curtail their \nconstitutional rights.\n  More than two centuries ago, the Framers of our Constitution set out \nto build a nation dedicated to government by consent of the governed. \nThat Constitution draws its power from only one source: ``We the \npeople.''\n  For two centuries, we the people have shaped this Nation and made it \ngreat.\n  For two centuries, we the people have chosen our leaders from among \nourselves and have held them to the highest standards.\n  For two centuries, we the people have taken responsibility for the \nFederal Government of the United States of America.\n  I sought the privilege to serve in the U.S. Senate with some of my \ndistinguished colleagues like Senator Hollings, because I want to take \npower and authority away from the Government and return it to the \npeople. I cannot support any proposal that seeks to limit the ability \nof the people to speak--and takes the power to shape our public debate \naway from the public and gives it to the Government. That is what this \ndebate is about.\n  In Buckley versus Valeo, the Supreme Court ruled that the debate \nabout campaign finances is about the fundamental role of the people in \nour democratic society. The Court wrote:\n\n       In the free society ordained by our Constitution, it is not \n     the government, but the people--individually as citizens and \n     candidates and collectively as associations and political \n     committees--who must retain control over the quantity and \n     range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.\n\n  Mr. President, the system has not failed us. Our problems stem from a \nfailure of leadership. I am outraged, not by the system, but by the \ndeplorable conduct of those few men and women who abuse it. That is \nwhat outrages the American people.\n  Before we reform the Constitution, we should first look at how we \nmight reform ourselves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska for his very important contribution to this debate. He is, \nindeed, correct: What we have before us is an effort to amend the first \namendment for the first time in the history of this country to give to \nthe Government the power to control the speech of individuals, groups, \ncandidates and parties. In short, a complete takeover of political \ndiscourse in this country by the Government.\n  I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his important contribution to \nthis debate. This amendment needs to be defeated, and defeated soundly, \nin the name of protecting the first amendment. I am sure the Senator \nfrom Nebraska is as pleased as I am that even the reform group, Common \nCause, is against this. Even the Washington Post is against this. Even \nthe New York Times is against this. I mean, even the reformers think \nthis is a bad idea. So this should be rejected and rejected firmly.\n  The good thing about this debate is it finally focuses the campaign \nfinance debate where it needs to be focused. This is all about \npolitical speech. I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his important \ncontribution.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chair for his \nfriendship, even though we don't agree on a particular point, and \nparticularly my friend from Nebraska. There is no question that if he \nand I could handle this particular problem--like he says, we would have \nto amend our ways and he and I can amend our ways immediately--we \nwouldn't have the problem that confronts us.\n  The Senator from Nebraska did have a comment that was encouraging to \nme. He said let's not be swayed by the emotion of the moment. I think \nthat is the only way we are going to get something done, is get an \nemotion of the moment, a fit of conscience, like you saw on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate yesterday afternoon. We had the emotion of the \nmoment when we realized that it was a total fraud and farce to just \ninvestigate illegal activities. The Justice Department is there and \nfully aware and fully performing the investigation of illegal \nactivities. Ours in the legislative branch is to investigate the \nimproper activities and see what laws we can do to rectify that \nsituation, particularly soft money.\n  Some who have been on the floor today are the leading opponents of \nsoft money, and that brings me right to the opening statement of the \ndistinguished occupant of the Chair. He said the constitutional \namendment is not the way to begin the debate on campaign finance \nreform. I agree. That is not the way to begin the debate on campaign \nfinance reform. But the distinguished Senator should understand that we \nbegan this debate in 1966. The Congress adopted public financing for \nPresidential elections.\n  Then, in 1967, we repealed the public financing for Presidential \nelections.\n  In 1971, we had the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act, and \nby 1974, we passed, which is the major act of today, the amendments to \nthe Federal Election Campaign Act.\n  In 1976, again we had the amendment of the Federal Election Campaign \nAct.\n  In 1985, we had the Boren-Goldwater amendment that changed the \ncontribution limits and eliminated the PAC bundling. But, Mr. \nPresident, that was tabled back at that particular time.\n  In 1986, we had the Boren-Goldwater amendment adopted.\n  In 1988, we had nine votes on the motion to instruct the Sergeant at \nArms to request attendance while trying to get a vote on S. 2. In fact, \nI think it was at that time we even had to arrest Senators. We are not \njust beginning the debate on campaign finance reform. We had to arrest \nSenators and everybody else to try to get a vote. But in 1988, we had a \nHollings constitutional amendment to limit campaign expenditures. We \nhad to finally file cloture, and that failed by a vote of 53 to 37.\n\n  In 1989, we had S. 139, comprehensive reform, which passed the Senate \nbut never made it out of the conference.\n  In 1991, we had S. 3. We did pass comprehensive reform of campaign \nfinancing, and President Bush vetoed it.\n  In 1993, we had the Hollings sense of the Senate that Congress should \nadopt a constitutional amendment limiting campaign expenditures.\n  In 1993, we had a majority of the Senate vote for it--not the \nWashington Post, not the New York Times, not the Common Cause crowd or \nthe ACLU group, but the U.S. Senators, the representatives of the \npeople who have been in the game and know it best. The majority said \nthat we ought to have a constitutional amendment limiting campaign \nexpenditures.\n  In 1993, we had S. 3, comprehensive reform, pass the Senate, but it \nnever made it out of the conference.\n  I say to our distinguished Presiding Officer, in 1995, again, we had \nthe Hollings constitutional amendment to\n\n[[Page S2198]]\n\nlimit campaign expenditures offered to the balanced budget amendment, \nbut that was tabled by a majority of the Senate on a vote of 52 to 45, \nand they had a real chance to do it.\n  Then, in 1995, we passed the sense-of-the-Senate amendment to address \ncampaign finance reform during the 104th Congress, sort of urging us \nalong. We finally are going to get to it. And, in 1996, cloture on the \nMcCain-Feingold campaign finance reform failed by a vote of 54 to 46.\n  Mr. President, you are right, a constitutional amendment is not the \nway to start, but after 30 years of everything that we could get out of \nCommon Cause and the Washington Post and all of those disparate groups \nlike the ACLU, it is time, I hope, that, as the Senator said, that we \nget swayed by the emotion of the moment, that we get a sort of fit of \nconscience so that we can really act here and realize that if we don't, \nwe really are in the hands of the Philistines with this Supreme Court.\n  Read this one. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee versus \nthe Federal Election Commission:\n\n       Before the Colorado Republican Party selected its 1986 \n     senatorial candidate, its Federal Campaign Committee \n     (Colorado Party), the petitioner here, bought radio \n     advertisements attacking the Democratic Party's likely \n     candidate.\n\n  That is not the candidate that is likely. They are ahead of the \ncurve.\n\n       The Federal Election Commission brought suit charging that \n     the Colorado party had violated the party expenditure \n     provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 which \n     imposes dollar limits upon political party expenditures in \n     connection with the general election campaign of a \n     congressional candidate.\n       The Colorado party defended, in part, by claiming that the \n     expenditure limitations violated the first amendment as \n     applied to its advertisements, and filed a counterclaim \n     seeking to raise a facial challenge to the Provision as a \n     whole.\n       The district court interpreted the ``in connection with'' \n     language narrowly and held that the Provision did not cover \n     the expenditure at issue. It therefore entered summary \n     judgment for the Colorado party, dismissing the counterclaim \n     as moot.\n       In ordering judgement for the FEC, the Court of Appeals \n     adopted a somewhat broader interpretation of the Provision \n     which it said both covered this expenditure and satisfied the \n     Constitution.\n\n  So the judgment was vacated and the case was remanded. But Judge \nBreyer, joined by Justices O'Connor and Souter, concluded that the \nfirst amendment prohibits the application of the party expenditure \nprovision, not the kind of expenditure at issue here, an expenditure \nthat the political party has made independently without coordination of \nany candidate.\n  That has thrown open the door. That is the soft money. That is the \nheadlines. That is the debate. That is the grinding the Government to a \nhalt. They talk about closing down the Government in Washington. Well, \nwe very actively closed it down with that Colorado decision, because \nyou can see the headlines. ``The Poor Party Had to Rent the Lincoln \nBedroom to Get Money.'' Anything they could do to get money, for \nHeaven's sake.\n  If you can believe the distinguished Senator from Texas coming on the \nfloor, and if you are convinced that the Republicans are the small \ngivers and the Democrats are the big givers, that the Republican Party \nis the party of the poor and the Democratic Party is the party of the \nrich, you will believe that the world is flat. This is just flat \nnonsense.\n  I mean, come on. They come in here with all this erudition and quote \nsomething about a gentleman over on the House side stating that there \nare two important values: The freedom of speech and our desire for a \nhealthy campaign and a healthy democracy. And you cannot have both. And \nthe free speech must die in order to have a healthy democracy. Nobody \nbelieves that, including the gentleman on the House side. I can tell \nyou that here and now.\n  The Senator from Texas says, ``Do you believe in free speech or not? \nThat is the question.'' We all believe in free speech. And we go about \nthis with trepidation. Only after 30 years and all the initiatives and \narresting the Members and cloture votes after cloture votes, and, yes, \ncoming back to the people in a sense of that is what we need do, that \nis what we need do. And then when we start to do it, we come on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate and talk about Patrick Henry and freedom of \nspeech and everything else.\n  This has to do with whether or not you believe in limits on campaign \nspending. Every one of you believes in limits of the free speech of \npolitical contributions. That is the Buckley versus Valeo decision. \nNone of these speakers coming up here opposing this particular \ninitiative have come forward and said, ``Oh, wait a minute. Let's take \nthe limits off on contributions.'' They would not have the unmitigated \ngall to say that because they know that the evil here is too much \nmoney.\n  If you are going to take the limits off on the contributions and \neverything else, we are gone as a republic, you are not going to decide \nanything in the marketplace of ideas. It is all going to be in the \nfinancial marketplace. The very idea that we had, the intent of the \nnational Congress, in 1974 was that you cannot buy the office. Under \nthe Buckley versus Valeo decision, now coupled with this Colorado soft \nmoney nonsense, you must buy the office.\n  What did the Senator from Kentucky say, as to withdrawing from \nrunning again, on the day before yesterday? That he resented the idea \nof having to get up all that kind of money. What did the Senator from \nOhio say? The same thing. We who have been in it and everything else--I \nresent it, you resent it.\n\n  It is time now that we act. And do not give us this Patrick Henry. \nThe Senator from Utah was quoting Patrick Henry. And the Senator from \nTexas followed him, and he said about free speech, ``You bet your \nboots, Patrick Henry had free speech in the campaign.'' There was not \nany radio to buy. There was not any TV to buy. There was not any \npolitical consultant to buy. There was not any money to get out the \nvote to buy.\n  You can go on down the list of all the things. That is when the \nConstitution had free speech. But as J. Skelly Wright stated--and I \nwant to get that right--J. Skelly Wright, the eminent jurist, he said \nhere, Judge Wright in the Yale Law Journal--and I quote:\n  ``Nothing in the first amendment commits us to the dogma that speech \nis money.''\n  We are not talking about what is free. We are talking about what is \nexpensive, what is paid for. They know it. You know it. I know it. You \nhave all the free speech you want.\n  When they talk about the newspapers, you can take the present law. \nThey raise these straw men again and again and again. The Senator from \nUtah, he got up and said that the Congress could come back and put such \nlow limits on candidates that only the incumbents would prevail, that \nwe incumbents would come in here and Congress might decide not to let \nanyone oppose them by putting just a limit of $100. Now where have you \nheard such a thing?\n  None of this is in the Senator from South Carolina's constitutional \namendment. The Senator from North Dakota, the Senator from \nPennsylvania--it is bipartisan. I could go on down the list of none of \nthat nonsense of the straw men that could happen. I am going to give \none example and then yield to my distinguished colleague.\n  I know what can happen under the present law because I had it happen \nto me. The Senator from Texas ran that campaign against me in 1992. And \nwe will get to some issues there in a minute. Since he acknowledged he \nhad that experience, I want to tell you about his experience and what \nhe charged falsely.\n  But getting right to the point, right before we were going to vote, \nthe week before the election day--they are very clever. They had, \nfirst, the Wall Street Journal come out with three articles. The Wall \nStreet Journal has never mentioned me before or since. They could care \nless about Hollings from South Carolina. But they had three spitball \narticles in there about the right to work and how I was against \nbusiness.\n  They even had coordinated it with the London Economist with ``Quits \nfor Fritz.'' Robert Novak, he came on Saturday night in ``Capitol \nGang.'' And he said it is also, ``Quits for Fritz,'' ``The white-headed \nSenator from South Carolina will bite the dust.'' Well, I am here.\n\n[[Page S2199]]\n\n  But if you want to use their logic, I would sue Dow Jones. I would \nsue the Wall Street Journal, that they own, for coming in and making a \ncontribution to my opponent under the present law. Now everybody knows \nthat is out of the question. The press is going to have freedom of the \npress, and we all defend it.\n  But under the silly roundabout analysis they give in erecting these \nstraw men on the floor--and I think even the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming said that while they did not think newspapers were covered, \nnewspapers could write, but you would not have the money to rebut \nit. You see the dilemma of the Senator from South Carolina. That is \nexactly the way it was. I did not have the money to rebut it. I had to \nlet it go the last weekend, going right into that election. There was \nnot any way to buy time to rebut it. There was not any way to answer it \nat all.\n\n  We have that under the present law. But if you limit, as we intended \nback in 1974, spending as well as expenditures, then all this bundling, \nsoft money and everything else, comes under control because you have to \ndisclose, you have a limited amount. We will still exercise free \nspeech, get out and hustle, like I used to do in the early days of my \npolitical career.\n  I ran for the legislature on $100. I went all over the county and I \nshook hands and saw everybody. I lucked out. I was elected. I was \nalmost elected by free speech. So I enjoy free speech. When it is so \nexpensive that all you can to is collect money to get on TV to collect \nmoney to get on TV to collect money to get on TV, all as expressed by \nJustice Byron White in the dissenting opinion of Buckley versus Valeo, \n``put the Congress back on a treadmill.'' That is his expression, and \nso aptly expressed. You can see exactly what we have.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague. I \nappreciate his leadership on this floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the initiative offered \ntoday by the Senator from South Carolina. I do not very often come to \nthe floor supporting constitutional amendments. I think we ought to \nchange the Constitution very rarely.\n  I think the Supreme Court has made an error here in the Buckley \nversus Valeo decision. It was a decision by one vote in the Supreme \nCourt, and the decision stands logic on its head. The Supreme Court \nsaid it is perfectly constitutional to limit campaign contributions but \nit is not constitutional to limit campaign spending. Limiting campaign \nspending, they say, is an abridgement of free speech. I have no idea \nhow the Supreme Court can conceive a logic like that that says it is \nfine to limit campaign contributions, but you cannot limit spending. We \nought to be able to have reasonable spending limits in campaigns.\n  The Senator from South Carolina brings an initiative to the floor \nthat is the first initiative, in my judgment, in this Congress that \nsays let's reform our campaign finance system in this country. If you \nneed evidence that that needs doing, pick up any paper and go to any \npage in the last 6 weeks. If you still need evidence, it means you \ncannot read. All around us there is evidence that we must reform this \ncampaign finance system.\n  Will Rogers once said something that is probably appropriate to quote \nin this Chamber, a Chamber that used to have spittoons between every \ndesk, he said, ``When there is no place left to spit, you either have \nto swallow your tobacco juice or change with the times.'' We either \nhave people willing to vote for this and change with the times, \nunderstanding this is necessary and it is necessary now, or I hope they \nwill sit around here and swallow their tobacco juice, because if you \nstill believe campaign finance reform is not necessary, if you still \nbelieve, as some do, that there is not enough spending in campaigns and \nwe ought to spend more, and there are people here who believe that, \nthen you are sadly off track with what the American people know about \nAmerican politics.\n  I want to refer to a chart. The chart shows spending since 1992. \nWages have gone up 13 percent since 1992. Spending on education has \nincreased 17 percent since 1992. So in 4 years, 1992 to 1996, wages in \nAmerica went up 13 percent, spending on education went up 17 percent, \nand spending on politics in our country went up 73 percent, 73 percent.\n  There are people still in this Congress who say and have said \nrepeatedly there is not enough spending in American politics. I have no \nidea what part of the world you would look in order to find their head. \nHow on Earth can you decide with the kind of political inflation we \nhave seen, where the spending on politics in America outstrips by \nmultiples the spending on other things, how on Earth can you conclude \nthere is not enough spending in politics? The fact is there is too much \nspending in politics.\n\n  Now, we could change that by ourselves. We do not need changes to the \nConstitution. In 1992, the election that Senator Hollings was speaking \nof, I was running for the Senate in 1992. I said to my opponent, let us \nprovide in North Dakota the most unusual campaign in America. I was \nalready an incumbent, a Member of the House of Representatives, so I \nsaid I am better known than you are, but let me make you a deal. I said \nI will propose this. Let us decide between the two of us not to do any \nadvertising--no television, no newspapers, no radio, no advertising at \nall, neither of us. We pledge to do that, and instead pool our money, \nand from September 1, Labor Day, to the election day in November, let \nus, once a week, buy prime time television statewide in North Dakota, \npool our money, pay half the costs, each of us. We come to this, 1 \nhour, each week, prime time, with no notes, no handlers, just us, and \nno moderator, and we spend an hour a week on prime time television, the \ntwo of us, telling North Dakotans why we are running for public office, \nwhat we believe in, what our passion is, what we believe is necessary \nfor the future of this country. At the end of those 8 weeks you will be \nas well-known as I am, because I am an incumbent, I am already well-\nknown, you will be as well-known as I am. Prime time, an hour a week, 8 \nweeks, we could simulcast throughout the State, and at the end of the 8 \nweeks, North Dakota would have the most unique campaign in the country. \nNo slash and burn 30-second ads, none. There would only have been 8 \nhours of debate between two people who desired to hold public office \nand who told the people why they aspire to be able to be given this \npublic trust, why they wanted to hold public office, what their dreams \nwere for the future of this country, what their vision was in public \npolicy changes for America's future.\n  It would have been the most unique campaign in the country. I regret \nmy opponent said no. I do not know why he said no. He said no. It was a \nmistake on his part. I am here, so I can say it was a mistake on his \npart. I think it would have been a better campaign for him and for me \nhad he accepted it, and certainly a better campaign for North Dakotans. \nBut he chose to run the kind of campaign that I had to respond to with \n30-second ads here and 30-second ads there, and those are not very \ninformative.\n  Despite the fact that we have these techniques in the 30-second ads, \nI might say to my friend, the Senator from South Carolina, I introduced \na bill dealing with that in the Congress, the 30-second ads. Do you \nknow that in political spending, a substantial amount of the money in \nall campaigns goes to television. The law requires that the television \nstations provide the lowest rate that they provide for their commercial \nadvertisers, the lowest rate for political advertising. So I suggested \nthat we require that the law say that the lowest rate for political \nadvertising will only apply to commercials that are at least 1 minute \nin length, and only commercials in which the candidate appears on the \ncommercial--75 percent of the commercial. Get rid of the slash and burn \n30-second ads, no more of the anonymous voices with slash and burn \nnegatives. I think that is the right incentive, but that is a different \nsubject for a different date.\n  My point is, there is no one I think who can credibly argue that we \nare not spending enough in politics. Clearly, political spending is \nmushrooming in this country. What shall we or could we do about it? The \nSenator from South Carolina offers a solution. His solution is one that \nsays let us provide that with the right approach we could reasonably \nlimit campaign expenditures. The Supreme Court has said that\n\n[[Page S2200]]\n\nis unconstitutional. The Senator from South Carolina says, well, change \nthe Constitution. We should never approach that easily or quickly, but \nI am with him. Frankly, I guess I would like to see us go to the \nSupreme Court a second time, and say will you not correct the error you \nmade the first time? I think there might be a chance of getting that \ndone because it was a decision by one vote.\n\n  In any event, I think that one of the solutions for campaign finance \nreform is to limit campaign spending. Is that an inhibition of free \nspeech? Is it an inhibition of free speech to tell somebody who has \n$100 million, ``You can't spend $30 million buying a seat someplace''? \nIs that what the Framers of the Constitution decided democracy was \nabout--to make some money, ante up to the trough, and plunk down $30 \nmillion and buy a seat? I don't think so. I don't think that's what the \nmethod of selecting people who serve in representative government was \nenvisioned to be by the Framers of our Constitution.\n  This is the first effort to say to my colleagues: Do you believe in \ncampaign finance reform, or don't you? Campaign finance reform. Boy, if \nwe need more discussion about that, then this must be an empty well; \nthis must be a pit without a bottom.\n  I want to describe what we have had on campaign finance reform in a \ndecade. We have had 6,700 pages of hearings, 3,300 floor speeches, \n2,700 pages of Congressional Research Service reports, 113 Senate \nvotes, 522 witnesses, 49 days of testimony, 29 different sets of \nhearings by 8 different congressional committees, 17 filibusters, 8 \ncloture votes on one bill alone, and one Senator arrested and dragged \nto the floor of the Senate. I wasn't here at that point, but I assume \nSenator Hollings was and could describe in remarkable detail whoever \nwas dragged to the floor. And there were 15 reports issued by 6 \ndifferent congressional committees.\n  Now, given that history, can we find some Senators who say we are not \nready and it is not time for campaign finance reform? The honest \nanswer, by some, is: Let's not have any reform. Some would say: Let's \ndecide there ought to be more money spent. Let's make campaigning a \ncommercial product. Let's have campaigns compete with Rolaids, dog \nfood, gasoline, and automobiles, in terms of consumer preference. \nWhoever has the most money can advertise the most.\n  But the Senator from South Carolina has raised, for most of this \nafternoon, the right questions. We can spend forever now, talking about \nwhat happened in the past. We will and we should. There isn't anything \nabout campaign finance abuses that ought not be investigated if there \nare reasonable and credible claims of abuses. The FBI is investigating \nsome questions. The Justice Department is investigating some questions. \nYesterday, we decided--and I voted for it, as did the Senator from \nSouth Carolina--that a committee ought to investigate some of these \nquestions.\n  There are some serious questions about foreign countries intending to \ninfluence American elections that ought to be investigated, and they \nwill be. The American people deserve to know that is the case. But the \nAmerican people deserve more than just a look back. The American people \ndeserve a Congress that is going to look ahead and say, how do we \nrespond to this question of galloping inflation in campaign finance \nspending? The galloping inflation of a campaign system that seems \nalmost out of control--spending more and more and more money in State \nafter State, in district after district. There are a hundred reasons to \nprevent something, and it is easy to do.\n  The Senator from South Carolina had the job this afternoon of coming \nand supporting an affirmative proposition, the first proposition on the \nfloor of the Senate to respond to campaign finance reform. I think it \nwas Mark Twain who was asked once to be a participant in a debate. He \nsaid, ``Of course, I will be happy to debate, provided I get to take \nthe negative side.'' He was told, ``But you have not asked what the \nsubject was.'' And he said, ``The subject doesn't matter. You don't \nneed any preparation to be on the negative side.''\n  That is pretty much true with any debate. The easiest proposition in \nthe world is to be on the negative side. Senator Hollings brings to the \nfloor a proposition that is very simple. This proposition is that what \nis wrong with campaigns in American politics today is too much money is \nspent. There is too much money around. This is not a democracy that was \non the auction block, for sale.\n\n  The framers of our Constitution did not envision that representative \ngovernment was part of a bidding process. We have tried, in a number of \ndifferent ways, to propose that we have reasonable limits that \ncompetitors in this political system would agree to, and we have \ndiscovered that the Supreme Court says those limits are \nunconstitutional. As much as I disagree with the Supreme Court, their \ndecision stands. The Senator from South Carolina now says, let us alter \nthat by making the change he proposes. Does it infringe on free speech? \nI don't think so. Would it hurt our political system? No, it would help \nour political system. Would it restore the confidence of the American \npeople in this system? I think so. Would it do the right thing in \ntrying to propose some sensible spending limits that are enforceable? \nSure.\n  Now, we can turn this down, and there may be the votes to do that. \nBut the question everyone ought to ask for those who turn this down is, \nwhat next? If you decide this is not the way, then what is the way? Or \ndo you like things just as they are? Do you find recreational reading \nabout campaigns, about the political system in our country, up to its \nneck in money, do you find that interesting and fun to read about? Or \ndo you really believe that there are ways for us to make some sense out \nof campaign finance reform in a way that would improve this system?\n  We had campaign finance reform over 20 years ago, in the 1970's, and \nit worked for awhile. I think there are people on all sides of the \npolitical spectrum who have stretched that and distorted it and \ndiscolored it in dozens of ways and found loopholes and hired the best \nminds to figure out how you jump the fence and get under the fence and \nthrough the fence, and the 1970's reforms don't work anymore. So the \nquestion will be, should we reform this system now? Or should we just \nlet this roll along and decide it is just fine?\n  The American people know the answer to that. The American people \nunderstand that things are not just fine. The American people support \ncampaign finance reform. This is the first bill and the first \nopportunity Members of the Senate will have to say: I want to stand up \nfor campaign finance reform.\n  I ask those who say ``no'' to this, then what? Do you believe the \ncurrent system works? If you do, you can fit in a mighty small phone \nbooth with all the rest of the American people who believe as you do. \nIf you believe this system is broken and needs to be repaired, if you \nbelieve this ought to be fixed, that we ought to stand up for our \npolitical system and for its future health, then I think this is a \nreasonable approach to decide that spending limits make sense. I intend \nto vote for it. I was pleased to cosponsor the initiative offered by \nthe Senator from South Carolina.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I understand that we are about to close \ndebate for this afternoon. Let me thank the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota, because he put the issue involved in a very calm and \nsuccinct fashion. What we have done here was done with tremendous \ncaution. We haven't come and said, ``Here is the solution.'' We have \ncome and said, ``Here is the authority to solve it.'' Now, they bring \nin these red herrings and everything about the freedom of speech. We \nare not disturbing the freedom of speech at all. We would not disturb \nthe freedom of speech, except for Buckley versus Valeo, which did put a \nhole in that first amendment, as they use that expression.\n  They say we are limiting the freedom of speech for the political \ncontributor. He can only give so much. If that is what it is, if money \nis the expression, then that group is limited. But the real evil in \ncausing our dilemma here over the past 30 years, particularly with this \nColorado decision now that puts a premium on buying the office by the \nnational parties, if we don't act now to at least have the authority, \nwe don't say in this amendment that the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky is\n\n[[Page S2201]]\n\nright. We don't say that the distinguished Senator from Kentucky is \nwrong. He may later on, with the authority, prevail. They might \nincrease spending. Like I say, we are not spending more on yogurt and \nCrackerjacks, and whatever else they had around here. I have forgotten \nthe things they brought up. I would not have dared to stand up as a \ncandidate and say I spent $86,000 for food. I could not hope to get \nelected in South Carolina buying $86,000 worth of lunches. That, \nperhaps, points to the dilemma.\n  The public that I represent and have worked with over the years \nreally is asking and begging. That is why they included the States.\n  Mr. President, we know that, as in warfare, he who controls the air \ncontrols the battlefield. In politics, he who controls the airwaves \ncontrols the campaign. That is where all the money is. That is what we \nare trying to limit. But I do not say that by voting for this that you \nlimit. I only say that by voting for this you give constitutional \nauthority because you see the extremes of the Supreme Court--it is the \n``Extreme Court of the United States''--when they come with the Buckley \nversus Valeo distortion. It is the ``Extreme Court of the United \nStates'' that comes with Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee \nagainst the Federal Election Commission.\n  So, right to the point, we are saying that we can amend this \nConstitution, that the last five of six amendments dealt with \nelections, that certainly the weight of money as qualifying a vote was \nconstitutionally outlawed in the 24th amendment. We ought to outlaw \nextreme and expensive expenditures in this. That would be the 28th \namendment, I think. They approved these particular amendments in 18.1 \nmonths, which was the average. We know we can get this approved next \nyear in 1998, and we will be on the road to really getting campaign \nfinance reform.\n  This is the acid test. Do you believe in limiting, or do you not \nbelieve in limiting? We are talking about expenditure of paid speech--\nnot free speech. It does not affect free speech whatever. You don't \naffect it under the Constitution. We wouldn't dare try to affect it \nunder the Constitution. And, of course, after the 30 years and all of \nthe debates in three Congresses having given us a majority here in the \nU.S. Senate saying we believe in a constitutional amendment and let's \nsee if we can at least get that majority, they are really coming now \nand are so opposed to McCain-Feingold and are so opposed to any \ncampaign finance reform as to vote this down. Then we will know exactly \nwhere they stand.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from Kentucky. I appreciate the \ndebate this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, I voted in favor of Federico Pena to \nbe the new Secretary of Energy for the Clinton administration in the \nsincere hope that he will be able to provide the Department of Energy \nwith the leadership and direction it needs to provide the proper \nstewardship of our national energy and security needs in the 21st \ncentury.\n  I have addressed the Energy and Natural Resources Committee with my \ngrave concerns about the current direction of the Department of Energy, \nespecially with respect to the maintenance and stewardship of our \nnuclear weapons complex. I wish to use this forum, and the occasion of \nthe Senate vote on Federico Pena, to restate my concerns and to \nreiterate my hope that the current trend at the Department of Energy \nwill be reversed.\n  Of particular concern has been former Secretary Hazel O'Leary's \ntechnically insupportable insistence that the United States can both \nmaintain a credible nuclear deterrent and permanently forego nuclear \ntesting. What is more, her lack of familiarity with the critical work \nof the Nation's nuclear weapons laboratories appears to have emboldened \nher to exert immense pressure on their directors to abandon the labs' \nlongstanding view that the nuclear stockpile cannot be certified \nwithout periodic underground testing.\n  Indeed, the nuclear weapons complex that the next Secretary of Energy \nwill inherit from former Secretary Hazel O'Leary is a shadow of its \nformer self, thanks in no small measure to a Clinton administration \npolicy which the distinguished chairman of the House National Security \nCommittee, Representatives Floyd Spence, has called erosion by design. \nIn releasing a study of this reckless policy on October 30, 1996, \nRepresentative Spence observed that:\n  ``The past four years have witnessed the dramatic decline of the U.S. \nnuclear weapons complex and the uniquely skilled workforce that is \nresponsible for maintaining our nuclear deterrent. The Administration's \nlaissez-faire approach to stewardship of the nuclear stockpile, within \nthe broader context of its support for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, \nis clearly threatening the Nation's long-term ability to maintain a \nsafe and reliable nuclear stockpile. * * * In my mind, it's no longer a \nquestion of the Administration's ``benign neglect' of our Nation's \nnuclear forces, but instead, a compelling case can be made that is a \nmatter of 'erosion by design.''\n  Mr. President, I share the concerns expressed in Representative \nSpence's study about the implications of the Clinton-O'Leary program \nfor denuclearizing the United States. In this regard, two portions of \nthe Spence report deserve special attention.\n  Stockpile stewardship:\n\n       The Clinton Administration's Stockpile Stewardship and \n     Management Program [SSMP] entails significant technological \n     risks and uncertainties. Certification that U.S. nuclear \n     weapons are safe and reliable--in the context of a \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty--depends on developing highly \n     advanced scientific diagnostic tools that do not yet exist \n     and may not work as advertised. Funding shortfalls, legal \n     challenges and other problems are almost certain to \n     continue to impede progress in achieving the program's \n     ambitious goals, and raise serious doubts about the \n     ability of the program to serve as an effective substitute \n     for nuclear testing. The Administration's commitment to \n     implementing the SSMP and, more broadly, to maintaining \n     the U.S. nuclear stockpile is called into question by \n     DOE's failure to adequately fund the SSMP and to conduct \n     important experiments.\n\n  Dismantling the DOE weapons complex:\n\n       Unprecedented reductions and disruptive reorganizations in \n     the nuclear weapons scientific and industrial base have \n     compromised the ability to maintain a safe and reliable \n     nuclear stockpile. The cessation of nuclear-related \n     production and manufacturing activities has resulted in the \n     loss of thousands of jobs and critical capabilities * * *. \n     DOE still lacks concrete plans for resuming the production of \n     tritium * * *. Unlike Russia or China, the United States no \n     longer retains the capacity for large-scale plutonium ``pit'' \n     production and DOE's plans to reconstitute such a capacity \n     may be inadequate.\n\n\n               Information and Physical Security Problems\n\n  Yet another alarming legacy of former Secretary O'Leary's tenure as \nSecretary of Energy could be the repercussions of her determination to \ndeclassify some of the Nation's most closely held information. As a \nresult, efforts by unfriendly nations--and perhaps subnational groups--\nbent on acquiring nuclear weapons capabilities have been afforded \nundesirable insights into designs, developmental experiences and \nvulnerabilities of U.S. nuclear devices.\n  Of particular concern is the fact that data concerning the precise \nquantities\n\n[[Page S2202]]\n\nand whereabouts of U.S. weapons grade material have been made public, \npotentially greatly increasing the risk of terrorist operations aimed \nat stealing or exposing Americans to attack with such materials. \nIncredibly, Clinton administration budgets have significantly reduced \nthe funding available for securing and protecting such sites.\n  In fact, the 1997 Energy Department annual report on the Status of \nSafeguards and Security concluded that there is a $157 million \nshortfall in these accounts. Ironically, that almost exactly equals the \namount contributed by the Department of Energy to the so-called \ncooperative treaty reduction, or Nunn-Lugar, program that is being \nspent ostensibly to improve the safety and security of former Soviet \nnuclear weapons and materials.\n\n\n                        The Cuban Nuclear Danger\n\n  Last but not least in this illustrative listing of the challenges \nfacing the next Secretary of Energy is another nuclear issue \nconfronting this Nation--the prospect that one or both of the two \ndefective nuclear reactors being built by Fidel Castro in Juragua, \nCuba, will be brought online and then fail catastrophically. Should \nthat happen, millions of Americans living downwind could be exposed to \nlethal levels of radioactive fallout.\n  On September 11, 1995, Secretary O'Leary confirmed this danger in a \nletter to the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Helms. She wrote:\n\n       If construction [of these reactors] were resumed and the \n     reactors completed, their poor construction and lack of \n     regulatory oversight, and uncertainties about the \n     qualification and experience of its operators would pose \n     serious safety risks. Written answers accompanying the \n     O'Leary letter in response to questions posed by Senator \n     Helms about the Cuban nuclear program cited the following \n     concerns: ``the quality of civil construction, the \n     condition of critical reactor components, the regulatory \n     structure and nuclear operating base, the plant staff \n     training programs and industrial infrastructure in Cuba \n     required to support operation and maintenance of nuclear \n     power plants.''\n  The O'Leary Energy Department even went so far as to state:\n\n       If a poorly designed, defectively constructed nuclear \n     reactor began operation in Cuba, there would be an \n     unacceptably high possibility that a large accidental release \n     of radioactive material would occur. Dependent on the \n     meteorological conditions at the time of a major accident, \n     people on the U.S. mainland could be exposed to significant \n     airborne (radioactive) contamination.\n\n  In response to questions I posed to Secretary Pena during his \nconfirmation hearing before this committee, I have been advised that he \nsubscribes to the positions taken in the September 1995 O'Leary letter \nto Senator Helms. The trouble is that Mrs. O'Leary took no perceptible \nsteps to address the menace posed by Castro's nuclear project.\n  This may have been due to the Department's view, as evidenced in some \nof the answers to Senator Helms' questions, that the Soviet VVER-440 \n(Model 318) design might prove to be safe, after all--notwithstanding \nthe fact that one has never been constructed or operated before. \nAlternatively, Mrs. O'Leary may have been satisfied, as suggested by \nother answers, that the levels of radiation from a Cuban meltdown would \nonly contaminate the U.S. food supply--not directly harm the American \npeople. Yet another explanation could be the O'Leary team's evident \nwillingness to accept Russian claims that the Juragua reactors are \ndesigned to withstand seismic shocks up to 7 on the Richter scale. The \nresponse to Senator Helms that Mr. Pena has endorsed did not take note \nof the fact that there was a 7.0 magnitude quake in the nearby \nCaribbean Plate in 1995.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that Fidel Castro's nuclear ambitions \ncould pose a significant threat to the United States. Others who have \nwarned of this danger include: the General Accounting Office, the House \nInternational Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, NBC \nNews and several Cuban defectors who had first-hand experience with the \ndismal quality control and safety aspects of the Juragua project. It is \nastounding--and unacceptable--that preventing such a danger from \nmaterializing is not a top priority for the leadership of the \nDepartment of Energy and the executive branch more generally.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  I would conclude by recommending to Secretary Pena that he carefully \nstudy, and try to emulate, the leadership of the first Secretary of \nEnergy, James Schlesinger. Dr. Schlesinger brought to his position \nextraordinary experience and first-hand knowledge of the national \nsecurity dimensions of the job. As a former chairman of the Atomic \nEnergy Commission, Director of Central Intelligence and Secretary of \nDefense and by dint of his work in the private sector at the RAND and \nMitre Corp., he was exceptionally well equipped to address the nuclear \nweapons-related issues of the day.\n\n  It was largely to Dr. Schlesinger's credit that the antinuclear \nagenda of an earlier Democratic administration did not result in an \nill-advised Comprehensive Test Ban. Secretary Schlesinger saw to it \nthat the best professional advice--not the politically correct or \ncoerced assertions--of those charged with certifying the Nation's \nnuclear arsenal were presented faithfully to the President and the \nCongress. It was clear that the considered judgment of the directors of \nthe nuclear weapons laboratories and other responsible experts was that \na small number of low-yield tests would be required each year to avoid \nreaching the point where confident weapon certification was no longer \npossible.\n  As a result, the case was convincingly made that such tests were the \nessential last step in the scientific process--the experimental \nvalidation of the hypothesis that our weapons would work as designed. \nIt was documented that many of the problems that appeared sooner or \nlater in one-third of all designs deployed would never have been \ndiscovered if testing has not continued after the weapons were \ndeployed. And it was established that without periodic testing, it \nwould be impossible over time to retain the skilled design physicists \nand engineers responsible for daily judgments about the Nation's \nnuclear weapons. In the face of these compelling arguments, President \nCarter ultimately abandoned the idea of a zero-yield Comprehensive Test \nBan.\n  We are now confronted with another President committed to a zero-\nyield CTB. Indeed, the Senate will shortly be asked to consider such a \ntreaty negotiated by the Clinton administration. I believe it is \nimperative, as the debate on the CTBT gets underway, that the next \nSecretary of Energy provide his subordinates in the Department and its \nlaboratories with the same opportunity for honest, unpoliticized \nanalysis and testimony as was afforded by Dr. Schlesinger nearly 20 \nyears ago.\n  I am hopeful that Secretary Pena will take these comments as they are \nmeant--as an illustrative list of issues which must have his attention. \nI also hope he will understand the importance of these national \nsecurity matters to Members of Congress and that Federico Pena will \nensure that an environment is recreated in the Department of Energy in \nwhich national security responsibilities and rigorous scientific \npractice are given primacy over dubious arms control agendas and \nwishful thinking.\n  If the vote today were on the Clinton energy policy, it would be a \nresounding ``no.'' Mr Pena is not an architect of the policy--yet. It \nis my hope that when Mr. Pena next appears before us he will \ndemonstrate a willingness to lead and not be an apologist for a \ncontinued failed policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/12/senate-section/article/S2201-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2202-S2203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to address recent revelations \nconcerning partial birth abortion. I also rise to draw my colleagues' \nattention to the letter sent to President Clinton by a group of \nAmerican Roman Catholic leaders and read this past Sunday by Cardinal \nAdam Maida at the Blessed Sacrament Cathedral in Detroit. That letter \nurged the President to ensure respect for all human rights--including \nthose of the unborn--and called our attention to the misinformation \ndistributed by some of those defending partial birth abortion.\n  Mr. President, the abortion issue has been a difficult and divisive \none for this country. But the unfortunate procedure of partial birth \nabortion need not be. The vast majority of Americans, even those who do \nnot share my\n\n[[Page S2203]]\n\nown strongly pro-life convictions, oppose partial birth abortion. This \noverwhelming opposition helped produce legislation during the last \nCongress that would have banned that morally troubling procedure. \nUnfortunately, that legislation was vetoed by President Clinton. Now it \nturns out that that veto was based in part on inaccurate information.\n  Mr. President, those who sought to defend partial birth abortion did \nso on the grounds that it was rare, undertaken only in cases of severe \nfetal deformity and strictly a late-term procedure. These arguments \nserved to make the procedure seem less morally troubling to some in the \npro-choice camp. But it turns out that these supposedly mitigating \nfactors do not exist. Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the \nNational Coalition of Abortion Providers, is quoted in the February 26 \nNew York Times as saying that he ``lied through [his] teeth'' in making \neach of these claims.\n\n  It turns out, Mr. President, that literally thousands of partial \nbirth abortions are performed in this country every year. It also turns \nout that the vast majority of these regrettable procedures are \nundertaken voluntarily--aborting perfectly healthy unborn children. And \nit turns out that partial birth abortions are being carried out on \nmothers in their second trimester of pregnancy.\n  I know that abortion is an issue that raises troubling issues for \nmany people. I know that I cannot help but take a strong pro-life \nposition, because of my faith and because of my own personal \nexperiences. My experience, having witnessed the births of my three \nchildren and having just had a nephew born 12 weeks premature, tells me \nthat the loss of an unborn life is a great tragedy. My nephew was born \nduring a time in his mother's pregnancy when many unborn children are \nstill subject to partial birth abortion.\n  I know that not everyone shares the pro-life position. But in my view \nit is clear that any reservations about restricting abortion need not \nand should not apply to partial birth abortion. The fact that the \ndefenders of this procedure felt it necessary to mislead the public, \nMembers of this body and the President, shows how little support their \nposition really commands. Regardless of where one stands in the broader \nabortion debate, then, all of us should be able to see partial birth \nabortion for what it is: an unjustifiable and wholly unnecessary \ntragedy.\n  Mr. President, it is my sincere hope that we will return as quickly \nas possible to the issue of partial birth abortion. It is also my hope \nthat my colleagues will keep in mind this incident as they consider the \nfactors supposedly mitigating this unfortunate procedure, and vote to \nend it once and for all.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nDetroit News appear in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Detroit News, Mar. 10, 1997]\n\n In Detroit: Maida, Other Cardinals Urge Ban on Partial-Birth Abortions\n\n                     (By Oralandar Brand-Williams)\n\n       Cardinal Adam Maida urged President Clinton to reconsider a \n     ban on partial-birth abortions during a public reading Sunday \n     of a letter sent to the president by a group of U.S. Roman \n     Catholic leaders.\n       ``The public learned that partial-birth abortions are \n     performed not a few hundred times a year, but thousands of \n     times each year,'' Maida said during mass at Blessed \n     Sacrament Cathedral in Detroit.\n       Last April, Clinton vetoed a bill that would have banned \n     the controversial procedure in which a fetus is partially \n     extracted, feet-first, from the birth canal. The brain is \n     then suctioned out.\n       Critics call the procedure infanticide.\n       Congress failed to override Clinton's veto.\n       The letter to Clinton was also read Sunday by the six other \n     American cardinals who also lead archidioceses in the United \n     States and the head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic \n     Bishops. All signed the letter with Maida, which Clinton \n     received Friday.\n       ``Mr. President, you are in a unique position to ensure \n     respect for all human rights, including the right to me which \n     is denied to infants who are brutally killed in partial-birth \n     abortion,'' urged the letter.\n       The letter asks Clinton to acknowledge that he was misled \n     about partial-birth abortion, and urges him to ask Congress \n     to pass a bill banning them. The letter also seeks a pledge \n     that Clinton will sign it into law.\n       Two weeks ago, Ron Fizsimmons, executive director of the \n     National Coalition of Abortion Providers, said he \n     intentionally misled the public in previous remarks about the \n     procedure. Fitzsimmons said he feared that if the truth were \n     known about the frequency of partial-birth abortions, it \n     would damage the cause of abortion rights.\n       Blessed Sacrament parishioner Canary Erving of Highland \n     Park said she supports Madia's efforts to get a ban on \n     partial-birth abortions.\n       ``It's important that we keep our children,'' Erving said. \n     ``If you have to have it and give it away, it's better than \n     destroying the life.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/12/senate-section/article/S2202-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2203-S2204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DR. ERNEST S. GRIFFITH\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the father \nof the Congressional Research Service, Dr. Ernest S. Griffith, who \nrecently passed away at the age of 100.\n  Dr. Griffith came to the Legislative Reference Service--now the \nCongressional Research Service--in 1940, at a time when the U.S. \npolitical landscape was dominated largely by the executive branch. \nLegislation was enacted based on information provided by the President, \nwith little opportunity for independent research and analysis by the \nCongress. Indeed, with an average of only two or three personal \nassistants per Member and a mere handful of committee staff, Members of \nCongress had nowhere to turn for accurate, reliable research and \nanalysis. Nowhere, that is, until Ernest Griffith assumed the reins of \nthe Legislative Reference Service.\n  Fueled by his belief that ``the Congress of the United States is the \nworld's best hope of representative government,'' Dr. Griffith \ndedicated himself to transforming the fledgling LRS into a vital source \nof objective, nonpartisan information and analysis for Members of \nCongress and their staffs. He recruited experts in disciplines ranging \nfrom tax policy to transportation, and greatly expanded the services \noffered by the LRS. He also appointed senior specialists who, under the \nterms of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, could be called \nupon by congressional committees at a moment's notice to work on \nimportant legislative initiatives. These senior specialists laid the \nfoundation for our modern legislative information infrastructure, and, \nin so doing, with others enabled the legislative branch to re-assert \nitself as the Nation's first branch of Government.\n  When asked to describe his greatest achievement as the Director of \nthe LRS, Dr. Griffith once responded: ``I think I am proudest of the \nfact that we have operated independently of the executive branch in a \ntechnical age.'' Mr. President, I too am proud of Dr. Griffith's \nachievement in this area. It is something of which we should all be \nproud.\n  Dr. Griffith left the LRS in 1958 to become the founding dean of the \nAmerican University School of International Service. A Rhodes scholar, \nhe received his undergraduate education at Hamilton College and his \nPh.D. from Oxford University. He taught economics at Princeton and \ngovernment at Harvard, and was the undergraduate dean at Syracuse \nUniversity before moving to Washington in 1935.\n  Among his many academic distinctions, Dr. Griffith was a Fulbright \nvisiting professor at Oxford. He also lectured at New York, Birmingham, \nand Manchester Universities, Swarthmore College, the University of \nOslo, and the University College of Swansea. He was visiting professor \nat the International Christian University and Rykko University in \nJapan, and lectured on American Government in Turkey and Brazil. He was \nprofessor of American Government at Alice Lloyd College in Kentucky in \nhis middle eighties.\n  In his spare time, Dr. Griffith taught Sunday school and served as a \ndelegate to the Third World Council of Churches. He founded the \nPioneers, a forerunner of the Cub Scouts, and chaired the Council of \nSocial Agencies, a predecessor of the United Way. He chaired the policy \nboard of an inter-university training center for Peace Corps \nvolunteers, was vice president of the American Political Science \nAssociation and president of the National Academy of Economics and \nPolitical Science. He climbed mountains into his nineties.\n  Mr. President, it is with great sadness that we bid farewell to \nErnest Griffith, who was memorialized last Saturday at the Metropolitan \nMemorial United Methodist Church here in Washington. He was a \npioneering public servant, a brilliant student of\n\n[[Page S2204]]\n\nAmerican Government, and a true friend to the community around him. He \nwill be sorely missed--not only by his children, grandchildren, and \ngreat-grandchildren, but also by us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/12/senate-section/article/S2203-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/12/senate-section/article/S2204-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.J.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 18\n\n       Whereas, in spite of the constitutional recognition of the \n     authority of states, Congress, using its authority to \n     regulate commerce among the states, has repeatedly preempted \n     state laws. Congressional actions affecting state laws \n     involve many issues, including health, transportation, \n     communications, banking, environment, and civil justice. \n     These actions have reduced the states' ability to respond to \n     local needs; and\n       Whereas, more than half of all federal laws preempting \n     states have been enacted by Congress since 1969. This trend \n     has intensified an erosion of state power that leaves an \n     essential part of our constitutional structure--federalism--\n     standing precariously; and\n       Whereas, the United States Constitution anticipates that \n     our American federalism will allow differences among state \n     laws. This structure expects people to seek change through \n     their own state legislative bodies without federal \n     legislators from other states imposing national laws; and\n       Whereas, the relationship between the states and the \n     federal government established in the ``Supreme Law of the \n     Land'' is predicated on the states having genuine authority \n     and powers not usurped at the federal level; and\n       Whereas, less federal preemption means states can act as \n     laboratories for democracy and act on novel social and \n     economic policies without risk to the entire nation; and\n       Whereas, during the 104th Congress, our federal lawmakers \n     considered legislation to provide specific mechanisms to help \n     protect the authority of the states. This legislation, known \n     as ``The Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996,'' would \n     have set in place mechanisms for all three branches of the \n     federal government to follow. For example, the legislative \n     branch would be required to include a statement of \n     constitutional authority and an expression of intent. The \n     executive branch agencies would be curbed from exceeding \n     their authority. The judicial branch would defer to state \n     laws where Congress is not clear in its intent to preempt; \n     and\n       Whereas, legislation like the Tenth Amendment Enforcement \n     Act of 1996 addresses fundamental issues of federalism and is \n     timely and needed. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact legislation to provide for the \n     enforcement of the Tenth Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n       Adopted by the Senate, February 26, 1997.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-42. A Joint Resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Wyoming; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                         Joint Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, the annual federal budget has not been balanced \n     since 1969, and the federal public debt is now more than five \n     trillion dollars or twenty thousand dollars for every man, \n     woman, and child in America; and\n       Whereas, continued deficit spending demonstrates an \n     unwillingness or inability of both the federal executive and \n     legislative branches to spend no more than available \n     revenues; and\n       Whereas, fiscal irresponsibility at the federal level is \n     lowering our standard of living, destroying jobs, and \n     endangering economic opportunity now and for the next \n     generation; and\n       Whereas, the federal government's unlimited ability to \n     borrow raises questions about fundamental principles and \n     responsibilities of government, with potentially profound \n     consequences for the nation and its People, making it an \n     appropriate subject for limitation by the Constitution of the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States vests the \n     ultimate responsibility to approve or disapprove \n     constitutional amendments with the People, as repesented by \n     their elected State Legislatures; and opposition by a small \n     minority repeatedly has thwarted the will of the People that \n     a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution should be \n     submitted to the States for ratification; and\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the State of Wyoming prefers \n     that a constitutional convention not be called to address \n     this issue and the implementation of this resolution by \n     Congress will effectively eliminate the necessity for such a \n     convention: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Legislature of the State of \n     Wyoming, That the Congress of the United States expeditiously \n     pass, and propose to the Legislatures of the several States \n     for ratification, an amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States requiring in the absence of a natinoal \n     emergency that the total of all federal appropriations made \n     by the Congress for any fiscal year may not exceed the total \n     of all estimated federal revenues for that fiscal year; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State transmit copies of \n     this resolution to the President of the United States Senate, \n     the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United \n     States, each Member of the Wyoming Congressional Delegation, \n     and the Secretary of State and the presiding officers of both \n     Houses of the Legislatures of each of the other States in the \n     Union.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-43. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 14\n\n       Whereas, the continuing practice of annual budget deficits \n     has severely hampered our nation's economy. In the years \n     since Congress and the President last provided a balanced \n     federal budget in 1969, our country's debt has skyrocketed. \n     As a result, we must direct badly needed tax dollars to \n     paying interest on our debt instead of utilizing tax dollars \n     to their fullest capability and, ultimately, reducing the tax \n     burden facing our citizens and businesses; and\n       Whereas, there are a host of benefits to our country to be \n     gained from a balanced budget constitutional amendment. With \n     less demand on credit, interest rates would decline. This \n     would enable individuals to attain worthwhile goals for \n     themselves and their families. Money for homes, cars, and \n     higher education would be more readily available. With the \n     added potential for investment, businesses could expand to \n     provide more and better jobs. Many of the budgetary questions \n     that cloud our future would be answered as we channel funds \n     to far more rewarding endeavors than paying interest on a \n     continual escalation of debt; and\n       Whereas, the American people, who are accustomed to their \n     state and local governments throughout almost the entire \n     country having to balance their annual budgets, are in favor \n     of similar responsibility in the federal government: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S2206]]\n\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to pass and submit to the states for \n     ratification a proposed amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States to require a balanced federal budget with \n     Social Security and Medicare removed from consideration so \n     long as the funds in those programs are guaranteed and are \n     not used to offset, or otherwise be made to serve as \n     collateral for, debt expenditure elsewhere in the federal \n     budget; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge that the proposed balanced budget \n     amendment provide for line item veto for cutting \n     appropriations as measures to achieve a balanced budget; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation. Adopted by the Senate, \n     February 27, 1997.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-44. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of South Dakota; to the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 1006\n\n       Whereas, the expenditures for election campaigns for \n     Congress have been rising each election year; and\n       Whereas, the State of South Dakota just experienced an \n     election campaign for the position of United States Senator \n     where the candidates spent eight million dollars on campaign \n     expenses and bombarded our citizens with campaign \n     advertisements for a year prior to the election; and\n       Whereas, despite the huge cost of this election in South \n     Dakota, it is a mere drop in the bucket when compared to \n     similar elections in more heavily populated states; and\n       Whereas, the increasing cost of Congressional elections has \n     led to a never-ending solicitation by candidates for \n     contributions from businesses, political action committees, \n     and individuals; and\n       Whereas, these high campaign expenditures and the \n     corresponding need for campaign contributions has given the \n     voters of the State of South Dakota and the nation the \n     perception that campaign contributions buy influence in \n     Congress; and\n       Whereas, these expenditures and contributions tarnish the \n     image of representative government and fuel voter apathy; and\n       Whereas, the Congress must pass meaningful election finance \n     campaign reform to help restore voter confidence in our \n     federal election process: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy-\n     Second Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate \n     concurring therein, That the Congress of the United States \n     pass election campaign finance reform which would call for \n     campaign expenditure limits on each candidate for the United \n     States House of Representatives and on each candidate for the \n     United States Senate; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Congress of the United States should \n     also provide in such legislation for campaign limits on in-\n     kind contributions for each candidate for the United States \n     House of Representatives and for each candidate for the \n     United States Senate; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives of the United States, and each \n     Member of the South Dakota Congressional Delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/12/senate-section/article/S2205-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. DODD:\n       S. 426.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to adjust \nthe needs analysis to protect more of a student's earnings; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n       THE BETTER FINANCIAL AID FOR WORKING STUDENTS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise here this morning to introduce a \npiece of legislation which I have entitled the Better Financial Aid for \nWorking Students Act of 1997. At the appropriate time here, Mr. \nPresident, I will send the bill to the desk and ask that it be referred \nto the appropriate committee. But let me take a few minutes, if I can, \nto explain what I am trying to do with this proposal.\n  This legislation is designed, Mr. President, to assist America's \nworking students to cope with the growing financial burdens of a \ncollege education. One hardly even needs to use the words ``growing \nfinancial burden.'' It is to state the obvious.\n  There is not a family in America that does not have children in \nschool or going on to college or who have already been there that does \nnot appreciate what a significant burden the cost of a higher education \nis in our country.\n  For the parents of college-aged children, of course, this is a trying \ntime of year, not only for the parents, but for those who are \nanticipating going on to higher education. These parents and students \nare today anxiously awaiting the acceptance letters or rejection \nletters from our Nation's colleges and universities around the country.\n  However, for the vast majority of families, beyond waiting for an \nacceptance or rejection letter in March and April from institutions \nthey have applied to, the biggest concern is not whether they are going \nto get into college or into a community college or into a university; \nthe biggest question, the biggest challenge facing these families is: \nHow are we going to pay for this? If they get in, how are we possibly \ngoing to finance this incredible burden that we see increasing all the \ntime?\n  In fact, Mr. President, I think this week or maybe the past week one \nof our national magazines--I believe it was Time magazine--has a \nspecial issue out on the cost of higher education. It is their cover \nstory. I commend them for it. I believe it was Time, I apologize if it \nwas another periodical. But it is at an appropriate point with these \nacceptance and rejection letters coming to seniors in high school and \nothers who have been out of school for some time but anxious to get \nback in.\n  So I am stating again the obvious. This is a time of some anxiety. \nBut I would argue, the greatest anxiety is not ``whether or not I'm \ngoing to be able to go on to a higher educational opportunity,'' but \nrather, ``How am I possibly going to afford this? How are we going to \nafford this so our children or myself will be able to acquire the \nskills and educational levels that are going to be necessary for us to \nsucceed or for my children to succeed in the future?''\n  That is why the letter they await, Mr. President, with the most \nanxiety, of course, is the financial aid letter. Working families \nunderstand as well as anyone that a college education has never been \nmore important than it is today.\n  Thirty years ago, Mr. President, a high school diploma could get you \na\n\n[[Page S2207]]\n\ngood job, not the best job, but you would get a good job. You could \nraise a family. You could buy a home. You could have a good life, \nretire with a decent level of financial security.\n  I suspect that the Presiding Officer, his family, my family, \ncertainly we saw that in case after case in our communities, whether it \nwas Arkansas or Connecticut. Today, both of us understand that whether \nit is Arkansas or Connecticut, that is just not the case any longer.\n  Even though you need a high school diploma today, you have to have \neven more education if you are going to fit into the economy of the \n21st century. Presently, the mean income of a high school graduate in \nthe United States is $18,700 a year; that's the mean income. That would \nbe barely enough to sustain a working family. In fact, if you have a \nfamily of four, $18,700 just doesn't do it today; I don't care where \nyou live in the United States. But with a bachelor's degree, earnings \nnearly double, to $32,600 a year. So that additional 4 years can make a \nfantastic and huge difference in an individual's ability to provide for \nthemselves and their families.\n  As you might anticipate, Mr. President, the higher the education, the \ngreater the financial benefits. On average, a holder of a professional \ndegree earns more than $74,500 a year. But making the college \nopportunity a reality for our children, and for those adults who are \ngoing on to higher education, is important beyond simply individual \nearnings. That is obviously a benefit. But beyond the dollars and \ncents, beyond the ability of individuals to earn a higher salary, there \nare benefits to the economy as a whole. According to a new Wall Street \nJournal survey, Mr. President, two-thirds of academic economists agree \nthat the right Government policies in education would provide a needed \nshot in the arm to the American economy. The fact is, in today's global \neconomy, higher education is vital if we are to maintain our \ninternational competitiveness and to keep our economy strong.\n  Since the passage of the GI bill, Mr. President--which millions of \nAmericans are familiar with--there may be those who are retired today \nwho remember, after coming out of World War II or the Korean conflict, \nwhat a difference the GI bill meant to them. There was a significant \ndebate that many may recall about whether or not we could afford to pay \nfor the GI bill.\n  I think in today's dollars, Mr. President, the GI bill--if we tried \nto adopt something like it today, in 1997--would amount to about $9,000 \nfor every single student who took advantage of it. Obviously, the bulk \nof them took advantage of it in the late forties and fifties, the \ngeneration that came out of World War II and Korea. But can you imagine \nthat, today, if you and I were to stand on the floor of the U.S. Senate \nand be advocates for something like $9,000 for every eligible person \nwho wanted to go on to a higher education? There is no way in the world \nwe could pass anything like that--not to mention finding the resources \nto pay for it.\n  So it was a remarkable accomplishment, with all the debt we had at \nthe end of World War II and Korea that hadn't been paid off at that \nparticular time. There was a collective understanding of the value to \nthe country beyond the individual benefit of having a generation that \ncould never, ever have thought about affording a higher education. We, \nas a country, at the national level, said, let's see if we can't come \nup and find some resources to help these people who could not afford to \ngo on to school, so they have the resources to do it. I think it is \nfascinating to note the analysis of how that has worked out. There was \nan analysis not long ago, Mr. President, that said that, for every \ndollar spent on the GI bill, the Nation reaped a benefit of $7 in \nadditional revenues--a 7-to-1 ratio. So as expensive as it was, our \ncountry as a whole benefited tremendously beyond the obvious individual \nbenefits that those men--primarily men, but men and women--who were \nrecipients of the GI bill received. The country as a whole was a \ntremendous beneficiary of that program.\n  At any rate, from this very first effort in higher education--on to \npolicies today--the hallmark of the Federal Government's role in \neducation is not to set aside the curricula in our higher education \ninstitutions, or be involved in the workings of these institutions; our \nrole is to try and come up with creative ways to help students and \nfamilies afford the financial burden of a higher education.\n\n  Today, Mr. President, student assistance is determined by a \ncomplicated analysis of family and student assets and earnings. I am \ndestined to make my colleagues' eyes glaze over if I try to explain it \non the Senate floor, but suffice it to say, it is a rather significant \nmorass of various loans, grants, and other forms of assistance. \nHowever, what must remain crystal clear is that, for millions of \nAmericans, college is not simply a time of tranquil learning and \nweekend parties or weekend gatherings on campuses. For many college \nstudents today, Mr. President--if not most--full and part-time work is \na fundamental part of their college education.\n  This bill that I am introducing this morning would help protect these \nstudents and ensure that when considering students' financial needs, \nwork is rewarding. Today, Mr. President, under current law, $1,750 of a \nstudent's earning from work is shielded when determining need for \nfinancial aid. Beyond that initial $1,750, students' earnings are \nassessed at a rate of 50 percent.\n  The proposal I have for us to consider would double that amount, from \n$1,750 to $3,500, which we would shield, so those students would not \nhave to allocate 50 percent of every dollar over $1,750 to their higher \neducation. It would establish a graduated assessment, from $3,500 to \n$5,000, which would be assessed at 35 percent, and anything over $5,000 \nin earnings would be assessed at the 50 percent that today is assessed \nat $1,750. I don't know exactly when, Mr. President, the $1,750 was set \naside. It may have been when the number of students that were actually \nworking to pay for their education was relatively small and that work \nmay have been something that people did to acquire some independent \nfinancial means to take care of their daily needs.\n  But as I would say again, no matter where you live in the country, \nmost of our students today are on loans and are out working. College \nisn't a 4-year deal where you go straight through anymore. You have to \nhave some work experience. This would allow them--since many are paying \ntheir own rent, buying their own food, paying for their own \ntransportation--by raising the $1,750 to $3,500, graduated up to \n$5,000, this would allow them to retain more of that income that they \nneed for their legitimate expenses, before assessing it at a high level \nthat would deprive them of that ability.\n  Again, this is not going to be a panacea for everything students \nneed, but I think it is realistic. We are going to consider major \nreforms in the Higher Education Act. I anticipate and hope that this \nbill might be a part of that proposal. This legislation would ensure \nthat the efforts of these families will be rewarded; work would be \nrewarded and encouraged. However, this effort should not stand alone, \nMr. President. Clearly, there are other groups who may require changes, \nand other groups of legislation that may require changes. Specifically, \nI think we need to be sure that single students--particularly those \nwith children--are not penalized because they are forced to work in \norder to pay for their education.\n  The bill I am introducing today is, I think, an important first step. \nIn my view, it will guarantee that low-income students receive the \nfinancial aid they so urgently need. I look forward to working on this \nlegislation with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle here. I put \nit out for people's consideration. They may have some ideas to moderate \nit one way or another.\n  Again, I think that given the common interest and common concern \nabout higher education and how we can at least lighten the burdens of \nthose out there trying to get that education and also holding down \njobs, I encourage my colleagues' attention to this proposal.\n  With that, I send the bill to the desk and ask that it be referred to \nthe appropriate committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be referred to the appropriate \ncommittee.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself and Mr. Shelby):\n\n[[Page S2208]]\n\n  S. 427. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to restore \nthe deduction for lobbying expenses in connection with State \nlegislation; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           LEGISLATION TO EXEMPT LOBBYING AT THE STATE LEVEL\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \nalong with my colleague Senator Shelby, that exempts expenses incurred \nto address legislation at the State level from the current law \nprovision that denies this deduction. This change would give lobbying \nat the State level the same tax deductible treatment currently given to \nexpenses incurred to lobby at the local level.\n  The provisions of this bill will allow businesses to once again \ndeduct legitimate expenses they incur at the State level to respond to \nlegislative proposals that can affect their livelihood and even their \nvery existence. I ask my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation.\n  As part of the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Congress approved a \nproposal recommended by President Clinton to deny the deductibility of \nexpenses incurred to influence legislation. As passed, the bill creates \na ``lobbying tax'' by denying a business tax deduction for legitimate \nexpenses incurred to influence legislation at both the State and \nFederal level. In addition, expenses incurred to influence the official \nactions of certain Executive branch officials are not deductible. \nExpenses incurred to influence the legislative actions of local \ngovernments, however, are exempt from the lobbying tax.\n  When the deductibility for lobbying expenses was partially repealed \nin 1993, the debate centered on lobbying at the Federal level. The fact \nthat lobbying to influence legislative actions at the local level is \nexempt indicates that the 1993 change did not intend to cover all \nlobbying activities. Lobbying at the State level was not part of the \ndebate, even though it was included in the final legislation that was \napproved by Congress.\n  At the State level, there is more active business participation at \nall levels of the legislative process. This is partly because State \nlegislatures have smaller staffs and meet less frequently than \nCongress. In most States, the job of State legislator is part time. \nAdditionally, many Governors appoint ``blue ribbon commissions'' and \nother advisory groups to recommend legislative solutions to problems \npeculiar to a specific State. These advisory groups depend on input \nfrom members of the business, professional, and agricultural community \nknowledgeable about particular issues. The recordkeeping requirements \nand tax penalties associated with the lobbying tax discourages and \npenalizes this participation.\n  The denial of a deduction for legitimate business expense incurred to \nlobby at the State level is an unwarranted intrusion of the Federal \ngovernment on the activity of State governments. While many of the \nreasons to restore this deduction at the State level can also apply to \nlobbying at the Federal level, this additional intergovernmental \nargument emphasizes the need to extend the current exemption from the \nlobbying tax at the local level to lobbying at the State level.\n  Perhaps one of the best reasons for restoring the deductibility of \nState lobbying expenses is the paperwork burden that this law has \nplaced on many businesses and organizations. This is especially true \nfor the many State trade associations, most of whom are small \noperations and not equipped to comply with the pages and pages of \nconfusing Federal regulations implementing this law. Compliance is both \ntime consuming and complicated, and detracts from the legitimate and \nnecessary work and services they perform for their members, who are \nprimarily small businesses and who depend on these associations to look \nafter their interests.\n  This bill is very simple. It restores the deductibility of business \nexpenses incurred for activities to influence legislation at the State \nlevel, and gives them the same treatment that exists under current law \nfor similar activities at the local level. It is good legislation, it \ndeserves your support, and it should be enacted into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Durbin and Mr. Chaffe):\n  S. 428. A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, \nto improve the safety of handguns; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   the CHILD SAFETY LOCK ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I introduce an important piece \nof legislation, The Child Safety Lock Act of 1997. Our measure will \nsave thousands of children's lives by curtailing the senseless deaths \nthat occur when improperly stored and unlocked handguns come within the \nreach of children. Let me tell you about the tragic death of 4 year-old \nDylan Pierce of Eaton, WI, which illustrates why we need this law.\n  Last August, Dylan and his 8-year-old brother Cody stumbled upon an \nunlocked cabinet while their parents were at work. The cabinet \ncontained a .357-magnum handgun and several rifles. Although the boys' \nparents told them not to play with the guns, the children were \nnaturally curious. The boys loaded the handgun with ammunition that was \nkept separate from the guns and began playing with the loaded handgun. \nWhile Dylan was handling the gun, it fired, shooting him in the head. \nDylan was instantly killed by the bullet. Now, the lives of this family \nare forever changed, forever damaged.\n  Unfortunately, statistics show that the Pierce family's tragedy \nrepresents part of an everincreasing trend in the United States. \nCurrently, children in the United States are 12 times as likely to die \nbecause of a firearm than children in the other 25 largest \nindustrialized countries. Even more startling, the Centers for Disease \nControl recently reported that nearly 1.2 million latch-key children \nalone have access to loaded firearms. These figures become even more \ndisturbing when you account for the tragedies that could have been \nprevented by safety locks.\n  And while most gun owners properly store their firearms, the sad fact \nis that a substantial number do not, leaving their guns loaded and \nwithin the reach of children.\n  Mr. President, children's natural curiosity should not lead to their \nunnatural deaths. We need to ensure that young people who stumble upon \nhandguns do not meet the same fate as Dylan Pierce or the many other \nchildren who have died or been injured in handgun accidents. This \nlegislation is especially necessary as long as some adults continue to \ncarelessly store their guns, and in places where children may reach \nthem. Preventing these tragic accidents is the sole purpose of the \nChild Safety Lock Act.\n  Our legislation is simple, effective and straightforward. First, it \nrequires that whenever a handgun is sold, a child safety device--or \ntrigger lock--is also sold. These devices vary in form, but the most \ncommon resemble a padlock that wraps around the gun trigger and \nimmobilizes it. Trigger locks are already used by thousands of \nresponsible gun owners to protect their firearms from unauthorized use, \nand they can be purchased in virtually any gun store for less than ten \ndollars.\n  Second, the measure requires that a warning be enclosed with the \npurchase of every firearm. This warning serves as a wake up call to \nmake gun owners aware of the risks associated with improper storage, \nand it also makes them aware of potential state civil and criminal \npenalties for failing to use child safety devices.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not a panacea, but it will help prevent \nthe tragic accidents and deaths associated with unauthorized, unlocked \nfirearms. And it will help ensure that American children do not die as \na result of adult carelessness. President Clinton challenged us to \nenact child safety lock legislation in his State of the Union Address: \nToday we respond to his challenge.\n  Senators Boxer, Durbin, and Chafee join me as cosponsors of this \nbipartisan bill. We ask our other colleagues to join as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 428\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ncertain cash rent farm landlords to deduct soil and water conservation \nexpenditures; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                            TAX LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I introduce important tax legislation to \nimprove our Nation's soil conservation and water quality. This measure \nwill extend the conservation expense income tax deduction to farmers \nwho improve soil and water conservation and need to rent that farmland \nto family members on a cash basis. This legislation builds upon an \nexisting and successful income tax provision that applies to similar \nimprovements on sharecrop rentals. I encourage my colleagues to \ncosponsor this legislation and thereby endorse an environmental tax \npolicy that uniformly encourages conservation improvements on our \nNation's farms.\n  Across all of our Nation's farmland, 4 out of 5 acres rely on private \nlandowners and tenants to care for the natural resources. Even though \nall farmers should be encouraged to become good stewards of the land, \ncurrent tax policy does not provide incentives to encourage all private \nlandowners and tenants to make conservation improvements that are \nconsistent with good environmental policy. On the one hand, farm \nlandlords operating on a sharecrop basis are rewarded with an income \ntax deduction for soil and water conservation improvements. However, \ncash rent landlords who make the same conservation improvements are \ndenied a similar income tax deduction. My legislation will eliminate \nthis inequality.\n\n  Mr. President, 43 percent of our Nation's farmland is rented. Of that \nfarmland, 35 percent is rented on a sharecrop basis, and 65 percent is \nrented on a cash basis. Sharecrop rentals are arrangements where \nlandlords typically contribute the real estate and improvements, and \ntenants contribute the labor. Cash rentals are also arrangements where \nlandlords usually contribute the real estate and improvements. However, \nthe landlords also contribute labor since these agreements exist many \ntimes within a family farm environment.\n  To further compare, sharecrop landlords may deduct certain costs paid \nor incurred for the treatment or moving of earth for soil and water \nconservation, including the leveling, conditioning, grading, and \nterracing of farmland. Likewise, sharecrop landlords may also deduct \ncosts incurred to build and maintain drainage ditches and earthen dams. \nCash rentals, however, are not provided a tax deduction even though \nthey practice similar conservation methods. In other words, though the \nsubstance of these rentals is similar, the tax treatment of \nconservation expenses is vastly different.\n  Mr. President, it may surprise you to know that many family farmers \nare cash rent landlords. The life cycle of a family farm is one where \naging parents gradually pass the family farm to their sons or \ndaughters. In many cases, because the children cannot initially afford \nto purchase the family farms from their parents, a parent-child \nbusiness relationship often starts out as a rental. Sometimes it is a \nsharecrop rental, other times they agree to a cash rent relationship.\n  Unfortunately, our tax and environmental policy toward these two \nrelationships remains irrational. If a landlord sharecrops with a \nstranger, then that landlord can deduct conservation expenditures. \nHowever, if a widowed farm wife cash rents farmland to her daughter and \nwatches over the grandchildren while the daughter works the crops in \nthe field, the grandmother cannot deduct conservation expenditures. \nSimilarly, a retired father who cash rents to his son and provides \nlabor assistance during harvest is likewise denied a conservation tax \ndeduction.\n  I believe that our tax policy should encourage and reward sound soil \nconservation practices regardless of the situation of the farmers. At a \nminimum, our tax policy should reward family farmers who make long term \nsoil conservation improvements to any of their farmland. In fact, these \nsound conservation practices have already aided many farmers in \nreducing our level of soil erosion. The USDA reported in its 1992 \nNatural Resources Inventory that soil erosion has decreased by 1 \nbillion tons annually. The USDA attributes one half of that decrease to \nimproved conservation efforts by farmers. Nonetheless, our Nation's tax \npolicy requires that family farmers on a cash rent basis bear much of \nthe expense of this successful environmental policy. My legislation \nfixes this problem. Surely, it will yield even further soil and water \nconservation of our nation's most valuable nonrenewable resource: \nfarmland.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to cosponsor this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 430. A bill to amend the act of June 20, 1910, to protect trust \nfunds of the State of New Mexico from erosion due to inflation and \nmodify the basis on which distributions are made from those funds; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n[[Page S2210]]\n\n      THE NEW MEXICO STATEHOOD AND ENABLING ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to amend the New \nMexico Enabling Act of 1910. I am pleased to have as a cosponsor, my \ncolleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman. I am also very pleased \nthat identical legislation is being introduced today in the House by \nNew Mexico's Representatives Skeen and Schiff.\n  Mr. President, the Enabling Act of 1910 provided the people of the \nNew Mexico with the authority to convene a State constitutional \nconvention and to organize a State government. As was the case with \nalmost every State west of the Mississippi River, New Mexico was also \ngranted certain public domain lands to be held in trust for the \npurposes of supporting the State's public educational institutions.\n  The New Mexico State Land Commissioner's office has a proud history \nof producing sustained revenues from these State trust lands. These \nrevenues have served the public schools of our State as they were \nintended, by providing for investments in a permanent fund. Mandates \nfor managing the trust lands to sustain the permanent fund, as well as \nthe control of and distributions from the fund are a part of our State \nconstitution. In order to amend the constitutional mandates related to \nthe State trust lands and the permanent fund, the Enabling Act requires \nthat Congress give its consent to the amendments. Today, we begin the \nprocess of allowing New Mexico greater flexibility for investment, and \nprotection of the permanent fund from the effects of inflation.\n  In New Mexico, the State Investment Council is charged with managing \nour State's permanent fund. The council is currently constrained by \nconstitutional mandate, and the Enabling Act, from making certain types \nof investments that would have provided millions of additional dollars \nfor our State's educational institutions over the past 20 years. \nAdditionally, they are currently required to distribute, on an annual \nbasis, the dividends and income from the permanent fund, regardless of \nthe impacts of inflation on the value of its assets. This requirement \nhas also cost the beneficiaries through periodic market value erosion \nof the fund's assets.\n  Mr. President, the voters of New Mexico have spoken. On November 5, \n1996, 67 percent approved amendments to our State constitution that \nwill improve the situation. These amendments give the State Investment \nCouncil the necessary flexibility to prudently invest the assets of the \npermanent fund. Additionally, they restrict the distribution of \nrevenues to a fixed percentage of a rolling 5-year average market value \nof those assets.\n\n  This proposal has broad bipartisan support in our State legislature, \nand from our Governor, Gary Johnson. At this point, I ask unanimous \nconsent to submit for the record a letter of support signed by Governor \nJohnson, and the bipartisan leadership of the New Mexico House of \nRepresentatives and Senate.\n  Mr President, the bill I am introducing today does two things. First, \nit amends the enabling act of 1910, so that it will be consistent with \nthe investment flexibility and permanent fund protection clauses of the \namendments to our State constitution, already approved by the voters of \nNew Mexico. Second, it provides the legal requirement of congressional \nconsent to the amendments, so that they can be implemented by our State \ngovernment. Combined with the State constitutional amendments approved \nthis past November, this bill will provide our State Investment Council \nwith the authority to greatly improve their investment strategies, \nbringing them to par with the vast majority of other public and private \nendowed fund management authorities.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation for the State of New Mexico, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 430\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT TRUST FUNDS OF THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``New Mexico \n     Statehood and Enabling Act Amendments of 1997''.\n       (b) Investment of and Distributions From Permanent Trust \n     Funds.--The Act of June 20, 1910 (36 Stat. 557, chapter 310), \n     is amended--\n       (1) in the proviso in the second paragraph of section 7, by \n     striking ``the income therefrom only to be used'' and \n     inserting ``distributions from which shall be made in \n     accordance with the first paragraph of section 10 and shall \n     be used'';\n       (2) in section 9, by striking ``the interest of which only \n     shall be expended'' and inserting ``distributions from which \n     shall be made in accordance with the first paragraph of \n     section 10 and shall be expended''; and\n       (3) in the first paragraph of section 10, by adding at the \n     end the following: ``The trust funds, including all interest, \n     dividends, other income, and appreciation in the market value \n     of assets of the funds shall be prudently invested on a total \n     rate of return basis. Distributions from the trust funds \n     shall be made as provided in Article 12, Section 7 of the \n     Constitution of the State of New Mexico.''.\n       (c) Consent of Congress.--Congress consents to the \n     amendments to the Constitution of the State of New Mexico \n     proposed by Senate Joint Resolution 2 of the 42nd Legislature \n     of the State of New Mexico, Second Session, 1996, entitled \n     ``A Joint Resolution proposing amendments to Article 8, \n     Section 10 and Article 12, Sections 2, 4 and 7 of the \n     Constitution of New Mexico to protect the State's permanent \n     funds against inflation by limiting distributions to a \n     percentage of each fund's market value and by modifying \n     certain investment restrictions to allow optimal \n     diversification of investments'', approved by the voters of \n     the State of New Mexico on November 5, 1996.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           Office of the Governor,\n\n\n                                                State Capitol,\n\n                                  Santa Fe, NM, February 24, 1997.\n     U.S. Senator Pete V. Domenici,\n     Federal Place,\n     Santa Fe, NM.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: We hereby respectfully request the \n     U.S. Congress amend the Enabling Act for New Mexico. This \n     Amendment is necessary to protect the fund from inflation and \n     to reduce risk by diversifying investments and establishing a \n     distribution formula similar to that used by most other \n     endowments. The Legislature and 67% of the voters from New \n     Mexico voted in favor of amending Article 12, Sections 2, 4 \n     and 7 of the New Mexico Constitution to accomplish these \n     objectives. Since these funds are derived from Federal land \n     granted to the State under the Enabling Act of 1910, it is \n     necessary to obtain the consent of the U.S. Congress before \n     the Amendment can be implemented. The Amendment can be \n     implemented without any cost to the Federal Government.\n       The Amendment changes the method of making distributions to \n     the institutional beneficiaries (primarily public schools, \n     universities and other public institutions) to one based on a \n     fixed percentage (4.7%) of the five-year average market value \n     of the funds, instead of one based solely on interest and \n     dividend income. This method of making distributions should \n     ensure that the fund will grow with inflation, therefore \n     protecting the fund for future generations.\n       Anything you can do to expedite the process of amending the \n     Enabling Act so that we can invest the State's Permanent \n     Funds more professionally and implement the new distribution \n     formula will be sincerely appreciated.\n       Thank you for your help and support of this request.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Gary E. Johnson,\n                                                         Governor.\n     Raymond G. Sanchez,\n                          Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n     Kip W. Nicely,\n              Minority Leader of the House of     Representatives.\n     Manny M. Aragon,\n                                       Pro Tempore, of the Senate.\n     Raymond Kysar,\n                                    Minority Leader of the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Gorton, Mr. \n        Burns, Mr. Craig, Mr. Kempthorne, and Mr. Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 431. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to divide the \nninth judicial circuit of the United States into two circuits, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     the ninth circuit court of appeals reorganization act of 1997\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues, Senators Stevens, Gorton, Burns, Craig, Kempthorne, and \nSenator Smith of Oregon, in introducing the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals Reorganization Act of 1997.\n  Our legislation will create a new twelfth circuit comprised of \nAlaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. This legislation will \nease the current burdens of the ninth circuit, as well as effectively \ncreate a new northwest circuit that is historically, economically, \nculturally, and philosophically united.\n\n[[Page S2211]]\n\n  Mr. President, one look at the contours of the ninth circuit reveals \nthe need for this reorganization. Stretching from the Arctic Circle to \nthe Mexican border, past the tropics of Hawaii and across the \ninternational dateline to Guam and the Marianna Islands, by any means \nof measurement, the ninth circuit is the largest of all U.S. circuit \ncourts of appeal.\n  There is also no denying the ninth circuit's mammoth caseload. It \nserves a population of more than 45 million people, well over one-third \nmore than the next largest circuit.\n  Last year, the ninth circuit had an astounding 7,146 new filings.\n  By 2010, the Census Bureau estimates that the ninth circuit's \npopulation will be more than 63 million--a 40-percent increase in just \n13 years, which inevitably will create an even more daunting caseload.\n  We believe that this legislation is long overdue. Because of its \nsize, the entire appellate process in the ninth circuit is the second \nslowest in the Nation. As former Chief Judge Wallace of the ninth \ncircuit stated: ``It takes about 4 months longer to complete an appeal \nin our court as compared to the national median time.'' Mr. President, \nwhat this means is that while the national median time for filing a \nnotice of appeal to final disposition is 315 days, the ninth circuit \nmedian time is 1 year and 2 months.\n  Furthermore, the massive size of the ninth circuit often results in a \ndecrease in the ability to keep abreast of legal developments within \nits own jurisdiction. This unwieldy caseload creates an inconsistency \nin constitutional interpretation. In fact, ninth circuit cases have an \nextraordinarily high reversal rate by the Supreme Court. During the \nSupreme Court's 1994-95 session, the Supreme Court overturned 82 \npercent of the ninth circuit cases heard by the Court. This lack of \nconstitutional consistency discourages settlements and leads to \nunnecessary litigation.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing is not novel. Since \nthe day the circuit was founded, over a century ago, there were \ndiscussions of a split. Nearly a quarter century ago, in 1973, the \nCongressional Commission on the Revision of the Federal Court of \nAppellate System recommended that the ninth circuit be divided.\n  Additionally, the American Bar Association has adopted a resolution \nexpressing the benefits of dividing the ninth district.\n  Since 1983, Senator Gorton and many others in this Chamber have \ninitiated legislation to split the circuit.\n  There have been Senate hearings. In December 1995, Senator Hatch \nstated in a committee report that:\n\n       The legislative history, in conjunction with available \n     statistics and research concerning the Ninth Circuit, \n     provides an ample record for an informed decision at this \n     point as to whether to divide the Ninth Circuit . . . Upon \n     careful consideration the time has indeed come.\n\n  Furthermore, splitting a circuit to respond to caseload and \npopulation growth is by no means unprecedented. Congress divided the \noriginal eighth circuit to create the tenth circuit in 1929, and \ndivided the former fifth circuit to create the 11th circuit in 1980.\n  The legislation that I and my colleagues introduce today is the \nsensible reorganization of the ninth circuit. The new ninth circuit \nwould embrace California, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii, and the U.S. \nterritories. And the new 12th circuit would be comprised solely of \nStates in the Northwest region. Most importantly, this split would \nrespect the economic, historical, cultural, and legal ties which exist \nbetween the States involved.\n  Mr. President, no one court can effectively exercise its power in an \narea that extends from the Arctic Circle to the tropics. The \nlegislation introduction today will create a regional commonality which \nwill lead to greater consistency and dependency in legal decisions.\n  Mr. President, we have waited long enough. The 45 million residents \nof the ninth circuit are the persons that suffer. Many wait years \nbefore cases are heard and decided, prompting many to forego the entire \nappellate process. In brief, the ninth circuit has become a circuit \nwhere justice is not swift and not always served.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 431\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe designation of renewal communities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n               the american community renewal act of 1997\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today, I am proud to join \ncolleagues on both sides of the Capitol and both sides of the aisle in \nintroducing the American Community Renewal Act of 1997. This \nlegislation addresses the social and economic pathologies currently \nbesetting this country. It helps bring back economic growth and the \nsense of community we need to maintain safe streets, strong families, \nand vibrant neighborhoods. And it does so be bridging the gap between \ntax policies designed to stimulate economic growth and social policies \ndesigned to strengthen our moral fabric.\n  This bipartisan, bicameral bill has the support of members from \ndiverse States and diverse political perspectives. Here in the Senate, \nI am joined by Senators Lieberman, DeWine, Hutchinson of Arkansas, and \nCoats. Meanwhile, Congressmen Watts, Flake, and Talent are introducing \na similar bill in the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, the tragedy of broken homes, drugs, violence, and \nwelfare dependency is so prevalent that some Americans accept it as \nnormal. But broken families are not normal, and neither is the \nhopelessness that lies at the root of community decay. We can and must \nwork to renew our distressed communities, both for the sake of the \npeople living there and for all Americans.\n  We spent $5.4 trillion on the War on Poverty, yet today's poverty \nrate is essentially the same as it was in 1966. The problem was not our \ngood intentions. Nor was it that community decay is an unbeatable \nadversary. Rather, the problem with the war on poverty was that it \nlooked toward Washington rather than to the communities themselves.\n  Mr. President, the Washington knows best approach is a recipe for \ndisaster. Washington can neither end poverty nor give people the habits \nof hard work, civility, and personal responsibility necessary for \ncommunity renewal. But Washington can do something. It can remove \nbarriers and free entrepreneurs and community leaders to reconstruct \nthe fundamental institutions, beliefs, and practices upon which any \nhealth community must rely.\n  Which leaders are we talking about? People like Indianapolis Mayor \nSteve Goldsmith, who is working with local groups like the Indianapolis \nHousing Project and Westside Cooperative Organization. Together they \nare cutting redtape and encouraging community development. They are \nrevitalizing neighborhoods that previously had been written off.\n  In Detroit, Mayor Archer's clean sweep program last year brought \ntogether over 20,000 volunteers in and around that city, along with \ndozens of local community organizations. Their efforts resulted in the \nremoval of over 300,000 bags of trash from our city. Community pride \nwas harnessed, and developed, in this worthwhile endeavor.\n  These are the kinds of cooperative efforts that can revitalize our \ndistressed communities. Such efforts lie behind the American Community \nRenewal Act of 1997. By replacing barriers with incentives, this \nlegislation aims to increase private investment, strengthen family \nties, and effectively fight drugs abuse by reintegrating faith-based \ninstitutions into the public life of our distressed areas. Building on \nthe pioneering legislation sponsored by then-Congressman Jack Kemp in \nthe 1970's, it will create 100 community renewal zones with targeted, \npro-growth tax and regulatory relief, housing assistance and provisions \nencouraging savings, education and investment.\n  A community must meet several criteria to qualify. First, its \nresidents must have incomes well below the average while at least a \nfifth fall below the poverty line. Other measures such as unemployment \nlevels and eligibility for certain Federal assistance programs are also \nconsidered.\n  Second, the community must bring to the table its own package of \nincentives including lower taxes, increased local services, a crime \nreduction strategy, and fewer economic regulations. Mr. President, part \nof rejecting the Washington knows best philosophy is acknowledging that \nnot all barriers to economic and social growth come from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  This legislation calls on local governments to do their part. In \nreturn for these concessions, Mr. President, the community will receive \na number of powerful benefits designed to encourage new businesses, job \ncreation, and economic growth.\n  First, we eliminate the capital gains tax for the sale of any renewal \nproperty or business held for at lest 5 years, we increase the \nexpensing allowance for small businesses for those who locate in the \nzone, and we target low-income workers with a 20-percent wage credit if \nthey are hired by a renewal community business.\n\n  Next, we target additional capital at renewal communities by allowing \nbanks to receive Community Reinvestment Act credit for investments in, \nor loans to, community groups within the zone. The idea is that these \ngroups would then provide loans to local small businesses and \nresidents.\n  Finally, we target environmental blight by providing tax incentives \nfor cleaning up of old commercial and industrial properties located \nwithin the renewal communities. There are tens of thousands of these \nso-called brownfields across the country, Mr. President, and in many \ncommunities they represent the No. 1 obstacle to redevelopment and \neconomic growth. Providing these tax breaks eliminates a barrier to \ninvestment in our renewal communities as it helps preserve undeveloped \nlands inside and outside these communities. For every brownfield that \ngets cleaned and reused, a greenfield is preserved.\n  Important as they are, however, investment and job creation \nincentives are not enough. That is why the Community Renewal Act also \ntargets families and organizations. For families living within renewal \ncommunities, the bill provides new opportunities for saving, owning a \nhome, and sending their children to the school of their choice.\n  The bill provides renewal zone residents with family development \naccounts. These super-IRA's will encourage low-income families to save \npart of their income by making the deposits--up to $2,000 per year--\ndeductible and the withdrawals tax free if used for purposes like \nbuying a house or meeting educational expenses.\n  The bill also provides for the sale of unoccupied or substandard \nlocal HUD homes and housing projects to community development \ncorporations. This provision increases housing opportunities for low-\nincome families, helping them stay together, invest in their homes, and \ncare for their neighborhoods by making them stakeholders in renewal \ncommunities.\n  Finally, there is an opportunity scholarship program. This means-\ntested program allows low-income parents to send their children to the \nschool they think best.\n  Our bill also targets community organizations for assistance. As has \nbeen noted previously, for every social problem we face, there is an \norganization out there that is addressing that problem. This \nlegislation's goal is to stimulate and encourage those organizations in \ntheir work.\n  In San Antonio, Pastor Freddie Garcia runs Victory Fellowship. This \nfaith based drug rehabilitation program has saved thousands of addicts \nin some of the city's toughest neighborhoods. Victory Fellowship offers \naddicts a safe haven, a chance to recover, job training, and a chance \nfor addicts to provide for themselves and their families and 13,000 \npeople have been helped there, with a success rate of over 80 percent. \nBut, because Victory Fellowship is faith based, it has not received any \nFederal help. Also because it is faith based, no one receiving Federal \nassistance is allowed to go there.\n\n[[Page S2213]]\n\n  Mr. President, the American Community Renewal Act would allow local, \nfaith based substance abuse treatment centers like Pastor Garica's to \nreceive Federal assistance. It does so without endangering the \nindependence of the Victory Fellowship and other centers doing similar \nwork, and it does so without forcing religious doctrine upon those who \nseek assistance.\n  And, finally, this legislation stimulates charitable giving in all \nAmerican communities by creating a new charity tax credit for private \ndonations to qualified charities. Mr. President, back in 1986, Congress \neliminated the charitable deduction for families who do not itemize. \nThis change in the Tax Code hurt the ability of charities to attract \nprivate support. To correct this problem, this new credit would be \navailable to all families, even those who do not itemize. To keep the \ncost reasonable, we have capped qualified donations for taxpayers who \nmust also personally volunteer at the recipient charity. Nevertheless, \nwe believe this provision will provide taxpayers with a powerful \nincentive to add their hard-earned money to the war on poverty and \ndrugs.\n  Mr. President, the American Community Renewal Act places its faith in \nindividuals, organizations, and communities all across America to \naddress our social and economic ills. It does so by bridging the gap \nbetween economic and social policy, and the gap between traditionally \nRepublican and Democratic solutions. I am glad to have joined hands \nwith my colleagues to move this initiative forward, and I look forward \nto seeing this legislation enacted into law this Congress.\n  Mr. president, I ask unanimous consent that a detailed summary of the \nAmerican Community Renewal Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the item was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n          The American Community Renewal Act of 1997--Outline\n\n       This legislation focuses on three broad themes: moral and \n     family renewal, personal economic empowerment, and fostering \n     private charity. Our bill allows for up to 100 ``Renewal \n     Communities'' to be established on a competitive basis in \n     both urban and rural areas. To be designated a Renewal \n     Community, state and local governments would have to work \n     together with neighborhood groups to relax zoning, housing, \n     tax, and business rules and regulations.\n\n\n       Title 1: Designation and Evaluation of Renewal Communities\n\n       Establish up to 100 Renewal Communities along the following \n     guidelines:\n       (1) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has the \n     authority to designate these ``renewal communities,'' 25 \n     percent of which must be in rural areas. Designations would \n     be effective for seven years.\n       (2) Areas nominated would have to meet certain criteria and \n     would be ranked on the degree to which they exceeded these \n     criteria. The criteria are as follows: (a) have an \n     unemployment rate of at least 1\\1/2\\ times the national rate; \n     (b) have a poverty rate of at least 20 percent; and (c) at \n     least 70 percent of the households in the area have incomes \n     below 80 percent of the median income of households in the \n     metropolitan statistical area.\n       Nominated areas also would have to meet certain population \n     criteria. These requirements are: (1) the areas must be \n     within the jurisdiction of local governments; (2) the \n     boundary must be continuous; and (3) if it is in a \n     metropolitan statistical area, the population, based on the \n     most recent census data, must be at least 4,000 (1,000 in the \n     case of rural areas) or be entirely within an Indian \n     reservation.\n       (3) Within four months of enactment, the Secretary of \n     Housing and Urban Development would be required to issue \n     regulations to: (1) establish the procedures for nominating \n     areas; (2) determine the parameters relating to the size and \n     population characteristics of ``renewal communities;'' and \n     (3) the manner in which nominated areas will be evaluated \n     based on the eligibility criteria.\n       (4) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development could \n     not designate an area a ``renewal community'' unless: (1) the \n     local governments and the state have the authority to \n     nominate an area; (2) agree to the requirements on state and \n     local governments (described below); and (3) provide \n     assurances that these commitments will be fulfilled; and (4) \n     the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines \n     that the information furnished is reasonably accurate.\n       (5) Before being considered for ``renewal community'' \n     status, state and local governments must enter into a written \n     contract with neighborhoods organizations to do at least five \n     of the following: (1) reduce taxrates and fees within the \n     ``renewal community;'' (2) increase the level of efficiency \n     of local services within the renewal community; (3) crime \n     reduction strategies; (4) actions to reduce, remove, \n     simplify, or streamline governmental requirements applying \n     within the renewal community; (5) involve private entities in \n     providing social services; (6) allow for state and local \n     income tax benefits for fees paid or accrued for services \n     performed by a nongovernmental entity but which formerly had \n     been performed by government; and (7) allow the gift (or sale \n     at below fair market value) of surplus realty (land, homes, \n     commercial or industrial structures) in the ``renewal \n     community'' to neighborhoods organizations, community \n     development corporations, or private companies.\n       Communities would receive credit for past activities with \n     respect to these activities.\n       (6) In addition, before being considered for ``renewal \n     community'' status, state and local governments must agree to \n     suspend or otherwise not enforce the following types of \n     restrictions on entry into business or occupations: (1) \n     licensing requirements for occupations that do not ordinarily \n     require a professional degree; (2) zoning restrictions on \n     home-based businesses that do not create a public nuisance; \n     (3). permit requirements for street vendors that do not \n     create a public nuisance; (4). zoning or other \n     restrictions that impeded the formation of schools or \n     child care centers; or (5). franchises or other \n     restrictions on competition for businesses providing \n     public services, including but not limited to taxicabs, \n     jitneys, cable television, or trash hauling. State and \n     local authorities may apply such regulations of businesses \n     and occupations within the ``renewal communities'' as are \n     necessary and well-tailored to protect public health, \n     safety, or order.\n       (7) State and local governments must agree to participate \n     in the low-income scholarship program provided for in Title \n     IV of this bill.\n       (8) With respect to existing Empowerment Zones and \n     Enterprise Communities, the first 50 designations of Renewal \n     Communities will be offered to existing zones on a first \n     come, first serve basis.\n\n\n           TITLE II: ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT AND TAX ADVANTAGES\n\n       The tax benefits for Renewal Communities are substantial. \n     The tax incentives are as follows:\n       (1) A 100 percent exclusion from capital gains for certain \n     qualified Renewal Community assets held for more than five \n     years;\n       (2) An additional $35,000 of expensing under IRS Code \n     Section 179 for qualified Renewal Community enterprises;\n       (3) A work opportunity tax credit to offset the cost of \n     hiring individuals who are either on Temporary Assistance for \n     Needy Families (TANF), are considered high-risk youth, or are \n     in need of some type of vocational rehabilitation. The \n     maximum credit can be up to $3,000 of first-year wages. The \n     credit only applies to businesses located within the Renewal \n     Community over a seven year period.\n       (4) A commercial revitalization tax credit for the \n     renovation and rehabilitation of qualified, non-residential \n     buildings located within a Renewal Community. The credit is \n     worth up to 20% of the cost of renovation of 5% a year for \n     ten years;\n       (5) Permits taxpayers to expense costs incurred in the \n     abatement of environmental contaminants located within a \n     Renewal Community.\n       Provides Family Development Accounts for the working poor \n     residing in ``renewal communities'' along the following \n     guidelines:\n       (1) As an incentive for low-income working families to \n     save, EITC recipients would be able to put a portion of their \n     credit into a savings account and be rewarded with a federal \n     match. The intent of this section is to provide low-income \n     working families an incentive to accumulate assets and help \n     achieve economic self-sufficiency. Withdrawals from these \n     accounts, known as Family Development Accounts, would be tax-\n     free for the purchase of a home, post-secondary education, \n     emergency healthcare costs or the creation of a small \n     business. Contributions to the account would be limited to \n     $2,000 in unmatched income for a one year period.\n       (2) These FDA accounts may be matched by public and private \n     funds to help low-income families build family assets and \n     become independent from government programs. Matches could be \n     provided by local churches, service organizations, \n     corporations, foundations, and state or local governments. A \n     federal match of this money would also be deposited into the \n     Family Development Account in at least 25 ``renewal \n     communities.'' The funds for these demonstration programs \n     will come from the $1 billion extra Social Service Block \n     Grant program created in the 1993 enterprise zone bill.\n       Provide a new tax credit for charitable giving to private \n     organizations which aid the poor along the following \n     guidelines:\n       (1) The credit would equal 75 percent of the value of \n     donations to qualified charities. The maximum gift for which \n     such credit would be claimed would be $100 for a single filer \n     ($200 for a joint-filing household). This credit would only \n     be active for a three year period. In order to be eligible \n     for the credit, the filer must have completed at least 10 \n     hours of volunteer service for the designated organization \n     over a one year period.\n       (2) In order for the credit to be claimed, the charity \n     which receives the gift: (a). must be predominately involved \n     in the provision of services to persons whose annual incomes \n     do not exceed 185 percent of poverty; (b). must allocate at \n     least 70 percent of its total expenditures to direct services \n     to low-income persons.\n\n[[Page S2214]]\n\n   Title III: Low-Income Educational Opportunity Scholarship Program\n\n       Establish an educational choice scholarship program in each \n     ``renewal community'' along the following guidelines:\n       (1) Parents of children who receive assistance under this \n     program will be free to choose the school which their \n     children will attend from a wide range of types of schools, \n     including: alternative public schools, charter schools, \n     private schools, and private religious schools.\n       (2) Funds under the program may be used (a). to cover the \n     reasonable cost of transportation to alternative public \n     schools or (b). to provide scholarships to pay for tuition \n     and reasonable transportation costs to private, and private \n     religious schools.\n       (3) Each locality will determine the value of scholarships \n     for children in their locality. The maximum value of the \n     scholarship shall not exceed the per capita cost of educating \n     children in a public school in the locality. The scholarship \n     shall have a minimum value which shall not fall below the \n     lesser of: (a). 66 percent of the per capita costs of \n     educating children in the public schools in the locality; or \n     (b). the normal tuition charged by the private school.\n       (4) A parent shall be able to redeem a scholarship at any \n     private or private religious school within the locality which \n     meets the health and educational standards for private \n     schools within the locality which existed as of January 1, \n     1996. All schools which receive these scholarships shall \n     comply with the antidiscrimination provision of Section 601 \n     of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and may not \n     discriminate on the basis of race.\n       (5) The locality may not prohibit parents from using \n     scholarships to pay for tuition in religious schools and may \n     not discriminate in any way against parents who choose to \n     place their child in a religious school. The Senate version \n     of the bill ensures that state and local funds are not used \n     for scholarships where it is prohibited by state law or state \n     constitution.\n       (6) Education funds under this act shall be provided into \n     two tiers: Tier I funds shall be based on the number of \n     school-age children with family incomes below 185 percent of \n     poverty; Tier II funds shall be based on the level of private \n     and public contribution to scholarships in the locality.\n       The level of Tier I funds, which each community shall \n     receive, shall be pro-rated based on the number of school-age \n     children in families residing in the community with incomes \n     below 185 percent of poverty relative to the total number of \n     such children in all localities eligible for funding. 80 \n     percent of the funds shall be dedicated to Tier I.\n       Tier II funds shall equal 20 percent of all education funds \n     under this Act and shall be proportional to the level of \n     contribution to scholarships from non-federal funds (public \n     or private) within the locality.\n       (7) No individual shall be entitled to scholarships. A \n     locality shall allocate scholarships and transportation aid \n     to eligible parents who apply for aid on a first-come, first-\n     served basis or through another mechanism of selection \n     determined by the locality which does not discriminate on the \n     basis of the type of school selected by the parent.\n       (8) If the funds allocated to a locality under this act \n     exceed the total expenditures on transportation aid and \n     scholarships in a locality in a given year, the locality may \n     use the surplus funds to provide for the education of low-\n     income children within the public school system.\n\n\n  Title IV: Faith-based Service Provider Empowerment and Homeownership\n\n       The act would empower neighbhorhood groups, including \n     religious institutions, who want to provide drug treatment \n     and drug counseling activities in the following manner:\n       (1) Modifies existing drug counseling and drug \n     rehabilitation programs. A state may provide drug counseling \n     and drug rehabilitation services through contracts with \n     religious organizations or other private organizations; or \n     may provide beneficiaries with vouchers or certificates which \n     are redeemable for services provided by such organizations.\n       (2) Funds may be used for drug counseling and \n     rehabilitation programs which have a religious content and \n     character, as long as the beneficiary is able to choose among \n     a range of service providers, including those which are \n     religious in character. Such use of funds shall conform to \n     the Supreme Courts interpretation of the Establishment Clause \n     as provided in Mueller v. Allen and Witters v. Department of \n     Services for the Blind.\n       (3) No beneficiary shall be required to participate in a \n     service or program which is religious in character. In all \n     cases beneficiaries shall be given the option of selecting \n     services from a non-religious provider.\n       (4) Except as provided in #3 above, neither the federal \n     government nor a state receiving funds may discriminate \n     against an organization which seeks to provide services or be \n     a contractor on the basis that the organization has a \n     religious character.\n       (5) States would be required to undertake a review of \n     credentialing requirements for drug rehabilitation programs. \n     The goal of this review would be to improve efficiency and \n     effectiveness of programs by reducing credentialing \n     requirements.\n       More low-income families will have the opportunity to buy \n     their first home through the Renewal Community home-ownership \n     provisions. These measures provide for the sale of unoccupied \n     or substandard homes and housing projects located within \n     Renewal Communities and owned by HUD to community development \n     corporations.\n       Finally, the bill would encourage bank lending within \n     ``renewal communities.'' The bill amends section 804 of the \n     Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 and allows financial \n     institutions to receive CRA credit for investments in, loans \n     to, or other ventures with community development financial \n     institutions as defined by the Bank Enterprise Act of 1991 \n     and which are located within ``renewal communities.''\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, from the time I came to the \nSenate in 1989, I have been proud to advocate enterprise zones for \nAmerica's troubled neighborhoods. I think this issue is at the heart of \nthe whole question of what America must do to redeem the promise of \neconomic opportunity for all Americans. I was pleased to work with Jack \nKemp on this issue when he was Secretary of HUD, for the past 2 years \nwith Senator Abraham, and now with Representatives Watts, Flake, and \nTalent.\n  We all believe that not enough is being done to empower those people \nwho live, work, and want to start businesses in our poorest urban and \nrural areas of the country. Any response to the economic distress in \nurban and rural areas which does not include a mechanism to attract \nbusinesses and jobs back to these areas is a response that is destined \nto fail.\n  We took a step toward empowering poor Americans and identifying and \nhelping impoverished communities by passing 1993 legislation creating \nempowerment zones and enterprise communities in more than 100 \nneighborhoods across the country. With the passage of that legislation, \nCongress recognized something that our States have acknowledged for \nmany years: Government loses the war on poverty when it fights alone. \nWhat we really need to do is figure out a way to pull the people and \nthe places with little or no stake in our economic system, into our \nsystem. We need to answer ``yes'' to the question posed by Paul Pryde, \ncoauthor of ``Black Entrepreneurship in America.'' That question is, \n``Can we make the market work for the discouraged, isolated and \nfrequently embittered underclass?''\n  We can, and need, to answer, ``yes.'' The 1993 legislation marked a \nfundamental change in urban policy, by recognizing that American \nbusiness can and must play a role in revitalizing poor neighborhoods. \nIndeed, American business involvement is essential if we are to break \nthe cycle of poverty and the related ills confronting too many cities \nand rural areas today--crime, drug abuse, illiteracy, and unemployment.\n  The 1993 breakthrough was a good start, but we did not go far enough. \nThat's why I am pleased to join with my colleague, Senator Spencer \nAbraham, on a bipartisan basis, in announcing the American Community \nRenewal Act of 1997. We want to help economically distressed urban and \nrural areas by creating 100 community renewal zones, including current \nempowerment zones and enterprise communities created by OBRA 1993, and \nadditional communities meeting poverty and local commitment criteria. \nSpecifically, these zones must have a 20 percent or more poverty rate, \nunemployment of at least 15 percent the national rate, and at least 70 \npercent of households with incomes below 80 percent median household \nincome. Renewal communities will commit to reducing barriers to \nbusiness, such as reductions in local taxes and fees, elimination of \nState and local sales tax, and waiver of local and State occupational \nlicensing regulations except for those specifically needed to protect \nhealth and safety.\n  This legislation will offer targeted, pro-growth tax and regulatory \nrelief to encourage private sector job creation and economic activity \nin impoverished areas. To enhance business and community partnerships, \nwe have included provisions to facilitate additional housing \nopportunities, encourage savings, and offer additional education and \ninvestment opportunities. The CRA credit will facilitate additional \ninvestment and lending to community development financial institutions, \nand family development accounts will encourage low-income families to \nsave part of their income or EITC refund. Family development account \nfunds will be deductible for tax purposes and can be withdrawn tax-free \nif used for qualified purposes. Family and community\n\n[[Page S2215]]\n\nties will be strengthened through new private investment opportunities \nand expanded access to drug treatment in these communities.\n  We cannot give up on our inner cities and impoverished areas. \nGovernment, itself, cannot revitalize these areas. Communities must be \nstrengthened through expanded economic opportunities, jobs, and private \nsector development in people's own local neighborhoods. Only then, can \nour communities save themselves from the vicious cycle of poverty and \nprepare our children for the future. Local partnerships and the \ncommitment of business and communities to improving the economy of our \npoorest areas will provide the cornerstone of the future.\n  Through limited government involvement, enhanced personal \nresponsibility, and the economic freedom of business to grow and \ndevelop, poor communities can become players in our Nation's economy. \nThe American Community Renewal Act helps poor Americans of all \nbackgrounds pursue happiness, and escape from the trap of poverty that \ndefines too many of their lives today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Allard, Mr. Coats, \n        Mr. Enzi, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 433. A bill to require Congress and the President to fulfill their \nConstitutional duty to take personal responsibility for Federal laws; \nto the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n              the congressional responsibility act of 1997\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I introduce a piece of \nlegislation that is being cosponsored by five of my colleagues. This \nlegislation is the Congressional Responsibility Act of 1997.\n  But first of all I would like to recognize the tremendous work of \nCongressman J.D. Hayworth in pushing this legislation during the last \nCongress. As leader of the Constitutional Caucus J.D. has worked hard \nto return to Congress its constitutionally granted authority over the \nlawmaking process, and it is a privilege to be able to work with him on \nthis legislation during the 105th. Congressman J.D. Hayworth will \nintroduce the Congressional Responsibility Act of 1997 along with 30 of \nhis House colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives later today.\n  I believe the Congressional Responsibility Act of 1997 will provide a \npowerful tool in returning to Congress the constitutional \nresponsibility it has abdicated for much of this century to \nunaccountable executive branch bureaucrats.\n  Ultimately this bill is about returning the constitutional \nresponsibility of Congress back to the Congress.\n  Article I, section 1 of the Constitution states, ``All legislative \npowers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress.''\n  I believe that for too long Congress has ignored this provision by \npurposely writing excessively broad laws that are left not to Congress \nfor interpretation but instead to unaccountable bureaucrats. As it \nstands now; Congress writes a law, an executive branch agency then \ninterprets the law and promulgates regulations, and then the agency \nenforces the regulation. The agency in effect becomes both the maker \nand the enforcer of law.\n  This is wrong.\n  I agree with Madison, who wrote in the Federalist Papers that the \nconsolidation of power into one branch of government is tyrannical.\n  This type of consolidation separates the American people from the \nprocess of lawmaking by separating the Congress from the promulgation \nof rules and regulations.\n  Taxation without representation was the charge levied at the British \nGovernment at the birth of our country. I believe a new charge levied \nat our own Government is regulation without representation. I believe \nit is a charge that we must answer.\n  The American people have a right to be heard in the lawmaking \nprocess; and we have a constitutional responsibility to make the law. \nCongress cannot and must not continue to carelessly delegate its \nauthority away to executive branch agencies. In fact, it must take back \nthat which it has already given away.\n  We must be responsible.\n  My bill will make us responsible. The Congressional Responsibility \nAct of 1997 will force Congress to vote on the rules and regulations \npromulgated by executive branch agencies before the rules and \nregulations can take effect.\n  Some will argue that this process will place an increased burden on \nthe Congress who, they argue, already has little enough time to \nconsider all the issues that come before it. This is an understandable \nconcern.\n  The obvious answer is that regardless of the time burden it is still \nour constitutional responsibility to oversee the lawmaking process.\n  But our bill does address some of these concerns. For example, our \nbill will require Congress to vote on every proposed rule or regulation \nin an expedited manner, unless a majority of Members vote to send it \nthrough the normal legislative process. Under the expedited procedure \nthe majority leader of both Houses, by request, must submit a bill \ncomprised of the text of the regulation for consideration. The bill \nmust then come before the respective Chamber for a vote within 60 days \nwith debate limited to 1 hour and not amendable. If the bill is sent \nthrough the normal legislative process it is amendable. If the bill is \nnot introduced the regulation is effectively killed. Congress must act \nfor the regulation to take effect.\n  It is our responsibility to represent our constituents, to create a \nbetter Government, and to ensure the integrity of our democracy by \nalways striving to give those who don't have a voice, a voice. It is \nour duty--it is what we were sent here to do.\n  Constitutional experts from across the country have expressed their \nstrong support for this legislation.\n  Judge Robert Bork and Stephen Breyer have both expressed support for \nthis issue. As well Professor David Schoenbrod at New York Law School \nand Professor Marci Hamilton at Cardozo have written letters strongly \nrecommending that we adopt this bill and reassert our constitutional \nresponsibility over the creation of laws. KU law professors Henry \nButler and Steve McCallister have signed on as well. Professor John \nHart Eli of the University of Miami has endorsed this bill as well.\n  This is a bipartisan concept that has, in the past, enjoyed the \nsupport of people like Senator Bill Bradley, and Nadine Strossen, \npresident of the ACLU. Judge Robert Bork has expressed his support for \nthis concept as well.\n  It is my sincere hope that Congress will act as it ought to act and \nin so doing pass the Congressional Responsibility Act of 1997 and once \nand for all return to Congress the authority it should have never given \naway.\n  I urge speedy consideration of this timely and vitally important \npiece of legislation.\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today as an original \ncosponsor of the Congressional Responsibility Act. I commend my \ndistinguished colleague from Kansas, Senator Brownback, for his \nleadership on this matter.\n  This legislation is an important step toward restoring the intent of \nour Constitution's framers that Congress--not the executive branch--\nmakes the law. For too long, unelected bureaucrats in Federal \ndepartments and agencies have issued rules and regulations that have \nthe force of law but that have never been deliberated by the people's \nelected representatives in Congress. That's not democracy. That's not \naccountability. America is not supposed to work that way.\n  We all know stories of Federal regulations run amok. We know of rules \nthat make no sense, of regulations whose costs far outweigh their \nbenefits, of rules that either don't solve the problem or prove worse \nthan doing nothing at all.\n  Time and again, these senseless regulations hurt real people--people \nwho expect accountability from their Government. Regulations have \nbecome one of the largest burdens on America's small businesses, \nfarmers, ranchers, and private property owners. If Americans are to \nmaintain faith in our democracy, the onslaught of regulation must be \nstopped.\n  Of course, Congress is not perfect either--but at least we are \naccountable to the people. That is why the Framers intended that \nCongress would make laws, and the executive branch would only carry \nthem out. Regulatory agencies should interpret the laws passed by \nCongress--not make laws of their\n\n[[Page S2216]]\n\nown. That is why we need to restore the Constitution's intended \nseparation of powers.\n  This legislation would do just that. It would prevent any Federal \nregulation from taking effect until Congress votes on it. In essence, \nit transforms the Federal regulators into Federal advisors--suggesting \nregulations that Congress may or may not approve.\n  Last year, Congress enacted the Congressional Review Act, which \npermitted Congress to review major Federal regulations. That was an \nimportant first step. This legislation we are introducing today goes a \nstep beyond that--it requires Congress to approve all federal \nregulations. If Congress does not approve, the regulators cannot \nregulate.\n  Mr. President, this bill is an important tool to return \naccountability to the regulatory process. This is about cutting \nGovernment and renewing the basic principle of our democracy--that the \npeople, through their elected representatives, control the Government, \nand not the other way around.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, and I \nurge all of my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. Byrd):\n  S. 434. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to correct \nthe treatment of tax-exempt financing of professional sports \nfacilities; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the stop tax-exempt arena debt issuance act\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to prohibit the use of tax-exempt financing for \nprofessional sports stadiums, the Stop Tax-exempt Arena Debt Issuance \nAct [STADIA], with one modification.\n  The bill I introduce today is identical to S. 122, the previously \nintroduced version of the STADIA bill, in all respects save one. The \nnew version, rather than generally applying to bonds issued on or after \nthe date of first committee action, as specified in S. 122, will be \neffective generally for bonds issued on or after the date of enactment.\n  On February 27, during the floor debate regarding the reinstatement \nof the airport and airway trust fund taxes, the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, raised an objection to the majority \nleader's request that the aviation tax bill be taken up and passed. \nSenator Specter's objection was based on his concerns about the \neffective date of S. 122. In view of the importance of the aviation tax \nlegislation, which is critical to the funding of air safety measures, I \nagreed to revised the effective date of my bill. Senator Specter then \nwithdrew his objection to passage of the aviation tax legislation, \nwhich the Senate proceeded to pass by unanimous consent.\n\n

Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks \nconcerning the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Senate's role in \nconfirming judges.\n  The ninth circuit is enormous. It spans nine states and two \nterritories covering 1.4 million square miles. It serves a population \nof more than 45 million people; the next largest, the sixth circuit, \nserves fewer than 29 million people, and every other Federal circuit \nserves fewer than 24 million. By 2010, the Census Bureau estimates that \nthe population of the ninth circuit will be more than 63 million--a 40-\npercent increase in just 15 years. Given the demographic trends in our \ncountry, it is clear that the population of the States in the ninth \ncircuit, and thus the caseload of the Federal judiciary sitting in \nthose States, will continue to increase at a rate significantly ahead \nof most other regions of the country.\n  To serve its enormous population, the ninth circuit already has 28 \njudgeships, making it by far the largest circuit--and, in fact, larger \nthan the first U.S. Senate. The next largest circuit, the fifth \ncircuit, has 17 judgeships, while the first circuit has six and the \nseventh and eighth each have 11. The average number of judgeships in \nthe Federal circuits other than the ninth is 12.6. Further, the ninth \ncircuit has requested an additional nine judgeships, which would take \nit to 37 active judges, in addition to senior judges.\n  Unfortunately, too often the decisions reached by this circuit have \nhad to be reversed on appeal. According to statistics published in the \nNational Law Journal, in the last six terms of the U.S. Supreme Court--\nfrom the 1990-91 term to the 1995-96 term--the Supreme Court reversal \nrate for the ninth circuit was 73 percent, 69 of 94 cases were \nreversed. The average reversal rate for the other circuits was 61 \npercent, 268 of 442. And so far this term, the high court has \noverturned 10 of the 11 ninth circuit cases it has reviewed. Since \ncircuit judges are simply supposed to apply the law enunciated by the \nSupreme Court, the obvious question is why the ninth circuit gets it \nwrong almost three-fourths of the time the Supreme Court reviews its \ndecisions.\n  Consider, for example, the 11 decisions handed down by the Supreme \nCourt on February 18 and 19. Three of the eleven decisions reviewed \nninth circuit cases. In all three cases, the ninth circuit was in \nconflict with other circuits. In fact, in one case, the ninth circuit \ndisagreed with five other circuits. In all three cases, the Supreme \nCourt unanimously reversed the ninth circuit.\n  Such decisive reversals are not an aberration. Most recently, on \nMarch 3, in a unanimous decision by Justice Ginsburg, the Supreme Court \nreversed an\n\n[[Page S2218]]\n\nen banc ninth circuit decision that Arizona could not require State \nemployees to speak only English on the job. The Supreme Court ordered a \nState employee's challenge to Arizona's English-only constitutional \namendment to be dismissed as moot because the worker resigned 7 years \nago. The high court castigated the ninth circuit. As the New York \nTimes, March 4, 1997, stated, ``Justice Ginsburg was pointed in her \ncriticism of how * * * the Ninth Circuit * * * handled this case.'' For \nexample, Justice Ginsburg wrote, ``The ninth circuit had no warrant to \nproceed as it did.'' Previous opinions have been even more damning.\n  The Supreme Court is able to review only a small number of the ninth \ncircuit's decisions. Thus, in all but a tiny fraction of cases, the \nninth circuit is the court of last resort for more than 45 million \nAmericans. To have so many subject to a circuit that so often errs \nshould concern us.\n  Some have attributed the ninth circuit reversal rate to the unwieldy \nsize of the bench. Others point to a history of judicial activism, \nsometimes in pursuit of political results. I suspect there is more than \none reason for the problem. Whatever the case, the Senate will need to \nbe especially sensitive to this problem when it provides its advise and \nconsent on nominations to fill court vacancies. The nominees will need \nto demonstrate exceptional ability and objectivity. The Senate will \nobviously have an easier time evaluating candidates who have a record \non a lower court bench. Such records are often good indications of \nwhether a judge is--or is likely to be--a judicial activist, and \nwhether he or she is frequently reversed. Nominees who do not have a \njudicial background or who have a more political background may be more \ndifficult to evaluate.\n  As President Clinton noted in response to Senator Dole's criticism--\nof ``activist'' judges--in the last campaign, the Senate has as much \nresponsibility as the President for those who end up being confirmed. \nWe need to take that responsibility seriously --among other things, to \nbegin the process of reducing the reversal rate of our largest \ncircuit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/12/senate-section/article/S2217-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DIVERSIFIED INTERGENERATIONAL CARE, INC.\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I rise to pay \ntribute to a fellow Navy man, Capt. Giles Roderick Norrington, who will \nbe reaching a milestone this Friday, March 14, 1997--the 24th \nanniversary of his release from captivity in North Vietnam.\n  On May 5, 1968, Captain Norrington was shot down on a reconnaissance \nmission over North Vietnam while piloting his RA5C aircraft. He was \nheld in various prisons in North Vietnam where he endured great \nphysical and mental hardships as a POW for 5 years. During those \ndifficult times, Captain Norrington and his fellow POW's never lost \nfaith in their country. They persevered and they returned with honor. \nAll Americans owe these brave men a great debt of gratitude for their \nsacrifices on our behalf.\n  Indeed, Captain Norrington's service and loyalty to his country has \nbeen commendable, not just during his captivity in North Vietnam, but \nthroughout his 34 years of active duty naval service. After his \nretirement from the Navy, he dedicated himself to his community as an \noutstanding member of the Rotary Club of Bailey's Crossroads in the \nState of Virginia. Recently, his fellow Rotarians expressed their \ncontinued support for Captain Norrington by electing him as their next \nvice-president.\n  On Friday, March 14, 1997, Captain Norrington will be surrounded by \nhis family and close friends who will be gathering to pay tribute to \nhim. As a Vietnam veteran who also served in the Navy, I consider it an \nhonor and privilege to share in this tribute, and I look forward to \nthanking Captain Norrington personally for his heartfelt service to our \ngreat Nation and to his own community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/12/senate-section/article/S2218-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA'S BULLDOGS AND LADY BULLDOGS\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am delighted to have this \nopportunity to congratulate the University of Georgia men's and women's \nbasketball teams on their outstanding seasons. Georgia fans all over \nthe country have had the pleasure of watching these two teams play \ngreat basketball in a conference known for its competitiveness. Tubby \nSmith's Bulldogs and Andy Landers' Lady Bulldogs earned No. 3 and No. 2 \nregional seeds, respectively, in the NCAA Tournament, making Georgia \none of only three schools in the Nation to claim two top four seeds in \nthe tournament.\n  Coach Tubby Smith, came to Georgia from the University of Tulsa in \n1995. He led the 1996 Bulldogs to a 21-10 record and their first NCAA \nTournament bid in 5 years. The team won their first NCAA Tournament \ngame in 9 years and made it to the Sweet 16. This year, Coach Smith \ntook a team with no returning starters and tied for the most wins in \nGeorgia men's basketball's 91-year history. As a result of their 24-8 \nrecord, they received the No. 3 seed in the NCAA southeast regional.\n  Coach Andy Landers has been coaching the Lady Bulldogs since 1979. \nDuring his 17 seasons at Georgia, Landers has become one of our \nNation's elite women's basketball coaches. The Lady Bulldogs have \nappeared in 13 NCAA Tournaments, 4 NCAA final fours, and won 5 SEC \ntitles during Coach Landers' tenure. These achievements have earned him \nthe honors of National Coach of the Year for 3 years and SEC Coach of \nthe Year for 3 years. The Lady Bulldogs were the SEC regular season \nchampions and have a record of 22-5.\n  The University of Georgia is fortunate to have individuals of the \ncaliber of Tubby Smith and Andy Landers coaching their basketball \nteams. Not only are these fine coaches teaching their players \nbasketball skills, but important lessons for life--courage, stamina, \ntenacity, and grace under pressure. Although they have enjoyed great \nsuccess throughout their coaching careers, their achievements go far \nbeyond their great talents in coaching. They have given back to their \ncommunity in countless ways. Coach Landers contributes his time and \nenergy to the United Way of Northeast Georgia, and Coach Smith is also \ninvolved in the United Way of Northeast Georgia, as well as the \nAmerican Cancer Society and the American Heart Association. I would be \nhard pressed to enumerate all of their contributions to the University \nof Georgia, the Athens community and to all of the athletes whose lives \nthey have touched.\n  All of the athletes and coaches of University of Georgia Bulldogs and \nLady Bulldogs have displayed their skills and dedication to excellence \nin basketball throughout this entire season. I extend my best wishes to \nthe Bulldogs' and Lady Bulldogs' basketball teams as they begin play in \nthe NCAA Tournament, and to the University of Georgia Athletic \nDepartment for its continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/12/senate-section/article/S2218-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S2219]]\n\n\n\n                             CAFE STANDARDS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak once again \non the matter of corporate average fuel economy standards. Last month, \n12 Senators, from both sides of the aisle, joined with me to introduce \nlegislation--S. 286--to return to Congress the authority for changing \nCAFE standards.\n  This issue is attracting an increased amount of attention as \nAmericans begin to understand the consequences of increased fuel \neconomy standards: less consumer choice, more dangerous vehicles, and \nreduced competitiveness for domestic automobile manufacturers. Perhaps, \nMr. President, some of these repercussions could be easier to accept if \nthe supposed benefits of increased CAFE standards were ever realized. \nUnfortunately, this has not occurred. In the two decades since CAFE \nstandards were first mandated, this Nation's oil imports have grown to \naccount for nearly half our annual consumption and the average number \nof miles driven by Americans has increased.\n  Mr. President, an excellent editorial in yesterday's Detroit News \nillustrates the problems associated with increased CAFE standards, and \nI ask that this article be inserted in the Record immediately following \nmy remarks.\n  The article follows:\n\n                              CAFE Society\n\n       Vehicle fuel efficiency standards represent regulation at \n     its worst: unelected bureaucrats endangering the public at \n     considerable cost while failing to achieve the promised \n     result. Unfortunately, eliminating the existing standards \n     appears to be politically unfeasible. But Congress should \n     seize the opportunity recently provided by members of the \n     Michigan delegation to halt new, more punishing mileage \n     requirements.\n       The issue has taken on renewed urgency with news that the \n     Big Three will fail to meet this year's fuel economy \n     standards--and thus face stiff penalties that would place \n     them at a competitive disadvantage. Fleet mileage averages \n     have fallen with brisk sales of light trucks, sport utility \n     vehicles and vans, which comprise a whopping 44 percent of \n     the new vehicle market--up from 20 percent in 1980.\n       That consumers prefer less fuel-efficient vehicles proves \n     how the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) law has failed \n     to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Nonetheless, the \n     Clinton administration favors stricter standards convinced \n     that increased fuel efficiency will somehow save us from \n     environmental apocalypse.\n       Economic catastrophe would likely hit first. Fortunately, \n     Michigan Sen. Spencer Abraham has introduced legislation to \n     freeze mileage standards at current levels, while requiring \n     Congress to approve any future increase. A companion measure \n     has been introduced in the House by Rep. Fred Upton, the \n     Benton Harbor-St. Joseph Republican. Both bills warrant swift \n     passage.\n       The current federal standard is 27.5 miles per gallon for \n     passenger cars and 20.7 for light trucks. Congress required \n     car standards in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of \n     1975. They left light truck levels to be set by the National \n     Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n       The fact is, consumers respond most directly to market \n     signals, not government dictates. Oil is cheap and plentiful. \n     It is no surprise, then, that the top 10 most fuel efficient \n     cars represent less than 1 percent of overall car and light \n     truck sales.\n       If anything, higher fuel efficiency invites more driving, \n     not less. The average American drove about 9,000 miles per \n     year in 1980, but 11,400 in 1995.\n       Absent an oil crisis, the Clinton administration is left to \n     argue for stricter CAFE standards on environmental grounds. \n     But its case is muddy at best--and deceitful at worst. All \n     new cars must meet the same emission standards regardless of \n     CAFE requirements. Tightening CAFE requirements would do \n     nothing to temper global warming.\n       Stricter standards would cost a good many Americans their \n     jobs--and lives. European and Japanese automakers long have \n     catered to more mileage-conscious markets, which has kept \n     their fleet mileage comparatively high. Tightening CAFE \n     standards would require costly re-engineering by the Big \n     Three, paring the profit margins on their best-selling and \n     most profitable products.\n       Meanwhile, the vehicle downsizing required to boost mileage \n     would only increase highway fatalities and injuries. Current \n     standards are responsible for an estimated 3,000 additional \n     highway deaths and innumerable injuries each year.\n       For two years, Michigan lawmakers have withheld funds that \n     would otherwise have enabled regulators to increase CAFE \n     standards. It makes more sense to rescind NHTSA's authority \n     to change CAFE requirements. That done, Michigan's \n     congressional delegation can turn its attention to outright \n     repeal of what ranks among society's most costly and \n     dangerous regulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/12/senate-section/article/S2219-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BILL O'NEILL\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngreat citizen, a true humanitarian and a dear friend--William F. \nO'Neill, Jr., of Norwich, CT.\n  On March 14, Bill will be receiving the Outstanding Citizen Award \nfrom the Connecticut Rivers Council, Boy Scouts of America for a \nlifetime of humanitarian and altruistic deeds.\n  A World War II veteran, Bill has, and continues to make, untold \ncontributions to the people of Connecticut. He's been a community \nactivist and humanitarian throughout his life, holding leadership \npositions in the Norwich Chamber of Commerce; the Knights of Columbus; \nthe Lions' Club; March of Dimes; and the Norwich Centenary Committee, \nto name only a few.\n  Bill has dedicated his life to making his community a better place \nfor people to live and raise a family. Perhaps his greatest \naccomplishment was the founding of the Rose Arts Festival. Every year \nthousands of nutmeggers flock to Norwich to take part in this community \nevent, where they enjoy entertainment, arts and crafts, and good food.\n  Bill has been recognized on numerous occasions for his tireless \nefforts, perhaps most notably in 1988, when he was presented with the \nKnight of St. Gregory Award by Pope John Paul II, for his many years of \nservice to the Roman Catholic Church.\n  Most recently Bill received the Successful Aging Award from \nConnecticut Care, which honors those over age 70 who continue to play \nan active and vital role in the affairs of their community. Clearly, \nBill has touched hundreds, if not thousands, of lives.\n  I have been fortunate to know Bill and his family for many years, and \nI can attest that he is a man of great integrity, character, and \ntalent.\n  But, Bill is more than just a close, personal friend, he was also a \ndear friend to my mother and father. Currently, Bill is the chairman of \nthe Thomas and Grace Dodd Memorial Scholarship--in memory of my \nparents.\n  Bill's work on behalf of my parents' and their memory is something \nfor which I will always be grateful. But, I am just one of many who \nhave been touched by Bill's generosity and acts of kindness.\n  Connecticut is indeed privileged to be able to call William F. \nO'Neill, Jr. one of its own, and I join all of those who have known \nBill in wishing him congratulations and the very best for the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/12/senate-section/article/S2219-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ORDER FOR STAR PRINT--S. 24\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nBanking Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 410 \nand that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 410) to extend the effective date of the \n     Investment Advisers Supervision Coordination Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, Arthur Levitt, has requested that the Securities and \nExchange Commission be given additional time to prepare for the \nhistoric changes enacted by the last Congress to the Investment \nAdvisers Act. Chairman Levitt requests an additional 90 days before \nthose changes become effective.\n  After careful review and discussion with my colleagues, and with the \nmembers of the affected industries, I believe that it would not only be \nproper but also desirable to give the SEC an additional 90 days to \nprepare appropriate regulations and take other steps necessary to \nimplement last year's legislation.\n\n[[Page S2220]]\n\n  I support this extension, S. 410, of which I am a cosponsor, \nprimarily out of a desire that the necessary rulemaking be done \ncarefully and responsibly. In most respects, I believe that the draft \nregulations published by the SEC for comment faithfully implement the \nlanguage of the National Securities Markets Improvement Act and the \nintent of the Congress. In several instances, in fact, I believe that \nthe SEC has done a particularly fine job in anticipating and responding \nin detail to the various questions that would arise as we implement the \ndivision of regulatory responsibility mandated in last year's historic \nlegislation.\n  As we adopt this bill today, however, I feel compelled to express \nconcern about one point in particular in which the draft SEC \nregulations are deficient. The good work of the Commission in other \nareas of implementing regulations makes this error so glaring. The \ndraft regulations propose to define an investment adviser \nrepresentative's ``place of business'' in a way that runs totally \ncounter to the spirit of the legislation, the intent of the Congress, \nand the clear, plain reading of the language of the law.\n  I am aware that there are those who oppose bringing rationality to \nthe system of securities regulation, who wish to retain superfluous \nlayers of regulatory oversight, and who are not bothered by subjecting \nsecurities professionals to redundant supervision by the Federal \nGovernment and by a multitude of State governments. However, the fact \nis that Congress acted last year to eliminate where possible multiple \nState supervision of securities market professionals, and the SEC rules \nshould not contradict the statute.\n  Under the plain provisions of the law as enacted last year, \ninvestment adviser representatives subject to SEC supervision may also \nbe supervised to a limited degree by the Government of the State where \nthe representatives has a ``place of business.'' When I think of place \nof business for an investment adviser representative, I certainly do \nnot think of a restaurant, an automobile, an airport lobby, or a phone \nbooth, and I would consider it bizarre to think of an adviser's client \nas a ``place of business.'' The implementing regulations must not \nindulge in the creation of this confusion, either.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues today to agree to this \nlegislation to give the SEC an additional 90 days to implement the \ninvestment advisers title of the National Securities Markets \nImprovement Act, and I do so explicitly so that the SEC will use this \ntime wisely to correct the deficiencies in the proposed regulations, \nsuch as the place-of-business definition, and thereby implement last \nyear's act and the will of the Congress, not frustrate it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe deemed read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill \nappear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 410) was deemed read for a third time, and passed as \nfollows:\n\n                                 S. 410\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
