Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nconsider the report of the committee of conference on the bill (H.R. \n4059) making appropriations for military construction, family housing, \nand base realignment and closure for the Department of Defense for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 1999, and for other purposes.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of July 24, 1998.)\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President. I am very pleased to bring before the \nSenate the military construction conference report for fiscal year \n1999.\n  This conference report was adopted by the House of Representatives by \na vote of 417 to 1. It was sent to the Senate and now waits our final \npassage.\n  We have worked hard with our House colleagues to bring the military \nconstruction conference to a successful conclusion. Both bodies took a \ndifferent perspective on the allocation of military construction \nfunding for the Department of Defense. In the final conference report, \nwe met our goals of promoting quality of life initiatives and enhancing \nmission readiness.\n  This bill has some points I want to highlight. It provides a total of \n$8.4 billion for military construction. Even\n\n[[Page S9716]]\n\nthough this is an increase of $665 million over the President's budget \nfor fiscal year 1998, it is still a reduction of $759 million from what \nwas appropriated last year--an overall reduction of 8.8 percent.\n  Some 42 percent of the bill is allocated to family housing--a total \nof $3.5 billion. This includes new construction, improvements to \nexisting units and funding for operation and maintenance of that \nhousing.\n\n  The base realignment and closure part of the bill account for 19 \npercent of our total funding--about $1.6 billion. This encompasses \nfunding for environmental clean-up of the closing bases and \nconstruction of new BRAC-related facilities.\n  I continue to be concerned about the growing costs of environmental \nclean-up at our BRAC installations. These costs frequently continue \nlong after we have closed these bases.\n  We strongly protected quality of life initiatives. We provided $716 \nmillion for barracks, $34 million for child development centers and \n$184 million for hospital and medical facilities.\n  We provided a total of $480 million for the Guard and Reserve \ncomponents. Overall, this represents an increase of $300 million from \nthe President's budget request. Many of those projects will enhance the \nreadiness and mission capabilities of our Reserve and Guard forces, \nvital to our national defense.\n  I thank my ranking member, Senator Murray, for her assistance and \nsupport throughout this process. She and her staff were extremely \ncooperative.\n  I commend this product to the Senate and recommend that it be signed \nby the President without delay.\n  It is nice to see everybody back from vacation and the August break. \nI think most of us had time to travel around our States and talk with \nour folks at home and to bring back maybe some new ideas. I remind this \nbody that for the first time in the history of this country, better \nthan 50 percent of our military forces are found in our National Guard \nand our Reserves. If we continue to trend that way, then the \ninfrastructure that it will take for those folks to be properly \ntrained--and let's face it, those who serve in the Guard and the \nReserves are as dedicated men and women to the national security of \nthis country as anybody else, but they will need the infrastructure in \nwhich to operate.\n  This administration did not really fully fund our infrastructure for \nour Guard and our Reserves, but this Congress did. I congratulate this \nCongress for doing so, because it becomes more and more important every \nday that these dedicated Americans who wish to serve their country as \ncitizens, soldiers, airmen, marines, and sailors have the \ninfrastructure in which to keep them trained and to keep their \ndedication and their morale as high as we can possibly make it.\n  I heartily recommend this conference report.\n  (At the request of Mr. Burns, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record:)\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending military construction \nappropriations conference report provides $8.5 billion in new budget \nauthority and $2.6 billion in new outlays for military construction and \nfamily housing programs for the Department of Defense for fiscal year \n1999.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other actions are \nconsidered, the outlays for the 1999 program total $9.2 billion.\n  Compared to 1998 appropriations, this bill is $446 million lower in \nbudget authority, and it is $412 million lower in outlays.\n  This legislation provides for construction by the Department of \nDefense for U.S. military facilities throughout the world, and it \nprovides for family housing for the active forces of each of the U.S. \nmilitary services. Accordingly, it provides for important readiness and \nquality of life programs for our service men and women.\n  The bill is within the revised section 302(b) allocation for the \nMilitary Construction Subcommittee. I commend the distinguished \nsubcommittee chairman, the Senator from Montana, for bringing this bill \nto the floor within the subcommittee's allocation.\n  Earlier, because CBO had not adjusted its baseline, prior year \nmilitary construction outlays had not been revised to reflect Congress' \noverride of President Clinton's line-item veto of 37 fiscal year 1998 \nprojects. This adjustment would have revised prior year outlays upward \nby $112 million. This $112 million has now been added back to the CBO \nbaseline and CBO's scoring of this legislation. Accordingly, this \nconference report contains no scorekeeping adjustments.\n  I urge the adoption of the conference report.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a table showing the relationship of the \nbill to the subcommittee's section 302(b) allocation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The table follows:\n\n            H.R. 4059, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS, 1999 SPENDING TOTALS--CONFERENCE

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my chairman, Senator \nBurns, in bringing to the Senate our conference report on the 1999 \nmilitary construction appropriation bill.\n  Favorable action in the Senate today will send this conference report \nto the President, making it the first of the regular 1999 \nappropriations bills to be passed by Congress. This is a noteworthy \naccomplishment, and I hope it will set the stage for swift action on \nthe remaining appropriations bills.\n  We had to make some very tough choices on this bill. Our conference \nagreement totals $8.4 billion. This is $760 million less than what was \nappropriated last year. Given the tight budget confines in which we \nwere operating, there were many worthy projects that we could not fund. \nNot one Senator or one State was exempt from this belt-tightening--not \nSenator Burns, not me, and not our leadership. Nevertheless, we held \nourselves to a high standard of fairness and equity, and our conference \nreport reflects that effort. This report satisfies to the best of our \nability the national and international priorities of our military \nservices as well as the regional priorities that our colleagues \nconveyed to us. Most important, it provides funding for scores of \nneeded projects throughout the United States and overseas that will \nsupport America's military personnel, both active and reserve, as they \ncarry out their mission to defend and protect our Nation.\n  The State of our Nation's military readiness continues to be a \npressing concern. Although we often equate readiness with equipment or \ntroop strength, it is important to remember that basic military \nconstruction--troop barracks, family housing, vehicle maintenance \ncenters, and the like--is at the core of military readiness. This bill \nis the vehicle through which we provide the basic, essential \ninfrastructure necessary to support our troops and advance military \nreadiness.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this conference report and \nspeed it to the President for his signature. This is the product of a \nsmooth, fair, and bipartisan process. I commend Chairman Burns for his \nswift and skillful handling of this bill. I commend his staff,\n\n[[Page S9717]]\n\nSid Ashworth, and my staff, Ben McMakin, Christina Evans, and Emelie \nEast, for their diligence and thoroughness in preparing this bill for \nour consideration. It is a good bill, and I hope that all of my \ncolleagues will be able to join me in supporting its passage.\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I stand before the Senate today to express \nmy deep disappointment over the egregious number of low-priority, \nCongressionally earmarked military construction projects that are \ncontained in the conference report on the Fiscal Year 1999 Military \nConstruction Appropriations Bill.\n  I am dismayed that, at a time when our nation's military is \nperilously close to becoming a ``hollow force''--due in great part to a \ndecade of declining defense budgets and increased commitments--members \nof both bodies have once again directed precious funds away from the \nservices' readiness and modernization needs toward their own parochial \ninterests. I am dismayed, but given the long tradition of egregious \nmember adds, I am not surprised.\n  This year's Military Construction Appropriations Bill was crafted \nunder the additional stricture of the Balanced Budget Agreement of \n1997. The agreement established firm funding limits to the National \nDefense budget. With these constraints in place, one would think that \nit would be difficult for members to even consider adding projects of \nquestionable merit. Sadly, the sheer volume of unrequested, low-\npriority projects present in this bill--142 domestic projects in all, \nat a cost of some $977 million--betrays an attitude of ``business as \nusual'' by the members of Congress.\n  I was encouraged by the fact that there were no new projects added by \nthe conferees as they crafted this compromise legislation. That display \nof discipline is laudable. However, it pales in comparison to the gross \nmisuse of critical defense dollars to fund members' pet military \nconstruction projects.\n  Recently the Navy announced that its pilot retention rate is at its \nlowest point since aviation continuation pay was instituted more than a \ndecade ago. The Air Force is currently retaining only 28 percent of its \npilots. The pay of service members lags an embarrassing 14 percent \nbehind the civilian sector. We are deploying some of our forces to \ncombat zones that are not meeting established readiness standards. \nCannibalization rates are increasing. Mission capable rates are \ndropping. Nearly 12,000 personnel are eligible for food stamps. The \nnumber and scope of training exercises have been curtailed as a result \nof insufficient funding, resources and manpower. The list indicating \nthe decaying readiness of our armed forces goes on and on. \nUnfortunately, the congressional response to these critical \ndeficiencies has not been ideal.\n  In this bill alone, there are 45 additional, unrequested Guard and \nReserve projects; five control towers at Air Force bases that currently \nhave operational control towers; twelve child development or physical \nfitness centers; an $8.3 million fence for Fort Bragg; and many more \nprojects of questionable merit--nearly $700 million worth.\n  The fact remains that funds for our national defense are limited. We \nhave a duty to ensure our men and women in uniform are ready to fight \nand win wars decisively, expeditiously, and with minimum loss of life. \nRobbing from readiness to pay for unadulterated, member sponsored \nmilitary construction projects does not contribute to that end.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the day when the Military \nConstruction Bill will be devoid of low-priority, member-requested \npork. I urge my colleagues to exercise the restraint required to make \nthat day a reality. Now, more than ever, the security of our nation \ndepends upon it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of questionable adds be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    QUESTIONABLE ADDS IN THE FY 1999 MILITARY CONSTRUCTION CONFERENCE REPORT                    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       Cost in  \n                 State                              Base                        Facility              thousands \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama................................

Mr. President, I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Military Construction Subcommittee for their work on this \nConference Report. Their efforts are vitally important to this nation's \narmed forces and the national defense.\n  This Conference Report will benefit military bases and military \npersonnel in Connecticut. The Naval Submarine Base in New London, the \nplanned Army Reserve center in West Hartford, and the National Guard \nTraining Center in Niantic each have projects that will be funded when \nthis report becomes law. The total to be spent on these projects will \nbe approximately $14 million.\n  The Conference Report funds badly needed pier upgrades at the New \nLondon Naval Submarine Base. The piers at the base were originally \ndesigned to support SSN 637-class submarines, half of which have been \ndecommissioned. The requirements of contemporary submarines have \noverwhelmed these piers. Power outages on the piers occur, on average, \n80 times per year, and the cranes that resupply the submarines outweigh \nthe piers' design capacity. This project affects military readiness, \nquality of life and the safety of our personnel.\n  The report also includes $1.49 million to take the first step to \nreplace an overwhelmed Army Reserve Center building and free the \ngovernment of a\n\n[[Page S9719]]\n\n$100,000 per month lease. Moreover, these funds will begin a much \nneeded expansion that will enhance the training and readiness of eight \nArmy Reserve units.\n  Finally, the report will fund the planning and design of a new \nNational Guard training center in Niantic, Connecticut. The present \nfacility consists of World War II vintage, temporary wooden structures. \nThey do not meet Army standards for classrooms, dining, or billeting. \nThe National Guard, however, relies on this training center to serve \ntroops from six Northeastern states. Troops of all ranks train at the \ncenter, and the Army and the Army Reserve use the center as well. The \nfunding of the planning and design of the new center is a welcome sign \nto thousands of servicemembers, for it signals a strong commitment from \nthe federal government to the National Guard.\n  One Connecticut project would have replaced an Air National Guard \ncomplex in Orange. The poor condition of the present facility severely \nhinders the 103rd Air Control Squadron from accomplishing its mission, \nand the structure suffers from a variety of building code violations. I \nthank my colleagues on the Military Construction Subcommittee for \nincluding this project in the Senate bill. The project was not funded \nin conference, but I still appreciate the support of Chairman Burns and \nSenator Murray, and I look forward to working with them next year to \nfund this project in Fiscal Year 2000.\n  So, I praise the Conference Committee for their work on this report. \nThey have made some tough choices--this report allocates $759 million \nless than last year. But they have made those choices with the best \ninterests of the U.S. armed forces in mind.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport accompanying the military construction appropriations bill. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.

Will Senators please take their conversations \nto the Cloakroom.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the conversations have not yet been ended. \nMay we have order in the Senate. Mr. President, I hope Senators will \npay attention to the Chair and show some respect for the Chair as well \nas the Senator who seeks to address the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend, the ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee. I remember well the days when I \ncame back from summer vacation, and for the first days of school it was \na little difficult to focus attention. It is good to see colleagues \nagain. I appreciate very much the effort so that we can discuss what \nunfortunately has become a very serious problem.\n  Mr. President, in light of the continued proliferation issues which \nsurround the world and the Middle East in particular, I believe that \nnow, more than ever, it is important for the United States to maintain \nits vigilance with\n\n[[Page S9720]]\n\nrespect to Iraq's insatiable appetite to procure the most terrible \nweapons on earth.\n  Saddam Hussein has attempted to avoid any and every attempt by the \ncivilized world to control and monitor his government's obsession with \nattaining weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein has a proven \ntrack record of his proclivity to utilize these weapons if he does not \nbelieve that the consequences of his actions would lead to his own \ndestruction or at least to severe injury. The continued aggressive \nmonitoring of Iraq's weapons stockpiles is critical to preventing him \nfrom building and using these weapons to make another attempt to \ndominate the region through physical threats to neighboring \npopulations.\n  The recent resignation of Scott Ritter from the inspection team and \nhis reasons for doing so should not go unheeded by this body. The \ncoalition of nations which developed originally to thwart Iraq's \naggression against its neighbors has deteriorated to the point where \neach new confrontation with Iraq becomes a test of wills within the \nUnited Nations and the Security Council. Time and time again, Saddam \nhas scoffed at United States stated policy of ``no compromise'' and \ntime and time he is proven correct. No longer do we punish Iraqi \ntransgressions; we become party to negotiating additional concessions. \nWe no longer lead with resolve; we follow timidly and make excuses for \ndelay and inaction.\n  We must not shirk from our responsibility to have the administration \nand the world understand our commitment to insuring that Iraq abandon \nits weapons of mass destruction program through strict inspections \nprograms and a well defined and consistently implemented set of \nconsequences for non-compliance. To achieve that I have proposed a \nresolution which outlines concerns I have regarding Iraqi weapons of \nmass destruction, calls upon the administration to oppose any effort to \nrelax inspection regimes and has the President submit a report to \nCongress on the United States Government's assessment of Iraq's weapons \nprogram.\n  I understand that the resolution I have proposed has been accepted by \nboth sides and has been included in the bill and I thank the chairman \nand the ranking member and other members of the committee for their \nhelp to include this resolution in this bill which outlines our most \ngrave concerns and calls upon the President to issue a report which \ncertifies the level of compliance by the Iraqi regime to the numerous \nnon-proliferation protocols currently in effect, the effectiveness of \nthese protocols, and the implementation of United States' policy to \ncurb Iraq's weapons program.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the chairman of the committee and the \nranking member for permitting me to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the bill before us is a $12.599 billion \nbill within an allocation of $12.6 billion.\n  While it is below the administration's request of $14.1 billion in \nfiscal year 1999, we provided virtually the same level as last year's \nfunding. If we compare last year's level with this year, including \narrears, both bills are approximately the same level--$13.1 billion.\n  Fortunately, we can achieve this level because Senator Domenici and \nthe Budget Committee decided to give arrears special treatment \nrelieving scoring pressure.\n  Let me review some of the highlights which many members have \nexpressed interest in.\n  For the first time we have reduced the level of support for Israel \nand Egypt. This is the first reduction of a planned 10 years, evenly \ndistributed schedule. We reduced Israel's economic aid by a total of \n$120 million to $1.080 billion and increased security assistance by $60 \nmillion to $1.860 billion.\n  There is no increase in security assistance for Egypt so to maintain \nproportionality we have only reduced the economic aid program by $40 \nmillion to $775 million. Security assistance stays constant at $1.3 \nbillion.\n  We have also tried to preserve a relatively strong level of funding \nfor the New Independent States which most of us agree need the help to \nfinish their transition to free market democracies. In total we have \nprovided $740 million.\n  Within the NIS account we have continued to earmark levels for three \ncountries, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia.\n  Although I strongly support securing Ukraine's political and economic \nindependence, and believe we should do all we can to help, I must \nconfess some frustration with the pace of reforms in that country. It \nis clear the economic environment in Ukraine is very difficult to work \nin. In particular, the government has been slow to recommend--and the \nRada even slower to pass--essential tax and commercial law reforms, the \nkey to attracting and expanding private investment.\n  Because of the slow pace of reforms, the bill reduces the overall \nlevel of support for Ukraine from $225 million to $210 million. The \nbill also authorizes the Secretary of State to withhold 50 percent of \nthe funds for 120 days until she certifies that the Ukrainians are on \nthe right track and have made progress in their tax and commercial \nstructure and demonstrated a serious commitment to economic reforms. \nThis will not be easy, but I believe President Kuchma has recognized it \nis in Ukraine's interest to advance and accelerate reforms.\n  Ukraine is not the only weak and worrisome economy. Since working on \nthe 1993 bill, Senator Leahy and I have both expressed concern about \nthe inconsistent and slow pace of reforms in Russia which are very much \nin the news this very day. August headlines once again demonstrate our \naid and that of other donors is not achieving crucial and sustainable \nresults.\n  For at least 4 years, we have all read the same headlines. Russia \nfaces imminent financial collapse and Moscow calls for immediate \ninternational support, always with a measure of justifiable urgency. \nThere are round the clock negotiations, in which Moscow, once again, \nagrees to all the right tough financial, tax and economic reforms, \ndonor funds are disbursed, there is a deep sigh of international \nrelief, and then absolutely nothing happens.\n  I have repeatedly warned officials at Treasury that it seems unwise \nat the very time we are dismantling our welfare system here at home, \nthat we create a new program of destructive dependency abroad. Russia's \naddiction to international loans is not healthy--for their economy or \nour interests. The administration must follow through and use our aid \nfor programs which will sustain the needed tax and commercial reforms \nor the current crisis will only get worse, if that is possible.\n  The crisis in investor confidence and the flight of capital is not a \nrecent event. In fact this latest crisis reflects how little foreign \ncapital has been invested in generating jobs, income and growth in \nmanufacturing and production. The collapse we are witnessing is driven \nby the fact that the Russian budget and economy are fueled primarily by \ntwo sources--international loans and the artificially inflated bond \nmarket. Given the choice between the promise of a government bond \nreturn of 150 percent or sinking capital into an industrial plant where \nthere are no commercial regulations protecting contract sanctity or \ninvestment, money has moved into Moscow's bond market.\n\n  But, even that investment has been slim compared to other global \neconomies. Before the stock market was closed, only a handful of \ncompanies were being traded, each losing enormous ground. Reports of 80 \npercent losses in value in such thin markets exaggerate the impression \nof the scale of trade and more importantly hid the real story. A few \ncompanies lost, and are losing, a lot of money. However, real, long \nterm investment in Russia's productive capacity has never really grown. \nWith no equity, no real investment to back it, the Russian ruble was \nbound to collapse calling attention to the basic problems with the \ncommercial environment which neither the administration nor the Yeltsin \ngovernment have been willing to tackle. Now, there is little chance--\nbut no choice to carry out overdue reforms.\n  Let me add one more caution. This overhaul should not be the IMF's \nformula response. Raising taxes in an economy where there is little \nincome and less growth isn't painful; it's stupid. Some Russian \nentities, most notably Gazprom, clearly have evaded tax\n\n[[Page S9721]]\n\ncollection in the past, at the expense of starved government coffers. \nBut, in general higher taxes are not going to solve Russia's long term \ncrisis. Confidence and investment will only be restored and expanded by \nreforms which implement and enforce a rational, consistent commercial \nrule of law.\n  While the NIS accounts is both large and important, I think the core \nof this year's bill has been defined by events in Asia. What is new \nthis year is the serious commitment we have made to support our trading \npartners, allies and friends across the Pacific, as they work through \nthe most turbulent economic conditions they have experienced since \nWorld War II.\n  There are several Asian related initiatives worth noting.\n  First, in title VI, we include full support for the new arrangements \nto borrow and the quota to replenish depleted resources for the IMF. \nAfter extensive discussion and debate, the Senator voted for a bill \nwhich provided both funding and reforms in the management of the IMF. \nThis bill includes the Senate passed version in its entirety.\n  Many share my concern that the IMF, and other international \ninstitutions, have been remote, indifferent and very closed societies \ndominated by foreign bureaucrats who are happy to take our money and \nspend it without accountability to any public authority or government.\n  This legislation takes a first step toward opening the IMF's doors \nand shedding light on their management polices and practices. I don't \nwant anyone to conclude that the IMF will be as accessible as your \ncredit union on the corner, but we have started a process which I hope \neventually will produce a better managed and more open, accountable \ninstitution.\n  While I was less concerned in the Spring about the IMF's financial \nstanding, I now believe the time has come for the Congress to complete \nour commitment. The recent repackaged $22 billion Russian loan \ncompelled activation of Fund's reserve line of credit known as the \nGeneral Arrangements to Borrow which this legislation will replenish. \nWith the possibility of new requirements in Asia and closer to home in \nLatin America, I think the Fund's solid financial footing avoids \nfurther U.S. bilateral commitment of funds and is key to the recovery \nof our Pacific trading partners which, I expect, in turn, will help \nstave off a slow down of our economy.\n  In addition to replenishing the IMF, we have recommended other steps \nto strengthen the Asian economies. We have increased the subsidy for \nthe Export Import Bank significantly over last year, which was not easy \ngiven the overall budget pressure. However, export support is more \nimportant than ever for the U.S. economy, especially as our traditional \npartners suffer setbacks and devaluations making their products cheaper \nand more competitive on the world market.\n  In addition to our commitment to U.S. financial institutions deeply \nengaged in Asia, this bill also specifically addresses the crisis in \nIndonesia, Burma and Cambodia.\n  Senator Stevens and Inouye have been especially concerned by the \ncollapse of the Indonesia economic and political situation, as all of \nus have. This time last year, I was convinced that the collapse in \ninvestor confidence, driving the rupiah down to devastating new lows \neach week, would only be reversed with a major political change. I \nbelieved then, as now, that until elections are held, and the country \nis provided honest, strong democratic leadership, Indonesia is destined \nto struggle, if not fail,\n  Suharto's departure was welcome, but long overdue. He has left behind \na shell of a government and the risk of more violence and instability \ngrows. In this context, I have been deeply disappointed by AID and the \nadministration's slow response to Indonesia's problems. Indonesia \ncontinues to be the regional economic undertow dragging down and \npotentially drowning each of her neighbors. The IMF, the World Bank, \nthe Asian Bank, and AID all lack a clear, consistent strategy on how to \naddress this crisis.\n  At this point conservative estimates suggest at least 60 million \npeople are unemployed placing pressure on virtually every family. This \nbill provides $100 million to launch a serious economic and political \neffort to help put the country back on track. It directs funds to \nstrengthen political parties to assure quick and fair elections and it \nprovides food, medical, job generating an related humanitarian \nassistance. But what is equally important is it will compel AID to \ncarry out this support outside the cozy, long standing relationship \nwith official ministries and their bureaucrats. The bill requires 80 \npercent of the aid be administered through non-government organizations \nwhich not only will ease suffering but also help build new, grass roots \naid delivery mechanisms and strengthen the next generation of political \nand economic leaders.\n  Next, the bill expands political and humanitarian support to Burma. I \nthink we are at a point where our ASEAN partners agree the junta in \nRangoon has gone too far. I commend Secretary Albright for her public \nstatements and effort to secure the return of the legitimate government \nand urge her to continue her crucial work in the days ahead.\n  While I have confidence in her commitment, much of her effort seems \nto be undermined by events in country. To assure American policy and \npractice are consistent both in Washington and in Rangoon, I have set \naside $2 million which may be expended only after written consultation \nwith the legitimate government elected in 1990. This is not a \nprecedent--there has been past dialog between other donors and the \nlegitimate government establishing guidelines for the administration of \ndevelopment aid. I do recognize this may be difficult to accomplish, \nbut U.S. policy and practice must press forward and actively include \nthe 1990 government in any dialog which involves our funds. Ultimately, \nthese funds may simply sit in trust for a future free day in Burma, but \nI think our support for democracy must be in both words and financial \naction.\n  For the past 2 years, I have held deep reservations about American \nembassy officials failure to support the restoration of democracy, but \nthat is a debate for another day. What I hope to achieve today is a \nclear statement and representation of support for those who suffer the \nbrutality of the regime by increasing our humanitarian aid and, to make \nabsolutely clear support or the legitimate government which we should \nbe working with rather than against.\n  Finally, and briefly, I want to turn to Cambodia. I am deeply \nconcerned that the environment leading up to elections was not \nconducive to a free and fair outcome. While the turnout was high, as we \nall know, elections are less about election day and more about the \nweeks and months beforehand.\n  After Hun Sen's bloody coup in which scores of people were killed and \nmany fled the country, his junta seemed to recognize the need to \nestablish some margin of legitimacy or face a cut off of all \ninternational aid. Hun Sen called for elections and then for months \nsystematically denied any opponent any real opportunity to campaign. At \nleast 49 people were targeted and assassinated in politically motivated \nhits. Candidates were denied access to the press, and restricted from \ngiving speeches, holding rallies or meeting and getting their message \nout to voters.\n  While the opposition urged a delay in the election date, the \nAdministration decided to support moving forward. Now there are real \nquestions about the final outcome with opposition challenges over fraud \nand irregularities. Whatever the outcome, what is very clear is many of \nthe candidates who returned to Cambodia to campaign did so at \nconsiderable risk. Sam Rainsy and his party members and FUNCIPEC \ncandidates, all put their lives on the line to run for office, to \nreclaim their nation.\n  I believe it is vital to stand by their commitment to democracy and \nassure their risk was not in vain. Thus, aid to Cambodia is conditioned \nupon certifications related to the fairness of the elections and the \nprospects for real democratic growth. Humanitarian aid and development \naid provided through non-government organizations can proceed \nregardless, but it makes no sense to prop up a vicious, selfserving \ndictatorship.\n  In conclusion, the market slides and crashes across Asia have \nconvinced even the most isolationists among us that our economic and \npolitical security interests are defined and can be\n\n[[Page S9722]]\n\ndamaged by events as far away as Jakarta. With increased export \nassistance, by expanding humanitarian and economic initiatives, and \nbuilding programs, to strengthen independent, democratic institutions \nworldwide, I believe this bill supports and secures U.S. interests in \ninternational economic growth and political stability, while living \nwithin the balanced budget agreement.\n  I encourage my colleagues' support.\n  I certainly urge my colleagues to support the bill. That completes my \nopening statement. Senator Leahy will probably want to make an opening \nstatement.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Andrew \nWeinschenk, a fellow in Senator Lautenberg's office, be granted the \nprivilege of the floor for the duration of debate on the foreign \noperations appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last year we completed debate on the \nforeign operations bill in record time. This year the bill contains \n$250 million less than last year, so I hope it will take even less \ntime.\n  The bill represents a delicate compromise. As I said, we have a lot \nless money this year, and since almost half the funds in this bill is \nearmarked for the Middle East, the quarter-billion-dollar cut from last \nyear has to come out of other programs. That is a very significant cut. \nIt is over $1 billion below the President's request.\n  A quarter of a billion dollars may not be a lot in some budgets, like \nthe defense budget, but it is a great deal when it means cuts in \nfunding for diplomacy and programs to--and I will give you examples of \nthe areas we are cutting--support for U.S. exports, or to promote \neconomic reforms in the former Soviet Union and democracy in Indonesia, \nor to aid refugees in Bosnia and support business exchange programs in \nEastern Europe, or money to combat the spread of illegal drugs and \ninfectious diseases. Infectious diseases--Mr. President, I remind \neverybody that the most virulent disease in the world is only an \nairplane trip away from any one of our homes in the United States. And, \nof course, money to protect the environment.\n  These are but a few examples of what is in this bill and what we have \nhad to cut because of this year's low budget allocation.\n  Having said that, I commend the chairman of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee. Senator McConnell has done an outstanding job to try to \nmake the most of the funds we have in as balanced a way as possible. No \none can be entirely happy with what we have done, because we don't have \nthe money to make everybody happy. I think the chairman has done his \nbest to honor the many requests of the Senators on both sides of the \naisle and to fund the foreign policy priorities of the United States.\n  I also thank the committee chairman, Senator Stevens, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Byrd, for their help. They have a difficult job in \ntrying to balance the interests of all the appropriations \nsubcommittees. I know they have tried to give us the funds we need and, \nat the same time, stay within the parameters of the balanced budget \nagreement.\n  I simply note that the entire foreign operations budget amounts to \nless than 1 percent of the Federal budget, but these are the funds we \nuse besides the defense budget to promote our influence around the \nworld. There is not a Senator here who does not want to protect our \nnational interests. Those national interests can be in Korea or they \ncan be in our own hemisphere. But for the United States, the most \npowerful, wealthiest nation history has ever known, the United States \nwhich has become that way because we have worldwide interests, it is \nhard to point to any part of the world on any continent of the world \nwhere our interests are not involved. All of us like to say, ``Well, we \nare the United States--we should influence this, that, or the other \nthing in the world.'' If we are going to do that, we have to have the \npower to do it, too.\n  It is like saying you want to go to such and such a spot, in your \nState, but if there are no roads and no way to get there, then you are \nnot going to do it. And the cost to carry out our responsibilities and \nto project our influence worldwide is not something that is going to be \npicked up by the State or local governments.\n  These programs are not ``foreign handouts'' as some have called it. \nThey are going to determine the kind of world in which our children and \ngrandchildren live 10, 20, 50 years hence.\n  Frankly, I do not believe this bill adequately funds our foreign \npolicy and national security needs. As a superpower that is \nincreasingly dependent on the global economy--in the last 2 days if \nthere is anybody who did not realize we were dependent on the global \neconomy, wake up; we are. As a superpower intent on solving global \nproblems by leading by example, I think we are going to look back years \nfrom now and wonder why we were so shortsighted.\n  Leadership and security are not just abstract concepts, they cost \nmoney. The amount in this bill is a pittance for a superpower that has \nimportant interests to protect on every continent, important American \ninterests to protect on every continent.\n  Mr. President, if history is any guide, I think the chairman and I \ncan expect there will be Senators who have amendments to shift funds \nfrom one account to another in this bill. They may feel we have done \ntoo little for their favorite program. And they may be right. But we \nhad to make some very painful choices, choices we would not have had to \nmake if we had a larger budget to begin with. The chairman and I are \ngoing to have to oppose such amendments.\n  This is a very delicately put together piece of legislation, based on \nthe allocation we have. I might have done things differently if I were \nchairman. And the 98 other men and women in this body may have each \ndone it somewhat differently. But we have to have one bill. The Senator \nfrom Kentucky and I have worked very closely together to balance the \ninterests of both sides of the aisle, the interests of the United \nStates and the interests of the administration, the interests of the \nU.S. Senate. With the funds we have, I think we should go forward with \nthis bill as it is. If there are amendments, I would hope that they \ncome up; if there are not, I am prepared to go to third reading.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 3492 and 3493 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send to the desk two amendments \nmodifying language included on global climate change. Senators Byrd and \nHagel have been very involved in this issue and have recommended these \nchanges so that programs can go forward, but Congress will have an \nopportunity to determine details on the planned activities.\n\n[[Page S9723]]\n\n  It has been very difficult to pin down just what the administration \nplans to do in the area of global climate change. I think these \namendments strike the appropriate balance and meet the concerns raised \nby colleagues who want to maintain a U.S. leadership role on \nenvironmental issues, yet at the same time preserve the congressional \noversight of these activities.\n  So I send, Mr. President, both of these amendments to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for himself and \n     Mr. Leahy, proposes amendments numbered 3492 and 3493 en \n     bloc.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 3492\n\n            (Purpose: To amend the Foreign Operations bill)\n\n       On page 71, line 17, after the word ``activities'' insert: \n     ``and, subject to the regular notification procedures of the \n     Committees on Appropriations, energy programs aimed at \n     reducing greenhouse gas emissions''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3493\n\n            (Purpose: To amend the Foreign Operations bill)\n\n       On page 107, line 25, strike ``and activities that reduce \n     vulnerability to climate change.''\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Leahy and I believe there is no opposition to \nthese amendments on either side of the aisle.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky is right. I \nsupport the pending amendment.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss with \nthe subcommittee chairman, Senator McConnell, his amendments to modify \nsection 540(b) and section 752(a) of the bill, modifications which I \nstrongly support.\n  It is my understanding that the purpose of the change to section \n540(b) is to make clear that funds in the bill may be used, \nnotwithstanding any other provision of law, to support energy programs \naimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, because of \nconcerns expressed by certain senators that requests to AID for \nspecific information about these activities was not provided and that \nthey therefore have been unable to determine precisely what these funds \nwere used for, they requested that these funds be subject to the \nCommittees' regular notification procedures. Does the subcommittee \nchairman agree that the purpose of subjecting these funds to the \nnotification procedures is not to prevent funding for these activities \nnotwithstanding any other provision of law, since we could have done \nthat by simply leaving the section as it is, but rather to be sure that \nthe Congress gets the information it requests?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator is correct. AID has not been responsive to \nthe requests of senators for information about these activities. We are \nadding the notification requirement to section 540(b) in order to \nensure that information that is requested about certain energy programs \nis provided in a timely way.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you. I would like to take another minute to ask the \nsubcommittee chairman about section 572(a) of the bill, which makes \nfunds available for certain environmental activities subject to the \nregular notification procedures of the committees. The language is \nquite broad, and it includes any activities promoting country \nparticipation in the Framework Convention on Climate Change. Again, I \nwant to be clear about the purpose of this provision. It is my \nunderstanding that, like section 540(b), it was included due to \nconcerns expressed by some senators that AID has not been sufficiently \nresponsive to requests for information about the expenditure of certain \nfunds for these activities. The information that was provided was very \ngeneral and did not fully describe what the funds were used for. It is \nmy understanding that this provision does not seek to prevent funding \nfor these activities, but instead aims to ensure that when senators \nrequest AID to provide specific information about its use of these \nfunds the information is provided in a timely way.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the managers of the bill would entertain a question, it \nis my understanding from their explanation that their intent in \nincluding the notification requirements in sections 540(a) and 572(b) \nis to support these activities, and to ensure that information the \nCongress asks for is provided by the administration. I want to be sure \nthat, assuming the administration keeps the Congress informed about how \nappropriated funds are to be spent, the Congress intends for these \nprograms to receive the necessary funds. Am I correct?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is my intention.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As the author of these provisions that is also my \nintention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3492 and 3493) were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3494\n\n       (Purpose: To make technical corrections)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send a package of technical \namendments to the desk. It is a fairly long list, but essentially \ninvolves corrections, language inadvertently left out, changes to \nassure consistency and date corrections. For example, the word \n``appropriated'' was struck in one instance and replaced with the \ntechnically correct ``made available.'' I send these technical \namendments to the desk and ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for himself and \n     Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 3494.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 5 and 6, strike ``1999 and 2000'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof, ``1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002''.\n       On page 8, line 23 and 24, strike ``, and shall remain \n     available until September 30, 2000''.\n       On page 13, line 13, insert ``demining or'' after the words \n     ``apply to''.\n       On page 13, line 14, strike ``other''.\n       On page 21, line 3, strike ``other than funds included in \n     the previous proviso,''.\n       On page 29, line 9, strike ``appropriated'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``made available''.\n       On page 29, line 13, strike ``deBremmond'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``deBremond''.\n       On page 31, line 23, insert ``clearance of'' before \n     ``unexploded ordnance''.\n       On page 39, line 1, insert ``may be made available'' after \n     ``(MFO)''.\n       On page 40, lines 5 and 6, strike ``Committee's \n     notification procedures'' and insert in lieu thereof, \n     ``regular notification procedures of the Committees on \n     Appropriations''.\n       On page 49, line 2, insert after ``commodity'' the \n     following, ``: Provided, That such prohibition shall not \n     apply to the Export-Import Bank if in the judgment of its \n     Board of Directors the benefits to industry and employment in \n     the United States are likely to outweigh the injury to United \n     States producers of the same, similar or competing commodity, \n     and the Chairman of the Board so notifies the Committees on \n     Appropriations''.\n       On page 57, line 17, insert ``disease programs including'' \n     after ``activities or''.\n       On page 84, beginning on line 25, through page 85, line 5, \n     strike all after the words ``The authority'' through the \n     word, ``countries'' and, insert in lieu thereof, ``Any \n     obligation or portion of such obligation for a Latin American \n     country, to pay for purchases of United States agricultural \n     commodities guaranteed by the Commodity Credit Corporation \n     under export credit guarantee programs authorized pursuant to \n     section 5(f) of the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act \n     of June 29, 1948, as amended, section 4(b) of the Food for \n     Peace Act of 1966, as amended (Public Law 89-808), or section \n     202 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, as amended (Public \n     Law 95-501)''.\n       On page 90, on lines 1, 5, and 15 before the word \n     ``Government'' insert the word ``central''.\n       On page 90, line 13, after the word ``re-signed'' insert \n     the word ``or is implementing''.\n       On page 91, line 24, before the word ``Government'' insert \n     the word ``central''.\n       On page 95, line 5, delete ``steps'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof, ``effective measures''.\n       On page 95, line 7, strike the word ``further''.\n       On page 106, line 8, strike ``1998 and 1999'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``1999 and 2000''.\n       On page 109, line 21, strike ``any''.\n       On page 117, line 24, after ``remain available'' insert \n     ``until expended''.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe there is no objection to \nthese technical amendments.\n\n[[Page S9724]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. There are no objections, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3494) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, those are the only amendments I am \naware of as of this moment. So we are moving right along, I say to my \nfriend.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Kentucky, I said \nearlier we did it in record time last year. We may break that now. \nAgain, I am perfectly willing to go forward and wrap it up. There may \nbe some who feel otherwise.\n\n\n                   community-based telecommunications\n\n  Mr. President, organizations such as the National Telephone \nCooperative Association are able to help provide new and innovative \nmethods to bring modern telecommunications service to rural and remote \nareas around the globe. Such initiatives, particularly those that \nencompass a grass-roots, community-based approach, are key to economic \ndevelopment, business creation and income generation. They enhance \neconomic stability, create jobs, improve agricultural production and \nfurther the development of democratic processes and traditions.\n  The committee has, in the past, encouraged AID to work with \norganizations like the National Telephone Cooperative Association to \nbring modern means of communication to rural areas. Cooperatives foster \ncommunity involvement and help to build civil society--important steps \nalong the path away from a socialist, government-controlled economy \ntoward a free-market economy. These programs are just the type that we \nshould be promoting in the Ukraine and other NIS states, where any \ngrowth in the private sector represents a challenge to the government \nand encourages sustainable income generation and economic growth on a \nlocal level.\n  Another program that the committee urged AID to support was rural \ntelephone cooperative programs in Poland, which have achieved \nsignificant success. The on-going program in the Philippines has also \nseen success. However, this project is in need of continued \nparticipation by AID's country and central programs. AID should also \npromote the development of telephone cooperatives in Africa. Countries \nin the Horn, Ghana, and South Africa are poised for developing useful \nrural telecommunications. There is no doubt that in addition to \npromoting economic growth, rural citizens in these countries would \nbenefit enormously.\n  For these reasons, I encourage AID to continue to work with telephone \ncooperatives in the United States to foster community-based \ntelecommunications programs in the developing countries. I hope that \nlanguage to this effect can be included in the conference report on \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/01/senate-section/article/S9719-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO PRESBYTERIAN DISASTER ASSISTANCE OF LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, while we have a moment, I would like to \nrecognize an organization from my home state of Kentucky which has been \non the front lines responding to international disasters.\n  The Presbyterian Disaster Assistance (PDA), headquartered in \nLouisville, has responded to international disaster issues in 37 \ncountries and has mission relations in 80 countries. It is dedicated to \nresponding to national and international disasters, aiding refugees and \ndisplaced persons, assisting refugee resettlement, educating the \nworld's children, and making efforts designed to foster development \nabroad. Clearly, it has made a difference in the world and brought hope \nto the needy.\n  Just recently, following the tragic bombings in Kenya and Sudan, PDA \nprovided the staff services of its eye clinic and specialized \northopedic rehabilitation center for victims. PDA also worked closely \nwith the Presbyterian Relief and Development Association of Sudan.\n  In early summer, Presbyterian Disaster Assistance, in cooperation \nwith other organizations, was able to provide a shipment of fishing \nsupplies to over 25,000 households in the Upper Nile Region where the \nability to fish the rivers will keep these people from slipping into \nthe grip of famine. PDA was able to serve people across several ethnic \nboundaries, ensuring that this assistance benefited those most in need.\n  Mr. President, I know the entire Senate joins me in saluting the \ncourageous work of Presbyterian Disaster Assistance. It gives me a \ngreat deal of pride that this organization which offers such important \nand valuable service is headquartered in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. \nWe all hope for a time when the efforts of organizations such as PDA \nare not necessary, but until that occurs we can take comfort that the \njob will be undertaken with vigor, compassion, and expertise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/01/senate-section/article/S9724-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9724-S9730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3495\n\n (Purpose: To provide a limited waiver for certain foreign students of \n the requirement to reimburse local educational agencies for the costs \n                      of the students' education)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Would the Senator from Kentucky yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I want to thank the Senator from Kentucky for the \ninterest\n\n[[Page S9725]]\n\nthat he and his committee have taken in American educational \ninstitutions abroad, and the role they play in advancing basic American \nvalues in countries of key strategic interest to the United States. As \nthe Chairman knows, I believe that Lebanon is one of the countries \nwhere American leadership is especially needed. Therefore, I was \npleased that the committee's report on S. 2334 gives special \nrecognition to the importance of the American University of Beirut and \nLebanese American University. As the report states, both these \ninstitutions, AUB and LAU, deserve further support from the American \nSchools and Hospitals Abroad program. I would like to ask the Senator \nfrom Kentucky if he agrees with me that AID also should directly \nsupport the American educational institutions in Lebanon through our \nbilateral aid program to that country.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. The Senator is quite right. Our aid program to \nLebanon is structured so that all assistance is channeled through \ngrants or contracts to American non-governmental organizations or U.S. \nfirms. The American educational institutions there should be the first \nto be supported. Education is at the heart of what we are trying to \naccomplish with our aid program. It instills the fundamental values \nthat will guide the next generation of leaders. It will determine \nwhether those leaders share our commitment to democracy and free market \nprinciples, and whether they learn how to solve their own problems or \nremain dependent on us. An investment in American education will pay \ngreater dividends than anything else we can do in Lebanon.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I am pleased to hear the Chairman say that. \nUnfortunately, AID currently is not pursuing such a policy in Lebanon. \nThe agency has established three strategic objectives for the country: \nexpanded economic opportunity, increased effectiveness of democratic \ninstitutions, and improved environmental practices. Each of these \nobjectives certainly deserves special attention and are quite \nimportant, thus I have no complaint about them as such. But, \nstrengthening the American educational presence in the country should \nalso be an objective. In fact, it should be the primary objective. The \nAmerican educational institutions can help achieve these other three \nobjectives, and many more, if their core educational and research \nactivities are enhanced. To some degree AID recognizes the invaluable \nresource they have in these institutions, and the agency is in fact \ncontracting with them to help accomplish the goals it has set for the \ncountry. But it seems to have missed the essential point that these \ninstitutions themselves need revitalization after fifteen years of war \nin Lebanon, and that this cannot be accomplished without supporting the \nrebuilding of weakened institutional structures. The American \neducational institutions in Lebanon can and should be called upon to \nhelp rebuild the country, but it is shortsighted not to commit \nadditional resources to rebuild them as well.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Michigan has special knowledge of \nLebanon, and his expertise is well respected by all his colleagues here \nin the Senate. The point he makes is indeed sound. I am grateful to \nhave his observations, and I am sure that AID will want to give them \nheed. I would like to assure my colleague that the committee will \nencourage the agency to do so, and we will monitor the situation to see \nif changes are made.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chairman.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (At the request of Mr. McConnell, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to thank Chairman McConnell \nand Senator Leahy for their work in putting together a foreign \noperations funding bill that provides for our national security \ninterests while doing so under tough fiscal constraints.\n  I would also like to commend the Chairman and Ranking Member on their \nrecognition of the important role Tunisia has played in the Middle East \nPeace Process for the past several years.\n  Tunisia has been a long-time friend of the United States. Tunisia \nhas, since the beginning of the Peace Process, fully committed itself \nto this process, which is viewed as the only way to restore peace in \nthe Middle East.\n  They launched the first U.S.-PLO dialogue as well as the first \npreparatory talks between Israeli and Palestinian leadership in Tunis. \nTunisia was the first Arab country to host meetings within the \nframework of the Peace Process.\n  Furthermore, a trilateral meeting was held in Washington in October \n1995 bringing together the three Foreign Ministers of the United \nStates, Israel and Tunisia, followed soon afterwards by another \ntrilateral meeting, in January 1996, in Washington, D.C. A decision was \nthen announced to open, both in Tunis and in Tel Aviv, interest \nsections in order to encourage the process of normalization between \nArab States and Israel.\n  The Tunisian's have undertaken these diplomatic initiatives at some \nlevel of security risk. Tunisia's next door neighbor is Libya. \nNevertheless the Tunisians have refused to engage in an arms race. In \n1997, they participated in 20 joint military exercises with the U.S. \nand the European Command.\n  I believe it is time that we demonstrate our appreciation and support \nfor this country through funding commitments. I also encourage the \nAdministration to begin exploring additional funding initiatives in \nfiscal year 2000.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens were \ninstrumental in securing funding for Tunisia. I have had a number of \nconversations with both members regarding this initiative. I have also \nadvised them of the tough fiscal constraints under which we in the \nForeign Operations Committee are operating.\n  However, I too recognize Tunisia's importance in the Peace Process \nand have agreed with Senator Leahy to provide $7 million of Foreign \nMilitary Financing (FMF) in this bill. $5 million is available under \ndraw down authority and $2 million will be available through a direct \ngrant.\n  I want to assure Senators Inouye and Stevens that if the Tunisians \ncontinue their role in the Peace Process, we will explore other funding \ninitiatives in the fiscal year 2000 Foreign Operations Appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. Inouye. Mr. President, I thank Chairman McConnell and Senator \nLeahy and look forward to working with them on this issue in the Fiscal \nYear 2000 Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges of \nthe floor be granted to Bob Guidos, a fellow on my staff, during the \npendency of S. 2334, the foreign operations appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have submitted three amendments for consideration by \nthe chairman and ranking minority member of the Foreign Operations \nAppropriations Subcommittee. It is my understanding that there will not \nbe objection, but I would like to briefly describe each of these \namendments and then offer them for consideration by the Senate.\n  The first amendment that I will offer is one which addresses the \nmicrocredit issue. This is one that I think is of extraordinary \nimportance in terms of supporting and promoting the entrepreneurial \nspirit of small business people around the globe through the use of \nmicrocredit loans.\n  For those unfamiliar with the term, microcredit is a very small loan \ngiven to very poor people with dramatic and positive results. By \naccepting this amendment, we could enhance the lives of thousands of \nimpoverished people\n\n[[Page S9726]]\n\nthroughout the world as well as their families and communities.\n  Many years ago, I journeyed to Bangladesh with a colleague of mine \nfrom the House of Representatives, Mike Synar of Oklahoma, who passed \naway a couple years ago. In Bangladesh, we saw the activities of the \nGrameen Bank, the people's bank, which gave small loans to very, very \npoor people. Through those loans, these peoples lives were transformed. \nThe people understood that this was a rare opportunity. And, they were \nsupported by people in their communities who would cosign the loans. \nThe payback rate on the loans was in the high 90th percentile. With \nonly a few dollars, maybe $100, a woman in Bangladesh had a chance to \nbuy some tools that would allow her to pursue a trade and to feed her \nfamily. Another woman might be able to buy a dairy cow and with the \nmilk from that cow she could feed her children as well as provide \nproducts for sale, which would provide some income for her family.\n  These microcredit loans are not charity; they are a means to provide \npoor, fledgling entrepreneurs in lesser developed countries with loans \nfor startup of individual businesses. It has proven to be a successful \nway to help these people achieve economic independence and dignity for \nthemselves.\n  It is interesting that where we found people in Bangladesh involved \nin microcredit, we also found timely discussion and debate about \ncritical issues, such as the elevation of the status of women, for \nexample. It wasn't a surprise to find that the women involved in \nGrameen Bank were also actively involved in prenatal activities so that \ntheir children would be more healthy. They also actively participated \nin family planning programs on a voluntary basis that helped them to \ntake personal responsibility for the size of their families as well as \nother issues that all of us, I believe, agree are part of the solution \nto dealing with developing economies.\n  My amendment will change the status of the program in one slight \nrespect. It gives microcredit a higher priority among U.S. enterprise \ndevelopment efforts. This amendment will ensure that at least half of \nthe funds already appropriated through this bill, S. 2334, for USAID \nfor microenterprise initiatives will be used for programs providing \nloans of less than $300 to poor people, particularly women, or for \ninstitutional support of organizations primarily engaged in microcredit \nloans.\n  We don't increase the overall spending amount; we merely have a \nreallocation of the smaller loans in this package. Existing loans have \na remarkably high repayment rate of 95 percent or more.\n  This amendment supports the goals of the Microcredit Summit held in \nWashington, DC, in 1997 to offer credit for self-employment and other \nfinancial aid. It also supports the goals found in S. 2152, the \nMicrocredit for Self-sufficiency Act of 1998, introduced in June, \nsponsored by myself, Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, and 22 other \nSenators on a bipartisan basis.\n  I believe that the use of microcredit loans is a pragmatic and proven \nmethod for fostering the growth of small businesses.\n  I thank the chairman for acceptance of this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3496\n\n (Purpose: To allocate funds available for activities pursuant to the \n                      Microenterprise Initiative)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I send this amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the pending \namendments are set aside so that the amendments offered by the Senator \nfrom Illinois are the pending business. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3496.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 11, line 15, before the period insert the \n     following: ``Provided further, That, of the funds \n     appropriated under this heading and made available for \n     activities pusuant to the Microenterprise Initiative, not \n     less than one-half shall be expended on programs providing \n     loans of less than $300 to very poor people, particularly \n     women, or for institutional support of organizations \n     primarily engaged in making such loans''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3497\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding United States \n                     citizens imprisoned in Peru.)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, my second amendment is one that deals with \nan issue of some controversy in my State of Illinois and one that we \nhave followed very closely.\n  Several years ago, two young people from Illinois made a very serious \nmistake. These young, I believe then teenage girls accepted an \ninvitation to fly to Peru. It sounded too good to be true and it was. \nThey found themselves lured into a drug trade and subsequently were \narrested in Peru.\n  For almost two years now, these young ladies, one is Jennifer Davis \nof Illinois, have languished in prison in Lima, Peru. Neither Jennifer \nDavis nor her family deny the fact that she is guilty as charged and \nthat she should be sentenced and should serve time for the crime she \nhas committed. In fact, she has cooperated fully with the Peruvian \nauthorities and those who are seeking to find who was responsible for \nthe drug trading involved.\n  The difficulty, of course, is that the Peruvian legal system is much \ndifferent than the United States system. It took an excruciatingly long \nperiod of time, nine months, before Jennifer was actually charged, \nbrought to trial, and convicted. We had hoped that the trial and \nconviction would lead to the possibility of her being sentenced and \nthen extradited to the United States to serve time for her sentence in \nan American prison, which is customary under international law. But, \nthe conviction was appealed by her codefendants. Under the Peruvian \nsystem, the appeal went to the Supreme Court, which called for a new \ntrial. Now, the process has started all over again.\n  I have spoken directly to Jennifer Davis' parents. I have spoken to \nthe U.S. Ambassador to Peru, Mr. Jett, about this case. It is not my \nintention in offering this amendment to in any way be confrontational \nwith the Government of Peru. What we are attempting to do is to urge \nthem to follow accepted international standards for a timely hearing \nand a timely trial of Jennifer Davis and all other Americans being held \nin Peruvian prisons. We do not presume the outcome of these trials. We \ndo not ask for special or favorable treatment, only that they be \ntreated as prisoners are treated in the United States and most other \ncountries--in a timely fashion--and that any decision by those courts \nbe carried out in a fair manner.\n  That is all that we can ask. It is all that we do in this amendment.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair asks the Senator, we still have the \nSenator's first amendment pending. Does the Senator wish to dispose of \nhis amendment prior to offering this amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I certainly do. I ask the chairman of the subcommittee if \nhe has any objection.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have no objection to the Durbin \namendments. Maybe we should go ahead and approve the first one.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3496\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? \nWithout objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3496) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3497\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the second amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3497.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S9727]]\n\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING UNITED STATES CITIZENS \n                   HELD IN PRISONS IN PERU.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) as a signatory of the International Covenant on Civil \n     and Political Rights, the Government of Peru is obligated to \n     grant prisoners timely legal proceedings pursuant to Article \n     9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights, which requires that ``anyone arrested or detained on \n     a criminal charge shall be brought promptly before a judge or \n     other officer authorized by law to exercise judicial power \n     and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or \n     release'', and that ``any one who is deprived of his liberty \n     by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings \n     before a court, in order that that court may decide without \n     delay on the lawfulness of his detention and order his \n     release if the detention is not lawful'';\n       (2) the Government of Peru should respect the rights of \n     prisoners to timely legal procedures, including the rights of \n     all United States citizens held in prisons in that country; \n     and\n       (3) the Government of Peru should take all necessary steps \n     to ensure that any United States citizen charged with \n     committing a crime in that country is accorded open and fair \n     proceedings in a civilian court.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. If there is no objection from the chairman or ranking \nmember----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have no objection to the second \nDurbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the amendment? Without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3497) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3498\n\n   (Purpose: To require a report on the training provided to foreign \n military personnel in the United States during fiscal years 1998 and \n                                 1999)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have one last amendment. Let me \napologize. I thought they were going to be considered en bloc. I \nunderstand now.\n  This last amendment is an attempt to address a matter of great \nconcern in an objective manner, and that is the concern of some in the \nUnited States that we have expended taxpayers' dollars over the years \nfor the training of foreign military officers and personnel in the \nUnited States with sometimes unintended tragic results.\n  First, let me say, that many of the individuals who have come to the \nUnited States from foreign countries to receive military training have \nreturned to their home countries and have served the cause of justice \nand the cause of civilian control of the military in an admirable way, \nbut there have been notable exceptions.\n  I will not at this moment offer the amendment that I had planned to \noffer involving the controversial School of the Americas. I was \nprepared to offer that amendment which would close down and terminate \nthe School of the Americas. That is an amendment which has been \nconsidered for many years in the U.S. House of Representatives, and I \nvoted for it there. I believe we should close that School. That is \nstill my heartfelt belief.\n  I have spoken to those who share my point of view. It is their belief \nat this moment that we should not offer that amendment. I follow their \nadvice on the subject.\n  Instead, I would like to offer for the consideration of the Senate \nand the House of Representatives and all others an amendment that would \nrequire the Inspectors General of the Department of Defense and \nDepartment of State to submit a report to Congress which spells out \nexactly what training is available to foreign military leaders and \npersonnel in the United States, including the location, the duration, \nthe numbers involved, the cost of the training, the purpose and nature \nof the training and, most importantly, an analysis as to whether that \ntraining is consistent with United States foreign policy and the goals \nof promoting democracy and the civilian control of the military and the \npromotion of human rights. I think this will set the stage for a more \nthorough and thoughtful consideration of all of the programs that might \ninvolve foreign military officers and personnel being trained in the \nUnited States.\n  Let me say at the outset, I believe that some of these programs are \ninvaluable, that many of the men and women who are participating in \nthem leave the United States and go back to their home countries \nprepared to really create a new military ethic. I think the United \nStates should continue on that course. But, unfortunately, in the past, \nparticularly in the case of the School of the Americas, there have been \nsome very controversial instances where those who have been trained \nhave responded in ways most of us would consider to be anathema. They \nhave returned to their home countries and have been involved in conduct \nof which I am sure no one would ever approve.\n  I ask and urge adoption of the amendment which I have offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has the Senator submitted the amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will submit the amendment. I just returned, Mr. \nPresident, from a few weeks away, and I am trying to get back into the \nflow of things. I thank the Senator for his forbearance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair welcomes the Senator back. The clerk \nwill read the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3498.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n       Sec. ____. (a) Not later than January 31, 1999, the \n     Inspector General of the Department of Defense and the \n     Inspector General of the Department of State shall jointly \n     submit to Congress a report describing the following:\n       (1) The training provided to foreign military personnel \n     within the United States under any programs administered by \n     the Department of Defense or the Department of State during \n     fiscal year 1998.\n       (2) The training provided (including the training proposed \n     to be provided) to such personnel within the United States \n     under such programs during fiscal year 1999.\n       (b) For each case of training covered by the report under \n     subsection (a), the report shall include--\n       (1) the location of the training;\n       (2) the duration of the training;\n       (3) the number of foreign military personnel provided the \n     training by country, including the units of operation of such \n     personnel;\n       (4) the cost of the training;\n       (5) the purpose and nature of the training; and\n       (6) an analysis of the manner and the extent to which the \n     training meets or conflicts with the foreign policy \n     objectives of the United States, including the furtherance of \n     democracy and civilian control of the military and the \n     promotion of human rights.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment to the \nfiscal year 1999 Foreign Operations appropriations bill offered by the \nSenator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin]. The amendment requires a report to \nthe Congress from the Inspectors General of the Departments of Defense \nand State detailing the type and purpose of military training provided \nto foreign military personnel within the United States during fiscal \nyears 1998 and 1999. I am pleased the Senate has adopted this \namendment.\n  I have long been opposed to the continued operation of the United \nStates Army's School of the Americas (SOA), located at Fort Benning, \nGeorgia. This amendment will ensure that the Congress receives a full \naccounting of the duration, cost, purpose and nature of the foreign \nmilitary training at all sites within the United States, including the \nSchool of the Americas. The report required by this amendment will also \ninclude a list of the number and country of origin of foreign military \nofficers trained and the units in which these officers serve. Further, \nthe report must include an analysis of whether or not the training \nthese officers receive conflicts with the foreign policy objectives of \nthe United States.\n  While the Senator's amendment includes all foreign military training \nthat is conducted in the United States, this is an especially \nappropriate time to talk about the training at the School of the \nAmericas in particular. All across our country, millions of children \nare beginning a new school year. Most students this year will study \nmath, science, history, and English, and perhaps foreign languages, art \nand\n\n[[Page S9728]]\n\nmusic. And they will learn the basic values of our society--honesty, \nintegrity, and how to get along with each other.\n  There is one school in our country, however, that has not subscribed \nto these basic American values. It is called the School of the \nAmericas--a name which evokes the idea of a shared system of values \namong the United States and our democratic neighbors in the Americas. \nThis school was created in 1946 with the best of intentions--to train \nLatin American military officers in combat and conterinsurgency skills, \nwith the goal of professionalizing Latin American armies and \nstrengthening the new democracies in our hemisphere. Its curriculum has \nincluded some history and math and science and foreign languages, to be \nsure. But this school has replaced the traditional three Rs with the \nthree As--arrest, abduction, and assassination. Because many of its \ngraduates have excelled at the three As, the school has earned the \nnickname the ``School of the Assassins.'' Others call it the ``School \nof Dictators.''\n  In 1991, following an internal investigation, the Pentagon removed \ncertain SOA training manuals from circulation. On September 22, 1996, \nthe Pentagon released the full text of those training manuals and \nacknowledged that some of those manuals provided instruction in \ntechniques that, in the Pentagon's words, were ``clearly objectionable \nand possibly illegal.'' The techniques in question included torture, \nextortion, false arrest, and execution. And the students have learned \nthese lessons very well.\n  The school's alumni directory reads like a who's who of international \ncriminals. Among its graduates are Manuel Noriega, at least 19 \nSalvadorean officers implicated by El Salvador's Truth Commission in \nthe murder of six Jesuit priests, and officers who participated in the \ncoup against former Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide.\n  Since I first came to the Senate in 1993, I have been contacted by \nhundreds of Wisconsin residents, including religious and school groups, \nwho see the closure of this school as a moral imperative. The \nimportance of removing the imprimatur of the United States from this \nschool has been driven home many times during the listening sessions I \nhold in each of Wisconsin's 72 counties every year. I share my \nconstituents' shock and disappointment that our government continues to \noperate a school with the miserable record of the School of the \nAmericas. As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I \nam committed to promoting human rights throughout the world. We cannot \ndo that by continuing to operate this school.\n  I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of S. 980, legislation \nintroduced by the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] to close this \nschool. The movement to close the School of the Americas is not a new \none. Over the past several years, there have been a number of votes on \nthis issue in the House of Representatives. Many of our colleagues in \nthe other body share my concern about this school. Last year, an \namendment to close SOA was defeated by the narrowest of margins. It is \nclear that the momentum behind the bipartisan effort to close this \nschool is growing, and I believe that SOA's days are numbered.\n  While it may be appropriate under certain circumstances for the \nUnited States military to offer training to military forces from \nfriendly nations, it is a mistake to conduct this training at the \nSchool of the Americas. I have no objection to training military \nofficers from Latin America, but to continue to do so at this school \nplaces all future training under a sinister shadow of doubt. This \nschool's reputation has been irrevocably tainted by the blood of the \nvictims of its graduates. In order to remove any suggestion of \nresponsibility for the deaths of these innocent people from the United \nStates, and in order to lift the cloud of suspicion over American \nmilitary training, we must separate the legitimate training exercises \nconducted by the United States military from the sordid acts most \nnotorious graduates of SOA. The only way to do that is to close the \nSchool of the Americas once and for all.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have no objection to the Durbin \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Illinois?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3498) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, Senator Specter announced earlier today the \nrelease of a voluminous and comprehensive report of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs special investigation unit on Gulf War illnesses. I \ncommend the Senator from Pennsylvania and the other Members of the \nCommittee, including my colleague from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller, on this report, which was over a year in the making. In \ngreat detail, this report and its appendices provide the justification \nfor legislation that Senator Specter, Senator Rockefeller, and I \nintroduced on July 28, S. 2358, the Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998.\n  The history of this sorry saga of war, illness, and bureaucratic \nbungling it details has not improved with time. Indeed, age has turned \nthis victory wine into sour vinegar, not a vintage to be savored. Since \nthe signing of the cease fire in Iraq in 1991, soldiers have been \ncomplaining of symptoms that have been poorly dealt with by the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. As the \nyears have passed, we have learned that these soldiers, sailors, and \nairmen had to operate in a toxic atmospheric cocktail of environmental \nand battlefield hazards, topped off with a chaser of vaccines and pills \nthat may have interacted poorly with all the other hazardous exposures. \nWe have learned that our equipment to detect and protect our troops may \nnot be good enough, and that their training and doctrine is inadequate. \nWe have even learned of the role that the U.S. played in arming Iraq \nwith chemical and biological warfare technology and materials. Finally, \nDOD and the VA record keeping was poor, the databases inadequately \ndesigned and incompatible, so that the ability to identify battlefield \nexposures--when known--is not available to the VA when requested by a \nsick soldier. We won the war, but the price paid by these soldiers has \nbeen unacceptably high, perhaps needlessly high. And DOD and the VA \nhave done little to correct the problems. The official motto seems to \nbe ``That which does not kill us, we ignore--unless forced to address \nit.''\n  Like other Members, I have tried to correct these matters as they \nhave come to light. I successfully offered an amendment to ensure DOD \nand the Intelligence Community consultation when pathogens useful to a \nbiological warfare program are approved for export, so that we have a \nbetter opportunity to track countries that have the capability, if not \nthe intent, to produce biological warfare agents. I obtained funding \nfor the first peer-reviewed scientific studies of the possible health \neffects of exposure to low levels of chemical warfare agents. An \namendment I authored that was adopted by the Senate but rejected in \nconference would have provided military health care to the children of \nGulf War veterans born with birth defects that might be linked to their \nparent's wartime exposures.\n  This year, I offered amendments to the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill to improve the oversight and approval process for \ngranting waivers to use investigational drugs without informed consent \nof the troops, and to require a review of chemical warfare defense \ndoctrine to address exposure to low levels of chemical warfare agents. \nThis last effort is based on a soon-to-be released General Accounting \nOrganization (GAO) study that I requested last year in conjunction with \nSenator Levin and Senator Glenn. I am sorry to say that, despite DOD's \n1996 show of concern over possible chemical exposures at Khamisiyah \n[Kam-ih-see-yah] and other Iraqi sites that may have resulted in the \nexposure of U.S. personnel to varying levels of chemical warfare \nagents, little has been done to address the lack of training that \nshould better enable our troops to recognize and take effective action \nto protect themselves from these potential health threats. We have also \nrequested GAO to look into the adequacy of U.S. detection and \nprotection equipment and efforts to address hazardous, but not lethal, \nlevels of chemical and biological warfare agents. This study will be \ncompleted next year.\n  While I hope that my efforts and the efforts of other Members and \nCommittees can push DOD and the VA into facing the serious new health \nconsequences of war on the modern battlefield, even these cannot \nadequately substitute for an epiphany in those departments that will \nresult in a sincere and thorough examination of this issue, and in \nproactive and coordinated steps to correct the deficiencies outlined in \nthis comprehensive report.\n  There is no smoking gun in this report, no explosive new evidence \nthat says ``whodunit'' and why. But like previous reports by Congress, \nthe GAO, and the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses, \nthis report confirms that our veterans were exposed to a poison \ncocktail of hazardous materials, that many are now ill, and that the \nbureaucratic response has been slow and stumbling. It is likely that \nthere will never be a clear and final answer for our sick soldiers and \ntheir families as to exactly what ails them. But this report does offer \nmany corrective recommendations aimed at preventing the veterans of the \nnext war from having to go through the years of frustration and outrage \nthat the sick veterans of the Persian Gulf War have endured. It also \noffers a solid foundation to move forward and address the legitimate \nhealth concerns of Persian Gulf veterans that are contained in S. 2358, \nthe Persian Gulf Veterans Act of 1998. Gulf War veterans in West \nVirginia and across the country are getting sick as a result of their \nparticipation in the Gulf War, which may have exposed them to a variety \nof hazardous materials and chemicals while serving their country. But \ninstead of receiving medical care, these veterans are given \nbureaucratic excuses. It is time to end\n\n[[Page S9731]]\n\nthe litany of excuses and to give our veterans the health care they \ndeserve. I again thank my friend from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, for \nhis efforts, and the efforts and my colleague from West Virginia, Mr. \nRockefeller. I congratulate and thank the committee for its efforts. I \nlook forward to the successful passage of S. 2358.\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend, Mr. Specter, for his courtesy in \nallowing me to proceed at this point. I now yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the pending \namendment is set aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself \n     and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment numbered 3506.\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Of the funds appropriated by this Act, or prior \n     Acts making appropriations for foreign operations, export \n     financing, and related programs, not less than $28,900,000 \n     shall be made available for expenses related to the \n     Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Preparatory Commission; \n     Provided, That such funds may be made available through the \n     regular notification procedures of the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this funding is very important so that \nthe processing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty may go forward. \nThis treaty is an important component of nuclear arms control and \nnonproliferation policy.\n  On behalf of the United States, President Clinton signed the treaty \non September 24, 1996, the day it was open for signature, and \nthereafter transmitted it to the Senate on September 22, 1997, for \nadvice and consent or ratification.\n  The treaty has been signed by 149 nations, ratified by 15. The treaty \nwill enter into force after 44 states specified in the treaty have \nratified it. The initial signatories to the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty established a preparatory commission to carry out the necessary \npreparations for implementation of the treaty as its entry into force. \nThe preparatory commission will ensure that a verification regime is \nestablished that can meet the treaty's requirements.\n  The need for this treaty came into very, very sharp focus earlier \nthis year when on May 12 of 1998 we had the detonation of nuclear \ndevices--actually it was on May 11--by India and two more on May 13. \nThen Pakistan responded with five tests on May 28 and one on May 30. \nThe issues posed by India and Pakistan engaging in nuclear tests is one \nof overwhelming importance to the feuding which has been going on \nbetween those two countries for years and the possibility of nuclear \nwar being initiated as a result of those two nations now having \npublicly announced their nuclear powers, having tested nuclear devices.\n  I saw firsthand the issues relating to these two countries when \nSenator Hank Brown and I visited both India and Pakistan back in August \nof 1995. On August 28, 1995, Senator Brown and I sent the following \nletter to President Clinton:\n\n       Dear Mr. President: I think it important to call to your \n     personal attention the substance of meetings which Senator \n     Hank Brown and I have had in the last two days with Indian \n     Prime Minister Rao and Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir \n     Bhutto.\n       Prime Minister Rao stated that he would be very interested \n     in negotiations which would lead to the elimination of any \n     nuclear weapons on his subcontinent within ten or fifteen \n     years including renouncing first use of such weapons. His \n     interest in such negotiations with Pakistan would cover \n     bilateral talks or a regional conference which would include \n     the United States, China and Russia in addition to India and \n     Pakistan.\n       When we mentioned this conversation to Prime Minister \n     Bhutto this morning--\n\n  That is on August 28--\n\n     She expressed great interest in such negotiations. When we \n     told her of our conversation with Prime Minister Rao, she \n     asked if we could get him to put that in writing.\n       When we asked Prime Minister Bhutto when she had last \n     talked to Prime Minister Rao, she said that she had no \n     conversations with him during her tenure as Prime Minister. \n     Prime Minister Bhutto did say that she had initiated a \n     contact through an intermediary but that was terminated when \n     a new controversy arose between Pakistan and India.\n       From our conversations with Prime Minister Rao and Prime \n     Minister Bhutto, it is my sense that both would be very \n     receptive to discussions initiated and brokered by the United \n     States as to nuclear weapons and also delivery missile \n     systems.\n       I am dictating this letter to you by telephone from \n     Damascus so that you will have it at the earliest moment. I \n     am also telefaxing a copy of this letter to Secretary of \n     State Warren Christopher.\n\n  After sending that letter to President Clinton, I have had an \nopportunity to discuss the issue with President Clinton on a number of \noccasions, and the President has stated an interest in trying to work \nwith both India and Pakistan. Of course, the President has communicated \nwith both India and Pakistan, at least following their nuclear \ndetonations. But that is a matter which I think might profitably \ninvolve substantial activity by the United States.\n  But the succession of events have followed so that in May of this \nyear, the time had arisen for India to make a public disclosure, a \npublic test, and then it was followed immediately by Pakistan. It is a \nmatter where those in India might well question the intensity of \ninterest of the United States in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty when \nthe United States is not a party to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter of August 28, \n1995, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I later wrote to the President on May 12 \nof 1998 enclosing a copy of that letter of August 28, 1995, urging him \nto move on the matter. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this \nletter of May 12, 1998, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on May 14, 1998, I wrote to Senator Helms \nas follows:\n\n       I write to urge you to act as promptly as possible to \n     conduct a hearing or hearings and to bring the Comprehensive \n     Test Ban Treaty to the Senate floor for a ratification vote. \n     In my judgment, the events of the past several days make that \n     the Senate's number one priority.\n       Following India's nuclear tests, Pakistan is now preparing \n     for similar tests. North Korea has stated its intention to \n     move forward to develop nuclear weapons and Iran and Iraq are \n     lurking in the background.\n       At a hearing before the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee \n     yesterday, Secretary of Defense Cohen urged Senate \n     consideration and ratification of the treaty.\n       As you know, the President submitted the treaty to the \n     Senate on September 22, 1997, and the only hearings which \n     have been held were conducted by the Governmental Affairs \n     Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and \n     Federal Services on October 27, 1997, and March 18, 1998, and \n     the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water \n     Development on October 28, 1997.\n       I noted the comment in your letter to the President on \n     January 21, 1998, that this treaty is very low on the \n     Committee's list of priorities, and I also heard your staffer \n     on National Public Radio this week state that the Foreign \n     Relations Committee did not intend to move ahead on the \n     treaty.\n       I am concerned that inaction by the Senate may have led the \n     government of India to think that the United States is \n     indifferent to nuclear testing which, I believe, is \n     definitely not the case. The events of the past several days \n     threaten an international chain reaction on the proliferation \n     of nuclear weapons and an imminent threat to world peace.\n       From comments on the Senate floor and in the cloakroom, I \n     know that many, if not most, of our colleagues share my \n     concern about action on the treaty.\n       I realize that there is some opposition to the treaty; if \n     it is the will of the Senate not to ratify, so be it; but at \n     the very least, the matter should be submitted to the full \n     Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9732]]\n\n  (See Exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator Helms has not responded to that \nletter. I think it appropriate to note Senator Helms has been absent \nfor some time because of important medical reasons--a knee replacement, \nI believe.\n  On May 19, Senator Biden and I circulated a ``Dear Colleague'' letter \nrequesting cosponsors for a resolution urging hearings before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee and debate on the Senate floor. \nThere are at this moment 36 cosponsors.\n  On July 21 of this year, I offered an amendment to the fiscal year \nforeign operations bill to remove the prohibition on funding for the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty Preparatory Commission. That amendment \nwas accepted. Mr. President, I believe that the inclusion of these \nfunds is very, very important so that the Preparatory Commission can \nmove forward. But I believe that this amendment has further \nsignificance as a test vote, so to speak, as to the views of the Senate \non the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  I have discussed with my distinguished colleague, Senator McConnell, \nthe chairman of the subcommittee, my interest in having a vote on this \nmatter. I do so not only to strengthen the position in conference--as a \npractical matter, if a matter is accepted on a voice vote, there is not \nquite the punch as if there is a very substantial vote in favor of the \namendment. And I do recognize that calling for a vote on the \namendment--that any vote on the Senate floor is risky business to an \nextent, but I believe that a vote will have significance beyond the \nspecific dollars and cents which are involved here.\n  It is my sense that arms control is a very, very important \ninternational issue at the present time, if not the most important \nissue. As we speak, President Clinton is meeting with Russian President \nYeltsin in a very unstable situation in Russia. There are concerns as \nto what the future of the Government headed by President Yeltsin will \nbe. There are concerns that the Communist Party may gain power in \nRussia. There are obvious concerns about what may happen to the Russian \nGovernment in the future and whether militaristic forces or reactionary \nforces might take control there, which could plunge the world into \nanother arms race. So this issue with Russia is a very, very important \none as we take a look at arms control.\n  We have the issues with China, an emerging power, and the need to \nlimit, to the extent we can, activity by China on nuclear testing. We \nhave the situation in North Korea where the reports are that they are \nmoving back for their nuclear weapons. We have Iran and Iraq, emerging \npowers, with nuclear weapons. We have missiles being sold to Pakistan. \nThere is a very dangerous, very unsafe world out there, to put it \nmildly.\n  I think it is an unfortunate situation that we have the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty not moving forward in the Senate. Under the \nConstitution, Senate ratification is necessary if a treaty is to take \neffect. It would be my hope that the Foreign Relations Committee would \nhold hearings on the matter or make its own judgment, or bring the \nmatter to the Senate floor, and let the full Senate work its will.\n  In the absence of activity there, this amendment--to repeat--has the \neffect of being a test vote, so to speak, although you can support the \nPreparatory Commission without necessarily being for the treaty, \nbecause we have to take these steps in any event.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Biden be listed \nas my principal cosponsor on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                             Select Committee on Intelligence,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 28, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I think it important to call to your \n     personal attention the substance of meetings which Senator \n     Hank Brown and I have had in the last two days with Indian \n     Prime Minister Rao and Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir \n     Bhutto.\n       Prime Minister Rao stated that he would be very interested \n     in negotiations which would lead to the elimination of any \n     nuclear weapons on his subcontinent within ten or fifteen \n     years including renouncing first use of such weapons.

When we told her of our conversation with Prime \n     Minister Rao, she asked if we could get him to put that in \n     writing.\n       When we asked Prime Minister Bhutto when she had last \n     talked to Prime Minister Rao, she said that she had no \n     conversations with him during her tenure as Prime Minister. \n     Prime Minister Bhutto did say that she had initiated a \n     contact through an intermediary but that was terminated when \n     a new controversy arose between Pakistan and India.\n       From our conversations with Prime Minister Rao and Prime \n     Minister Bhutto, it is my sense that both would be very \n     receptive to discussions initiated and brokered by the United \n     States as to nuclear weapons and also delivery missile \n     systems.\n       I am dictating this letter to you by telephone from \n     Damascus so that you will have it at the earliest moment. I \n     am also telefaxing a copy of this letter to Secretary of \n     State Warren Christopher.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 12, 1998.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: With this letter, I am enclosing a copy \n     of a letter which I sent to you dated August 28, 1995, \n     concerning the United States brokering arrangements between \n     India and Pakistan to make their subcontinent nuclear free.\n       You may recall that I have discussed this issue with you on \n     several occasions after I sent you that letter.\n       In light of the news reports today that India has set off \n     nuclear devices, I again urge you to act to try to head off \n     or otherwise deal with the India/Pakistan nuclear arms race.\n       I continue to believe that an invitation from you to the \n     Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan to meet in the Oval \n     Office, after appropriate preparations, could ameliorate this \n     very serious problem.\n       I am taking the liberty of sending a copy of this letter to \n     Secretary Albright.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 1998.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: I write to urge you to act as promptly \n     as possible to conduct a hearing or hearings and to bring the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the Senate floor for a \n     ratification vote. In my judgment, the events of the past \n     several days make that the Senate's number one priority.\n       Following India's nuclear tests, Pakistan is now preparing \n     for similar tests. North Korea has stated its intention to \n     move forward to develop nuclear weapons and Iran and Iraq are \n     lurking in the background.\n       At a hearing before the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee \n     yesterday, Secretary of Defense Cohen urged Senate \n     consideration and ratification of the treaty.\n       As you know, the President submitted the treaty to the \n     Senate on September 22, 1997, and the only hearings which \n     have been held were conducted by the Governmental Affairs \n     Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and \n     Federal Services on October 27, 1997, and March 18, 1998, and \n     the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water \n     Development on October 28, 1997.\n       I noted the comment in your letter to the President on \n     January 21, 1998, that this treaty is very low on the \n     Committee's list of priorities, and I also heard your staffer \n     on National Public Radio this week state that the Foreign \n     Relations Committee did not intend to move ahead on the \n     treaty.\n       I am concerned that inaction by the Senate may have led the \n     government of India to think that the United States is \n     indifferent to nuclear testing which, I believe, is \n     definitely not the case. The events of the past several days \n     threaten an international chain reaction on the proliferation \n     of nuclear weapons and an imminent threat to world peace.\n       From comments on the Senate floor and in the cloakroom, I \n     know that many, if not most, of our colleagues share my \n     concern about action on the treaty.\n       I realize that there is some opposition to the treaty; if \n     it is the will of the Senate not to ratify, so be it; but at \n     the very least, the matter should be submitted to the full \n     Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. For the moment, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I say, for those on this side of the aisle \nwho may have amendments, it is a good time to\n\n[[Page S9733]]\n\nbring them forward. Again, I hope, along with the distinguished \nchairman of the subcommittee, that we might be able to wrap up \nrelatively soon on this piece of legislation. I mention that, for those \nwho are sitting around wondering if there is anything better to be \ndoing, that now is a good time to do it. Many have called; few are \naccepted. Now is the time to do it.\n  With that, Mr. President, and nobody else seeking recognition, I \nyield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/01/senate-section/article/S9731-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I will not take long. I know that there \nare discussions ongoing.\n  Before we left for the August recess, Democrats made it very clear \nthat it is essential that we not leave here before the end of the year \nwithout having taken up and passed the Patients' Bill of Rights. I \nthink it is very clear, given the extraordinary degree of interest in \nthe issue on both sides of the aisle, that there is an opportunity for \nus to complete our work on that bill. I hope we can do it sooner rather \nthan later. I see no reason why we cannot do it within the course of \nthe next couple of weeks.\n  I will propound a unanimous consent request that would allow us to do \nthat. The request, very simply, would allow the Senate to take up the \nHouse-passed HMO reform bill, begin the debate, allow relevant \namendments, and set the bill aside at the request of the majority \nleader to take up appropriations bills when they are ready to be \nconsidered. It takes into account the need for us to complete our work \non appropriations bills, and it takes into account the high priority \nthat both parties have put on dealing with this issue.\n  But I must say, for Democrats, that there cannot be a more important \nissue than the complete and successful conclusion of the debate on \nmanaged care and the Patients' Bill of Rights. We now have over 170 \ndifferent organizations that have said they join us in supporting this \nlegislation and recognize the importance of passing it before we leave. \nAll we have left is 6 weeks. Mr. President, it is critical that we \ncomplete our work, that we get this job done, that we do so in the \nremaining time we have, and that we allow a full debate given the \ndifferences we have on how we might approach this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon disposition of the \nforeign operations appropriations bill, the Senate proceed to \nconsideration of Calendar No. 505, H.R. 4250, the House-passed health \ncare reform bill; that only relevant amendments be in order; that the \nbill be the regular order, but that the majority leader may lay it \naside for any appropriations bill or appropriations conference report \nwhich he deems necessary to consider between now and the end of this \nsession of Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am very deeply disappointed that the \nSenator from Kentucky has seen fit to object to this.\n  We will continue to press this matter. We will look for other \nopportunities. I would much rather do it in an orderly fashion using \nthe regular order to allow this to come up and be debated. But if we \ncannot do it that way, we will offer it in the form of amendments. One \nway or the other we will press for this issue. We will see it resolved, \nand see it resolved successfully, because I don't believe there is \nanother issue out there this year that is of greater importance to the \nAmerican people.\n  I would be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, as I \nunderstand it, the proposal that was made by the minority leader would \nhave only permitted amendments that were relevant to the underlying \nmeasure, which would be the Patients' Bill of Rights, and that would \nhave still granted to the majority leader the opportunity to move \nahead, as we must, with the various appropriations bills, and \nappropriations conference reports.\n  As I understand, if the leader's proposal had been accepted, we would \nthen have had the opportunity to consider this very important piece of \nlegislation in an orderly way that would ensure adequate debate and \ndiscussion. The proposal would have ensured, if the Senator would \nagree, an opportunity to debate relevant amendments on critically \nimportant issues. It would have allowed the Senate to debate amendments \nthat would ensure: that health care decisions are being decided by \ndoctors rather than insurance company accountants; that all women have \naccess to appropriate specialists for the gynecological and \nobstetrician care that they need; that patients with life-threatening \nconditions have access to clinical trials; an effective end to gag \npractices that inhibit doctors from making medical recommendations and \nsuggestions based on their patients' needs; that all patients have \naccess to a meaningful and timely internal and external appeal, similar \nto what we have in Medicare, for example; and that the States \nthemselves, if they so choose, to find further accountability for those \nwho are going to practice medicine.\n  Am I correct that these elements were included in the legislation \nwhich the minority leader introduced, and that these are measures--\nalong with others, that the minority leader thinks the Senate ought to \nhave an opportunity to debate, discuss and vote upon--were based in \npart on the comments that have been made to the minority leader, I am \nsure, from people in his own State, and from representatives of the 170 \nleading patient and medical organizations in this country?\n  These are the groups that are supporting the leader's legislation, \nand they are supporting this action as well. And I understand that now \nthe Republican leadership has just objected to our request to move \nforward to debate on health care legislation, on the Patients' Bill of \nRights? Is that what we have just seen on the floor of the Senate?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. \nFirst, to the point he made about relevancy, what our unanimous consent \nrequest would have done is simply allowed what we have attempted to \nnegotiate with our Republican colleagues now for months, which is to \nallow a good debate about this issue and allow the opportunity for the \nSenate to decide on relevant amendments.\n  This may be one of the most comprehensive and most complicated \nmedical issues that the Senate will address for a long period of time. \nIt is impossible for us to address it in the way that has been \nsuggested by some on the other side, that we have an up-or-down vote on \ntwo simple bills. There is nothing simple about them. These are very \nserious questions about holding health insurance companies accountable, \nabout making sure that when a woman has a mastectomy she can be \nprotected, about making absolutely certain that when you go into a \npharmacy you have a drug that the doctor prescribed and not something \nthat the health care company prescribed.\n  Those are the kinds of issues that we ought to have the opportunity \nto decide in a very careful way. So we offered a unanimous consent \nrequest that would have allowed for relevant amendments.\n  The Senator is absolutely right, as well, about the 170 \norganizations. In my time in the Senate on an issue of\n\n[[Page S9734]]\n\nany magnitude, I don't remember a time when over 170 organizations of \nall philosophical stripes were on board and said, yes, we want to pass \nthis bill. That is phenomenal. That is historic. And so the Senator is \nright. I hope, regardless of whether it is today or tomorrow or \nsometime soon, we can have the kind of debate the Senator from \nMassachusetts and others have called for for a long period of time. We \nneed time to do it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator further yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I welcome the opportunity for those who support the \nRepublican position to provide the Senate with the names of the medical \norganizations and the patient organizations that support their \nproposal. Yet I think this may not be possible, because I believe they \ndo not exist.\n  But let me ask the Senator if I state this correctly. We debated the \ndefense authorization bill for eight days and 124 amendments were \noffered; in fact, 10 were cosponsored by the majority leader and the \nassistant majority leader. We spent five days on agricultural \nappropriations with 55 amendments offered; seven days on the most \nrecent budget resolution with 105 amendments; nineteen days on the \nhighway bill with 100 amendments offered.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that we ought to be able to deal with \npatient protection legislation in a timely way that might not even come \nclose to the time spent on other pieces of legislation that we have had \nhere earlier in the year? Does the Senator think, given the fact we had \nspent 19 days on the highway bill, that we ought to be able to spend at \nleast a few days on relevant amendments on something that affects every \nfamily in this country, affects their children, affects husbands and \nwives, affects grandparents in a very, very special and personal way? \nDoes the Senator agree that this would not be a wasted period of time \nin terms of the remaining several weeks for debate? And would not the \nSenate minority leader be willing to work out a satisfactory kind of \ntime frame so that we could have this debate?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. When \nyou think about it, we spent a lot of good time on the highway bill, \ntime we needed to spend on a bill that I supported. We all know that \nthe highway bill has many complicated aspects to it; there wasn't any \nobjection from the other side in that regard. The highway bill was \ncomplicated, and because it was, we offered, as the Senator noted, over \n100 amendments. Now what they are saying on this particular bill is \nthat even though it is every bit as complicated, they are only willing \nto provide three slots for amendments--not 100, not 75, not 50, but \nthree slots on a bill that affects personally more people than even the \nhighway bill.\n  That is what we are up against. That is the motivation in offering \nthe unanimous consent request this afternoon.\n  I would be happy to yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wanted to ask the Senator to yield for a question. This \nis a critically important issue that affects tens and tens of millions \nof Americans. It deals with the question of whether, when they show up \nand are ill and need health care treatment, they are going to be told \nby their attending physician who is working for a managed care \norganization all of their options for medical treatment or just the \ncheapest. We have talked day after day in this Chamber about how these \nissues deal with the life and death of patients.\n  We had one story here about a managed care organization that \nevaluated a young boy and determined that because he had only a 50 \npercent chance of being able to walk by age 5, it was determined \ninsignificant and he shall not therefore be eligible for the therapy--a \n50 percent chance of walking by age 5 is insignificant so don't help \nhim. These are important issues.\n  Now, the question I ask the Senator from South Dakota, we have put \ntogether legislation, we have developed legislation that I think is \nvery important and we have been working very hard to try to get it to \nthe floor of the Senate. We spent days debating the renaming of an \nairport, but apparently we don't have time to deal with the issue of \nmanaged care reform and a Patients' Bill of Rights. How many months \nhave we been trying to get a time to get this issue to the floor of the \nSenate so that we can debate it and deal with this issue? I ask the \nminority leader, how many months have we worked to try to get this \nissue to the floor of the Senate for debate?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think the Senator from North Dakota raises a very \nimportant point. This particular bill has been pending now for over 6 \nmonths. And as the Senator from Massachusetts noted, over that period \nof time, more and more groups from all over the country, the doctors, \nthe nurses, people in health care delivery from virtually every facet \nand every walk of life, every one of them have said you put your finger \non a problem that you have to solve. It is getting worse out there. And \nunless we address the situation meaningfully in public policy, it will \ncontinue to get worse. How long must we wait? Must we wait until next \nyear or the year after? And how many millions of people will be \nadversely affected if we do not act? They are telling us to act. And I \nhope we will do it before the end of this session of Congress.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further, just another point. I \nregret that there is opposition to the request. It seems to me the \nrequest is appropriate. Do the appropriations bills, do the conference \nreports, but make time at least to do this issue. We have talked about \nin this Chamber the stories of someone whose neck was broken, taken to \nan emergency room, and told you can't get this covered because you \ndidn't have prior approval, brought to the emergency room with a broken \nneck, unconscious. So I mean these issues go on and on and on, the \nstories go on forever, and the question is, Is the Congress going to \naddress it? Is Congress going to deal with it? Does the Congress think \nit is an important issue? If it thinks it is an important issue, then \nwe ought to be debating it on the floor of the Senate; we ought to make \ntime and allow for discussion. That is what the Senate is about. I \nhope, I say to the Senator from South Dakota, the Democratic leader, I \nhope very much that we continue to push and continue to press, and we \nwill not take no for an answer. We want this piece of legislation on \nthe floor of the Senate for full and open debate so we can resolve this \nissue on behalf of all Americans.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator for his contribution.\n  I would be happy to yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my leader for making what I think is a very \nrational request, that we take up a Patients' Bill of Rights and we \nhave the option of amending such a bill so that we can in fact help the \nmajority of the American people who are telling us pretty unequivocally \nhere they want quality health care. I have a brief comment and then a \nquestion for my colleague and my leader.\n  Mr. Leader, I want you to know about a story in my State. There are \nso many of them, and I have told many of them on the floor. This \nparticular story, I think, is quite poignant because it has a good \nending to it. But it makes a very important point and I think our \nPresiding Officer who is sitting in the Chair, our President of the \nday, would be interested in this as a physician.\n  A little girl named Carly Christie got a very rare type of cancer \nmany years ago, about 9 years ago. It required some very delicate \nsurgery that only a couple of specialists had ever really performed \nbefore. It was a cancerous tumor on her kidney. Her dad went to the HMO \nand said, ``Look, I know the doctors who know how to do this and I am \ngoing to go and have this operation done.''\n  The HMO said, ``No, you are not. We have a general surgeon, and the \ngeneral surgeon can do this operation.''\n  ``Well, has the general surgeon ever done such an operation before?''\n  ``No.''\n  And Mr. Christie said, ``This is my flesh and blood. This is my \nchild. I want her to live. I need to go to someone, a specialist, who \nknows how to do this operation.''\n  They said, ``No.''\n  He got the money, $50,000, I tell my leader, and she got the surgery. \nAnd\n\n[[Page S9735]]\n\nnow, many years later--she was 9 at the time; she is 14--she is cancer \nfree.\n  What would have happened to that little girl if she hadn't had an \nexperienced specialist? I ask my leader, the bill we want to bring \nbefore this body, wouldn't that ensure that any little Carly or any \nother child, or any man or woman, would be able to get that specialist? \nI ask my colleague on that point.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from California is right on the mark. That \nis exactly the essence of our legislation. We talk so often in \nstatistical terms here on the Senate floor. Sometimes we have to put it \nin personal terms, in real terms. The Senator from California has just \ndone so, so eloquently. In real terms, this bill would allow an \nindividual, whether it is somebody in this Chamber today or anybody who \nmay be watching, that they will have an opportunity to choose and be \ntreated by a qualified specialist. They would have an opportunity to \nmake sure that the specialist is competent, so they will get the best \ncare for their personal set of circumstances, like young Carly.\n  That is what our bill is all about. That is why it is important to \npass it this year. That is why we cannot wait until next year. I thank \nthe Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. On behalf of all the Carlys, thank you, Mr. Leader. We \nwill stand with you until we get this up before the American people.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Before I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts, let me \nsay the unanimous consent request that we made took into account the \nfact that the House has already acted on this issue. The House has \npassed a health care bill, not one that I would necessarily be excited \nabout, but it passed a bill. What we are suggesting here is that we \nwant to amend the House-passed bill. We want to complete the job. We \nwant to put a Democratic imprint on a comprehensive health care bill \nthat will do the job and get that bill signed.\n  There is another piece of legislation the House has now passed, \ncampaign finance reform. That bill has also passed out of the House. \nThe Shays-Meehan bill has passed, and that, too, is pending now in this \nChamber. That, also, ought to be on our agenda. When can we take up the \nShays-Meehan bill? It passed in the House. Let's pass it in the Senate.\n  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask the leader just to clarify for the \nrecord precisely the full measure of the request that he made.\n  It is my understanding the leader requested, not that we would not \nproceed to other legislation, but that we would simply create an \nopportunity, a fixed opportunity within the next 6 weeks during which \ntime we would be able to debate the issue of health maintenance \norganization reform. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct. Basically, \nour unanimous consent request simply would have made as regular order, \nas the next bill to be considered, H.R. 4250, the House-passed health \ncare reform bill. We would then offer, in the form of amendments, our \nbill and other relevant amendments that would be considered. We would \ngive the majority leader, certainly, the authority to set that bill \naside so long as other appropriations bills or conference reports on \nappropriations bills need to be considered. We would complete our work \non patient protections, and it would be my expectation, following the \nsuccessful conclusion of that debate, to offer a similar unanimous \nconsent request on campaign finance reform. It seems to me, those two \nkey issues are critical to the agenda of this country and critical to \nthe business of the Senate--particularly given the fact, as I have just \nnoted, that they both now have passed in the House of Representatives. \nI can't think of anything more important than to complete the work of \nthis Congress on those two bills. That would be my intention.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, with respect to the campaign finance reform \nbill the leader mentions, it is clear, is it not, that bill ultimately \npassed after the repeated efforts of the membership of the House to \nmake it clear that they would not accept leadership efforts to stop it? \nIn other words, there were repeated efforts by the leadership, the \nSpeaker of the House, to sidetrack campaign finance reform. But, for \none of those rare instances where it happens, the popular will, the \nwill of the American people to have the vote on campaign finance reform \nand to put into effect a reform that for years people have known we \nneed--that won in the House of Representatives. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. So the only thing standing in the way of a similar \nexpression of what we know to be a majority of the U.S. Senate prepared \nto vote for campaign finance reform, the only thing that stands in the \nway is the leadership of the Republican Party, that wants to say no, we \nare not going to give you this opportunity. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. To date, that is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. With respect to the problem of the Patients' Bill of \nRights, is that not the No. 1 issue of concern of Americans--young, \nold, middle aged, of all walks of life--that is the one thing most on \nthe minds of the American people that they want the U.S. Congress to \naddress?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is \nabsolutely correct. The issue, as we have noted now several times, has \nprobably the most elaborate array of support by health care \norganizations, organizations that deal with this every day. \nOrganizations on the front line of health care delivery have said this \nmust be our highest priority--not just in health care, but in the array \nof issues that are confronting this Congress. They say there is nothing \nmore important than passing this legislation this year. I think they \nare right.\n  This is what the American people want. I might note, we just received \na faxed letter from the President, from Moscow, on this very issue. I \nmight just read one short paragraph.\n\n       As I mentioned in my radio address this past Saturday, \n     ensuring basic patient protections is not and should not be a \n     political issue. I was therefore disappointed by the partisan \n     manner in which the Senate Republican Leadership bill was \n     developed. The lack of consultation with the White House or \n     any Democrats during the drafting of your legislation \n     contributed to its serious shortcomings and the fact it has \n     failed to receive the support of either patients or doctors. \n     The bill leaves millions of Americans without critical \n     patient protections, contains provisions that are more \n     rhetorical than substantive, completely omits patient \n     protections that virtually every expert in the field believes \n     are basic and essential, and includes ``poison pill'' \n     provisions that have nothing to do with a patients' bill of \n     rights.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                       Moscow,\n\n                                                September 1, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: Thank you for your letter regarding the \n     patients' bill of rights. I am pleased to reiterate my \n     commitment to working with you--and all Republicans and \n     Democrats in the Congress--to pass long overdue legislation \n     this year.\n       Since last November, I have called on the Congress to pass \n     a strong, enforceable, and bipartisan patients' bill of \n     rights. During this time, I signed an Executive Memorandum to \n     ensure that the 85 million Americans in federal health plans \n     receive the patient protections they need, and I have \n     indicated my support for bipartisan legislation that would \n     extend these protections to all Americans. With precious few \n     weeks remaining before the Congress adjourns, we must work \n     together to respond to the nation's call for us to improve \n     the quality of health care Americans are receiving.\n       As I mentioned in my radio address this past Saturday, \n     ensuring basic patient protections is not and should not be a \n     political issue. I was therefore disappointed by the partisan \n     manner in which the Senate Republican Leadership bill was \n     developed. The lack of consultation with the White House or \n     any Democrats during the drafting of your legislation \n     contributed to its serious shortcomings and the fact it has \n     failed to receive the support of either patients or doctors. \n     The bill leaves millions of Americans without critical \n     patient protections, contains provisions that are more \n     rhetorical than substantive, completely omits patient \n     protections that virtually every expert in the field believes \n     are basic and essential, and includes ``poison pill'' \n     provisions that have nothing to\n\n[[Page S9736]]\n\n     do with a patients' bill of rights. More specifically, the \n     bill:\n       Does not cover all health plans and leaves more than 100 \n     million Americans completely unprotected. The provisions in \n     the Senate Republican Leadership bill apply only to self-\n     insured plans. As a consequence, the bill leaves out more \n     than 100 million Americans, including millions of workers in \n     small businesses. This approach contrasts with the bipartisan \n     Kassebaum-Kennedy insurance reform law, which provided a set \n     of basic protections for all Americans.\n       Lets HMOs, not health professionals, define medical \n     necessity. The external appeals process provision in the \n     Senate Republican Leadership bill makes the appeals process \n     meaningless by allowing the HMOs themselves, rather than \n     informed health professionals, to define what services are \n     medically necessary. This loophole will make it very \n     difficult for patients to prevail on appeals to get the \n     treatment doctors believe they need.\n       Fails to guarantee direct access to specialists. The Senate \n     Republican Leadership proposal fails to ensure that patients \n     with serious health problems have direct access to the \n     specialists they need. We believe that patients with \n     conditions like cancer or heart disease should not be denied \n     access to the doctors they need to treat their conditions.\n       Fails to protect patients from abrupt changes in care in \n     the middle of treatment. The Senate Republican Leadership \n     bill fails to assure continuity-of-care protections when an \n     employer changes health plans. This deficiency means that, \n     for example, pregnant women or individuals undergoing care \n     for a chronic illness may have their care suddenly altered \n     mid course, potentially causing serious health consequences.\n       Reverses course on emergency room protections. The Senate \n     Republican Leadership bill backs away from the emergency room \n     protections that Congress implemented in a bipartisan manner \n     for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997. The bill includes a watered-down \n     provision that does not require health plans to cover \n     patients who go to an emergency room outside their network \n     and does not ensure coverage for any treatment beyond an \n     initial screening. Those provisions put patients at risk for \n     the huge costs associated with critical emergency treatment.\n       Allows financial incentives to threaten critical patient \n     care. The Senate Republican Leadership bill fail to prohibit \n     secret financial incentives to providers. This would leave \n     patients vulnerable to financial incentives that limit \n     patient care.\n       Fails to hold health plans accountable when their actions \n     cause patients serious harm. The proposed per-day penalties \n     in the Senate Republican Leadership bill fail to hold health \n     plans accountable when patients suffer serious harm or even \n     death because of a plan's wrongful action. For example, if a \n     health plan improperly denies a lifesaving cancer treatment \n     to a child, it will incur a penalty only for the number of \n     days it takes to reverse its decision; it will not have to \n     pay the family for all damages the family will suffer as the \n     result of having a child with a now untreatable disease. And \n     because the plan will not have to pay for all the harm it \n     causes, it will have insufficient incentive to change its \n     health care practices in the future.\n       Includes ``poison pill'' provisions that have nothing to do \n     with a patients' bill of rights. For example, expanding \n     Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) before studying the current \n     demonstration is premature, at best, and could undermine an \n     already unstable insurance market.\n       As I have said before, I would veto a bill that does not \n     address these serious flaws. I could not sanction presenting \n     a bill to the American people that is nothing more than an \n     empty promise.\n       At the same time, as I have repeatedly made clear, I remain \n     fully committed to working with you, as well as the \n     Democratic Leadership, to pass a meaningful patients' bill of \n     rights before the Congress adjourns. We can make progress in \n     this area if, and only if, we work together to provide needed \n     health care protections to ensure Americans have much needed \n     confidence in their health care system.\n       Producing a patients' bill of rights that can attract \n     bipartisan support and receive my signature will require a \n     full and open debate on the Senate floor. There must be \n     adequate time and a sufficient number of amendments to ensure \n     that the bill gives patients the basic protections they need \n     and deserve. I am confident that you and Senator Daschle can \n     work out a process that accommodates the scheduling needs of \n     the Senate and allows you to address fully the health care \n     needs of the American public.\n       Last year, we worked together in a bipartisan manner to \n     pass a balanced budget including historic Medicare reforms \n     and the largest investment in children's health care since \n     the enactment of Medicaid. This year, we have another \n     opportunity to work together to improve health care for \n     millions of Americans.\n       I urge you to make the patients' bill of rights the first \n     order of business for the Senate. Further delay threatens the \n     ability of the Congress to pass a bill that I can sign into \n     law this year. I stand ready to work with you and Senator \n     Daschle to ensure that patients--not politics--are our first \n     priority.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask further of the leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield further to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. As we all know, the cynicism of the American people is, \nregrettably, growing with respect to their view as to how politics \nworks in their own country. Increasingly, that is reflected in their \nattitude about campaigns and voting. And many, many people are aware of \nthe enormous influence of money in American politics.\n  Regrettably, there appears, now, to already be a question arising \nwithin this Congress about the link of tobacco to some of the events \nthat have taken place here. I wonder if the leader would not share with \nme the sense that the entire tobacco debate and the now-early \ninvestigative efforts taking place with respect to tobacco expenditures \ndon't make even more compelling the notion that the U.S. Senate ought \nto deal with campaign finance reform as rapidly as possible?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. \nThere are so many areas that I believe ought to be clarified and ought \nto be rectified. I don't think there is any greater need than for \nclarification on the role of independent expenditures and what may \nhappen, now, with regard to tobacco.\n  Passing Shays-Meehan would allow us to do that. We ought to let that \nhappen. We ought to make that happen in the next 6 weeks.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me just say, Mr. President, to the leader--and I know \nhe shares this view--there are many of us prepared to adopt the same \nmeasure of militancy that was found in the House of Representatives in \norder to guarantee that the Senate has an opportunity to deal with \ncampaign finance reform.\n  I hope the leadership on the other side will take note of the need to \ndo the business of this Nation and to do the business of the Senate in \na timely and orderly fashion, but that there is an absolute \ndetermination by a number of us to guarantee that we make the best \npossible effort to try to pass the Shays-Meehan bill in this body.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for taking the floor this afternoon \nand making his unanimous consent request. I sincerely regret there was \nan objection to it. I would like to ask the minority leader a question, \nbut first I would like to note that over this last break, I made a tour \nof my State, and I did an interesting thing I never had done before. I \nvisited community hospitals, and I invited the professional nursing and \nmedical staffs to come down and meet with me and talk about this issue. \nI wanted to find out if my impression of the importance of this issue--\nwhat I had seen in the mail, what I had heard from my colleagues--was \nfelt in downstate Illinois, in a small town, in a community hospital.\n  I found it very interesting that many doctors came into the room to \nmeet with me. They brought their beepers along. Some of them were \ncalled off to emergency calls and others with like requirements, but \nthey met there because they wanted to take the time to tell me what \nthey thought.\n  The stories they told me were amazing. I thought I heard it all on \nthe floor of the Senate about what the insurance companies were doing \nto American families, how health care was being compromised and why \nthis legislation, which the Senator from South Dakota has suggested, is \nso important. But when a doctor comes before me and says, ``I had to \ncall the insurance company for approval to admit a patient and they \nsaid, `No, we won't go along with your suggestion, your medical advice, \nsend the patient home,' '' this one doctor in Joliet said, ``I finally \nasked the person on the other end of the line, `Are you a doctor?' ''\n  He said, ``No.''\n  He said, ``Are you a nurse?''\n  He said, ``No.''\n  He said, ``Do you have a college degree?''\n  The man said, ``Well, no.''\n  He said, ``Well, what is your training?''\n  He said, ``Well, I have a high-school diploma, and I have the \ninsurance company manual that I'm reading from.''\n  That is what it came down to, and a patient was sent home because \nthis man, with literally no medical education, made a decision based on \nthe insurance manual.\n\n[[Page S9737]]\n\n  Another doctor told a story, which was just amazing and frightening \nto any parent, about how a mother brought a son in who had been \ncomplaining of chronic headaches on the left side of his head. The \ndoctor examined him and said clearly, ``This is a situation where a CAT \nscan is warranted, because there may be a tumor present and let's \ndecide very early if that is the case.''\n  He left the room and called the insurance company. The insurance \ncompany said, ``Under no circumstances does that policy allow a CAT \nscan of that little boy,'' who had been complaining of these headaches \nfor such a long period of time.\n  The doctor said, ``Not only did they overrule me, but under my \ncontract, when I went back in the room and faced the mother, I couldn't \ntell that mother that I had just been overruled by an insurance company \nclerk. I had to act as if it were my decision not to go forward with \nthe CAT scan.''\n  That is what the gag rule is all about. We are restraining doctors \nfrom being honest with their patients, doctors from their honest \nrelationship with parents bringing in children for care.\n  So when the Senator from South Dakota suggests this unanimous consent \nrequest to bring this issue up, I say that my experience in the last \nfew weeks suggests this is a timely issue, an important issue, much \nmore important in many ways than a lot of the things that we have \ndiscussed on the floor of the Senate.\n  My question of the Senator from South Dakota is this: I understand \nthat he has said we must pass the appropriations bills. That is the \nresponsible thing to do. That takes precedence. But he has also said \nlet's move to this bill and allow amendments to it.\n  We have seen repeatedly here--the Republican leadership has stopped \nan effort to pass a tobacco bill. The Republican leadership has stopped \nan effort to pass campaign finance reform. And now it appears the \nRepublican leadership is going to stop an effort to have a Patients' \nBill of Rights and do something about managed care.\n  Can the Senator from South Dakota tell me what is it that is so \npressing on this Senate agenda in the next 4 weeks that we cannot set \naside even 1 day's time to discuss managed care reform? Is there \nsomething that perhaps the majority leader has told the Senator from \nSouth Dakota which we missed in the newspapers?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois has made a very eloquent and \npoignant statement about circumstances that are very real, that are \nhappening as we speak in Illinois, South Dakota, Massachusetts, and \nCalifornia. In every State, there are illustrations of how the system \nis broken, just as the Senator from Illinois has described.\n  But he really needs to direct his question to the majority leader. I \ndon't know what could be more pressing than this issue. Obviously, by \nlaw, we have to address appropriations bills. Obviously, by law, we \nshould be addressing the budget, but I am told the Republicans now may \noverlook the fact that the law requires a budget resolution by April \n15. They are overlooking that. So we have already violated--they have \nviolated the law with regard to the budget. But I would hope we can \nadhere to the law with regard to appropriations, because we know the \nconsequences if we don't. We have already gone through that. I think \nthey have learned their lesson on that. We don't want to shut the \nGovernment down, but I would direct your question to the majority \nleader when you have the opportunity.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be coming to the floor and taking that opportunity \nwhen I can. I ask one other question of the minority leader.\n  Is it not a fact that the Republican approach on this--should they \ncall their legislation--on Patients' Bill of Rights--if you can \ncharacterize it as such--only protects 29 percent of all the American \npopulation from managed care abuses? Is it not true that the Republican \napproach, sponsored by Senator Nickles, in fact, does not provide \nprotection for those who are self-employed, employees in small \ncompanies, State and local government employees; it leaves out a wide \nswath of Americans who deserve the same kind of basic protection when \nit comes to health insurance? Is this not one of the reasons why we \nwould like to offer amendments so that we can cover the vast majority \nof Americans rather than exclude the majority, as the Republican bill \ndoes in its current form?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely right. They leave out over 100 \nmillion people; 100 million people won't be touched.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. So it is a sham. It is not a piece of legislation that \ncan give confidence to any American today, not when the problems are as \ngreat as the ones suggested by the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from South Dakota----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If he will yield for one final question. What is it that \nis so--if the Senator knows--what is it that is so frightening to the \nmajority that they will not allow this issue to come to the floor? We \nknow it is timely. We know it is important. The Republican Senators \nhave put forth a bill that they think should be considered. Why is it \nthat this particular issue, involving massive insurance companies and \nhealth care across America, is so frightening to the Republican \nmajority that they will not allow your unanimous consent request? Can \nthe Senator from South Dakota give us some insight as to why this issue \nshould be so frightening to the Republican majority?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I wish I could. I appreciate the question offered by the \nSenator from Illinois. I have no clue. All I know is that the American \npeople are expecting us to act responsibly and comprehensively on this \nissue. I hope we will, and we will be back, either in the form of \namendments or additional unanimous consent requests, to give them the \nopportunity to change their mind.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the distinguished assistant majority \nleader is here and would like to say a few things about the issue that \nhas just been before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I will make a couple comments \nconcerning those made by some of our Democratic colleagues who said \nthey want to bring up the Patients' Bill of Rights. We have offered \nthroughout the month of July to bring up the Patients' Bill of Rights. \nI will make a unanimous consent request to do it again. Unfortunately, \nour Democratic colleagues haven't been able to take yes for an answer. \nIn other words, I think they want to debate an issue, discuss an issue, \nhave unlimited amendments, and we are not going to give them that.\n  We only have 22 days left in this legislative session. We tried to \nget this up and considered and done in July. They wouldn't accept that \nrequest.\n  In just a moment, I am going to make a unanimous consent request to \nbring it up with limited amendments. I will tell my colleagues, it will \nbe three amendments a side. You can design any amendment any way you \nwant. You can offer your proposal in any way that you want. We are \ngoing to give you an up-or-down vote on your proposal; we are going to \nhave an up-or-down vote on our proposal. That is going to be in my \nrequest. You would have the right to do three amendments; we would have \nthe right to do three amendments. It is the same request that we made \nin July. If you want this issue to be considered and passed, that is \nthe way to do it. If you want to say we want to have this issue on the \nfloor all month, as was the unanimous consent request made by the \nminority leader, that is not going to happen. Or to say that we are \ngoing to take up the House bill and work off the House bill, that is \nnot going to happen.\n\n  So, again, I tell my colleagues, if you want to consider the bill, \nand if you want it passed, the Patients' Bill of Rights, we are willing \nto do it. What I hear our friends on the Democratic side say is, ``We \nknow we don't have the votes so we want to talk about it.'' And \nsometimes I think it is important if you are going to talk about the \nissue\n\n[[Page S9738]]\n\nthat you speak truthfully. Unfortunately, I do not think the President \ndid that in his radio address.\n  The President, in his radio address on Saturday, frankly--I am going \nto come back to that issue shortly because I know my friend from \nKentucky wants to go back to the bill. I am going to come back later to \nthe floor and analyze the President's speech or his radio address where \nhe talked about the Patients' Bill of Rights, and he characterized what \nthe Republican bill did. And he was flat wrong. I think he should know \nthe truth. And maybe his staff should do better work or they should \nquit trying to politicize this issue and he should speak factually what \nis in our bill and what is in his bill. Unfortunately, that did not \nhappen on Saturday.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No, I will not yield. I will yield in a moment.\n  Another thing that galls this Senator is if and when the President \nthinks he can legislate by radio address. The President is the Chief \nExecutive Officer in the country, but under the Constitution he does \nnot have legislative powers to legislate by Executive order or to \nlegislate by radio address. I think, frankly, he crossed that line \nagain on Saturday. That is unfortunate.\n  If he wants legislation, we are willing to consider legislation. The \nPresident talked about having internal appeals and so on. We have \ninternal appeals in our bill. We have external appeals in our bill. So \nif the President likes that provision, he can take it up. And he should \nurge our colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle to take this \nlegislation up and pass it. We are giving a reasonable unanimous \nconsent request to bring it up. So I just hope that, again, common \nsense would prevail and that we would take the legislation up under a \nreasonable time limit.\n  I mention that the counteroffer that we received in July was not \nthree amendments a side; it was 20 amendments a side. That would be 40 \namendments. That is ridiculous. That is not going to happen. I want to \npass this legislation. Frankly, I have invested a lot of time in this \nlegislation, as well as Senator Frist and Senator Collins, Senator \nJeffords, Senator Gramm--many of our colleagues--Senator Santorum. We \nworked for months on this legislation.\n  I also want to take just a little issue with our friend from \nIllinois. He said, ``Isn't it true that the Republican bill left out \nmillions of Americans?'' That is false. We gave every single American \nthat has an employer-sponsored plan an internal appeal and external \nappeal. And that is not in current law. We believe it should be \nlegislated, not deemed by Executive order. And so to say, ``Well, they \ndon't have protections under the Republican bill'' is absolutely false.\n  We do not have 300-some mandates as proposed by the Democrat bill. We \ndo not have 56 new causes of action where really it would say it would \nbe health care by litigation. We have health care to be determined by \nphysicians, not by trial attorneys.\n  So, yes, there is a difference between the bills. We are saying: \nFine. You have a legislative proposal. We will let you offer it. We \nwill find out where the votes are. We have a legislative proposal. We \nwill offer it and find out where the votes are, and maybe offer a \ncouple of amendments. And we can dispose of the bill. We can pass the \nbill. We can go to conference with the House, hopefully work out the \ndifferences with the House.\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that the majority \nleader, after notification of the Democratic leader, shall turn to \nSenate bill S. 2330 regarding health care. I further ask that \nimmediately upon its reporting, Senator Nickles be recognized to offer \na substitute amendment making technical changes to the bill, and \nimmediately following the reporting by the clerk, Senator Kennedy be \nrecognized to offer his Patients' Bill of Rights amendment, with votes \noccurring on each amendment, with all points of order having been \nwaived. I further ask that three other amendments be in order to be \noffered by each leader or their designee regarding health care, and \nfollowing the conclusion of debate and following the votes with respect \nto the listed amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading, and \nthe Senate proceed to H.R. 4250, the House companion bill, that all \nafter the enacting clause be stricken, and the text of S. 2330, as \namended, be inserted, and the Senate proceed to a vote. I further ask \nthat following the vote, the Senate bill be returned to the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I think if I heard \ncorrectly, under the Senator from Oklahoma's proposal the Senate is \ngoing to return the bill to the calendar following the vote? Did the \nSenator say that?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Only the Senate version. What we would do is strike the \nHouse language and insert the Senate language--what we always do when \nwe consider legislation. To respond to my colleague, the text of the \nSenate language would be sent over to the House under the H.R. number.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, \nwould this unanimous consent request permit debate and discussion on \nthe principal concerns outlined in the President's letter to the \nmajority leader? Would this request permit a full discussion and debate \non each of these? They all appear to be relevant. And could we have the \nassurance that the minority leader would have the opportunity to \nformulate amendments and have a debate and discussion of at least these \nparticular proposals?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to respond.\n  It would be very easy for my colleague to address those \nconsiderations in the letter, which I have not seen yet. You could put \nthose in your amendment. You could put those in your substitute. You \ncould have that in any combination and consider everything addressed in \nthat letter.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Do I understand further that the Senator would be \nwilling to agree that we would have separate amendments on each of \nthese measures that have been included in today's letter from the \nPresident to the majority leader on the Patients' Bill of Rights?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Again, to answer my colleague's question, I said you \nwould have a substitute amendment. You could have three amendments, and \ncertainly with your skillful legislative prowess, you could have all 10 \nthings in that format.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate, I am sure, what you intended to be a \ncompliment, but I would like to know whether the leader or other \nMembers would be able to at least raise for debate and discussion each \nof the rather thoughtful observations that have been made by the \nPresident of the United States to the majority leader. And I understand \nthat the majority leader, or his spokesman, the Senator from Oklahoma, \nis not prepared to permit the observations and shortcomings of the \nRepublican proposal to be considered, if I am not wrong, to be made \nindividually.\n  Let me ask further, in the appeals procedures in the Republican \nproposal, you have put a strict limitation on the circumstances under \nwhich patients can appeal health plan decisions. It has to reach $1,000 \nin order to qualify for appeal. That would effectively rule out any \nchild, for example, that might have had a bicycle accident or a hockey \naccident or football accident from being able to be guaranteed a right \nto an appeal under the Republican proposal.\n  Would we have an opportunity to debate this limitation and others in \nthe appeals section of the Republican proposal?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, one, I have a unanimous consent request \npending at the table.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am reserving the right to object. I would like to find \nout if we are able to have a debate and discussion about the wisdom of \nputting dollar thresholds on the appeals that are in the Republican \nproposal.\n  Would we have an opportunity for the Senate to express itself on \nwhether it wants a $1,000 threshold to exclude----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Regular order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object. What is the regular \norder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President----\n\n[[Page S9739]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Once the regular order has been called for, \nthe Senator cannot reserve the right to object. The Senator must either \nobject or not.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. For those reasons, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I regret that my colleague from \nMassachusetts has objected to our unanimous consent request to bring \nthis bill up. Obviously, he has some concerns, but he does not have the \nvotes.\n  We have offered to vote on his proposal. He can draft his proposal \nany way he wants. We have drafted our proposal. We want to vote on our \nproposal. We want to pass our proposal. We will give him an up-or-down \nvote on his proposal. We will offer and have offered that he can have \ntwo or three amendments, and we can have two or three amendments. We \ncan finish this bill. He can draft those amendments in any way, shape \nor form he wants to and address any and all issues he has addressed \ntoday that might be in this letter or another letter. I hope he will do \nbetter work in the letter than the President did in his radio address. \nHe was factually incorrect in that. I happen to be offended by that. I \njust make that comment.\n\n  To reiterate, we offered to bring this up in July. My colleague from \nTennessee and I and others wanted to finish it in July because we know \nwe have a difficult conference with the House. This is not the easiest \nlegislation to consider. So it is important to move sooner rather than \nlater, as I think I heard my colleague from South Dakota mention. So I \nhope we will bring it up. But we are going to have to have cooperation \nfrom our colleagues. If they continue to insist on unlimited \namendments, to where they can debate this issue all month, that is not \ngoing to happen. They will be successful in killing this bill, not the \nRepublicans.\n  I yield to my colleague from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. As I understand the unanimous consent request, there would \nbe the opportunity for either side to put into the bill they brought to \nthe floor anything they wanted to. Is it correct, then, that whatever \ndocuments have been put forward or requested by the President could be \nbrought forward to the floor in the original bill that the Democratic \nleader or the Senator from Massachusetts brought forward?\n  Mr. NICKLES. They could have it in the original bill or they could \noffer it in the form of an amendment.\n  Mr. FRIST. The unanimous consent would allow consideration of a bill \npresented by the Democratic leader and a bill that is presented by the \nRepublican leader?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. In the unanimous consent, you gave the opportunity for \namendments to come forward. How many amendments on either side?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Three.\n  Mr. FRIST. In saying there could be only three amendments, you did \nnot restrict what was in the original underlying bill so that any issue \ncould be put forward--a bill of rights, or a recommendation by the \nPresident--is that correct?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That's correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. That has been denied.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes. It is unfortunate because my Democratic colleagues \nare not able to take yes for an answer. I regret that.\n  Mr. FRIST. One final question. The issue of the Patients' Bill of \nRights is very important to me. As my colleague from Oklahoma has \npointed out, we have collectively, as the U.S. Senate, spent a lot of \ntime on this particular issue. Given the fact that we do have a number \nof bills--and I know we are anxious to get to the underlying bill right \nnow--isn't it reasonable, given the opportunity, that we can put into \nthese bills a Patients' Bill of Rights, or anything we want to, based \non the unanimous consent right now? Isn't it reasonable to limit that \ndiscussion so that we can conduct the Senate's business, since we can \nput as much as we want into these bills right now and also allow them \nto be subjected to the amendments of the unanimous consent?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I agree. Particularly, if you want to see something \nbecome law, it is going to have to be this kind of structure, or it \nwill never happen. We would still be talking toward the end of \nSeptember. We might have a good debate or a political issue, but we \nwon't have any legislative change. I happen to be interested in trying \nto make a significant legislative improvement that becomes law.\n  Mr. FRIST. I just hope we can come to agreement and a time agreement \non this important issue, and that we can address this Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the leadership the Senator has shown in \nputting this bill together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/01/senate-section/article/S9733-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9739-S9751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Indonesia is the World's 4th most populous nation, with \n     a population in excess of 200,000,000 people.\n       (2) Since 1997, political, economic, and social turmoil in \n     Indonesia has escalated.\n       (3) Indonesia is comprised of more than 13,000 islands \n     located between the mainland of Southeast Asia and Australia. \n     Indonesia occupies an important strategic location, \n     straddling vital sea lanes for communication and commercial \n     transportation including all or part of every major sea route \n     between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, more than 50 \n     percent of all international shipping trade, and sea lines of \n     communication used by the United States Pacific Command to \n     support operations in the Persian Gulf.\n       (4) Indonesia has been an important ally of the United \n     States, has made vital contributions to the maintenance of \n     regional peace and stability through its leading role in the \n     Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Asia \n     Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC), and has promoted \n     United States economic, political, and security interests in \n     Asia.\n       (5) In the 25 years before the onset of the recent \n     financial crisis in Asia, the economy of Indonesia grew at an \n     average rate of 7 percent per year.\n       (6) Since July 1997, the Indonesian rupiah has lost 70 \n     percent of its value, and the Indonesian economy is now at a \n     near standstill characterized by inflation, tight liquidity, \n     and rising unemployment.\n       (7) Indonesia has also faced a severe drought and massive \n     fires in the past year which have adversely affected its \n     ability to produce sufficient food to meet its needs.\n\n[[Page S9740]]\n\n       (8) As a consequence of this economic instability and the \n     drought and fires, as many as 100,000,000 people in Indonesia \n     may experience food shortages, malnutrition, and possible \n     starvation as a result of being unable to purchase food. \n     These conditions increase the potential for widespread social \n     unrest in Indonesia.\n       (9) Following the abdication of Indonesia President Suharto \n     in May 1998, Indonesia is in the midst of a profound \n     political transition. The current president of Indonesia, \n     B.J. Habibie, has called for new parliamentary elections in \n     mid-1999, allowed the formation of new political parties, and \n     pledged to resolve the role of the military in Indonesian \n     society.\n       (10) The Government of Indonesia has taken several \n     important steps toward political reform and support of \n     democratic institutions, including support for freedom of \n     expression, release of political prisoners, formation of \n     political parties and trade unions, preparations for new \n     elections, removal of ethnic designations from identity \n     cards, and commitments to legal and civil service reforms \n     which will increase economic and legal transparency and \n     reduce corruption.\n       (11) To address the food shortages in Indonesia, the United \n     States Government has made more than 230,000 tons of food \n     available to Indonesia this year through grants and so-called \n     ``soft'' loans and has pledged support for additional wheat \n     and food to meet emergency needs in Indonesia.\n       (12) United States national security interests are well-\n     served by political stability in Indonesia and by friendly \n     relations between the United States and Indonesia.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the decision of the Clinton Administration to make \n     available at least 1,500,000 tons of wheat, wheat products, \n     and rice for distribution to the most needy and vulnerable \n     Indonesians is vital to the well-being of all Indonesians;\n       (2) the Clinton Administration should work with the World \n     Food Program and nongovernmental organizations to design \n     programs to make the most effective use of food donations in \n     Indonesia and to expedite delivery of food assistance in \n     order to reach those in Indonesia most in need;\n       (3) the Clinton Administration should adopt a more active \n     approach in support of democratic institutions and processes \n     in Indonesia and provide assistance for continued economic \n     and political development in Indonesia, including--\n       (A) support for humanitarian programs aimed at preventing \n     famine, meeting the needs of the Indonesian people, and \n     inculcating social stability;\n       (B) leading a multinational effort (including the active \n     participation of Japan, the nations of Europe, and other \n     nations) to assist the programs referred to in subparagraph \n     (A);\n       (C) calling on donor nations and humanitarian and food aid \n     programs to make additional efforts to meet the needs of \n     Indonesia and its people while laying the groundwork for a \n     more open and participatory society in Indonesia;\n       (D) working with international financial institutions to \n     recapitalize and reform the banking system, restructure \n     corporate debt, and introduce economic and legal transparency \n     in Indonesia;\n       (E) urging the Government of Indonesia to remove, to the \n     maximum extent possible, barriers to trade and investment \n     which impede economic recovery in Indonesia, including \n     tariffs, quotas, export taxes, nontariff barriers, and \n     prohibitions against foreign ownership and investment;\n       (F) urging the Government of Indonesia to--\n       (i) recognize the importance of the participation of all \n     Indonesians, including ethnic and religious minorities, in \n     the political and economic life of Indonesia; and\n       (ii) take appropriate action to assure the support and \n     protection of minority participation in the political, \n     social, and economic life of Indonesia;\n       (iii) release individuals detained or imprisoned for their \n     political views.\n       (G) support for efforts by the Government of Indonesia to \n     cast a wide social safety net in order to provide relief to \n     the neediest Indonesians and to restore hope to those \n     Indonesians who have been harmed by the economic crisis in \n     Indonesia;\n       (H) support for efforts to build democracy in Indonesia in \n     order to strengthen political participation and the \n     development of legitimate democratic processes and the rule \n     of law in Indonesia, including support for organizations, \n     such as the Asia Foundation and the National Endowment for \n     Democracy, which can provide technical assistance in \n     developing and strengthening democratic political \n     institutions and processes in Indonesia;\n       (I) calling on the Government of Indonesia to repeal all \n     laws and regulations that discriminate on the basis of \n     religion or ethnicity and to ensure that all new laws are in \n     keeping with international standards on human rights; and\n       (J) calling on the Government of Indonesia to establish, \n     announce publicly, and adhere to a clear timeline for \n     parliamentary elections in Indonesia.\n       (c) Report.--(1) Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \n     Congress a report containing the following:\n       (A) A description and assessment of the actions taken by \n     the Government of the United States to work with the \n     Government of Indonesia to further the objectives referred to \n     in subsection (b)(3).\n       (B) A description and assessment of the actions taken by \n     the Government of Indonesia to further such objectives.\n       (C) An evaluation of the implications of the matters \n     described and assessed under subparagraphs (A) and (B), and \n     any other appropriate matters, for relations between the \n     United States and Indonesia.\n       (2) The report under this subsection shall be submitted in \n     unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself \n     and Mr. McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered 3508.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title V, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) In May 1998, more than 1,200 people died in Indonesia \n     as a result of riots, targeted attacks, and violence in \n     Indonesia. According to numerous reports by human rights \n     groups, United Nations officials, and the press, ethnic \n     Chinese in Indonesia were specifically targeted in the riots \n     for attacks which included acts of brutality, looting, arson, \n     and rape.\n       (2) Credible reports indicate that, between May 13 and May \n     15, 1998, at least 150 Chinese women and girls, some as young \n     as 9 years of age, were systematically raped as part of a \n     campaign of racial violence in Indonesia, and 20 of these \n     women subsequently died from injuries incurred during these \n     rapes.\n       (3) Credible evidence indicates that these rapes were the \n     result of a systematic and organized operation and may well \n     have continued to the present time.\n       (4) Indonesia President Habibie has stated that he believes \n     the riots and rapes to be ``the most inhuman acts in the \n     history of the nation'', that they were ``criminal'' acts, \n     and that ``we will not accept it, we will not let it happen \n     again.''.\n       (5) Indonesian human rights groups have asserted that the \n     Indonesia Government failed to take action necessary to \n     control the riots, violence, and rapes directed against \n     ethnic Chinese in Indonesia and that some elements of the \n     Indonesia military may have participated in such acts.\n       (6) The Executive Director of the United Nations \n     Development Fund for Women has stated that the attacks were \n     an ``organized reaction to a crisis and culprits must be \n     brought to trial'' and that the systematic use of rape in the \n     riots ``is totally unacceptable. . . and even more disturbing \n     than rape war crimes, as Indonesia was not at war with \n     another country but caught in its own internal crisis''.\n       (7) The Indonesia Government has established the Joint \n     National Fact Finding Team to investigate the violence and \n     allegations of gang rapes, but there are allegations that the \n     investigation is moving slowly and that the Team lacks the \n     authority necessary to carry out an appropriate \n     investigation.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the mistreatment of ethnic Chinese in Indonesia and the \n     criminal acts carried out against them during the May 1998 \n     riots in Indonesia is deplorable and condemned;\n       (2) a complete, full, and fair investigation of such \n     criminal acts should be completed by the earliest possible \n     date, and those identified as responsible for perpetrating \n     such criminal acts should be brought to justice;\n       (3) the investigation by the Government of Indonesia, \n     through its Military Honor Council, of those members of the \n     armed forces of Indonesia suspected of possible involvement \n     in the May 1998 riots, and of any member of the armed forces \n     of Indonesia who may have participated in criminal acts \n     against the people of Indonesia during the riots, is \n     commended and should be supported;\n       (4) the Government of Indonesia should take action to \n     assure--\n       (A) the full observance of the human rights of the ethnic \n     Chinese in Indonesia and of all other minority groups in \n     Indonesia;\n       (B) the implementation of appropriate measures to prevent \n     ethnic-related violence and rapes in Indonesia and to \n     safeguard the physical safety of the ethnic Chinese community \n     in Indonesia;\n       (C) prompt follow through on its announced intention to \n     provide damage loans to help rebuild businesses and homes for \n     those who suffered losses in the riots; and\n\n[[Page S9741]]\n\n       (D) the provision of just compensation for victims of the \n     rape and violence that occurred during the May 1998 riots in \n     Indonesia, including medical care;\n       (5) the Clinton Administration and the United Nations \n     should provide support and assistance to the Government of \n     Indonesia, and to nongovernmental organizations, in the \n     investigations into the May 1998 riots in Indonesia in order \n     to expedite such investigations; and\n       (6) Indonesia should ratify the United Nations Convention \n     on Racial Discrimination, Torture, and Human Rights.\n       (c) Support For Investigations.--Of the amounts \n     appropriated by this Act for Indonesia, the Secretary of \n     State, after consultation with Congress, shall make available \n     such funds as the Secretary considers appropriate in order to \n     provide support and technical assistance to the Government of \n     Indonesia, and to independent nongovernmental organizations, \n     for purposes of conducting full, fair, and impartial \n     investigations into the allegations surrounding the riots, \n     violence, and rape of ethnic Chinese in Indonesia in May \n     1998.\n       (d) Report.--(1) Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \n     Congress a report containing the following:\n       (A) An assessment of--\n       (i) whether or not there was a systematic and organized \n     campaign of violence, including the use of rape, against the \n     ethnic Chinese community in Indonesia during the May 1998 \n     riots in Indonesia; and\n       (ii) the level and degree of participation, if any, of \n     members of the Government or armed forces of Indonesia in the \n     riots.\n       (B) An assessment of the adequacy of the actions taken by \n     the Government of Indonesia to investigate the May 1998 riots \n     in Indonesia, bring the perpetrators of the riots to justice, \n     and ensure that similar riots do not recur.\n       (C) An evaluation of the implications of the matters \n     assessed under subparagraphs (A) and (B) for relations \n     between the United States and Indonesia.\n       (2) The report under this subsection shall be submitted in \n     unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of the distinguished \nchairman of the subcommittee and myself to address the two amendments \nthat I have just sent to the desk. The first amendment addresses the \npolitical, economic, and social turmoil now facing Indonesia, one of \nour most important allies, and calls for a more active U.S. role in \nsupporting a peaceful economic and political transition in Indonesia.\n  The second amendment expresses my concern and condemnation over the \nallegations regarding the brutal treatment and rape of ethnic Chinese \nwomen in Indonesia during the riots that occurred this past May, a \nsituation that, if left unaddressed, threatens to undermine the other \nprogress that Indonesia is making.\n  Taken together, I believe that these two amendments provide a solid \nframework for U.S. policy towards this vital country.\n  Indonesia is a country of great significance for the United States, \nand we have a great deal riding on the outcome of the current period of \neconomic and political transition.\n  Indonesia is the world's fourth-most populous nation, and its ethnic \nand religious diversity boasts the world's largest Muslim population;\n  Indonesia is comprised of over 13,000 islands which span important \nsea lanes, including 50 percent of volume of all international shipping \nand every major route between the Indian and Pacific Oceans;\n  Indonesia has served as a vital engine of East Asian economic growth. \nIt possesses vast natural resources, including oil and gas. Before the \ndisruption caused by the current global financial crisis, the World \nBank in 1997 estimated that Indonesia would possess the world's 6th \nlargest economy by early in the new century, and Indonesia has been an \nactive proponent of more liberal trade measures in the Asia-Pacific \nregion;\n  As the largest member of ASEAN, and a founder of the Asian Regional \nForum, Indonesia has been a linchpin of regional security, and has \nworked with the United States on many key regional security concerns;\n  In short, the United States has a profound national interest in the \nemergence of a stable, prosperous and democratic Indonesia from its \ncurrent period of instability.\n  Let me briefly recap some of the issues currently facing Indonesia \nand the developments which underscore, I believe, the need for these \ntwo Amendments.\n  First, in response to public pressure to step down, earlier this year \nPresident Suharto resigned after thirty-two years in office. Following \nan orderly transfer of power, the new President, B.J. Habibie, \nassembled a cabinet, took some initial steps towards political reform, \nand pledged new elections.\n  Several dangers still lie ahead. Indonesia lacks a system with strong \nand capable democratic institutions and has a long history of regional, \nreligious and ethnic tensions. The road to a more open and democratic \npolitical system will be long and hazardous.\n  Second, at the same time as Indonesia must make progress in this \npolitical transition, it is imperative that the Habibie government also \ntake action to address the economic crisis that continues to buffet \nIndonesia.\n  In other words, it is in the national interest of the United States \nthat there be a stable, prosperous and democratic Indonesia and that it \ncome out of its current period of instability.\n  The first amendment before this body addresses the political, \neconomic, and the social turmoil now facing Indonesia, and it calls for \na more active U.S. role in supporting a peaceful economic and political \ntransition and for America to lead a major humanitarian effort. Mr. \nPresident, today, at least 7\\1/2\\ million people are facing starvation \nin that country.\n  The second amendment is a sense of the Senate that expresses the \nconcern and condemnation regarding allegations for the brutal \nmistreatment of the ethnic Chinese community within that country. That \ncommunity totals about 6 percent of Indonesia's population. It is an \nentrepreneurial mercantile class. Once before, in the 1960s, during a \npro-Communist revolution, the Chinese ethnic community was made a \nscapegoat, and literally tens of thousands of people were killed. This \ntime, once again, there was a brutal outbreak against this community, \nand this resolution condemns it in no uncertain terms.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Indonesia is extraordinarily important \neconomically. As I said, the rupiah has fallen by over 70 percent in \nvalue in the past year. The country is saddled with about $80 billion \nin private debt and the prospect of a fall of 10 percent in its gross \ndomestic product and a drop of over 25 percent of its manufacturing \noutput. The economy is at a standstill. Inflation is threatening to \nreach triple digits and unemployment is rising rapidly.\n  While I believe that Indonesia has the long-term capacity to work its \nway back to prosperity, in the short term the pain will likely get \nworse as the full effect of the financial crisis works its way through \nthe economy.\n  Finally, Indonesia is on the brink of a profound humanitarian crisis.\n  In the past year Indonesia has faced severe droughts and massive \nfires, with the end result being that Indonesia is now unable to \nproduce sufficient food to meet the needs of its people--food shortages \nwhich have been exacerbated by the current economic crisis.\n  In a somewhat limited assessment earlier this year, the World Food \nProgram estimated that more than 7.5 million Indonesians in the Eastern \nareas faced severe food shortages, malnutrition, and starvation as a \nresult of the drought and fires. Others have estimated that with the \neffects of the economic crisis compounding the natural disasters, \nupwards of 100 million people across all of Indonesia may soon face \nacute food shortages.\n  The Administration, I believe, is to be commended for its handling of \nthe situation thus far. President Clinton's meeting with Suharto at \nAPEC last fall, Special Presidential Envoy Mondale's session with \nSuharto in March, Secretary Albright's numerous discussions with \nForeign Minister Alatas, and Assistant Secretary Roth's many trips to \nJakarta have provided the United States an opportunity to encourage and \nsupport Indonesian political and economic reform.\n  The Administration has also made important pledges of food aid--more \nthan 230,000 tons this year through grants and ``soft'' loans, with \nmuch more promised if and as the crisis deepens.\n  In assessing the challenges facing Indonesia, however, I believe that \nthe United States must do more to assist the people of Indonesia to \ntake advantage of the challenges and opportunities of a post-Suharto \nera.\n  Indeed, beyond the ``macro'' questions of political and economic \nreform,\n\n[[Page S9742]]\n\nhard-won gains made over the past thirty years in such areas as \nnutrition, sanitation and public health are all under threat, while, \ncrime, child labor, and poverty are on the rise. Ordinary Indonesians \nare suffering as a result of this crisis.\n  First, in recognition of the need to help alleviate that suffering, \nthis Amendment supports the Administration's pledges of humanitarian \nfood assistance. Moreover, it calls on the United States to take a \nleading role in the international community in developing and \nimplementing efforts to meet Indonesia's humanitarian and food needs, \nwith the goal of assuring that programs are put in place which will \nprevent famine and which will meet the basic needs of Indonesia's \npeople.\n  I believe it is extraordinarily important that the United States lead \na major international effort at humanitarian relief to see that the \npeople of Indonesia avoid starvation. And this sense of the Senate, the \nfirst resolution, puts this body in support of the administration's \nactions and urges the administration to go a step further and lead a \nmajor international humanitarian relief effort.\n  Second, this amendment supports Indonesia's efforts to move forward \nwith economic reforms. As I have already said, while I am encouraged by \nsome of the positive signs we have seen thus far, the key question is \nwhether the Habibie government will be more successful than its \npredecessor in carrying through on its economic reform commitments.\n  To that end this amendment calls on the United States to adopt a more \naggressive approach to working with Indonesia to implement serious and \nfar reaching economic and fiscal reform: To restructure corporate debt, \nreform bankrupt and corrupt economic structures, implement transparent \nlegal and banking systems, and open its economy to greater \ninternational trade.\n  At the same time, this amendment recognizes that such economic reform \ncan not come without considerable disruption to the lives of many \nIndonesians, and it thus supports efforts by the Government of \nIndonesia to cast a wide social safety net to provide relief to those \nin need.\n  Finally, given President Habibie's public affirmation of the \nimportance of moving on political reform and economic recovery in \ntandem--an approach I agree with--this amendment also calls on the \nAdministration to take a more activist approach to working to develop \ndemocratic institutions and processes in Indonesia, to see that the \nhuman rights of all Indonesians are respected and protected, and for \nthe Government of Indonesia to adhere to its commitment to hold \nelections.\n  In sum, this amendment seeks to encourage the development of more \nactive and engaged U.S. approach to Indonesia, and a U.S. policy which \nwill work the Indonesian government to develop and lead a reform \nprocess that is deep and wide, reaches out to all Indonesians, and lays \nthe groundwork for restored confidence in Indonesia's political and \neconomic future.\n  The second amendment which I have offered today speaks to a specific \nsituation in Indonesia which I fear, if left unaddressed, runs the risk \nof undermining the progress which Indonesia has made and the goals \narticulated by my first amendment: The question is the treatment of its \nethnic Chinese minority during the riots of this May, and specifically \nwhat appears to be systematic rape against the female population as an \ninstrument of terror.\n  Mr. President, in all too many places and in all too many conflicts \nin recent years we have witnessed the use of rape and sexual torture as \nan instrument of war and ethnic cleansing. Although, I am sad to say, \nsome incidents of rape have always accompanied war and turmoil in human \nhistory, the record of the past few years, with the use of organized, \nsystematic campaigns of rape as a tool of terror, is almost as though a \nnew chapter in the barbarity of human history has been opened.\n  I was therefore deeply troubled when I learned that there are serious \nand credible allegations that rape was used as an instrument of terror \nin targeted attacks on the ethnic Chinese community in Indonesia during \nthe riots this past May.\n  According to credible reports, at least 168 cases of rape occurred in \nJakarta alone during the riots of May 13-15, 1998 as part of a pattern \nof political violence targeted against ethnic Chinese in Indonesia.\n  An investigative report published in Asiaweek on July 24, 1998 \ndescribes incidents documented by Rosita Noer, an Indonesian physician \nand human rights activist. For example, ``In three Chinese areas of \nwest Jakarta, between 5 and 8 pm, dozens of men dragged a hundred or so \ngirls on to the streets, stripped them and forced them to dance before \na crowd. Twenty were raped, then some burned alive, says Noer. She \nexamined six other victims attacked in their homes in different areas \nof Jakarta. The girls were between the ages of 14 and 20; four of them \nhad been raped by seven men.''\n  In light of such reports, I was encouraged by President Habibie's \ndecision two months ago to set up a national committee of inquiry to \ninvestigate the rapes, and his branding these rapes as criminal, \ninhumane actions.\n  I have been troubled, however, by the lack of clear and decisive \naction taken by the Government of Indonesia over the past three months \nto investigate these rapes and bring the perpetrators to justice.\n  Just this past weekend, for example, Indonesian Women's Affairs \nMinister Tutty Alawiah, one of the leaders of the government \ninvestigation, was reported in the press to have stated that ``The team \nhas been conducting an investigation for 1\\1/2\\ months now but has \nfound no women who fell victim to gang rape or who claimed to have been \nraped during the May riots.''\n  Minister Tutty Alawiah's statement, and those of other leading \nIndonesian political figures have also been quoted in the press as \ndoubting the veracity of the rapes, fly in the face of the voluminous \ncredible findings of independent groups, such as the Indonesian Human \nRights Commission, as well as numerous reports in the media, which have \nfound considerable evidence of the these criminal, inhuman, rapes.\n  For example, in an August 3, 1998 story Business Week reported that \n``On May 14, trucks loaded with muscular men raced to shopping centers \nand housing projects owned by ethnic Chinese. The men doused the shops \nand houses with gasoline and set off devastating fires. At least 182 \nwomen were raped or sexually tortured, some of them repeatedly, by men \nwith crewcuts whom the victims believed to be soldiers. At least 20 \nwomen are confirmed to have died as a result.''\n  ``Confirmed to have died.'' I do not want to cast aspersions on the \ngovernment's official investigation, but I can not help but find it \ncurious that a journalist can find evidence of the rapes and the \naftermath yet one of the leaders of the government's investigation can \nnot.\n  I find this particularly troubling in light of an August 1, 1998 \nAgence France-Presse news story which reported that ``At least 22 \nvictims and witnesses of rapes during the widespread rioting in \nIndonesia in May have talked to a team set up by the government to \nprobe violence during the unrest.''\n  What has become of the evidence provided by these 22 victims and \nwitnesses, that Minister Tutty Alawiah claims that no evidence of the \nrapes can be found and that no victims have come forward?\n  The Chicago Tribune, on July 29, 1998, carried a story featuring \n``Aileen'', a still-hospitalized 24 year old ethnic Chinese women raped \nby a group of men and left in a pool of blood.\n  Are the government investigators unwilling or unable to find this \nwomen, and the many others like her, so easily found and interviewed by \nan American journalist?\n  Perhaps most telling, a July 13, 1998 report by the Volunteers Team \nfor Humanity, headed by Father Sandyawan, a respected Indonesian human \nrights activist, found ample documentation of systematic and organized \nrapes targeted at Indonesia's ethnic Chinese community.\n  The report contains locations of rapes, the modus operandi of the \nperpetrators, dates of the rapes, and quotes from victims and \nwitnesses, among other documentary evidence.\n  Indeed, it is ironic to note that the authors of this July 13 report \nundertook their documentary efforts precisely because they feared that \nthere\n\n[[Page S9743]]\n\nwould be efforts to ``cover the case up as if it never happened.''\n  What has become of this credible volume of documentation gathered by \na respected independent group in the context of the government \ninvestigation?\n  In short, there appears to be ample evidence that these rapes \noccurred, and that the director of the United Nations Development Fund \nfor Women was well-founded in her belief when she stated that these \nrapes occurred as part of an ``organized reaction to crisis.''\n\n  I realize that the Indonesian government investigation is not yet \ncomplete. But I find it deeply troubling that there are signs that the \nofficial government investigation of these incidents may be guided more \nby political considerations then by a commitment to the truth and to \njustice.\n  We all know that there are numerous problems that arise with efforts \nto investigate and document rape. Many women are afraid to speak to \ninvestigators. There is embarrassment and great social stigma.\n  And, in a case like Indonesia, where there are allegations that \nmembers of the armed forces may have been involved in the riots and \nrapes, there is a special need to assure that any victims who cooperate \nwith the investigation receive protection.\n  But given the ability of others--independent groups and the media--to \ncompile significant and credible evidence of the rapes which appeared \nto have occurred during the May riots, it is unsettling, to say the \nleast, to be faced with the prospect that the government may try to \ndeny that the rapes occurred at all, let alone to bring to justice \nthose responsible.\n  Thus, the second Amendment which I have offered here today condemns \nin no uncertain terms the rapes and mistreatment of the ethnic Chinese \ncommunity during the May riots.\n  Moreover, it urges a full, fair, and complete investigation of the \nrape allegations and calls for those responsible to be brought to \njustice.\n  It calls on the Government of Indonesia to assure that the human \nrights of the ethnic Chinese community--indeed of all Indonesians--\nshould be respected and protected; that the reparations the government \nhas pledged to those who lost property in the May riots should be \nexpedited, and that rape victims should receive just compensation as \nwell, including medical care where still-needed.\n  The Amendment also calls on the Administration to provide support and \nassistance to the Indonesian government and the independent human \nrights groups investigating these allegations, in the interest of \nassuring full, fair, and complete investigations.\n  Lastly, it calls for the administration to provide Congress with a \nreport evaluating the allegations surrounding these rapes, the actions \ntaken by the Government of Indonesia, and the implications for U.S.-\nIndonesian relations.\n  Essentially what the resolution does is condemn these acts, calls on \nthe administration to work with the Indonesian government committee \ninvestigating these acts in hopes that the investigation will be \nforthcoming and straightforward and will take adequate measures to \nbring to justice those responsible for these riots and these rapes.\n  To those in Indonesia who may misinterpret my intent with this \nAmendment let me be clear: I do not offer this Amendment as an attack \non the Government of Indonesia. Just the opposite. I offer it because I \nunderstand how difficult it can be to face up to misdeeds and take \nnecessary and responsible action to rectify the situation, and I want \nthe people of Indonesia to know that as they move forward and deal with \nthis difficult issue that if they do the right thing their friends will \nbe there to offer support and assistance.\n  It is my belief that if Indonesia does not take adequate measures to \nbring to justice those responsible for the May riots and rapes, it may \nwell set itself down a course in which political and economic reform, \ndemocratization, respect for human rights--in short, many of the \nmeasures which Indonesia so desperately needs to undertake to work \nitself out of the present crisis--become all but impossible. That would \nbe a great tragedy for the people of Indonesia, and a great \ndisappointment to those of us here in the Senate who consider ourselves \nfriends of the Indonesian people.\n  Mr. President, Indonesia is undergoing a dramatic transformation. The \ntransition to a more pluralistic system will likely be lengthy and \ndifficult. The United States has long sought to promote a more open and \ntolerant Indonesia. I believe that the United States must continue to \nwork closely with Indonesia during this critical transition period, \nwhile acknowledging that only the Indonesian people can determine their \nfuture. It is my hope that the two amendments which I have offered \ntoday can contribute to this process.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee, the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky, for his support of these two amendments to the bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I commend my friend and colleague from California for \nthese two amendments, and I am proud to be a principal cosponsor of \nthem.\n  I think the amendments both define the core problems which afflict \nIndonesia, as well as offer clear support for the organizations and \ninitiatives which will return Indonesia to a path of economic growth as \nJakarta launches on a new democratic political course.\n  The road ahead for Indonesia will not be easy, but I am confident of \ntwo things--first, what happens in Jakarta is of enormous strategic \nimportance to the United States. Second, we should take note that the \npolitical changes underway are a direct result of the efforts of the \nIndonesian people. As they suffer an acute economic crisis causing \ndislocation, devastation and pain, they have managed to drive and \ndirect political transition which I am hopeful will lead to an elected \nand truly democratic government.\n  This course has not been without its horror stories. Let me speak to \none of the two amendments which focuses on the ethnic violence which \nexploded in the Spring. For decades, the Indonesian Chinese community \nhas played an important role in generating the exceptional economic \ngrowth which improved the quality of life for a majority of \nIndonesians. Although only six million strong, most have deep roots \nreaching back many generations and consider Indonesia their home.\n  Tragically, for many Indonesian Chinese their place in Indonesia's \nrich life came to a shocking and sudden end in the violence which \nerupted in May. Indonesian Chinese homes, shops, and businesses were \nclearly targeted, burned, looted and destroyed in the riots which broke \nout. While it was difficult for the police to restore stability any \nwhere, it seemed to many no effort was made to protect Indonesian \nChinese communities and their citizens. Most shocking of all were \nallegations of rape and attacks on women and young girls. \nUnfortunately, there are even allegations that police officers and army \ntroops may have engaged in these atrocities. Non-government \norganizations have estimated that more than 160 women and girls were \nvictims of these awful crimes, many of them Indonesian Chinese.\n  While this violence has a very human face and toll, a number of news \naccounts have called attention to the crippling economic impact of this \nethnic violence. Not only did Indonesian Chinese withdraw their \ncapital, Southeast Asian Chinese in Hong Kong, Taiwan and elsewhere \nhave pulled out and are reluctant to return. One expert has estimated \nit will be at least five years before the community is confident enough \nto resume investment--a fact that contributes to Indonesia's already \ngrave economic woes. And, who could blame them?\n  This amendment condemns the violence against ethnic Indonesian \nChinese, encourages prompt full action by the government and provides \nfor U.S. support for the effort to investigate and bring to justice \nthose responsible for these outrageous acts. As Indonesia proceeds on \nits path to build a democratic and free nation, it is essential that \nthe rights of minorities are respected and protected. I believe the \ngovernment must take steps to fully investigate the violence suffered \nby the Indonesian Chinese community over the past several months and \nclearly support efforts to rebuild homes, businesses and lives. I was \nencouraged by\n\n[[Page S9744]]\n\nPresident Habibe's decision to turn responsibility for the \ninvestigation over to the National Human Rights Commission which has \npledged to conduct a prompt, complete investigation of all allegations \nof attacks and crimes.\n  I welcomed the Commission Vice Chairman's response to suggestions \nthat foreign media were generating false accounts of events. He said,\n\n       These crimes are so serious they need no exaggeration and \n     we must not lose sight of that. We want to work carefully and \n     methodically and I can tell you that the evidence we are \n     obtaining so far is very strong, and, yes, it is apparent \n     there were gang rapes, and yes, some were very violent.\n\n  The Vice Chairman has also confirmed that 20 victims of rape have \nsince died, most by suicide and some within hours of the offenses.\n  Since these preliminary positive signs, there was a report that the \nCommission was not able to reach any conclusions on the scale or \npattern of attacks. I hope that Commission and our embassy will work \nhard to make sure all of the concerns raised by the Indonesian \nChinese community are addressed before declaring their work done.\n\n  Some observers seem to have an impression that this ethnic community \nis so wealthy they can and should leave Indonesia, but, that is simply \nnot the case. As Jusef Wannadi, a prominent member of the community, \nnoted, ``The majority of Indonesia Chinese--poor laborers, farmers, \nfishermen and small shop owners--have no option but to try to survive \nin Indonesia.''\n  His sentiments were echoed by a father of three:\n\n       The worst thing is that you can't really stay but there is \n     nowhere else to live. They tell me I am an Indonesian \n     national, yet I am starting to feel homeless as well as \n     stateless. Tell me, why should I have to leave my home?\n\n  It is going to take a great deal of effort by a credible, elected \ngovernment to heal these deep rifts dividing Indonesia which makes the \nprocess and prospects of political reform all the more urgent. The \nsecond amendment focuses on how the United States can expand and \naccelerate our support for this reconciliation and recovery. As I made \nclear in my opening statement, the Administration has been consistently \nbehind the curve in supporting such an effort.\n  Although AID's Administrator has pledged an expansion of food, \nmedical and humanitarian relief very little has actually been made \navailable, in part because the real needs are still a matter of guess \nwork. Altough I have pressed since March, AID still hasn't conducted a \nnation-wide estimate of food shortages or other social safety net \nrequirements. I am also disappointed by the slow pace of AID efforts to \nwork and build upon Indonesia's vast Muslim community organizational \nnetworks. Two national organizations have clinics, schools, and \ncommunity centers which already reach out to a majority of the \npopulation. Although they have expressed interest in working with AID, \ncooperation has been slow to materialize.\n  AID must also expand support for political reforms. Media training \nand technical support, political party building and legal reforms are \nall urgently needed to secure the foundation for democratic \ninstitutions to constructively shape Indonesia's future. The bill, \nreport and this amendment encourage improvements, and require a report \non the conditions and status of our efforts in meeting national needs.\n  The bill's commitment of $100 million along with these amendments \nsets a course for improving our relations and support for the important \ntransition underway in a nation of criticial importance to the United \nStates. Instability in Indonesia continues to be the undertow dragging \ndown regional economic recovery. And, the Secretary of Defense has been \nvery persuasive in making the case that a further decline into chaos in \na country of more than 200 million people, a nation which staddles \nvital global shipping lanes, in a scenario he believes we should make \nevery effort to prevent.\n  Our support and Indonesian effort are the key to what lies ahead--to \nsuccess--to building investor confidence--to recoverying capital which \nhas fled--to protecting minorities--to restarting the engines of \neconomic growth--to rebuilding American markets--to helping a key ally \nset a democratic course.\n  Again, I commend the Senator from California for her interest and \nhard work to restore the vital partnership we share with Indonesia.\n  As far as I know, Mr. President, there are no objections to these \namendments on either side of the aisle, and I recommend that we proceed \nto passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendments?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the two amendments offered by \nthe Senator from California. Without objection, they will be considered \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3507 and 3508) were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington has an \namendment which we have cleared on both sides of the aisle, and I would \nlike to give him an opportunity to send that amendment to the desk at \nthis time.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3509\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress regarding IMF response \n                   to the economic crisis in Russia)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have sent an amendment to the desk and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3509.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.     . SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMF RESPONSE TO \n                   THE ECONOMIC CRISIS IN RUSSIA.\n\n       (a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) Russia is currently facing a severe economic crisis \n     that threatens President Boris Yeltsin's ability to maintain \n     power;\n       (2) the Russian Communist Party may well soon be a part of \n     the government of the Russian Republic and may be given real \n     influence over Russian economic policies;\n       (3) the International Monetary Fund has continued to \n     provide funding to Russia despite Russia's refusal to \n     implement reforms tied to the funding;\n       (4) the Russian economic crisis follows a similar crisis in \n     Asia;\n       (5) the International Monetary Fund imposed strict \n     requirements on Republic of Korea and other democratic and \n     free market nations in Asia;\n       (6) the International Monetary Fund has not imposed the \n     same requirements on Russia; and\n       (7) Russia has not made the same commitment to free market \n     economic principles as Republic of Korea and other Asian \n     nations receiving assistance from the International Monetary \n     Fund.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the International \n     Monetary Fund should not provide funding to a Russian \n     government whose economic policies are significantly affected \n     by the Russian Communist Party, or under significantly less \n     free market conditions than those imposed on the Republic of \n     Korea and other democratic, free market nations in Southeast \n     Asia.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, at an earlier date, on the bill similar to \nthis relating to foreign policy, I discussed some of the policies of \nthe International Monetary Fund in that connection with respect to \nIndonesia while Indonesia was still ruled by the Suhartos. That \namendment, or a modification of that amendment, was included in the \noriginal passage of the International Monetary Fund refurbishment and, \nin fact, is included in this bill, although it is close to irrelevant \nnow that the Government of Indonesia is in different hands and in \nconsiderable need of aid, as was indicated by some of the debate on the \nprevious amendment.\n  This amendment deals with my deep concern, a concern I believe widely \nshared, with respect to the way in which the International Monetary \nFund is handling the problems in Russia. The amendment--a sense of the \nSenate directed at the International Monetary Fund--makes two points in \nthat connection. The first cautions the International Monetary Fund \nagainst funding any Russian Government in which the Communist Party of \nRussia plays a significant role with respect to economic policy. We \nknow that the\n\n[[Page S9745]]\n\nRussian Government is in chaos at the present time after the firing of \none Prime Minister by President Yeltsin and the substitution for him, \nat least at the behest of the President, of Mr. Chernomyrdin, a \nprevious Prime Minister of Russia. His nomination was just rejected \nyesterday by the Russian Duma. We don't know where it will go. What we \ndo know is that the Government of Russia was very close to an agreement \nwith the Russian Communist Party, under which the Communist Party would \nplay a major role in the Government and a major role in its economic \npolicies, that major role being to reverse free market reforms and \nreturn to state control of the economy. It would be foolishness \nexemplified, were we to fund such a change in the Russian Government \nthrough the International Monetary Fund, and this amendment cautions \nagainst it.\n\n  It also deals with another subject, the subject of all of the \nbillions of dollars that the International Monetary Fund has granted to \nRussia already on condition that it move more decisively toward a free \nmarket economy. While the International Monetary Fund has dealt very \nfirmly with respect to free market conditions in dealing with the \ncrisis in Southeast Asia--with the Republic of Korea, with Thailand, \nwith Malaysia, with Indonesia and the like--it has consistently \noperated with a double standard with respect to Russia. The double \nstandard has not only wasted money, the double standard has created \njustified unhappiness, justified bitterness in the Southeast Asian \ncountries that see the International Monetary Fund imposing a double \nstandard: One very tough standard on them and far more lax standards \nor, rather, standards that are consistently ignored with respect to \nRussia.\n  So this amendment, the sense-of-the-Senate amendment, also calls for \na single standard with respect to International Monetary Fund funding \nof Russia, even in a noncommunist government, and the similarly \nsituated countries in Southeast Asia. As the chairman of the \nsubcommittee said, I think this represents a broadly held point of \nview. I am not sure that it should not be a part of the bill as a \nmandate on the way in which we deal with the International Monetary \nFund, but because I cannot see the future, it is merely a sense of the \nSenate at this point.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \nabout this double standard called ``The IMF's $22.6 billion failure in \nRussia,'' from the Heritage Foundation.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  [From the Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum, August 24, 1998]\n\n               The IMF's $22.6 Billion Failure in Russia\n\n             (By Ariel Cohen, Ph.D., and Brett D. Schaefer)\n\n       On August 17, just three days after President Boris Yeltin \n     unequivocally stated that the ruble would not be devalued, \n     Russia's Prime Minister announced that the government would \n     allow the ruble to be devalued by 34 percent by the end of \n     this year. He also declared a 90-day foreign debt moratorium. \n     It is now painfully clear that the $22.6 billion bailout \n     package orchestrated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \n     has not rescued Russia.\n       Commenting on the Russian devaluation and debt moratorium \n     on August 17, Michel Camdessus, the Fund's Managing Director, \n     concluded that ``Implementation of [Russia's economic] \n     program has been satisfactory.'' Camdessus, however, never \n     explains how something as disastrous as a currency \n     devaluation of this scope can be deemed ``satisfactory.'' \n     Even he admits that, despite the IMF bailout, ``confidence in \n     financial markets has not been reestablished and as a result \n     Russia has continued to lose reserves, and asset prices have \n     fallen sharply.'' If this is ``satisfactory,'' Camdessus must \n     have a very high tolerance for failure.\n       What was the purpose of the July IMF bailout of Russia, and \n     who is responsible for its failure?\n\n\n                     the purpose of the imf bailout\n\n       On July 20, the IMF Executive Board approved its portion \n     ($11.2 billion) of a $22.6 billion international bailout. \n     This emergency package was intended to help Russia maintain \n     the value of the ruble while the government implemented \n     reforms necessary to create long-term stability. IMF First \n     Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer outlined this \n     strategy on July 13:\n       The underlying problem [in Russia] is the budget and the \n     financing needs. So if you devalue, you sort of relieve the \n     pressure on the markets for a while, causing difficulties, \n     but unless you got the budget in shape, and the devaluation \n     wasn't going to do anything for the budget, you would be back \n     in this situation.\n       Indeed, the IMF plan specifically stated that ``exchange \n     rate policy should remain broadly unchanged during the \n     remainder of 1998.'' After only four weeks, however, it is \n     clear that the massive bailout failed in both of its \n     missions: The ruble was devalued, and reforms are not likely \n     to be implemented.\n       On August 17, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko announced \n     that the government would allow the ruble to fall from the \n     former official rate of 6.3 to the U.S. dollar to 9.5 to the \n     dollar. This devaluation and a 90-day foreign debt moratorium \n     amount to an expensive policy debacle for Russia. The \n     devaluation will make it much more expensive to repay foreign \n     currency-denominated debt. The moratorium has frightened \n     already leery investors and likely will dampen foreign \n     investment for years to come.\n       The Russian Duma, moreover, is not likely to adopt the bulk \n     of the IMF-sanctioned reform agenda. In fact, the Duma's \n     communist majority already is urging the Russian government \n     to backpedal on budgetary cuts, increase domestic spending \n     instead of paying foreign debt, or nationalize the dollar-\n     denominated debt of Russian banks.\n\n\n                          who is responsible?\n\n       Both Russia and the IMF are responsible for the Russian \n     debacle. Russia's fault lies in the government's chronic \n     refusal to reform. The Russian government has been aware of \n     the problems in its economy and what is needed to fix them \n     for at least five years. Because of mismanagement, inertia, \n     and outright corruption, such vital changes as trimming the \n     budget, overhauling the tax code and tax collection, land \n     reform, and otherwise providing conditions to step capital \n     flight and attract foreign investment have not been \n     implemented.\n       The fault of the IMF lies in its willingness to provide \n     successive bailouts regardless of whether they achieve the \n     desired results. When asked at a July 13 press conference \n     whether the IMF would refrain from new lending because of \n     reduced liquidity, IMF Treasurer David Williams responded, \n     ``[W]e never say no.''\n       Russia is a prime example of how this can lead to \n     disastrous results. Since 1992 (and before the most recent \n     $22.6 billion bailout), the IMF lent Russia over $18 billion. \n     With each loan, the IMF required Russia to adopt economic \n     reforms. Even though Moscow rarely fulfilled its promises, \n     the IMF continued to disperse tranche after tranche. In other \n     words, the cheap credits allowed Russia to delay reforms, \n     while the IMF rewarded Moscow for not reforming.\n       This pattern is being repeated in the current bailout. \n     Despite the devaluation of the ruble and the Duma's refusal \n     to pass the majority of IMF-mandated reforms, Michel \n     Camdessus' August 17 statement merely remarked that \n     [Russia's] measures and their potential impact will \n     immediately be analyzed by the staff and management of the \n     IMF . . . I hope that the government's economic program will \n     continue to be implemented in full, so that the economic and \n     financial situation will improve and the IMF can be in a \n     position to disburse the second tranche . . .\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Russia is now in an economic morass. The achievements of \n     the Yeltsin administration--a stable currency and low \n     inflation--have gone down the drain. The political cost to \n     the Yeltsin government will be tremendous, as millions of \n     workers and pensioners have not been paid for months and the \n     price inflation will escalate. Before August 17, Russia had \n     asked whether the international community were prepared to \n     provide some additional financial support beyond the $22.6 \n     billion finalized on July 20. Thus far, the G-7 leading \n     industrial countries have prudently declined.\n       Both the IMF and Russia share the blame for the country's \n     current crisis. Despite ample advice on how to shore up its \n     economy, Russia has refused to implement the changes \n     necessary to resolve the current crisis and create long-term \n     economic health. The IMF has consistently permitted Russia to \n     borrow despite Russia's refusal to reform its economy.\n       Congress should send a message to Russia that the United \n     States will no longer send good money after bad. It can do so \n     by refusing to approve additional funding for the IMF. An \n     organization that cannot say ``no'' should not be given \n     additional money to waste.\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

PROHIBITION ON ASSISTANCE TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC \n                   OF CONGO.\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act may be provided to the central Government of the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo until such time as the President \n     reports in writing to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the Majority Leader of the Senate, the \n     International Relations Committee of the House, the Foreign \n     Relations Committee of the Senate, the Appropriations \n     Committee of the Senate, and the Appropriations Committee of \n     the House that the central Government of the Democratic \n     Republic of Congo is--\n       (1) investigating and prosecuting those responsible for \n     civilian massacres, serious human rights violations, or other \n     atrocities committed in the Congo; and\n       (2) implementing a credible democratic transition program, \n     which includes\n       (A) the establishment of an independent electoral \n     commission;\n       (B) the release of individuals detained or imprisoned for \n     their political views;\n       (C) the maintenance of a conducive environment for the free \n     exchange of political views, including the freedoms of \n     association, speech, and press; and\n       (D) the conduct of free and fair national elections for \n     both the legislative and executive branches of government.\n\n     Notwithstanding the aforementioned restrictions, the \n     President may provide electoral assistance to the central \n     Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo for any fiscal \n     year if the President certifies to the International \n     Relations Committee of the House, the Foreign Relations \n     Committee of the Senate, the Appropriations Committee of the \n     Senate, and the Appropriations Committee of the House that \n     the central Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo \n     has taken steps to ensure that conditions in subsection 2 \n     (A), (B), and (C) have been met.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to explain an amendment \nrelated to U.S. development assistance to the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo (DROC) that the managers of this bill have agreed to accept. \nAs the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Africa, I am pleased to \nhave been joined in this effort with the Chairman of that Subcommittee, \nmy colleague from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] as well as the junior Senator \nfrom North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth].\n  This amendment revises Section 574 of the foreign operations \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1999 to define restrictions on aid \nto DROC. It mandates that no aid may be granted to the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo until the President certifies that the DROC \ngovernment is investigating and prosecuting those responsible for human \nrights violations or atrocities and is taking specific steps to \nimplement a credible democratic transition program.\n  When I originally began thinking about an amendment of this nature, I \nwas concerned about the inability of the DROC government to follow up \non what were really gross abuses of human rights committed during the \ntakeover of the former Zaire by the rebel movement that became known as \nthe Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL). \nDuring the takeover, which took place from late 1996 through the Spring \nof 1997, thousands of civilians, mostly Hutu refugees, were slaughtered \nreportedly by rebel troops, some of them possibly Rwandan or under \nRwandan command. The facts have never been clear on these massacres, \nbut credible information from human rights groups clearly indicate that \nmassacres were carried out throughout the country--in Mbandaka, in the \nwest; in Kisangani, in the middle of the country, and in the Kivu \nregion in the east--leading even a casual observer to surmise it was a \nwell planned military operation.\n  In July 1997, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan named an \ninvestigative team to investigate gross violations of human rights and \ninternational humanitarian law in Congo since March 1993. Not only was \nthe team mandated to look into the general question of the massacres \nthemselves, but also to establish responsibility for the massacres.\n  Unfortunately, the government of Laurent Kabila continually \nobstructed the work of the U.N. team--imposing various conditions, \ndelaying meetings, harassing potential witnesses, refusing permission \nto deploy to certain sites, and apparently organizing demonstrations \nagainst the U.N. teams, to name a few. Eventually, in April 1998, Mr. \nAnnan felt compelled to withdraw his teams since it became impossible \nfor the team to conduct its work.\n\n  Nevertheless, it remains important that these atrocities be fully \ninvestigated and that those responsible be brought to justice. Our \namendment calls for the investigation and prosecution of these abuses. \nThis could mean that the government conduct its own transparent and \ncredible investigation. It could mean that the DROC government \ncooperates with a future UN mission, if the UN decides to launch a new \ncommission of inquiry. Or it could mean that the government cooperates \nfully with an appropriate judicial body, possibly an international \ntribunal, which would be charged with investigating the massacres. We \nhave left the desired method intentionally vague so that all options \nmight be considered.\n  The amendment also calls for the implementation of a credible \ndemocratic transition program, which includes the establishment of an \nindependent electrical commission, the release of individuals detained \nor imprisoned for their political views, the establishment of an \nenvironment conducive to the free exchange of political views, and free \nand fair elections.\n  The discussion of both the investigation of past abuses and of the \nimplementation of political reform may seem academic at a moment when \nwe are watching Congo disintegrate into civil war for the second time \nin less than two years. A slightly different rebel movement is trying \nto recreate the ``success'' of the AFDL in 1996 by taking control of \nlarge portions of Eastern and Central Congo. However, the latest events \nonly underscore the critical need for U.S. policy to focus on the \nprotection of human rights, an end to impunity for gross abuses, and \ndemocratization in DROC. It has been precisely the lack of attention to \nthese issues that fueled the conflicts throughout central Africa, and \nwhich now threaten the entire region.\n  Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to say unequivocally that \nI condemn actions by all the governments and other movements in the \nregion to become involved in violent conflict in DROC. I am sorely \ndisappointed that despite repeated efforts to discourage them, the \ngovernments of both Rwanda and Uganda sought early on to support the \nrebel movement. Now, the involvement of Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia on \nthe other side is no less constructive. In fact, we are now seeing an \nalmost total regionalization of this conflict that risks bringing more \nand more African countries into it.\n  Clearly, this is no way to further the African ``renaissance'' that \nwe had reason to believe was underway.\n  I hope the parties will quickly move to declare a cease-fire, and to \ntry to negotiate an end to this terrible situation.\n  In the meantime, I thank the managers for the consideration of this \namendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3511\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit assistance to the Palestinian Broadcasting \n                              Corporation)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a letter to \nSecretary Albright on the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 1998.\n     Hon. Madeleine K. Albright,\n     Secretary of State, Department of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Albright: We are writing to bring to your \n     attention the very troubling issue of the United States \n     assisting foreign entities which promote an agenda hostile to \n     the interests of our country. We cite the example of the \n     Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation (PBC), which has been \n     benefitting from U.S. assistance while engaging in a campaign \n     in support of violence and hatred against the United States, \n     our ally Israel, and the goal of peace in the Middle East.\n       As you well known, U.S. foreign assistance programs are \n     designed to promote democratic ideals and respect for human \n     rights. U.S. agencies which have distributed U.S. assistance, \n     however, have failed at times to determine beforehand if the \n     organizations they are funding promote these basic ideals. In \n     the specific case of the PBC, it is apparent that neither \n     USAID, which has provided hundreds of thousands of dollars \n     via interagency agreements to engage in programs with the PBC \n     and other media outlets, nor USIA/USIS Jerusalem, which has \n     been the recipient of much of the funding, has assessed the \n     value of these programs for U.S. interests in the Middle \n     East.\n       Despite its awareness of the PBC's activities and the \n     resulting harm to U.S. interests, USIA committed the U.S. to \n     pay for two TVRO satellite dishes for the PBC's use in \n     exchange for their commitment to use seven hours of Worldnet \n     broadcasting a week. Although we commend efforts to further \n     the reach of Worldnet, we are concerned that the PBC's letter \n     of acceptance for the equipment does not stipulate which \n     programming will be shown and during what time periods. In \n     essennce, we provided the PBC with equipment that could be \n     used to import broadcasts from Iraq, Iran, Libya and other \n     nations hostile to the United States in exchange for a \n     commitment to show a sporting event at 3:00 a.m.\n       It is our belief that the U.S. should support a free and \n     independent media around the world. As USIA/USIS has \n     recognized, however, the PBC is the official broadcasting arm \n     of the Palestinian Authority, which is engaged in a campaign \n     to restrict a free press and promote violent progaganda. The \n     PBC consistently broadcasts programming that attempts to \n     undermine all the United States seeks to achieve in the \n     Middle East.\n       Madame Secretary, we ask you to formulate a clear U.S. \n     policy to terminate U.S. taxpayer support for the PBC, while \n     encouraging programs that promote genuine press freedoms by \n     supporting independent journalists. We will be working in the \n     Senate to implement such a policy and feel that a unified \n     response on this important issue is warranted.\n       We thank you for your consideration of this issue and look \n     forward to working with you to advance U.S. interests in the \n     Middle East more effectively.\n           Sincerely,\n       Representative Michael P.

Mr. President, this amendment expresses the sense of \nCongress that information relevant to the murders of four American \nchurchwomen in El Salvador be made public to the fullest extent \npossible. My understanding is that it is acceptable to both sides.\n  It was 18 years ago, but the 1980 brutal murders of four American \nchurchwomen by members of the Salvadoran National Guard is seared in \nour memory. Since that time the victims' families have sought answers \nto questions about the nuns' untimely deaths. Some have been answered, \nmany have not. It is unfortunate that after so many years, it is still \nnecessary to offer an amendment to urge the administration to release \nany information that would shed light on what happened in this case. It \nshould have been done years ago.\n  To its credit, the State Department did promptly respond to \nCongressional requests and fully release information about these \nhorrific crimes. Other agencies have not. Far too often in this case \nand others like it, the response to requests for information has come \ngrudgingly, and then only in the form of heavily redacted documents \nwith a few lines of practically meaningless text.\n  I appreciate the need to protect intelligence sources and methods, \nbut these American citizens were murdered almost two decades ago.\n  For years there have been allegations and evidence to indicate that \nthe National Guardsmen convicted of these crimes acted after receiving \norders from their superiors.\n  In March 1998, after 14 years of silence, four of the convicted men \nconfessed that this was the case. Recently, it has become known that \neven though U.S. officials had reason to believe these crimes were \nordered and covered up by higher authorities, at least one of those \nSalvadoran officers was granted permanent residence and is reportedly \nliving in Florida.\n  In addition to calling for the release of information, this amendment \nalso directs the Attorney General to review the circumstances under \nwhich individuals connected with these crimes obtained residence in the \nUnited States. It is a tragic irony that with so many people \nlegitimately seeking asylum upon our shores, we may have opened our \ndoors to individuals who belong behind bars.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3515\n\n    (Purpose: To require a consolidated report on all U.S. military \n            training provided to foreign military personnel)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill add the following new \n     section:\n       Sec.   . (a) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of \n     State shall jointly provide to the Congress by January 31, \n     1999, a report on all overseas military training provided to \n     foreign military personnel under programs administered by the \n     Department of Defense and the Department of State during \n     fiscal years 1998 and 1999, including those proposed for \n     fiscal year 1999. This report shall include, for each such \n     military training activity, the foreign policy justification \n     and purpose for the training activity, the cost of the \n     training activity, the number of foreign students trained and \n     their units of operation, and the location of the training. \n     In addition, this report shall also include, with respect to \n     United States personnel, the operational benefits to United \n     States forces derived from each such training activity and \n     the United States military units involved in each such \n     training activity. This report may include a classified annex \n     if deemed necessary and appropriate.\n       (b) For purposes of this section a report to Congress shall \n     be deemed to mean a report to the Appropriations and Foreign \n     Relations Committees of the Senate and the Appropriations and \n     International Relations Committees of the House.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as we consider the Foreign Operations \nAppropriations bill today, many of my colleagues may think that by \nreviewing the provisions of the bill with respect to funding for \nInternational Military Education and Training (IMET) they will have a \nfull picture of the total U.S. spending for the training of foreign \nmilitary personnel that is proposed for fiscal year 1999. Based on that \nreview, they might conclude that the Administration will spend \napproximately $50 million for training of military personnel from some \n113 countries, or roughly the same as has been spent on IMET during the \ncurrent fiscal year. However, that conclusion would not be accurate.\n  While it is true that the Congress gets a very detailed accounting of \nthe nature and level of IMET spending annually, a recent series of \narticles that appeared in the Washington Post revealed that a great \ndeal more training of foreign military personnel was ongoing totally \noutside the framework of IMET programs.\n  The fact of the matter is that training of foreign military personnel \nis now being undertaken using funds from a variety of other accounts \nunder the control of the State Department or the Defense Department. \nSome of these accounts have no reporting requirements associated with \nthem and therefore little or no Congressional oversight is possible.\n  What is even more significant, is that more foreign military \npersonnel may be being trained outside of the traditional framework of \nIMET programs than is within such programs. I do know for example that \nduring Fiscal Year 1997 IMET funds were used to train approximately 192 \nMexican Military Personnel--a modest number. During that same time \nperiod, so called Section 1004 authorized funds, paid for out of the \nFiscal 1997 Defense Appropriations Act, were used to train some 829 \nMexican military personnel--roughly four times as many individuals as \nwere trained under the auspices of IMET.\n  Mr. President, I am one who believes that United States National \ninterests can be served by U.S. training foreign military personnel on \nthe appropriate roles for national militaries in civil society. \nHowever, I also believe that certain kinds of training are \ninappropriate for military institutions that may have poor track \nrecords with respect to respecting the human rights of their own \ncitizens. It is imperative that the Department of Defense and State \nwork closely together to ensure that the United States is conveying a \nconsistent message with respect to United States policy as it \nundertakes various programs with foreign military leaders. I do not \nbelieve that currently enough consultation takes place in this regard.\n  At the moment, there is no single office or report that one can turn \nto obtain a comprehensive overview of the training that is ongoing \nabroad. It is for that reason that I have offered the pending \namendment, which requires a detailed report on this issue. The \namendment requires the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State \nto jointly provide to the Congress by January 31, 1999, a report on all \noverseas military training of foreign military personnel under programs \nadministered by the Department of Defense and the Department of State \nduring fiscal years 1998 and 1999, including those proposed for fiscal \nyear 1999.\n  Specifically, the report would include the following for each such \nmilitary training activity: a foreign policy justification and purpose \nfor the activity; location and cost; the number of foreign students \ntrained and their units of operation. The report would also identify \nthe United States military units involved in the activities and an \nexplanation of the benefits to United States personnel derived from \neach such training activity. If deemed necessary and appropriate, the \nreport may include a classified annex.\n  If Congress is going to be able to carry out responsible oversight to \ntaxpayer funded programs, such a report is vital. I also believe that \nsuch a report will be beneficial to Executive Branch officials and \ncivilian government authorities in the countries where training is \nongoing.\n  It is my understanding that the Administration has no opposition to \nthis amendment. I urge its adoption.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3516\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress on the trial in the \n Netherlands of the suspects indicted in the bombing of Pan Am Flight \n                                  103)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S9749]]\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE TRIAL IN THE \n                   NETHERLANDS OF THE SUSPECTS INDICTED IN THE \n                   BOMBING OF PAN AM FLIGHT 103.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On December 21, 1988, 270 people, including 189 United \n     States citizens, were killed in a terrorist bombing on Pan Am \n     Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.\n       (2) Britain and the United States indicted 2 Libyan \n     intelligence agents--Abdel Basset Al-Megrahi and Lamen \n     Khalifa Fhimah--in 1991 and sought their extradition from \n     Libya to the United States or the United Kingdom to stand \n     trial for this heinous terrorist act.\n       (3) The United Nations Security Council called for the \n     extradition of the suspects in Security Council Resolution \n     731 and imposed sanctions on Libya in Security Council \n     Resolutions 748 and 883 because Libyan leader, Colonel \n     Muammar Qadaffi, refused to transfer the suspects to either \n     the United States or the United Kingdom to stand trial.\n       (4) The sanctions in Security Council Resolutions 748 and \n     883 include a worldwide ban on Libya's national airline, a \n     ban on flights into and out of Libya by other nations' \n     airlines, a prohibition on supplying arms, airplane parts, \n     and certain oil equipment to Libya, and a freeze on Libyan \n     government funds in other countries.\n       (5) Colonel Qaddafi has continually refused to extradite \n     the suspects to either the United States or the United \n     Kingdom and has insisted that he will only transfer the \n     suspects to a third and neutral country to stand trial.\n       (6) On August 24, 1998, the United States and the United \n     Kingdom proposed that Colonel Qadaffi transfer the suspects \n     to the Netherlands, where they would stand trial before a \n     Scottish court, under Scottish law, and with a panel of \n     Scottish judges.\n       (7) The United States-United Kingdom proposal is consistent \n     with those previously endorsed by the Organization of African \n     Unity, the League of Arab States, the Non-Aligned Movement, \n     and the Islamic Conference.\n       (8) The United Nations Security Council endorsed the United \n     States-United Kingdom proposal on August 27, 1998, in United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1192.\n       (9) The United States Government has stated that this \n     proposal is nonnegotiable and has called on Colonel Qadaffi \n     to respond promptly, positively, and unequivocally to this \n     proposal by ensuring the timely appearance of the two accused \n     individuals in the Netherlands for trial before the Scottish \n     court.\n       (10) The United States Government has called on Libya to \n     ensure the production of evidence, including the presence of \n     witnesses before the court, and to comply fully with all the \n     requirements of the United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions.\n       (11) Secretary of State Albright has said that the United \n     States will urge a multilateral oil embargo against Libya in \n     the United Nations Security Council if Colonel Muammar \n     Qadaffi does not transfer the suspects to the Netherlands to \n     stand trial.\n       (12) The United Nations Security Council will convene on \n     October 30, 1998, to review sanctions imposed on Libya.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Colonel Qadaffi should promptly transfer the indicted \n     suspects Abdel Basset Al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah to \n     the Netherlands to stand trial before the Scottish court;\n       (2) the United States Government should remain firm in its \n     commitment not to negotiate with Colonel Qadaffi on any of \n     the details of the proposal approved by the United Nations in \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1192; and\n       (3) if Colonel Qadaffi does not transfer the indicted \n     suspects Abdel Basset Al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah to \n     the Netherlands by October 29, 1998, the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations should--\n       (A) introduce a resolution in the United Nations Security \n     Council to impose a multilateral oil embargo against Libya;\n       (B) actively promote adoption of the resolution by the \n     United Nations Security Council; and\n       (C) assure that a vote will occur in the United Nations \n     Security Council on such a resolution.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today, Senator Kennedy and I join \ntogether, as we have in the past, in a ceaseless effort to provide some \ndegree of justice for the families of the victims of the terrorist \nattack on Pan Am 103. This flight was brought down over Lockerbie, \nScotland on December 21, 1988. 259 people on the plane and 11 others on \nthe ground were killed. Most of the victims were Americans, making it \nthe most fatal terrorist atrocity in American history.\n  Two Libyan security agents have been charged with this heinous crime. \nThey must be held accountable before a United States or United Kingdom \ncourt. The United Nations Security Council has imposed sanctions in an \neffort to make this happen, but for years this has brought no results.\n  Recently, Secretary of State Albright proposed that the two suspects \nin the bombing of Pan Am 103 be tried in a Scottish court, under \nScottish law, with a panel of Scottish judges, but physically located \nin the Netherlands. Libyan authorities have publicly accepted this \nproposal while calling for negotiations.\n  I remain skeptical of Libya's willingness to cooperate with the \ninternational community in bringing terrorists to justice. But I also \nremain hopeful that the families of the victims will soon be able to \nend their painful wait for justice. I therefore believe we should give \nthis potential solution an opportunity to work, while remaining \ndetermined to see the indicted terrorists brought to trial.\n  The amendment we are introducing today therefore sets a reasonable \ntime limit for action. It also calls for the imposition of additional \nmultilateral sanctions measures, even including an embargo on oil \nexports, if Libya fails to turn over the bombing suspects for trial.\n  The families of the victims of the Pan Am 103 bombing understand that \nnothing will bring back their loved ones. Nothing we do here can change \nthat. But by adopting this resolution today we send the clear message \nthat we are determined to see justice served and we will continue to \nincrease international pressure on Libya until that happens.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I sent this amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senators Lautenberg, D'Amato, and Torricelli.\n  Mr. President, ten years ago, in December 1988, 270 people, including \n189 Americans were killed in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 \nover Lockerbie, Scotland. As a result of the intense and skillful \ninvestigation that followed, Britain and the United States indicted 2 \nLibyan intelligence agents.\n  The leader of Libya, Colonel Muammar Qadafi, refused to extradite the \nsuspects to either the United States or the United Kingdom to stand \ntrial. As a result, the international community, acting through the \nUnited Nations Security Council, imposed economic sanctions on Libya. \nThe sanctions include a worldwide ban on Libya's national airline and a \nban on flights into and out of Libya by the airlines of other nations. \nThey also include a prohibition on supplying arms, airplane parts, and \ncertain oil equipment to Libya, and a freeze on Libyan Government funds \nin other countries.\n  Despite these sanctions, Colonel Qadafi has refused to turn over the \nsuspects to either the United States or the United Kingdom. He has \nsaid, however, that he will transfer them to a third country to stand \ntrial.\n  A week ago, in a major development in this case, the United States \nand the United Kingdom proposed that Colonel Qadafi transfer the \nsuspects to the Netherlands to stand trial before a Scottish court, \nunder Scottish law, and with a panel of Scottish judges. Last Thursday, \nthe United Nations Security Council endorsed this proposal and called \non Colonel Qadafi to transfer the suspects promptly.\n  The Administration has told Colonel Qadafi that this is a take-it-or-\nleave-it proposal and that it is non-negotiable. Secretary of State \nAlbright has said that the United States will urge a worldwide oil \nembargo against Libya in the United Nations Security Council if Colonel \nQadafi rejects this offer and refuses to transfer the suspects to the \nNetherlands to stand trial. The Security Council is scheduled to \nconduct the next periodic review of Libyan sanctions on October 30. All \nof us hope that Colonel Qadafi will accept this plan before that date.\n  To send a clear message to Colonel Qadafi, this resolution calls on \nhim to transfer the indicted suspects to the Netherlands promptly, so \nthat they can stand trial before the Scottish court in the Netherlands. \nThe resolution supports the commitment by the United States Government \nnot to negotiate with Colonel Qadafi on the details of the proposal. If \nColonel Qadafi fails to transfer the suspects to the Netherlands before \nthe end of October, the resolution calls on the United States Permanent \nRepresentative to the United Nations to introduce a resolution in the \nSecurity Council to impose a worldwide embargo against Libya and \nactively seeks its enactment.\n  The families of the victims of Pan Am 103 have waited too long for \njustice. The Administration's plan is a reasonable opportunity to end \nthe long\n\n[[Page S9750]]\n\nimpasse over these suspects, and achieve a significant victory in the \nongoing battle against international terrorism.\n  I urge my colleagues to approve this resolution.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3517\n\n  (Purpose: Relating to the development of a new strategy for United \n                States bilateral assistance for Nigeria)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE IN NIGERIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The bilateral development assistance program in Nigeria \n     has been insufficiently funded and staffed, and the United \n     States has missed opportunities to promote democracy and good \n     governance as a result.\n       (2) The recent political upheaval in Nigeria necessitates a \n     new strategy for United States bilateral assistance program \n     in that country that is focused on promoting a transition to \n     democracy.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President, acting through the United States Agency for \n     International Development, should--\n       (1) develop a new strategy for United States bilateral \n     assistance for Nigeria that is focused on the development of \n     civil society and the rule of law and that involves a broad \n     cross-section of Nigerian society but does not provide for \n     any direct assistance to the Government of Nigeria, other \n     than humanitarian assistance, unless and until that country \n     successfully completes a transition to civilian, democratic \n     rule;\n       (2) increase the number of United States personnel at such \n     Agency's office in Lagos, Nigeria, from within the current, \n     overall staff resources of such Agency in order for such \n     office to be sufficiently staffed to carry out paragraph (1); \n     and\n       (3) consider the placement of such Agency's personnel \n     elsewhere in Nigeria.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the President, acting through the \n     United States Agency for International Development, shall \n     submit to the Committees on Appropriations and Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committees on Appropriations \n     and International Relations of the House of Representatives a \n     report on the strategy developed under subsection (b)(1).\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the managers of the \nforeign operations appropriations bill have agreed to accept my \namendment regarding development assistance to Nigeria.\n  My amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the assistance \nprogram in Nigeria has not been sufficient and should be expanded, and \nthat the recent political upheaval in the country requires a new \nstrategy for development assistance. The amendment specifies that no \ndirect aid shall be provided to the government ``unless and until that \ncountry successfully completes a transition to civilian, democratic \nrule.'' It also encourages the development of a more robust presence in \nNigeria, including placing development personnel outside of Lagos, the \ncapital. Finally, it requires the President to submit a report to \nCongress on the new strategy.\n  This amendment reiterates part of the basic policy expressed in a \nbill I introduced earlier this year, S. 2102, the Nigeria Democracy and \nCivil Society Empowerment Act of 1998. That bill declares that the \nUnited States should encourage the political, economic and legal \nreforms necessary to ensure the rule of law and respect for human \nrights in Nigeria and should aggressively support a timely and \neffective transition to democratic, civilian government for the people \nof Nigeria. The bill codifies many existing sanctions, authorizes the \nPresident to impose new sanctions if conditions sour in Nigeria, and \nwould provide for $37 million in development assistance over three \nyears to support democracy and governance programs and the activities \nof the U.S. Information Agency.\n  My amendment would pick up on the development assistance provisions \nof S. 2102 without specifying an amount. Like S. 2102, this amendment \nauthorizes no new money. All spending in Nigeria would come out of \nexisting USAID appropriations.\n  The United States Agency for International Development has already, \ncorrectly, noted that its program in Nigeria needs considerable re-\nthinking. It recently submitted a notification to certain congressional \ncommittees for some $5 million to support an immediate and effective \ntransition to democracy. But activities under this notification were \nnot fully defined, and approval would have granted USAID broad leeway \nin its budgeting for this project, so the Congress has asked USAID to \nprovide additional details.\n  My amendment would require the administration to submit a report with \na more defined strategy for its Nigeria program within 90 days of \nenactment of the Foreign Operations bill. I would hope that the \npreparation of this report will help the administration focus its \ndevelopment efforts in Nigeria, so that we do not receive such vague \nnotifications in the future.\n  With the replacement of longtime ruler General Abacha by the current \nmilitary leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, there has been reason to be \noptimistic about Nigeria's future. Although General Abubakar has not \nyet moved to repeal the repressive decrees that place severe \nrestrictions on the basic freedoms of Nigerians, he has taken some \npositive steps, including the release of several prominent political \nprisoners, and has indicated a willingness to move his country once and \nfor all in the direction of democracy. But he had yet to deal with some \nof the more vexing issues related to such a transition, which were \nfurther complicated by the untimely death last May of Chief Moshood \nAbiola, the presumed winner of the 1993 elections.\n  These are not easy times in Nigeria, nor for U.S.-Nigeria relations. \nAs the Ranking Member of the Senate Subcommittee on Africa, and as \nsomeone who has watched Nigeria over the past several years, I look \nforward to working with the administration on the development of a \ncoherent Nigeria policy, beginning with a more robust development \nassistance presence.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3518\n\n   (Purpose: To improve the prohibition on United States arms export \n transactions to foreign governments that do not cooperate fully with \n                  United States antiterrorism efforts)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____.

Mr. President, Senator Leahy and I have cleared this \nblock of amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3510 through 3518), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. Leahy, I know that you join me in welcoming the \nprogress that the citizens of Northern Ireland and the Republic have \nmade toward implementing a peace agreement. I would like to thank you \nand the members of the Appropriations Committee for the tremendous work \nyou have done this year, including funding the International Fund for \nIreland (IFI) at the full amount President Clinton requested in FY \n1999. At this critical point in time, this Senate, and the United \nStates as a whole, must begin to study our relationship with Northern \nIreland and do our best to ensure that peace takes hold in the region. \nDramatic cuts in the budget, particularly foreign aid, have made this \ntask more challenging. Understanding both the need to support peace in \nNorthern Ireland and dealing with budget cuts, I would like to request \nyour support for consideration of adding any additional funding to the \nIFI, should it become available at a later time. It is important that \nwe consider ways to meet the needs of the people of Northern Ireland \nand the Republic, and I hope you will join me in this effort.\n  Mr. LEAHY. As a fellow supporter of the peace process in Northern \nIreland, I want to assure you that, should additional funds become \navailable at a later date, we will consider increasing the amount \navailable to the IFI.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. Chairman, I would like to join my colleague in \nexpressing my support for the work the Appropriations Committee has \ndone this year. It is important that we maintain our strong support for \nNorthern Ireland and the Republic, and the funds made available to the \nIFI in the upcoming fiscal year are a critical step. In the wake of the \npassage of the Good Friday Accords, I have been working with Senator \nTorricelli over the past several months to determine a method that will \nbest express the United States' support for peace in Northern Ireland. \nAt this point in time, I would like to request your support for \nconsideration of additional funding to the IFI, should it become \navailable in the future.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I join Mr. Leahy in assuring you that we will consider \nadding funds to the IFI, should they become available at a later date, \nso that we may bolster peace in the region.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am very concerned about a provision in \nthe FY 1999 Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \nAppropriation bill regarding military assistance for the Baltic nations \nthat, according to the Committee report, is intended to accelerate the \nintegration of the Baltic States into NATO. Although the Administration \nhas assured the Congress that consideration of the Baltic nations for \nmembership in NATO would proceed in a deliberate fashion in \nconsultation with our NATO allies subject to the procedures already \nestablished, designating military assistance to the Baltic nations in \naccordance with the language contained in the Committee report would \ncircumvent those assurances. I wish to advise my colleagues that the \nallocation of any military assistance provided in this bill to the \nBaltic nations will not assure their admission into NATO.\n  Mr. President, I recall that during the recent debate on enlarging \nNATO last April, many senators expressed their concern about extending \nour military commitments beyond the limits which are already straining \nour ability to meet worldwide contingencies. I believe that providing \nmilitary assistance to the Baltic nations in order to accelerate their \nmembership into NATO could lead us into a de facto security commitment \nto that region that might strain our resources even further, and \ntherefore, be harmful to our national security interests as well as \nthose of our NATO allies. Many of my colleagues here in the Senate as \nwell as the distinguished Dr. Henry Kissinger who testified last spring \nbefore the Armed Services Committee question our ability to respond \neffectively to military contingencies in the Baltic region.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I am very concerned about the state of \nrelations between the United States and Russia at this vulnerable time \nin international relations. Providing military assistance to the Baltic \nnations for the express reason of accelerating their membership in NATO \nis likely to exacerbate the uneasy state of our relations with the \ncurrent Russian government as well as many influential Russian leaders \nwho oppose that nation's current leadership. I do not believe it is in \nour interest to create unnecessarily greater difficulties with Russia \nthan we already have. I believe this provision of the bill as discussed \nin the Committee report could cause significant problems with Russia \nand unfounded expectations among the Baltic nations for whom there is \nno assured membership in NATO.\n  I have spoken with Senators Leahy, Hutchison, and Roberts about my \nconcerns and they share these sentiments.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Senator Bingaman. I too am concerned that \nproviding military assistance to the Baltic nations with the expressed \nintent to accelerate their membership into NATO is premature and should \nnot prejudice consideration for their membership into NATO when a \ndecision to do so might occur.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I agree with my colleagues on this \nvery important national security issue. In particular, I agree that the \nwords in the Committee report for this bill should not be taken to mean \nthat membership in NATO by the Baltic states is going to be considered \nuntil there is a complete debate on the matter, that the Senate's \nresponsibility for advice and consent on treaties is in any way \npredetermined in the case of the Baltic countries.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to add my \nreservations to those of my colleagues. I am very concerned about \noverextending our military commitments without sufficient resources to \nhandle the additional tasks we might assume. Enlarging NATO should be a \nstep by step deliberate process that should not be circumvented in any \nway.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate the supportive words of my colleagues on \nthis important matter of national security.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Joan Wadelton, a \nState Department fellow on the staff of the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, be accorded the privilege of the floor during the pendency \nof S. 2334.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I know both Senators from New Jersey are anxious to \nmake a statement on another matter, but Senator Leahy and I now have a \nfinite list of amendments which we believe will bring us to final \npassage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/01/senate-section/article/S9739-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9751-S9753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING THE TOMS RIVER EAST AMERICAN LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the manager and ranking member \non the Foreign Operations Subcommittee for giving us these few minutes \nof time. This is kind of a happy moment in New Jersey. One of our \ncommunities, Toms River, has produced a special group of young people \nwho have won the Little League World Series. I send a resolution to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S9752]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 268) congratulating the Toms River \n     East American Little League team of Toms River, New Jersey, \n     for winning the Little League World Series.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce that resolution \nalong with my colleague, Senator Torricelli, expressing our pride and \nour admiration for that very special group of youngsters from New \nJersey. New Jersey has a national philosopher who dwells in its \nboundaries. His name is Yogi Berra. He is often quoted and I quote him \nnow. I recall he said, ``It's like deja vu all over again.''\n  For another time, a New Jersey Little League team has won the \nprestigious Little League World Series championship, a group of \nexciting youngsters under the age of 12, vigorous sports figures now. I \nhave seen them on television. I understand the 11-year-old pitcher got \na request for marriage from an admirer. I don't think that is what he \nwas striving for, but it happened. The honors accorded this group have \nbeen spectacular.\n  This past Saturday, the Toms River East American Little League team \nclinched the honor, defeating Kashima, Japan, by a score of 12 to 9 to \nwin the 52nd annual Little League World Series Championship. They are \naffectionately known as ``The Beasts of the East,'' these little guys. \nThey are pretty good. They received a hero's welcome Sunday upon return \nhome from the five-game series in Williamsport, PA, where they defeated \nteams from Jenison, MI, Cyress, CA, Tampa, FL, and Greenville, NC, \nbefore their final game with Japan. They are the fourth New Jersey team \nin history to win the Little League World Series and the first U.S. \nteam in 5 years to win this title.\n  Toms River East American has brought pride to its community and the \nentire State of New Jersey. They join the ranks of the New Jersey teams \nfrom Hammonton, the 1949 Little League champions; Wayne, NJ, the 1970 \nchampions; and Lakewood, champs in 1975.\n  All of the young men on the team deserve hearty congratulations for \nan incredible season. I give you their names: Mike Belostock, Eric \nCampesi, Chris Cardone, Chris Crawford, Scott Fisher, Brad Frank, Joe \nFranceschini, Todd Frazier, Tom Gannon, Casey Gaynor, Gabe Gardner and \nR.J. Johansen.\n  These 12 young men are not only fine athletes, but they are also \noutstanding young people. They showed poise and dignity, and if one saw \nthem in that game on national TV, unparalleled enthusiasm under \npressure.\n  Their manager, Mike Gaynor, and coaches, Ken Kondek and Joe \nFranceschini, Sr., all volunteers, shepherded these youngsters through \na 28-game season. I commend them for their hard work and their \ndedication on behalf of Toms River's children. But I also must \ncongratulate the parents, the families and the fans of the team's \nplayers who supported these young sluggers through thick and thin. They \ntraveled long distances to root for their children, and they are truly \nthe heroes behind the champions.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the entire U.S. Senate will have a \nchance to join with me and Senator Torricelli in recognizing the \naccomplishments of not only the Toms River East American team, but also \nthe greater Toms River community. New Jersey and the Nation owe a debt \nof gratitude to the ``Beasts from the East,'' their parents, families, \nfriends and fans for allowing us to celebrate this important \nachievement.\n  As Yogi Berra said, ``I'd like to thank all of those who made this \nnight necessary.''\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am very proud to join with my \ncolleague, Senator Lautenberg, in offering this resolution of \ncongratulations. With all the rancor and discord of our times, it is \nworth the Senate taking a moment to note that in small towns and cities \nacross America, there are values that endure.\n  On Saturday, 12 young men, no more than 11 and 12 years old, reminded \nus of some of those values. They became the first American team in 5 \nyears to win the Little League World Series. It is a process that began \na year ago when 7,000 different teams across America and in several \nother nations began to compete for this honor. The culmination was on \nSaturday when, by a score of 12 to 9, they defeated Kashima, Japan.\n  There is no denying the athletic prowess of each of the 12 young men \nwho produced this victory. An 11- or 12-year-old boy to hit a baseball \nmore than 210 feet in repeated home runs is as much an achievement in \nits own way as Mark McGwire racing for a home run title.\n  But in truth, there is more to this success than simple athletic \nprowess. Behind each and every one of these young men was a parent, a \ncoach, a teacher, a neighbor, an umpire--someone who gave something of \nthemselves, not simply to teach an athletic skill, but character, \nvalues, the qualities of determination that are so very American.\n  In this way, each of the 46,000 people of Toms River were a part of \nthis victory; indeed, in a special sense, so was every American a part \nof this victory.\n  The lesson learned is that sacrifice and humility are an essential \npart of victory. How else does one explain a Mike Belostock who, in a \nchampionship game at a principal moment of his life, discovers that his \neye is scratched from a contact lens and tells his mother he has \ndecided not to play because the eye damage could have sacrificed the \nchances of his team.\n  Or persistence: Chris Cardone who replaced Belostock in the lineup \nand hit a game-winning home run, his first in 28 games, and only his \nsecond hit of the tournament. Or Todd Frazier who not only struck out \nthe final Japanese batter, but who also batted a perfect 4 for 4 in the \ngame.\n  Those are all sources of pride, but when the game was over and the \nteam came home, there was something that impressed me even more. Every \nparent made it very clear that on Monday morning, every superstar of \nthe ``Beasts from the East'' would be at school promptly and ready for \nwork when school resumed.\n  Mr. President, I join my colleagues in congratulating Chris Cardone, \nTodd Frazier, Scott Fisher, Gabe Gardner, Joe Franceschini, Casey \nGaynor, Eric Campesi, R.J. Johansen, Mike Belostock, Brad Frank, Tom \nGannon, Chris Crawford and their coaches, Mike Gaynor and Ken Kondek, \nfor a job well done.\n  Toms River is a town of champions, those who were on the field and \nthose who were off. For those of us in the Senate and across America \nwho watched their achievement with pride, we are reminded that there \nare values in our children as quintessentially American as baseball \nitself. Toms River, congratulations and well done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the resolution congratulating the Toms River East \nAmerican Little League.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 268) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 268\n\n       Whereas on Saturday, August 29, 1998, the Toms River East \n     American Little League team defeated Kashima, Japan, by 12 \n     runs to 9 runs to win the 52d annual Little League World \n     Series championship;\n       Whereas Toms River East American team is the first United \n     States team to win the Little League World Series \n     championship in 5 years, and the fourth New Jersey team in \n     history to win Little League's highest honor; and\n       Whereas the Toms River East American team has brought pride \n     and honor to the State of New Jersey and the entire Nation: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the Toms River East American Little \n     League Team and its loyal fans on winning the 52d annual \n     Little League World Series championship;\n       (2) recognizes and commends the hard work, dedication, \n     determination, and commitment to excellence of the team's \n     members, parents, coaches, and managers; and\n       (3) recognizes and commends the people of Toms River, New \n     Jersey, and the surrounding area for their outstanding \n     loyalty and support for the Toms River East American Little \n     League team throughout the team's 28-game season.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe resolution was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S9753]]\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania may be pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania does have the \npending amendment. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I outlined the purpose of this amendment earlier \ntoday. What it does is provide for some $28.9 million of funding for \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Preparatory Commission. There is not \na problem with the funding coming out of unobligated funds of prior \nyears.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is pending before the U.S. Senate. \nSenator Biden and I had submitted a resolution sponsored by some 36 \nSenators which called for hearings before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and a vote by the Senate on ratification of the \nconstitutional procedure.\n  The matter now pending is somewhat different, and that is to provide \nfunding for the Preparatory Commission. The problem with testing, which \nis going on now, has become very acute during the course of the past \nseveral months--when India initiated nuclear testing, followed by \nPakistan--those two countries with all of their controversy are on the \nverge of real problems.\n  I said earlier this morning that when Senator Brown and I traveled to \nIndia back in August of 1995 and talked to Prime Minister Rao, he was \ninterested in having the subcontinent nuclear-free. Shortly thereafter, \nwe visited Pakistan and saw their political leader, Prime Minister \nBenazir Bhutto, who had a similar view, but that situation has \ndeteriorated materially.\n  In asking for a vote on this matter, it is not only to strengthen the \nposition in conference where we know that on a voice vote, sometimes \nthe position in conference is not as strong. But, also in the absence \nof the Senate taking up the Treaty, to have a show of support for the \nTreaty as I think will be reflected at least in part; although, you \ncould support this amendment without necessarily committing to the \nTreaty.\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as I outlined earlier, my cosponsor is \nthe distinguished Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden. He has come to \nthe floor. At this time, I yield to him.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will not take much of the Senate's time. \nI think this debate is about the easiest debate the Senate can face. \nThere is one simple reason to support the Specter amendment, of which I \nam a cosponsor, and the U.S. contribution to the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty Preparatory Commission. It is real simple. It is in the national \nsecurity interest of the United States. I reiterate what the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania said. This is true whether or not you favor the test \nban treaty or oppose it.\n\n  Most of the funding requested for the Preparatory Commission is to be \ndevoted to capital expenditures on the international monitoring system, \nthe ability to monitor. Improving our nuclear test monitoring \ncapabilities is clearly of benefit to the United States--again, whether \nyou are for or against this treaty--as well as to the benefit of the \nworld community.\n  The recent nuclear weapons tests in India and Pakistan are a stark \nreminder of the importance of monitoring. The international monitoring \nsystem should improve the seismic monitoring of nuclear tests in India \nand Pakistan by nearly a full order of magnitude. That will lower the \nthreshold of detectable yields by a factor between 5 and 10, depending \non the test-site geology.\n  So if the detection threshold is a yield of 200 tons today, it would \nbe 20 to 40 tons a few years from now. Let me say that again. If the \nthreshold at which we can detect today is 200 tons, if this monitoring \nsystem is improved, as we fully expect it would be assuming we fund our \npart, it would reduce that to be able to detect 20 to 40 tons--but only \nif we pay our contribution.\n  The international monitoring system will also provide these improved \nmonitoring capabilities in a more cost-effective manner than we can \nachieve them unilaterally. Countries other than the United States will \nbear roughly 75 percent of the costs. Where I come from, that is a \npretty good deal. We pay three-quarters less than we would have to pay \nin order to be able to get 5 times the accuracy in terms of \ninformation, as much as 10 times the resolution we need to know if \nanybody has set off a nuclear test.\n  In addition, some of the improvement is literally unattainable \nthrough U.S.-sponsored monitoring alone, as some of the international \nmonitoring sites will be in countries that refuse to contribute to a \nU.S. unilateral monitoring system.\n  The Preparatory Commission, Mr. President, is investing--is \ninvesting--now in an international monitoring system, even though the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty might not come into force for \nsome years.\n  There are two important reasons to support this. First, if we do \nconsent to U.S. ratification of the treaty, we will want to be able to \nverify compliance as soon as the treaty enters into force. Any delay in \nfunding the international monitoring system would translate into a \ndelay in achieving the needed verification capabilities. Second, the \nimproved monitoring achieved through new or upgraded sensor sites will \ncontribute to U.S.--and world--monitoring capabilities as soon as they \nare in place, not just after the treaty enters into force.\n  U.S. agencies need to monitor possible nuclear weapons tests \nworldwide whether or not we ratify the treaty. Even so, opponents of \nratification should support this funding. What would we do if we were \nhere on the floor and said, ``You know, there's going to be no test ban \ntreaty. We just want to know what's going on in the rest of the world. \nWe want to know. And guess what? A whole bunch of nations will join in \nwith us to increase the capability of monitoring a test by roughly \ntenfold, a minimum of fivefold. And all we have to do is contribute, in \nthis case, one-quarter of the cost''?\n  Would we conclude not to do that? Would we sit here and say, ``No, \nno, no, we don't want to know; we don't want to pay 25 percent of the \ncost to increase our ability to detect testing that is up to 10 times \nmore sensitive than what our capability now is''?\n  What are we talking about here? I mean, what rationale can there \npossibly be? I suspect my friends will say, ``Well, you know, if we go \nahead and do this, then we're on a slippery slope to ratifying that God \nawful treaty.'' I think it is a good treaty, but that is the best \nargument you can come up with unless you say, ``We don't want to know. \nWe don't want to know whether or not a nation is detonating a nuclear \ndevice that is in the 20 to 40 ton range. We're satisfied knowing all \nthey can do is under 200 tons. Once they get above that, that is when \nwe'll pay attention to it.''\n  Mr. President, in sum, the international monitoring system will make \na real contribution to U.S. monitoring capabilities. That contribution \nwill be much less expensive than sustaining those sites unilaterally. \nAnd it will come on line as soon as the equipment is installed.\n  Lest anybody have to be reminded, we live in a very dangerous world. \nThe proliferation of nuclear weapons is occurring and it is a real \nrisk. It seems to me, Mr. President, again, whether or not you are for \nthe test ban treaty, the national interests requires these monitoring \ninvestments. So I strongly urge--strongly urge--all of my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania has raised\n\n[[Page S9754]]\n\na very important issue, one that has not been given sufficient \nattention by this body this year--that of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty (CTBT). Ratification of the CTBT is one of the single most \nimportant steps the Senate could take today to improve our national \nsecurity and reduce the future threat of a missile attack. This treaty \nexists only because the United States made it a priority and put a lot \nof energy into its formulation. Entry into force of the treaty will now \noccur only if the U.S. Senate engages these issues directly and begins \nthe ratification debate. I realize that many of my colleagues do not \nsupport the treaty. But I think most Senators would agree that this is \nan important debate, one that should not be allowed to slip off the \nSenate's fall agenda.\n  The amendment before the Senate would fully fund the Administration's \nrequest for $28.9 million to cover the U.S. contribution to the \nComprehensive Test Ban Preparatory Commission. This organization will \nbe responsible for coordinating the efforts of the CTBT signatories to \nmonitor compliance with the treaty and seek to prevent break-out of the \ntreaty. The organization plans to build 171 monitoring stations around \nthe world, greatly enhancing the ability of the U.S. and other \ncountries to detect a nuclear explosion.\n  Not only is this function critically important to our national \nsecurity, it comes at a bargain price: the U.S. pays only 25 percent of \nthe cost of the Preparatory Commission. The remainder is borne by the \nother signatories to the treaty. As we struggle to stretch every \ndefense dollar a bit further, I don't think we can afford to let this \nbargain escape us.\n  Mr. President, I know there are many obstacles to entry into force of \nthe CTBT. And without active, engaged U.S. leadership, it might never \nhappen. But we have a lot at stake here, both for today's security \nneeds and to prevent future nuclear weapons threats. It is much easier \nto prevent the emergence of such threats than it is to protect against \nthem once they have been developed. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, would the Senator from Oregon withhold \njust for a minute?\n  Is the debate completed on the Specter amendment? I was thinking, \nsince Mr. Smith of Oregon is here----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. No \none has risen to speak in opposition to the amendment as of this point. \nAnd in the event nobody does, I think the debate is concluded. The \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware spoke; and I have spoken on two \noccasions. I think the issue is before the body. So, in the absence of \nany opposition, I think we are ready to go to a vote when that is \nconvenient for the managers.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Specter amendment be temporarily set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk \nand ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are the amendments offered en bloc?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. They are not, Mr. President. They are separate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Oregon ask unanimous \nconsent that they be considered together?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I think they need to be considered separately. \nThey are on entirely different issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Which amendment does the Senator wish to \npresent to the body at this time?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. If the clerk will read the first one before him, \nI will proceed with that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3520\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the first amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith], for himself, Mr. \n     Thomas, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Allard, Mr. Bond, Mr. Grams, Mr. \n     Dodd, Mr. Sessions, Ms. Collins, Mr. Wyden and Mr. D'Amato, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3520.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section, and renumber the remaining sections accordingly:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This section may be cited as the ``Equality for Israel at \n     the United Nations Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EFFORT TO PROMOTE FULL EQUALITY AT THE UNITED NATIONS \n                   FOR ISRAEL.\n\n       (a) Congressional Statement.--It is the sense of the \n     Congress that--\n       (1) the United States must help promote an end to the \n     inequity experienced by Israel in the United Nations whereby \n     Israel is the only longstanding member of the organization to \n     be denied acceptance into any of the United Nations region \n     blocs, which serve as the basis for participation in \n     important activities of the United Nations, including \n     rotating membership on the United Nations Security Council; \n     and\n       (2) the United States Ambassador to the United Nations \n     should take all steps necessary to ensure Israel's acceptance \n     in the Western Europe and Others Group (WEOG) regional bloc, \n     whose membership includes the non-European countries of \n     Canada, Australia, and the United States.\n       (b) Reports to Congress.--Not later than 60 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this legislation and on a semiannual \n     basis thereafter, the Secretary of State shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a report which includes \n     the following information (in classified or unclassified form \n     as appropriate):\n       (1) Actions taken by representatives of the United States, \n     including the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, \n     to encourage the nations of the Western Europe and Others \n     Group (WEOG) to accept Israel into their regional bloc;\n       (2) efforts undertaken by the Secretary General of the \n     United Nations to secure Israel's full and equal \n     participation in that body;\n       (3) specific responses solicited and received by the \n     Secretary of State from each of the nations of Western Europe \n     and Others Group (WEOG) on their position concerning Israel's \n     acceptance into their organization; and\n       (4) other measures being undertaken, and which will be \n     undertaken, to ensure and promote Israel's full and equal \n     participation in the United Nations.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an \namendment requiring the Secretary of State to report on actions taken \nby our Ambassador to the United Nations to push the nations of the \nWestern Europe and Others Group to accept Israel into their group.\n  As you may know, Israel is the only nation among the 185 member \nstates that does not hold membership in a regional group. Membership in \na regional group is the prerequisite for any nation to serve on key \nUnited Nations bodies such as the Security Council.\n  In order to correct this inequality, I am introducing ``The Equality \nfor Israel at the United Nations Act of 1998.'' I believe that this \nlegislation will prompt our United Nations Representative to make \nequality for Israel at the United Nations a high priority.\n  I am proud to be joined by Senators Brownback, Allard, Bond, Grams, \nDodd, Sessions, Collins, Wyden, D'Amato and Thomas as original \ncosponsors of this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, Israel has been a member of the United Nations since \n1949, yet it has been continuously precluded from membership in any \nregional bloc. Most member states from the Middle East would block the \nvote needed to join their own regional group.\n  The Western Europe and Others Group, however, has accepted countries \nfrom other geographical areas such as the United States and Australia, \nfor example.\n  This year United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan announced that \n``It's time to usher in a new era of relations between Israel and the \nUnited Nations * * * One way to rectify that new chapter would be to \nrectify an anomaly: Israel's position as the only Member State that is \nnot a member of one of the regional groups, which means it has no \nchance of being elected to serve on main organs such as the Security \nCouncil or the Economic and Social Council. This anomaly would be \ncorrected.''\n  I believe it is time to back Secretary General Annan's idea with \nstrong support from the United States Senate and I ask all my \ncolleagues to join me in sending this message to the UN to stop this \ndiscrimination against Israel.\n\n[[Page S9755]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 3521\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith], for himself, Mr. \n     Biden, Mr. D'Amato, and Mr. Johnson, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3521.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC. . SANCTION AGAINST SERBIA-MONTENEGRO.\n\n       (a) Continuation of Executive Branch Sanctions.--The \n     sanctions listed in subsection (b) shall remain in effect \n     until January 1, 2000, unless the President submits to the \n     Committees on Appropriations and Foreign Relations in the \n     Senate and the Committees on Appropriations and International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives a certification \n     described in subsection (c).\n       (b) Applicable Sanctions.--\n       (1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United \n     States executive directors of the international financial \n     institutions to work in opposition to, and vote against, any \n     extension by such institutions of any financial or technical \n     assistance or grants of any kind to the government of Serbia-\n     Montenegro.\n       (2) The Secretary of State should instruct the United \n     States Ambassador to the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to block any consensus to allow \n     the participation of Serbia-Montenegro in the OSCE or any \n     organization affiliated with the OSCE.\n       (3) The Secretary of State should instruct the United \n     States Representative to the United Nations to vote against \n     any resolution in the United Nations Security Council to \n     admit Serbia-Montenegro to the Untied Nations or any \n     organization affiliated with the United Nations, to veto any \n     resolution to allow Serbia-Montenegro to assume the United \n     Nations' membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic \n     of Yugoslavia, and to take action to prevent Serbia-\n     Montenegro from assuming the seat formerly occupied by the \n     Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (4) The Secretary of State should instruct the United \n     States Permanent Representative on the Council of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization to oppose the extension of the \n     Partnership for Peace program or any other organization \n     affiliated with NATO to Serbia-Montenegro.\n       (5) The Secretary of State should instruct the United \n     States

Certification.--A certification described in this \n     subsection is a certification that--\n       (1) the representatives of the successor states to the \n     Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have successfully \n     negotiated the division of assets and liabilities and all \n     other succession issues following the dissolution of the \n     Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (2) the government of Serbia-Montenegro is fully complying \n     with its obligations as a signatory to the General Framework \n     Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (3) the government of Serbia-Montenegro is fully \n     cooperating with and providing unrestricted access to the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, \n     including surrendering persons indicted for war crimes who \n     are within the jurisdiction of the territory of Serbia-\n     Montenegro, and with the investigations concerning the \n     commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity in \n     Kosova.\n       (4) the government of Serbia-Montenegro is implementing \n     internal democratic reforms.\n       (5) Serbian, Serbian-Montenegrin federal governmental \n     officials, and representatives of the ethnic Albanian \n     community in Kosova have agreed on, signed, and begun \n     implementation of a negotiated settlement on the future \n     status of Kosova.\n       (d) Statement of Policy.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the United States should not restore full diplomatic \n     relations with Serbia-Montenegro until the President submits \n     to the Committees on Appropriations and Foreign Relations in \n     the Senate and the Committees on Appropriations and \n     International Relations in the House of Representatives the \n     certification described in subsection (c).\n       (e) Exemption of Montenegro.--The sanctions described in \n     subsection (b)(1) should not apply to the Government of \n     Montenegro.\n       (f) Definition.--The term ``international financial \n     institution'' includes the International Monetary Fund, the \n     International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the \n     International Development Association, the International \n     Finance Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guaranty \n     Agency, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development.\n       (g) Waiver Authority.--\n       (1) The President may waive the application in whole or in \n     part, of any sanction described in subsection (b) if the \n     President certifies to the Congress that the President has \n     determined that the waiver is necessary to meet emergency \n     humanitarian needs or to achieve a negotiated settlement of \n     the conflict in Kosova that is acceptable to the parties.\n       (2) Such a waiver may only be effective upon certification \n     by the President to Congress that the United States has \n     transferred and will continue to transfer (subject to \n     adequate protection of intelligence sources and methods) to \n     the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia \n     all information it has collected in support of an indictment \n     and trial of President Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes, \n     crimes against humanity, or genocide.\n       (3) In the event of a waiver, within seven days the \n     President must report the basis upon which the waiver was \n     made to the Select Committee on Intelligence and the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations in the Senate, and the \n     Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee \n     on International Relations in the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, we have all watched the events in \nKosovo with alarm and distress over the past several months. The \nsituation on the ground continues to deteriorate and no progress has \nbeen made on a negotiated solution to the conflict.\n  Serb paramilitary groups and Yugoslav army units are conducting \noffensives in Kosovo that have the effect of driving tens of thousands \nof Kosovar Albanians from their homes. Innocent civilians have been \nkilled. Villages throughout the province have been razed. Humanitarian \nworkers in Kosovo are in great danger as they try to fulfill their \nmission of delivering food, medicine, and other necessities to the \nrefugee population.\n  In fact, just recently, in a despicable act, three aid workers with \nthe Mother Theresa Society in Kosovo were deliberately killed by \nSerbian forces as they attempted to deliver humanitarian assistance to \nKosovars that had been displaced by the conflict. Fighting has occurred \non the border with Albania, highlighting the potential for this \nconflict to spread throughout the Balkans, and even involve Greece and \nTurkey, two of our NATO allies.\n  Mr. President, I lay the blame of this disaster on the shoulders of \none man: Slobodan Milosevic. Mr. Milosevic, currently President of the \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia, rose to power in 1989 by exploiting and \nmanipulating Serbian nationalism in Kosovo--a process that led directly \nto the horrific war in Bosnia and resulted in the death of tens of \nthousands of Bosnians of all ethnic groups. In his desperate effort to \nhold onto power, Milosevic has reverted to his old tricks: he is using \nthe status of Kosovo--a province which is overwhelmingly populated by \nethnic Albanians--to consolidate and perpetuate his authority and \nposition.\n  The six-nation Contact Group charged with monitoring events in the \nformer Yugoslavia has issued various sets of demands since the crisis \nbegan in February--demands which Milosevic repeatedly ignores. I am \naware of the diplomatic effort underway to start the process of \nnegotiating a settlement. Yet no solution will endure that does not \nguarantee the Albanians in Kosovo their full political rights and civil \nliberties.\n  Mr. President, for several years, the Clinton Administration has \nmaintained a policy of upholding the so-called ``outer wall'' of \nsanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The FRY is what \nremains of socialist Yugoslavia, and consists of two republics, Serbia \nand Montenegro.\n  The outer wall denies United States' support of FRY membership in \ninternational organizations. It denies United States' support for FRY \naccess to economic assistance provided by international financial \ninstitutions. And the outer wall withholds full United States \ndiplomatic relations with the FRY.\n  The Administration has stated that the FRY and Mr. Milosevic must \nfulfill five conditions before the outer wall of sanctions is lifted. \nThe amendment that we have before us today requires the President to \ncertify these five conditions are met before any action is taken to \nlift or to weaken the outer wall.\n  These five conditions as laid out by senior officials of the Clinton \nAdministration are as follows. First, all succession issues due to the \nbreak-up of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia--in \nparticular, the division of assets and liabilities--must be resolved\n\n[[Page S9756]]\n\nwith the other republics that emerged from the dissolution of that \ncountry. Second, the FRY must comply with all of its obligations as a \nsignatory of the Dayton Accords. Third, the FRY must cooperate with the \nWar Crimes Tribunal that is investigating and prosecuting war criminals \nin the former Yugoslavia. Fourth, the FRY must make substantial \nprogress in implementing democratic reforms. And finally, the FRY must \nmake progress in resolving the situation in Kosovo.\n  When discussing ``progress'' in Kosovo, I want to emphasize that \nprogress does not mean the end of the Serbian policy of ethnic \ncleansing in Kosovo. Nor does it mean Serbian paramilitary forces \nceasing their operations directed at civilians in Kosovo. That is not \nprogress. Progress is a negotiated settlement that allows ethnic \nAlbanians to exercise their political rights.\n  Let me be clear: the problem here is Mr. Milosevic, not the Serbian \npeople. The Serbian people must not be blamed for the irrational \npolicies promoted by Milosevic. I want to be helpful to those in Serbia \nwho are courageously opposing the detrimental policies propounded by \nhim. These individuals are trying to establish independent media that \nwill provide unbiased reporting to the Serbian people; they are working \nto strengthen the democratic opposition, small though it is, to \nMilosevic's stronghold on power; they are trying to develop a civil \nsociety based on the rule of law. They need our help--and they deserve \nour help.\n  But Mr. Milosevic--and the Serbian people--must understand that \nMilosevic either needs to comply with the five conditions laid out by \nthe Administration or his country will continue to be isolated into the \nnext century.\n  Before continuing, Mr. President, I must take note of the positive \ndevelopments that have occurred this year in Montenegro, Serbia's \npartner in the FRY. Montenegro has made great strides in implementing \nnecessary reforms to make the transition from a socialist state with a \ncentrally planned economy to a free market democracy.\n  Events in Montenegro prove that democracy can take root and flourish \nin the FRY, but requires leaders that are committed to a pluralistic, \nmulti-ethnic state. It is in our interests to support Montenegrin \nPresident Djukanovic in his effort to consolidate and accelerate the \ndemocratic reform process. Though Mr. Milosevic has made every attempt \nto frustrate President Djukanovic's efforts, the Montenegrin people \nhave spoken--and their choice is democracy.\n  Mr. President, the amendment we have before us clearly states exactly \nwhat Mr. Milosevic needs to do for his country to join the family of \nWestern nations. This is not a secret to him. It has been the position \nof this Administration for several years. What is new, however, is that \nthis amendment prohibits the FRY from joining international \norganizations, such as the United Nations and the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, and prohibits the FRY from gaining \naccess to assistance from international financial institutions until \neach of these five conditions are met.\n  What we are asking for is responsible behavior. Before lifting the \nouter wall of sanctions--which in effect is a reward for Serbia--we \nshould expect nothing less.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I understand that these amendments may be accepted by \nthe managers of the bill. So I will not ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Smith amendments are cleared on \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will not take any more of the Senate's \ntime. I learned a long time ago from a former chairman named Russell \nLong that when you are about to accept something, let it be accepted.\n  I rise to cosponsor an amendment that codifies the so-called outer \nwall of sanctions on the government of Serbia-Montenegro.\n  Mr. President, as we know, for the last decade Slobodan Milosevic has \npursued his mad dream of a Greater Serbia. The result has been hundreds \nof thousands dead, millions made homeless, and centuries-old Serbian \nculture eradicated from sections of the former Yugoslavia.\n  And Milosevic is continuing his murderous policies in Kosovo, while \nplaying games with us in Bosnia and frustrating democratic reforms in \nSerbia.\n  The amendment that Senator Smith, Senator D'Amato, Senator Johnson, \nand I are proposing codifies five categories of sanctions.\n  First, the Secretary of the Treasury is to instruct the U.S. \nexecutive directors of the international financial institutions to work \nin opposition to and vote against, any extension by these institutions \nof any financial or technical assistance or grants of any kind to the \ngovernment of Serbia. Montenegro's reformist government is exempted \nfrom these sanctions.\n  Second, the Secretary of State is to instruct the U.S. Ambassador to \nthe OSCE--the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe--not \nto join any consensus to allow the participation of Serbia-Montenegro \nin the OSCE.\n  Third, the Secretary of State is to instruct the Representative to \nthe United Nations to vote against any resolution in the U.N. Security \nCouncil to admit Serbia-Montenegro to the U.N.\n  Fourth, the U.S. is to oppose the extension of the Partnership for \nPeace program to Serbia-Montenegro.\n  Fifth, the U.S. is to oppose the extension of membership in the \nSoutheast European Cooperative Initiative to Serbia-Montenegro.\n  How might Milosevic avoid these sanctions?\n  The amendment would drop these sanctions if the President certifies \nthat Serbia-Montenegro has taken five steps.\n  First, Serbian representatives must be negotiating in good faith with \nthe other successor states of the former Yugoslavia on the division of \nassets and liabilities and other succession issues.\n  Second, the government of Serbia-Montenegro must be complying fully \nwith its obligations as a signatory to the Dayton Accords.\n  Third, the government of Serbia-Montenegro must be cooperating fully \nwith, and providing unrestricted access to, the International Criminal \nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\n  Fourth, the government of Serbia-Montenegro must be implementing \ninternal democratic reforms, including progress in the rule of law and \nindependent media. In this regard it is worth noting that the \ngovernment of the Republic of Montenegro is already in compliance.\n  Fifth, the government of Serbia-Montenegro must meet the requirements \non Kosovo enumerated elsewhere in this Act.\n  Mr. President, Slobodan Milosevic has jerked this country around long \nenough. This amendment makes clear to him what he has to do in order to \nhave the outer wall of sanctions removed.\n  The ball is squarely in his court.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I compliment my friend from Oregon in leading the way \non this. I think the balance here is real. I think it is very \nimportant. I think it is totally consistent with the direction we have \nbeen going in the way the Senate should act relevant to the sanctions \nand the exceptions we grant the President for other reasons relating to \nother than that very high bar of the national security test.\n  I compliment him. I thank him for the modification.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendments of \nthe Senator from Oregon?\n  Does the Senator from Oregon wish them to be voted on en bloc?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Yes. Mr. President, I would make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the two amendments of the Senator from Oregon.\n  The amendments (No. 3520 and No. 3521) were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n[[Page S9757]]\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thought we were ready for a finite \nlist of amendments, but apparently we are not. The Senator from \nOklahoma has been waiting patiently for a couple of hours. The Senator \nfrom New York also would like to make just a brief comment on the IMF \nprovision. I know that the Senator from Idaho has brief comments to \nmake as well. I wonder if it is all right with the Senator from \nOklahoma, since his amendment is going to be a contentious amendment, \nif we dispose of comments of the Senator from New York and the Senator \nfrom Idaho, which I understand are going to be quite brief.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have no objection.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I thank the distinguished manager of \nthe legislation and my colleague and friend from Oklahoma for his \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. President, the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill before us \naddresses a matter of the utmost urgency: the need to replenish the \nresources of the International Monetary Fund.\n  Title VI of the bill provides $14.5 billion--the amount of the United \nStates' quota increase--which will augment the general funds available \nto the IMF. The need for this measure is undeniable: the Fund's \nresources have been seriously depleted as a result of the Asian \nfinancial crisis--specifically, the $36.1 billion in assistance \ncommitted to Indonesia, Thailand, and Korea--and now nearly drained by \nominous developments in Russia. Not to mention the potential \n``contagion'' effect. The bill also approves the United States' $3.36 \nbillion contribution to the New Arrangements to Borrow--a new fund that \nwill provide additional resources to respond to financial crises of \nsuch consequence that they threaten the stability of the international \nmonetary system. Unfortunately, we have entered a period in which \ncrises of such magnitude are upon us.\n  Action on the IMF funding request is surely overdue. The President \nsought these funds in his requested supplemental appropriation for \nFiscal Year 1998. The Senate readily agreed, approving the IMF funding \namendment offered by the distinguished floor manager, the Senator from \nKentucky, by a resounding vote of 84-16. That was on March 26. \nRegrettably and incomprehensibly, the measure was then dropped in \nconference at the urging of the House. It is now more than five months \nlater, with no action by the other body, and global financial markets \nare in yet more precarious positions.\n  I spoke this morning with our esteemed Secretary of the Treasury, \nSecretary Rubin, who reiterated the importance of immediate action on \nthis legislation. There is no end in sight to the Asian financial \ncrisis, which began more than a year ago in Thailand. The President \ntoday is in Russia, which is on the brink of financial collapse. These \nevents, particularly those in Russia in recent days, ought to convince \nus that this is not the time to put into jeopardy the IMF as an active \nparticipant in world financial matters.\n  It is true that the Russian economy is small. As pointed out in \nSaturday's New York Times, the drop last week in the value of stocks on \nthe Tokyo Stock Exchange--some $241 billion--was roughly the size of \nthe entire annual output of the Russian economy at present exchange \nrates. Western Europe's exports to Russia account for well under 0.4 \npercent of their GDP. And for the United States, the amount is \nminuscule. Total U.S. exports to Russia in 1997 reached $3.4 billion, a \nmere 0.04 percent of our GDP.\n  But it would be a serious mistake to minimize the potential impact of \nthe current crisis in Russia. As The Financial Times pointed out last \nweekend, in its August 29-30, 1998 issue,\n\n       Events in Moscow have moved with bewildering speed. The \n     rouble and stock market are plunging, and there is a run on \n     the banks. Most of the reformers seem to be out of the \n     government, replaced by politicians who can be relied on only \n     to set policies to meet the desires of Russia's oligarchs. . \n     . . However, it is already clear that the impact of this \n     crisis will be greatly disproportionate to Russia's size. At \n     worst, the crisis could trigger a new round of contagion, \n     sending western stock markets crashing, and the world into \n     recession . . .\n\nAnd yet, the economic consequences of the current turmoil in Russia are \nnot nearly as serious as the potential political consequences, which \nmay have profound implications for the people of Russia--and indeed for \nthe entire globe in this nuclear age.\n  For instance, Dr. Murray Feshbach, who warned so presciently in the \nearly 1980s about the troubles afflicting the Soviet Union, continues \nto document frightening Russian public health problems. The life \nexpectancy of Russian men dropped from 62 years in 1989 to 57 years in \n1996. There is no historical equivalent. It has increased slightly in \nthe last year, but remains at appalling levels. A century ago, a 16 \nyear-old Russian male had a 56 percent chance of surviving to age 60. \nIn 1996, a 16 year-old Russian male had only a 54 percent chance of \nsurviving to age 60. Two percent less than he would have had he been \nborn a century earlier!\n  The military is not spared the problems afflicting the Russian \neconomy or the health of its citizens. Last month, an army major in \ncentral Russia took to the streets with a tank to protest the failure \nto pay wages. The first rule of government is pay the army. Russian \nsoldiers are reduced to begging for food. The decrepit state of the \nmilitary leaves Russia, for the most part, undefended. Except, Sir, for \nnuclear weapons, of which it has over 20,000.\n  A recent National Security Blueprint, issued by President Boris \nYeltsin on December 17, 1997, is a remarkable document. It is a 14,500-\nword assessment of Russian national security published openly in an \nofficial paper. It acknowledges the ethnic tensions which exist in \nRussia and notes how the weak economy exacerbates those forces. It \nstates:\n\n       The critical state of the economy is the main cause of the \n     emergence of a threat to the Russian Federation's national \n     security. This is manifested in the substantial reduction in \n     production, the decline in investment and innovation, the \n     destruction of scientific and technical potential, the \n     stagnation of the agrarian sector, the disarray of the \n     monetary and payments system, the reduction in the income \n     side of the federal budget, and the growth of the state debt.\n\n  It goes on to warn:\n\n       The negative processes in the economy exacerbate the \n     centrifugal tendencies of Russian Federation components and \n     lead to the growth of the threat of violation of the \n     country's territorial integrity and the unity of its legal \n     area.\n       The ethnic egotism, ethnocentrism, and chauvinism that are \n     displayed in the activities of a number of ethnic social \n     formations help to increase national separatism and create \n     favorable conditions for the emergence of conflict in this \n     sphere.\n\n                          (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n  Mr. President, the IMF, with its emphasis on economic reform, has a \nrole to play here. Now is not the time to call into question the United \nStates' commitment to that institution. We can debate whether the \namounts provided in this bill will be enough. Indeed, a persuasive \narticle in this morning's Washington Post by Susan Eisenhower, chairman \nof the Center for Political and Strategic Studies here in Washington, \nstates:\n\n       Simply put: The IMF multiyear ``bailouts'' were enough to \n     obligate Russia to implement Western-designed programs, but \n     not enough to do the job. Total Western assistance to Russia \n     has been a fraction of what West Germany has spent in East \n     Germany since unification.\n\n  It may be time for us to concede that the situation in Russia merits \na much more aggressive assistance program, on the order of the Marshall \nPlan that was so effective in reviving Western Europe. Fifty years ago, \nfrom 1948-1952, the United States gave about $3 billion a year to fund \nthe Marshall Plan. A comparable contribution in round numbers, given \nthe current size of the United States economy, would be about $100 \nbillion a year for five years. And yet, the United States' total \nbilateral assistance to Russia in the five-year period from fiscal \nyears 1992 through 1996 was merely $3.1 billion.\n  Certainly the 20,000 nuclear weapons in Russia's hands ought to \npersuade us that a more serious approach to Russia's economic problems \nis required. Without question, the first order of business must be the \npassage of this legislation, to secure funding for the IMF. And after \nthat, we ought to begin a serious debate on what more can and should to \nbe done.\n\n[[Page S9758]]\n\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, thank you, very much. May I also thank \nthe Senator from Oklahoma for his patience. He has an amendment to \noffer.\n  I rise to thank the chairman, the Senator from Kentucky, and the \nranking member, the Senator from Vermont, for his help on two \namendments which I placed in this foreign ops bill, and also some very \nimportant language that they worked out with me with regard to the IMF.\n  By way of explanation, the amendments require U.S. directors of \ninternational institutions (such as the IMF and Agency for \nInternational Development, AID) to use the voice and vote of the United \nStates to encourage purchase of American products, commodities and \nequipment. This legislation requires that our directors of \ninternational organizations use their influence to encourage purchase \nof U.S. ag commodities.\n\n  The amendments also require the Secretary of the Treasury to report \nto Congress annually on the efforts of the heads of federal agencies \nand the U.S. executive directors of international financial \ninstitutions to promote the purchase of American commodities. We can't \njust tell these directors to promote our products, we must also have \nsome accountability, so we can encourage and see the results of U.S. \nagricultural commodities actually being purchased.\n  This is strong, unambiguous language. The concept and language of \nthis amendment affecting surplus commodities should be applied to the \nequally important issue that funds made available through this bill \nshould purchase American agricultural products.\n  If we are going to ask American farmers and ranchers to pay their \ntaxes to support the financial assistance provided in this bill, then \nwe should ask their American representatives in these international \nfinancial institutions to urge the purchase of American agriculture \ncommodities with the funds made available with this bill.\n  The foreign operations bill also attempts to increase exports of \nAmerican products and also seeks to make sure that the International \nMonetary Fund will not subsidize the foreign semiconductor industry to \nthe detriment of American semiconductor companies. Specifically, the \nprovisions require the Secretary of Treasury to certify to Congress \nthat no IMF resources will support semiconductor and other key \nindustries in any form, and that the Secretary of the Treasury will \ninstruct the U.S. Executive Director of the IMF to use the voice and \nvote of the United States to oppose disbursement of further funds if \nsuch certification is not given.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking member again for \nworking with me on this particular language which is critically \nimportant to the semiconductor industry. Senator Craig and I have met \nwith a number of individuals from the U.S. Treasury, including the \nSecretary of Treasury, Robert Rubin, prior to his trip to Asia. I \nbelieve that he delivered a very strong message to the countries in \nAsia.\n  As we have talked about the semiconductor business, the transparency \nissue of the International Monetary Fund, as well as agriculture, they \nare all linked together because when we met with a number of the \nnational ag commodity groups, they all said there is a crisis that \nexists in agriculture today, and one of the elements that they stressed \nthat was important was to see the recovery of economies around the \nworld, certainly in Asia so that those markets, again, are available to \nU.S. agricultural commodities.\n  So, again, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his great help and \nleadership on this issue.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I, too, thank and congratulate the \nSenator from Idaho for his amendments and his good work in this regard.\n  Now, the long-suffering Senator from Oklahoma is next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished Senator for \nyielding.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3366\n\n (Purpose: To require a certification that the signing of the Landmine \nConvention is consistent with the combat requirements and safety of the \n                   armed forces of the United States)\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3366.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 82, line 16, after the end period insert: ``This \n     subsection shall not apply unless the Joint Chiefs of Staff \n     and the unified combatant commanders certify in writing to \n     the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the \n     Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives that the signing of the Convention is \n     consistent with the combat requirements and safety of the \n     armed forces of the United States.''.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. There is some language that was put on this bill by the \nvery distinguished Senator from Vermont. I will read that language to \nyou. The language states:\n\n       Statement of Policy. It is the policy of the United States \n     Government to sign the Convention on the Prohibition of the \n     Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel \n     Mines and on Their Destruction as soon as practicable.\n\n  My amendment merely agrees to that language but adds, provided ``the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff and the unified combatant commanders certify in \nwriting to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the \nCommittee on National Security of the House of Representatives that'' \nsuch a step ``is consistent with the combat requirements and safety of \nthe armed forces of the United States.''\n  So essentially what we are doing is saying that we agree that the \nlanguage is--even though I would prefer the language not be in there, \nthe language remain in there, but it be qualified. I am always a little \nbit confused and disturbed when I see the qualifier ``as practicable.'' \nI don't know what ``as practicable'' means, and so I think this \nactually would improve the language that was put in by the Senator from \nVermont giving some qualifications.\n  I think also that the Senator from Vermont has a lot of passion on \nthis issue. I certainly understand that. When I was a freshman, I was \nseated up there where the President is seated right now and listened to \nhis comments for about an hour. I know his concern comes from the \nheart. I think he is also equally concerned about the safety of troops \ndeployed overseas, thousands of troops in South Korea and troops all \naround the world.\n  A statement that was made by the Senator from Vermont, referring to \nthe Ottawa Treaty, was: I think we can get to it sooner, and I and \nothers will be pushing to do so. So I think there is going to be an \nongoing effort to get to this treaty sooner than some of us would want \nto do that.\n  The fact is that our senior military commanders, both those currently \nin uniform and many of those now in retirement, have already put us on \nnotice: The U.S. military requires the ability to make responsible use \nof self-destructing APLs. This is particularly true in those situations \nwhere American forces are forced to operate in hostile territory, often \nseverely outnumbered. The alternative to the responsible use of \nantipersonnel landmines is to have their positions overrun, to \nbeachhead loss and heavy casualty loss unnecessarily sustained.\n  So, Mr. President, here is what every Member of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff and every one of the unified combatant commanders wrote last \nyear, and I am quoting right now.\n\n       Self-destructing landmines are particularly important to \n     the protection of early entry and light forces which must be \n     prepared to fight outnumbered during the initial stages of \n     deployment. The lives of our sons and daughters should be \n     given the highest priority when deciding whether or not to \n     ban unilaterally the use of self-destructing APLs.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the full text of this extraordinary \nletter dated July 10 of 1997 printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S9759]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    The Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 1997.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are seriously concerned about the new \n     legislative proposal to permanently restrict the use of funds \n     for new deployment of antipersonnel landmines (APL) \n     commencing January 1, 2000. Passing this bill into law will \n     unnecessarily endanger U.S. military forces and significantly \n     restrict the ability to conduct combat operations \n     successfully. As the FY 1998 Defense Authorization Bill and \n     other related legislation are considered, your support is \n     needed for the Service members whose lives may depend on the \n     force protection afforded by such landmines.\n       We share the world's concern about the growing humanitarian \n     problem related to the indiscriminate and irresponsible use \n     of a lawful weapon, non-self-destructing APL. In fact we have \n     banned non-self-destructing [dumb] APL, except for Korea. We \n     support the President's APL policy which has started us on \n     the road to ending our reliance on any anti-personnel \n     landmines. Having taken a great step toward the elimination \n     of APL, we must at this time, retain the use of self-\n     destructing APL in order to minimize the risk to U.S. \n     soldiers and marines in combat. However, we are ready to ban \n     all APL when the major producers and suppliers ban theirs or \n     when an alternative is available.\n       Landmines are a ``combat multiplier'' for U.S. land forces, \n     especially since the dramatic reduction of the force \n     structure. Self-destructing landmines greatly enhance the \n     ability to shape the battlefield, protect unit flanks, and \n     maximize the effects of other weapons systems. Self-\n     destructing landmines are particularly important to the \n     protection of early entry and light forces, which must be \n     prepared to fight outnumbered during the initial stages of a \n     deployment.\n       This legislation, in its current form, does not \n     differentiate between non-self-destructing and self-\n     destructing APL. Banning new deployments of APL will prevent \n     use of most modern U.S. remotely delivered landmine systems \n     to protect U.S. forces. This includes prohibiting use of most \n     antitank landmine systems because they have APL embedded \n     during production. Self-destructing APL are essential to \n     prevent rapid breaching of antitank mines by the enemy. These \n     concerns were reported to you in the recent ``Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff Report to Congress on the Effects of a \n     Moratorium Concerning Use by Armed Forces of APL.'' Also of \n     concern is that the bill's definition of an APL jeopardizes \n     use of other munitions essential to CINC warplanes.\n       We request that you critically review the new APL \n     legislation and take appropriate action to ensure maximum \n     protection for our soldiers and marines who carry out \n     national security policy at grave personal risk. Until the \n     United States has a capable replacement for self-destructing \n     APL, maximum flexibility and warfighting capability for \n     American combat commanders must be preserved. The lives of \n     our sons and daughters should be given the highest priority \n     when deciding whether or not to ban unilaterally the use of \n     self-destructing APL.\n           Sincerely,\n         Joseph W. Ralston, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n           Staff; Dennis J. Reimer, General, U.S. Army, Chief of \n           Staff; Ronald R.

As I said, I don't want to change the language. I don't \nthink I want to change the intent of the language of the Senator from \nVermont, but nonetheless this does put language in there that would \ntake our troops out from harm's way.\n  I know that the Senator from Vermont has some comments to make \nperhaps in opposition to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thought the Senator was going to be \nspeaking longer.\n  Mr. President, I would like to read what is in the bill. It says:\n\n       It is the policy of the U.S. Government to sign the \n     Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, \n     Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their \n     Destruction as soon as practicable.\n\n  That is a convention that has now been signed by some 129 nations, \nincluding every one of our NATO allies except Turkey and every other \nWestern Hemisphere country except Cuba. It says we will sign it as soon \nas practicable. It does not set a deadline. Other nations far less \npowerful than the United States have said they can sign it, but we have \nnot signed it. We have said that even though we are the most powerful \nnation history has ever known, we are not powerful enough to sign the \nanti-landmine treaty, but we wish other nations would. And we have \nencouraged other nations to give up their landmines, in laudatory \nfashion--nations nowhere near as powerful as we, nations that face a \nlot more threats on their borders than we.\n  Mr. President, I happen to disagree with the President of the United \nStates in that regard. I do agree with my friend from Oklahoma that \nboth he and I are concerned about the men and women that we send into \ncombat. My son is a marine. He is a rifleman in the Marine Corps. When \nhe was called up for Desert Storm, his MOL was carry the SAW, light \nmachine gun, and he was listed as a ``casualty replacement,'' \nencouraging terminology for parents of all young marines who are so \nlisted--the idea that they are the ones who go first into combat \ncarrying a gun with others behind them to pick up the guns, the \nweapons, and so on, if the first one falls, which in this instance \nwould have been our son.\n  Now, we are fortunate the war ended so quickly that neither he nor \nthe others in his unit ended up in harm's way. But I have to assume he \nmay be called up again. And as a parent and a U.S. Senator, the last \nthing in the world I want to do is anything that increases the threat \nto our own troops or that in any way diminishes our ability to defend \nourselves.\n  But having said that, I am also struck by the number of generals, the \nnumber of combat leaders, including the retired commander in chief in \nKorea, including the former supreme allied commander of NATO in Europe, \nincluding a number of others who have called for such a ban on \nlandmines because it has become such a double-edged sword, aside from \nthe fact that most people who are killed by landmines today are \ncivilians, not combatants.\n  The United States was the first Nation in the world to actually pass \nlandmine ban legislation, legislation that banned the export of \nlandmines from this country, something hotly contested in this Chamber. \nAnd in a rollcall vote, 100 Senators voted for that amendment, voted \nfor the Leahy law, and it became law--100 U.S. Senators across the \npolitical spectrum. In fact, many have said that that legislation was \nthe trigger that got us to where we are today, where 129 nations have \nsigned the Ottawa Treaty.\n  We expect 40 ratifications by next month. That is the fastest that \nany international humanitarian law or arms control treaty has ever in \nhistory come into force. I think that shows the tremendous \ninternational support and momentum for this treaty and for the end to \nthe endless slaughter of innocent people by landmines.\n  Now, the United States has not signed it, and even if the United \nStates does sign it, even if the United States does sign it, it then \nhas to come to the Senate where two-thirds of the Senators present and \nvoting have to vote to approve such a treaty before the President can \nratify it. The President of the United States cannot ratify such a \ntreaty unless two-thirds of the Senators present and voting vote to \nallow him to ratify it. And actually, if we did, he still doesn't have \nto ratify it but, of course, would.\n  Mr. President, even though a majority of the Senators in this body \nhave signed legislation, cosponsored legislation that would ban United \nStates use of anti-personnel mines except in Korea, in an attempt to \nwork closely with the Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nand particularly General Ralston for whom I have immeasurable respect, \nthe President of\n\n[[Page S9760]]\n\nthe United States, the Secretary of Defense, and the National Security \nAdviser, I worked hard to agree on an approach that was acceptable to \neveryone. The language in this bill, which the Senator from Oklahoma \nwants to modify, is consistent with that agreement. My language simply \nsays it is our policy to sign the treaty as soon as practicable. And \nthat reflects the understanding that the administration is searching \naggressively for alternatives to landmines. And General Ralston has \nassured me that they are doing that and I have confidence in him.\n  Incidentally, several types of landmines we use are not prohibited by \nthe Ottawa Treaty, neither command detonated Claymore mines, nor anti-\ntank mines. But I am concerned that my friend from Oklahoma now wants \nto give a veto to a whole lot of other people. The fact of the matter \nis, no treaty is going to come up here with any chance of being \napproved by two-thirds of the Senate unless the President, the \nSecretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and everybody else \nsupport it. But the Senator from Oklahoma wants to require that each of \nthe unified combatant commanders has to agree--it apparently isn't \nenough that the Commander in Chief, or the Secretary of Defense, \nagrees.\n  I have dealt in good faith with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the \nPresident and the National Security Adviser and the Secretary of \nDefense. My language reflects that. And I agreed not to oppose a waiver \nof my moratorium legislation, and other things that the Pentagon \nwanted. The amendment by the Senator from Oklahoma places that \nagreement in jeopardy.\n  I know there may be others who wish to speak. I will give a longer \ntutorial on the landmines issue later today or tomorrow. But let's be \nclear. My language does not have us ratifying the Ottawa Treaty or \nanything like that. We are not ratifying it here, even though 40 of \nthose nations will have done so very shortly, the fastest that any \ninternational law or arms control treaty has ever been agreed to come \ninto force. No. Even with my language, the United States is still one \nof the lone holdouts in the world. Certainly among our NATO allies we \nare the most significant holdout.\n  I tell my friend from Oklahoma, if he went to some of the parts of \nthe world where we use the Leahy War Victims Fund and saw the numbers \nof civilians blown apart by landmines, he would understand my concerns. \nAnd if he received the letters or talked to the military officers I \nhave talked to who have been injured, or seen their fellow soldiers \nkilled or wounded by our own landmines, he would understand. And if he \nhad heard some of the speeches by our allies who ask why the most \npowerful nation on Earth wants them to give up their landmines but \nrefuses to give up ours, then he would also understand my concern.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  I withhold that, Mr. President, if the Senator from Oklahoma wishes \nto speak. I withhold the suggestion of the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Vermont. Most of the things he \nstated so eloquently I do agree with. I would like to discuss a couple \nof them, however.\n  The 125 nations or so that we are talking about that he referred to \nwho signed this Ottawa Treaty--obviously, we have not. I don't think it \nis good policy for us to say that we didn't sign it ourselves but we \nencourage others to do it.\n  I have not seen any documentation of that. If I did, it wouldn't \nreally be too meaningful to me.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Of course.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We have encouraged others to give up their landmines. We \nhave done this around the world, as we should. In the Ottawa Treaty, \nno; in fact, in the Ottawa Treaty, when it was being negotiated in \nOslo, the United States came in at the last minute and expressed some \ninterest but we did everything possible to thwart it up to that point.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for that clarification.\n  A statement that was made by the Senator from Vermont was that, if \nyou go to parts of the world where you can see the damage inflicted by \nthese, you perhaps will feel differently. I suggest to the Senator, I \nhave been there, and I remember the problems we had in Nicaragua and \nHonduras. There is nothing that is more repugnant, nothing that is \nsadder than seeing the effect of landmines on individuals. However, \nwhat we are talking about now is many of those landmines were not U.S. \nlandmines. Those were landmines that were made in other parts of the \nworld. We are talking about self-destructing landmines, self-disarming \nlandmines, and landmines that, in the opinion of our military leaders, \nare necessary to save the lives of Americans.\n  As far as the alternatives, I hope that we are going to be able to \ncome up with alternatives to landmines, even smart landmines. I will be \nthe first one, when that time comes, to stand here on the floor of the \nSenate and change our policy so that we can more accurately use and \neffectively use these landmines. However, we can always change the law \nwhen that time comes.\n  In addition, the statement that I read was endorsed by every member \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff and every one of the unified combatant \ncommanders, which was:\n\n       Self-destructing landmines are particularly important to \n     the protection of early entry and light forces which must be \n     prepared to fight outnumbered during the initial stages of \n     deployment. The lives of our sons and daughters should be \n     given the highest priority when deciding whether or not to \n     ban unilaterally the use of destructive APLs.\n\n  I think some of the same language was used by our Commander in Chief \nwhen the President said, it was a year ago this month I believe, Mr. \nPresident, he said:\n\n       As Commander in Chief, I will not send our soldiers to \n     defend the freedom of our people and the freedom of others \n     without doing everything we can to make them as secure as \n     possible. There is a line that I simply cannot cross and that \n     line is the safety and security of our men and women in \n     uniform.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield for a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. I have a copy of what I believe is the amendment that the \nSenator from Oklahoma has offered. I wonder if this is the amendment, \nand I am going to read what I have:\n\n       This subsection shall not apply unless the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff and the unified combatant commanders certify in writing \n     to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the \n     Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives that the signing of the Convention is \n     consistent with the combat requirements and safety of the \n     armed forces of the United States.\n\n  Is that the Senator's amendment?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is the language.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it seems that we would all want the military \nleaders of our country to agree that any policy that we adopt is \ncommensurate with both combat requirements and the safety of the Armed \nForces of the United States. And if they are not willing to certify \nthat, then I certainly wouldn't want to be on record as supporting a \npolicy or a treaty or a law that they felt was inimical to the safety \nof the Armed Forces of the United States. I guess I am really wondering \nwhat the controversy is about. Maybe there isn't much controversy.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I respond to the Senator from Arizona, at the very \nbeginning when we opened our remarks, I said the language the Senator \nfrom Vermont put in this appropriations bill is left intact, but this \none proviso is there. When we try to use the argument you are not going \nto be able to get the Joint Chiefs and the CINCs to agree, if they \ndon't agree, I don't want to invoke this.\n  I will say, yes, that is the intent and the letter of this amendment. \nIt is very simple, and I can't imagine anyone will want to go on record \nsaying that we want to stop the use of any kind of landmines if it is \nnot in the best interest of our fighting troops over there as certified \nby the Joint Chiefs and the CINCs.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I can again ask the Senator from Oklahoma \nto yield, I certainly agree with that assessment. It seems to be a very \nreasonable proposition. I certainly hope our colleagues will agree with \nthe amendment because of that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  I would like to comment on a couple of other things. In addition to \nthe letter that was sent by the Joint Chiefs, here is a letter that was \nsent to the\n\n[[Page S9761]]\n\nPresident last July by 24 of the Nation's most distinguished retired \nfour-star ground combatant commanders, including a former Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, a former supreme allied commander, Secretary \nof State, six former combatants of the Marine Corps, two former Chiefs \nof Staff of the Army, two recipients of the Congressional Medal of \nHonor and four service Vice Chiefs of Staff.\n  This is what they said. A month ago this letter was received by the \nPresident:\n\n       Studies suggest that U.S. allied casualties may be \n     increased by as much as 35 percent if self-destructing mines \n     are unavailable, particularly in the halting phase--\n\n  The halting phase, we are talking about should the North Koreans come \ndown south of the DMZ, we would have a phase where we would not be as \nprepared.\n  They said:\n\n       --particularly in the halting phase of operations against \n     aggressors. Such a cost is especially unsupportable since the \n     type of mines utilized by U.S. forces and the manner in which \n     they are employed by those forces do not contribute to the \n     humanitarian problem that impels diplomatic and legislative \n     initiatives to ban APLs.\n\n  I find it difficult right now in light of what happened this last \nweek, in terms of the missiles that were launched from North Korea and \nthe accuracy of those missiles with two phases, that we can question \nwhether or not there is a threat out there.\n  These are the words that came from 24 of the Nation's most \ndistinguished retired four-star ground combatant officers.\n  They went on to say:\n\n       Unfortunately, a ban on future deployment of APLs will in \n     no way diminish the danger imposed by tens of millions of \n     dumb landmines that have been irresponsibly sown where they \n     inflict terror and devastation on civilian populations. Only \n     the United States military and those of other law-abiding \n     nations will be denied a means through the use of marked or \n     monitored mine fields of reducing the costs and increasing \n     the probability of victory in future conflicts.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the full text of the \nletter from the retired generals dated July 21, 1997, printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                  An Open Letter to President Clinton\n\n                                                    July 21, 1997.\n     Hon. William Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We write to express our strong \n     opposition to U.S. participation in any international \n     agreement that would prohibit the defensive use by American \n     forces of modern, self-destructing anti-personnel landmines \n     (APLs) and/or the use of so-called ``dumb mines'' in the \n     Korean demilitarized zone. In our experience, such \n     responsible use of APLs is not only consistent with the \n     Nation's humanitarian responsibilities; it is indispensable \n     to the safety of our troops in many combat and peacekeeping \n     situations.\n       We are also concerned about the implications of legislation \n     that would unilaterally deny the U.S. military the ability to \n     deploy any kind of anti-personnel landmines (except command-\n     detonated Claymores and, provisionally, those in the Korean \n     DMZ). We agree with the Joint Chiefs of Staff who have--as \n     stated by their Chairman, General John Shalikashvili--\n     declared that a legislatively imposed moratorium on APL use: \n     ``. . . constitutes an increased risk to the lives of U.S. \n     forces, particularly in Korea and Southwest Asia, and \n     threatens mission accomplishment. It is the professional \n     military judgment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the \n     geographic Combatant Commanders that the loss of APL which \n     occurs as a result of this moratorium, without a credible \n     offset, will result in unacceptable military risk to U.S. \n     forces.'' In fact, studies suggest that U.S./allied \n     casualties may be increased by as much as 35% if self-\n     destructing mines are unavailable--particularly in the \n     ``halting phase'' of operations against aggressors. Such a \n     cost is especially unsupportable since the type of mines \n     utilized by U.S. forces and the manner in which they are \n     employed by those forces do not contribute to the \n     humanitarian problem that impels diplomatic and legislative \n     initiatives to ban APLs.\n       Unfortunately, a ban on future deployments of APLs will in \n     no way diminish the danger posed by tens of millions of \n     ``dumb'' landmines that have been irresponsibly sown where \n     they will inflict terror and devastation on civilian \n     populations.

Mr. President, more recently, 16 of those generals have \nwritten a powerful open letter to the Senate opposing Senator Leahy's \neffort to legislate U.S. compliance with the Ottawa Treaty. They said \nin part:\n\n       In our experience as former senior military commanders of \n     American ground forces, such a decision would likely \n     translate into the needless and unjustifiable death of many \n     of this country's combat personnel and possibly jeopardize \n     our forces' ability to prevail on the battlefield.\n\n  I again ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter from \nthe generals dated June 16, 1997, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                      An Open Letter to the Senate\n\n                                                    June 16, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: We understand that the Senate may \n     shortly be asked to consider an amendment to the FY 1999 \n     Defense Authorization bill that would have the effect of \n     creating a statutory requirement for the U.S. military to \n     cease all use of anti-personnel landmines (APLs) by 2006, if \n     not before. In our professional opinion as former senior \n     commanders of American ground forces, such a decision would \n     likely translate into the needless and unjustifiable death of \n     many of this country's combat personnel--and possibly \n     jeopardize our forces' ability to prevail on the battlefield.\n       As you may know, we were among the twenty-four retired \n     four-star general officers who expressed to President Clinton \n     our concerns about such an initiative last summer. In an open \n     letter to the President dated July 21, 1997, we wrote: ``In \n     our experience, [the] responsible use of APLs is not only \n     consistent with the Nation's humanitarian responsibilities; \n     it is indispensable to the safety of our troops in many \n     combat and peacekeeping situations.'' The open letter went on \n     to note that:\n       ``Studies suggest that U.S./allied casualties may be \n     increased by as much as 35% if self-destructing mines are \n     unavailable--particularly in the `halting phase' of \n     operations against aggressors. Such a cost is especially \n     unsupportable since the type of mines utilized by U.S. forces \n     and the manner in which\n\n[[Page S9762]]\n\n     they are employed by those forces do not contribute to the \n     humanitarian problem that impels diplomatic and legislative \n     initiatives to ban APLs.\n       ``Unfortunately, a ban on future deployments of APLs will \n     in no way diminish the danger posed by tens of millions of \n     `dumb' landmines that have been irresponsibly sown where they \n     will inflict terror and devastation on civilian populations. \n     Detecting and clearing such mines should continue to receive \n     urgent attention from our government and others. The \n     unverifiability and unenforceability of a ban on production \n     of such devices, however, virtually ensures that this \n     practice will continue in the future. Only the U.S. \n     military--and those of other law-abiding nations--will be \n     denied a means, through the use of marked and monitored \n     minefields, of reducing the costs and increasing the \n     probability of victory in future conflicts.'' (Emphasis \n     added.)\n       We were deeply troubled to learn that President Clinton has \n     recently agreed to impose constraints on and, within a few \n     years, to ban outright the use of even self-destructing anti-\n     personnel landmines. This is all the more remarkable given \n     the opposition previously expressed by the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff and the Nation's Combatant Commanders to such \n     limitations and President Clinton's own statement of \n     September 17, 1997 when he announced his opposition to the \n     Ottawa treaty banning APLs, declaring:\n       ``As Commander-in-Chief, I will not send our soldiers to \n     defend the freedom of our people and the freedom of others \n     without doing everything we can to make them as secure as \n     possible. . . . There is a line that I simply cannot cross, \n     and that line is the safety and security of our men and women \n     in uniform.''\n       We urge you and your colleagues to reject any legislative \n     initiative that would have the effect of crossing the line--\n     whether by endorsing new ``operational concepts'' (read, \n     accepting more U.S. casualties) or other measures--that would \n     jeopardize the safety and security of our men and women in \n     uniform by impinging upon the U.S. military's ability to make \n     responsible use of self-destructing/self-deactivating anti-\n     personnel landmines and long-duration APLs in Korea.\n           Sincerely,\n         Robert H.

Mr. President, my concern here is that those individuals \nwho are concerned--genuinely concerned--about the problems that exist \nover there are concerned about damage that is inflicted by these \nlandmines, and certainly I am one of these individuals, are also \nconcerned about the saving of American lives. We certainly should not \ncontemplate doing so unless the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the unified \ncombatant commanders formally change their minds and agree such a step \ncan be taken without jeopardizing the U.S. forces.\n  I also have written a letter to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General Shelton. This is just in the last few days. I have a \nletter back from General Shelton in which he talks about his opinion. \nIn his response he said:\n\n       In your third question, you noted General Norman \n     Schwarzkopf, who has been widely portrayed as a supporter of \n     a complete ban on antipersonnel landmines, has been quoted in \n     an interview with the Baltimore Sun as saying, ``I favor a \n     ban on the dumb ones. Those are the ones that are causing \n     humanitarian problems. I think the smart ones are a military \n     capability we can use.''\n\n  Further quoting General Shelton, he said:\n\n       My view again is that our smart mixed ATAV munitions are \n     critical to our efforts to protect our men and women in the \n     field.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter also be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  U.S. Special Operations Command,\n\n\n                             Office of the Commander in Chief,\n\n                              Macdill AFB, FL, September 13, 1997.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: Thank you for your letter of 12 \n     September in which you state your concern about the \n     compatibility of the emerging Oslo treaty on anti-personnel \n     landmines (APL) with the military's requirements today and \n     for the foreseeable future. I appreciate the opportunity to \n     express my views on these issues as Commander in Chief, U.S. \n     Special Operations Command.\n       Your first question asked for my view on the importance of \n     retaining the Korean exemption, limiting the systems covered \n     by the treaty to those ``primarily designed'' for anti-\n     personnel purposes, and ensuring what we are able to continue \n     using self-destructing/self-deactivating APL when packaged \n     with anti-tank landmines.\n       In my view, each of those positions is critical. Anti-\n     personnel landmines are integral to the defense of the \n     Republic of Korea, and as long as there is risk of aggression \n     in Korea and we do not have suitable alternatives fielded, we \n     must ensure the best protection of our forces and those of \n     our allies. I also believe that an accurate definition of \n     anti-personnel (AP) landmines is essential to prevent the \n     banning of mixed munitions under the treaty. Finally, I \n     firmly believe that our anti-tank (AT) and anti-vehicle (AV) \n     munitions--which are mixed systems composed entirely of smart \n     AT and AP mines that self-destruct or self-deactivate in a \n     relatively short period of time--are vital to the protection \n     of our men and women in the field.\n       Your second question asked whether I thought a landmine ban \n     that did not accommodate these positions would be in the \n     national security interest of the United States. I do not. I \n     believe that any treaty to which the United States agrees \n     must ensure that these valid national security concerns are \n     adequately addressed.\n       In your third question, you noted that General Norman \n     Schwarzkopf--who has been widely portrayed as a supporter of \n     a complete ban on anti-personnel landmines--has been quoted \n     in an interview with the Baltimore Sun as saying: ``I favor a \n     ban on the dumb ones; those are the ones that are causing the \n     humanitarian problem. I think the smart ones are a military \n     capability we can use.'' You asked whether I agree with this \n     assessment.\n       My view, again is that our smart, mixed AT/AV munitions are \n     critical to our efforts to protect our men and women in the \n     field. As I noted earlier, these systems are composed \n     entirely of smart mines that self-destruct or self-deactivate \n     in a relatively short period of time. The military utility of \n     these systems is, in my mind, unquestionable. Beyond that, \n     however, I do want to reiterate that, because of the unique \n     situation on the Korean peninsula, non-self-destructing (NSD) \n     or ``dumb'' mines are essential to our commanders in the \n     Republic of Korea as long as there is risk of aggression and \n     we have not fielded suitable alternatives to the NSD mines \n     used in Korea.\n       In your final question, you asked whether I will work to \n     ensure that this capability is protected in any landmine \n     treaty the U.S. signs. In response, let me state again that I \n     firmly believe that any landmine treaty to which the United \n     States becomes party must ensure protection of ``smart'' \n     mixed systems.\n       As always, I appreciate your support of our men and women \n     in uniform. With all best wishes from Tampa,\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Henry H. Shelton,\n\n                                               General, U.S. Army,\n                                               Commander in Chief.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is very simple. It is not a \ncomplicated thing to deal with. It simply says that we take the \nlanguage that is supported and has been put in by the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont and add--I will read it one more time, these \nwords--\n\n       This subsection shall not apply unless the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff and the unified combatant commanders certify in writing \n     to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the \n     Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives that the signing of the Convention is \n     consistent with the combat requirements and safety of the \n     armed forces of the United States.\n\n  So it is a very straightforward and simple amendment. Quite frankly, \nI want to have the input of the military when these decisions are made.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will just respond briefly. Is the Senator speaking of \nholding onto landmines that the Joint Chiefs\n\n[[Page S9763]]\n\nhave already said they are prepared to give up? Command detonated \nlandmines are still available. We use those in Korea and elsewhere. \nNothing bans those in this treaty. And as for self-destruct mines, the \nPresident has already said the Pentagon will give them up outside Korea \nby 2003, and in Korea by 2006. The Pentagon has also said it is \nsearching aggressively for alternatives to the use of anti-personnel \nmines in mixed mine systems. These are self-destructing mines. So if \nthere are military officers who are saying they oppose finding \nalternatives to these mines, they are speaking out of school. That is \nnot consistent with the Pentagon's policy.\n  My friend from Arizona speaks of having the military's input. Of \ncourse we should have the military's input. If we were to sign any \ntreaty of this nature, we would. And we would require two-thirds of the \nSenators to vote for it before the President could even ratify such a \ntreaty.\n  A lot is made of Korea. Obviously we are concerned about the defense \nof Korea. But I say to my friends, talk to the former commander of our \nforces there, General Hollingsworth, or General Emerson. They say \nlandmines caused more problems for our forces than they solved. Our \nforces are highly mobile. You don't want to impede their mobility by \nsowing a lot of landmines around. But anyway, the Pentagon has already \nsaid it is going to find alternatives to landmines in Korea.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment on land \nmines to the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill offered by my \ncolleague, the Senator from Oklahoma. This amendment, which seeks to \npreserve for our military commanders a weapons system which, among \nother things, mitigates the manpower disadvantage American forces \nroutinely suffer, is needed now more than ever.\n  Every day seems to bring fresh evidence of two facts we have known to \nbe true for some time: First, that our military is currently too small \nand stretched too thin for the many missions assigned to it; and \nsecond, that the international security situation is more volatile than \nit has been in a generation. Both situations argue heavily in favor of \nthis amendment.\n  Even the most ardent defenders of our ongoing defense drawdowns \ncannot help but be alarmed at the sudden lack of trained manpower in \nour military. Recruiting goals are not being met and our long serving \nleaders--both officer and enlisted--are leaving the military in droves. \nOne government report after another finds that our front line units are \nchronically undermanned. Next to these disturbing facts, we see that \nthe situation in North Korea has recently taken a most frightening turn \nwith their launch of a two-stage ballistic missile directly over the \nJapanese Islands. Japan has pulled out of the Light Water Reactor \nagreement which was our only real hope of keeping North Korea from \nresuming their nuclear weapons development program. Between our under \nstrength military, and the new tension on the Korean Peninsula, it \ncould be said that it has been many years since our military forces in \nSouth Korea have been in such an insecure and tenuous position. It is \nnot idle hyperbole to say that South Koreans, and the forty thousand \nAmerican troops who live at the pointy end of the spear in that \ncountry, depend on land mines for their lives.\n  In light of these developments, I cannot think of a worse time to \npass a Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill that includes a provision \nwhich would facilitate the signing of the Convention of the Prohibition \nof anti-personnel land mines, quote--``as soon as practicable.''--\nunquote. A harmless sounding passage to be sure, but one which, in the \nhands of an administration prone to trading our national security for \nparchment, could be interpreted as clearance to sign that dangerous \npiece of paper.\n  Senator Inhofe's amendment would simply require that, before the \nadministration signed any treaty that would take this critically \nimportant weapons system from our military, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nalong with the Commanders in Chief of the various Combat Commands, \ncertify that they can accomplish their missions without it.\n  Not in the last two decades have tensions been so high in that part \nof the world, Mr. President. It would seem that every possible factor \nis now conspiring to place our troops on the precipice: Our military is \nundermanned and underfunded; our diplomatic initiatives with the \nworld's totalitarian regimes are breaking down everywhere; ballistic \nmissile and nuclear weapons technology is proliferating at breakneck \nspeed; and in Asia, the terrible economic situation there only serves \nto raise tensions and reduce available peaceful alternatives. I cannot \nenvision a worse time to be taking military options away from our \ncommanders in the field. But let me be clear: Even under the best of \ncircumstances I would be against any attempt to take away military \noptions from those commanders. And I will feel this way with particular \nregard to anti-personnel land mines until the proponents of this ban \ncan give me a cogent answer to a simple question: How will taking self-\ndestructing, self-deactivating land mines away from the United States \nmilitary save one life in Angola, Cambodia or Afghanistan? Until I get \na clear answer to that question, I will continue to defend our military \nfrom these misguided attempts to eliminate the means by which they \naccomplish the missions America deems fit to assign them, in the safest \npossible way. I support this amendment from the Senator from Oklahoma, \nand I encourage my colleagues to do so as well.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLautenberg be added as an original cosponsor of amendment No. 3516, \noriginal cosponsor of amendment No. 3514, and amendment No. 3520.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Kentucky, the \ndistinguished chairman of the subcommittee, on the floor, so I yield to \nhim.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my colleague from Vermont, we have--I hate to \ninterrupt the debate on this amendment, but we have a unanimous consent \nagreement that has been cleared on both sides limiting the amendments. \nIf it is all right with them, I would like to propound that at this \nparticular time.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the \nremainder of the Senate's consideration of S. 2334, the following \namendments be the only remaining first-degree amendments, other than \nthe pending amendment, in order and subject to relevant second degrees. \nI further ask that following the disposition of the listed amendments, \nthe bill be advanced to third reading and a vote occur on passage of S. \n2334, all without intervening action or debate.\n  The amendments listed, Mr. President, are two by Senator Brownback, \none on Iran, one on Georgia; two by Senator Coverdell, one relevant, \none on Black Hawk helicopters; Senator Craig, four relevant; Senator \nCoats on North Korea; Senator DeWine on Haiti, drugs, and Africa, three \nof them; Senator Faircloth on world economic conference; Senator \nHutchison on North Korea; the Senator Inhofe amendment, which is \npending, on landmines; Senator Kyl, IMF; two amendments by the majority \nleader; two amendments on North Korea by the Senator from Arizona, \nSenator McCain; two relevant amendments by myself; and one by Senator \nShelby, and the pending Specter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. There are some more.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Sorry, Mr. President. There is another page, \nincluding, interestingly enough, all the Democratic amendments. What an \noversight.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I knew you wanted to make sure those were in before you \nasked for unanimous consent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Conditions for the Use of Quota Resources.--\n     (a) None of the funds appropriated in this Act under the \n     heading ``United States Quota, International Monetary Fund'' \n     may be obligated, transferred or made available to the \n     International Monetary Fund until 30 days after the Secretary \n     of the Treasury certifies that the Board of Executive \n     Directors of the Fund have agreed by resolution that stand-by \n     agreements or other arrangements regarding the use of Fund \n     resources shall include provisions requiring the borrower--\n       (1) to comply with the terms of all international trade \n     obligations and agreements of which the borrower is a \n     signatory;\n       (2) to eliminate the practice or policy of government \n     directed lending or provision of subsidies to favored \n     industries, enterprises, parties, or institutions; and\n       (3) to guarantee non-discriminatory treatment in debt \n     resolution proceedings between domestic and foreign \n     creditors, and for debtors and other concerned persons.\n\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I advise the Senator from Vermont that this is the original \ncommittee language.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I apologize to my friend from Arizona. I \nhad been momentarily distracted. I thought it was an amendment to the \nInhofe amendment. I did not realize that had been set aside. I would \nnot have required the reading of the amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. That is quite all right. I am happy to make that \nclarification.\n  At this time I would like to yield to the Senator from Indiana for \nthe purpose of laying down an amendment and making his statement on \nthat amendment before I make my statement on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I will soon send an amendment to the desk \nand then have it set aside. It doesn't have anything to do with \nlandmines, but I would be happy to have the clerk read it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3523\n\n (Purpose: To reallocate funds provided to the Korean Peninsula Energy \n    Development Organization to be available only for antiterrorism \n                              assistance)\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3523.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 31, line 7, strike ``and'' and all that follows \n     through ``(KEDO)'' on line 9.\n       Beginning on page 32, strike line 10 and all that follows \n     through line 24 on page 33 and insert the following: ``That, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, of the funds \n     appropriated under this heading not less than $56,000,000 \n     shall be available only for antiterrorism assistance under \n     chapter 8 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961.''.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I want to speak on a broader subject. I \nwant to take a few moments to discuss what has been a dramatic change \nin administration policy regarding the war on terrorism. According to \nthe administration's chronology of Osama bin Laden's terrorist attacks \nagainst U.S. facilities or U.S. citizens, this individual is connected \nin one way or another to a series of disturbing terrorist incidents. \nThis chronology, by the way, was offered by our National Security \nAdvisor, Mr. Berger. I am taking this from that chronology of terrorist \nincidents. He has conspired to kill U.S. servicemen in Yemen in 1992. \nHe plotted the deaths of American and other peacekeepers in Somalia in \n1993. He assisted Egyptian terrorists who tried to assassinate Egyptian \nPresident Mubarak in 1995. He conducted a car bombing against the \nEgyptian Embassy in Pakistan in 1995. He plotted to blow up U.S. \nairliners in the Pacific and separately conspired to kill the Pope. He \nbombed a joint U.S. and Saudi military training mission in Riyadh in \n1995. He issued a declaration of war against the United States in \nAugust of 1996. He stated, ``If someone can kill an American soldier, \nit is better than wasting time on other matters.'' In February of this \nyear, Osama bin Laden stated, he declared his intention to attack--his \nnetwork--their intention to attack Americans and our allies, including \ncitizens, civilians, anywhere in the world. And as we all know, last \nmonth he has been directly linked to the bombing of U.S. Embassies in \nDar Es Salaam and Nairobi.\n  Two weeks after this latest tragic incident, the U.S. launched a \nmissile strike against one of bin Laden's facilities in Afghanistan, as \nwell as against a Sudanese facility, which received initial financing \nfrom a bin Laden enterprise.\n  I, along with most Americans, welcome this administration's change in \npolicy as a necessary and long overdue response. However, it is not to \nsay that there weren't legitimate questions raised concerning the \ntiming of this attack--I was one of those who raised such questions--\nand the timing of this policy change, coming as it did during the \nPresident's personal crisis. I was concerned that this sea change, this \ndramatic change in policy, might be misunderstood or misinterpreted by \nboth allies and foes alike, thereby damaging and undermining the \ncredibility of this administration's newly declared policy against \nterrorism.\n  Make no mistake, Mr. President, it is appropriate to respond whenever \ninnocent Americans are attacked in acts of political terrorism. The \nalternative serves only to encourage those who seek to do us harm in \npursuit of their private agendas. I caution, however, that we must also \nbe certain of our targets and political objectives, and careful to make \nsure that our response is to reinforce and not undermine our policies.\n  Clearly, the U.S. strike and the administration's characterization of \nit as a ``war on terrorism'' is a notable departure from the policies \nand actions of the past several years. Rightly or wrongly, the Khobar \nTowers incident stands out as an example of U.S. inaction in the face \nof recent terrorist attacks.\n  Certainly the Khobar Towers investigation has been delayed and \ncomplicated by the need for close cooperation with the Saudi \nGovernment. But the current White House crisis raises serious doubts \nfor our allies and gives fuel to our adversaries whose focus is likely \nto be the difference in the U.S. response to the deaths of American \nmilitary personnel at Khobar and those in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam. \nThere may very well be justification for the difference in response, \nbut it clearly signals a change in policy and, for many of us, a \nwelcome change in policy.\n  More worrisome is that this newfound inclination to military action \nagainst terrorist organizations bears no resemblance whatsoever to the \nadministration's so-called foreign policy priorities concerning rogue \nnations, such as Iraq and North Korea.\n  On February 17, 1998, President Clinton addressed the Nation. He \nsaid, ``. . .this is not a time free from peril, especially as a result \nof reckless acts of outlaw nations and an unholy axis of terrorists, \ndrug traffickers and organized international criminals * * * and they \nwill be all the more lethal if we allow them to build arsenals of \nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons\n\n[[Page S9765]]\n\nand the missiles to deliver them. We simply cannot allow that to \nhappen. There is no more clear example of this threat than Saddam \nHussein's Iraq. His regime threatens the safety of his people, \nstability of his region and the safety of all the rest of us.''\n\n  Yet, Mr. President, in the last few months, this administration has \nmade what many see as a mockery of the inspection regime in Iraq, has \nfailed to respond to the intelligence of an active nuclear program in \nNorth Korea, and has clearly allowed the North Koreans to continue to \nbuild a delivery system which will be capable of reaching the United \nStates in its next phase of development.\n  The President himself said last February that ``we have no business \nagreeing to any resolution of [the Iraqi crisis] that does not include \nfree, unfettered access to the remaining sites by people who have \nintegrity and proven competence in the inspection business.''\n  This is a critical statement, one which I think bears repeating.\n  The President himself said last February that ``we''--meaning the \nUnited States--``have no business agreeing to any resolution of [the \nIraqi crisis] that does not include free, unfettered access to the \nremaining sites by people who have integrity and proven competence in \nthe inspection business.''\n  Yet, just last week, the lead inspector of the United States resigned \nin disgust at the pressure the Clinton administration has brought to \nbear to explicitly undercut the very inspection regime which the \nPresident said we have no business in changing. In his resignation \nletter, Scott Ritter, that inspector--someone who does have proven \nintegrity and proven competence in the inspection business--said this:\n\n       Iraq has lied to the special commission and the world since \n     day one concerning the true scope and nature of its \n     proscribed programs and weapons systems. This lie has been \n     perpetuated over the years through systematic acts of \n     concealment. . . . the commission has uncovered indisputable \n     proof of a systematic concealment mechanism, run by the \n     President of Iraq, and protected by the Presidential security \n     forces. . . .\n       The current decision by the Security Council and the \n     Secretary General, backed at least implicitly by the United \n     States, to seek a diplomatic alternative to inspection-driven \n     confrontation with Iraq, a decision which constitutes a \n     surrender to the Iraqi leadership . . . has succeeded in \n     thwarting the stated will of the United Nations.\n       The illusion of arms control is more dangerous than no arms \n     control at all. What is being propagated by the Security \n     Council today in relation to the work of the special \n     commission is such an illusion, one which in all good faith I \n     cannot, and will not, be a party to. I have no other option \n     than to resign from my position here at the commission \n     effective immediately.\n\n  That is a strong statement, Mr. President. It is a strong statement \nmade by one who has a reputation for impeccable integrity and for total \ncompetence in the inspection business. Yet, he believed that his \nability to carry out his assigned duties and his mission was undermined \nby the United Nations Security Council, with the implicit support of \nthe U.S. Government, and he felt that the only course of action he had \nwas to resign.\n  Clearly, last month's strikes are a substantial change from the \nadministration's largely restrained reactions to previous terrorist \nattacks on Americans. To be fair, circumstances and the need to \ncooperate with foreign governments were behind some of that earlier \nreticence.\n  The President said: We must be prepared to do all that we can for as \nlong as we can.\n  There is no question that we will face attempts at reprisal over \nyears and years. This is something that seems all the more certain \ngiven the reports that bin Laden has offered bounties for terrorist \nactions resulting in the deaths of Americans. So we, indeed, must be \nprepared to act for as long as we must.\n  But we must recognize that in our endeavor to defeat terrorists, \nperhaps to a greater extent than ever before, our success will depend \nupon the ability to gather friends and allies together in a common \nstruggle against this common enemy. Trust is the essential element in \nthis equation. So it is imperative that the President of the United \nStates be capable of establishing and maintaining the level of trust \nnecessary to execute a successful policy against terrorism.\n  At the same time, we will need to increase our readiness to defend \nagainst the wide range of potential attacks on our citizens and \ninterests as well as those of our friends and allies anywhere in the \nworld.\n  Our planning and strategy must be sustainable over the long run. We \nneed to find cheaper and more effective methods to attack terrorist \ninfrastructures and planning. It seems woefully obvious that the use of \ncostly weapons and defensive measures will have to be restricted to \ncorrespondingly grievous affects. Osama bin Laden unquestionably \npresents a significant and demonstrated threat to U.S. interests. But \nsurely nations such as Iraq and North Korea represent a substantially \ngreater magnitude of threat to our vital national interests. Moreover, \nthese nations have demonstrated an intent to develop, and in the case \nof Iraq employ, weapons of mass destruction. Worse yet, these states \nseem willing to transfer such technology to other nations or groups who \nintend to use it against the United States and our allies.\n  Secretary Albright declared that ``the risk that leaders of a rogue \nstate will use nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons against us or \nour allies is the greatest security threat we face.''\n  That statement does not square with the allocation of national \nsecurity resources to operations in Haiti, Somalia, and Bosnia. It may \nbe that these latter operations should enjoy some measure of emphasis. \nBut, lacking a coherent foreign policy and corresponding national \nsecurity strategy, it is difficult to judge and even more difficult to \ntrust the rationale we are giving for our involvement in these \noperations.\n  If leaders of these rogue states--Iraq and Korea--do pose, as \nSecretary Albright has said, the greatest security threat that we and \nour allies face, then we must ask legitimate questions about the \ndeployment of our security resources and national security assets in \nplaces of lesser importance, unless, of course, we are willing to \nsupport both in a measure necessary to be prepared and to accomplish \nboth objectives at the same time.\n  Mr. President, let's take this new-found determination to combat \nterrorism, as declared by the President, at face value. In doing so, it \nis important, then, that the call to action must be more than mere \nrhetoric. It is important that the President articulate his policy and \naccording strategy as well as initiate development of the capabilities \nthat will be needed to affect that strategy. The current upside-down \npriorities wherein all too limited U.S. defense resources are spent on \nwhat are surely less critical operations in Bosnia and elsewhere need \nto be examined to reflect the serious threat to U.S. national interests \nthat terrorism comprises, whether by rogue nations, states-sponsored \ngroups, or actions of independents like bin Laden.\n  Yet the question remains: What are the Nation's capabilities to \nexecute this administration's change in foreign policy about terrorism? \nWhat has been done to enhance the interagency process to address the \ntransnational threat of terrorism? Has the administration developed the \nintelligence capabilities and the military capabilities to support this \npolicy?\n\n  Some of our friends and allies rightly express the concern that the \nClinton administration has not addressed some of these key issues, and \nthat, therefore, when the United States starts to find out how hard and \nhow expensive it is to pursue a long-term effort against terrorism, we \nwill lose resolve and not sustain our efforts.\n  Many of us fear that the administration will merely add the military \ntasks associated with counterterrorism to the Pentagon's already \nstretched list of missions, and will do so without providing the \nadditional funding required. In short, we will throw yet another rock \nin the military's already overflowing rucksack and expect them to \nshoulder the burden with the same budget and the same forces.\n  We must recognize the risk of pursuing such an approach with our \nmilitary, a military that is currently ill-matched to this threat. \nMilitary budgets and force structure are down 35 percent to 40 percent \nsince the cold war; while at the same time our peacetime commitments \nare up several hundred percent.\n  And perhaps most importantly, defense procurement is down nearly 70 \npercent from the Reagan administration when this Nation developed the\n\n[[Page S9766]]\n\nmodernized, professional military that was victorious in the cold war. \nBut we have been living off the Reagan buildup for nearly a decade, and \nthe procurement holiday is over.\n  The average age of our fleet of aircraft, ships, tanks, and trucks \nand other equipment has been increasing year by year, and our forces \nare having a difficult time maintaining that equipment. This is a major \nsource of the readiness problems confronted by our military today.\n  Yet, year after year this administration's budget falls short of its \ngoal of procurement. And I project it will fall short again.\n  Significantly, the report of the National Defense Panel last December \nhighlighted that this administration needs to provide $5 billion to $10 \nbillion a year to transform our military so that our Nation can \nleverage advances in technology and will be prepared to address what \nare envisioned to be the fundamentally different operational challenges \nin the 21st century. One of those, and perhaps the most important of \nthose, is terrorism.\n  In short, we still have a military designed to fight the conventional \nwars of the past, and it is poorly prepared to conduct this war on \nterrorism. Transformation to a national security posture necessary to \naddress the threats of the future is necessary and cannot be \nsuccessfully accomplished without a reallocation of resources and a \nrevision of policy.\n  I, therefore, urge the President to prepare this Nation for this \nprolonged conflict against terrorism, but in doing so use more than \njust strong words, but prepare us in a way so that we have the \nresources in place to successfully account for this threat and protect \nthe American people.\n  We face a range of threats and potential defensive strategies. Some \nof the latter could affect traditional American freedoms.\n  At the very least, there should be an open and serious debate over \nhow far we can go, or how far we should go, in altering the security \nenvironment in America and at our facilities abroad. Although an \neasily-defended fortress sounds like a good idea for diplomatic \nsecurity, it also restricts the very access that effective diplomacy \noften requires. And we must recognize this.\n  Mr. President, we face a difficult road in pursuit of a war on \nterrorism.\n  Like other Americans, I am committed to the elimination of this \nscourge of terrorism. But I cannot help but be somewhat skeptical of \nthe administration's determination and their commitment, and \nunfortunately I fear that we will find few allies willing to risk their \nsecurity and reputations on the strength of the current \nadministration's say so. The ``say so'' must be followed with the ``do \nso.''\n  Mr. President, hidden beneath the headlines of the last 2 weeks was \nyet another explosive revelation. North Korea has reportedly had as \nmany as 15,000 people working to build what some suggest is a nuclear \nreactor or fuel reprocessing facility buried deep within a mountain.\n  This, despite what the administration has touted as a landmark \nagreement stopping North Korea's nuclear weapons research and \ndevelopment program in exchange for food, energy, and the promise of \ntwo new light-water reactor power plants.\n  The State Department, by stating that it sees no nefarious intent \nbecause the concrete for this facility has not yet been poured, is \nasking us to trust their assessment of the situation. Only 6 months \nago, the President certified to Congress that ``North Korea is \ncomplying with the provisions of the Agreed Framework'' and ``has not \nsignificantly diverted assistance provided by the United States for \npurposes for which it was not intended.''\n  We are now told by administration officials that this new facility \nshould not be considered a ``deal-breaker'' because its completion \n``will take half a decade or more.''\n  To add insult to injury, we have learned that North Korea has test \nfired a 1,200-mile-ranged ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean, \noverflying Japan. And they did so just days after the Joint Chiefs \nissued their commentary on the Rumsfeld report in which they reasserted \nthe administration's claims that there currently is no imminently \ndiscernible ballistic missile threat warranting a national missile \ndefense. They state, moreover, their confidence that our intelligence \ncommunity would provide ample warning to permit meeting such a threat \nin the context of the President's 3+3 strategy.\n  North Korea's test launch of this ballistic missile has demonstrated \nthe truth of that old adage that actions speak louder than words. \nDoesn't the testing of a two-stage ballistic missile suggest that there \nis something for us to be worried about? How much harder can it be to \nlaunch a three-stage system capable of reaching the United States?\n  I am not nearly as cynical about our intelligence capabilities as \nsome, and so it is not idle curiosity when I wonder out loud whether \nthe State Department officials knew, as the Pentagon did, that North \nKorea was planning a missile test. And if so, did the State Department \nraise this issue with the North Koreans during last week's meetings on \nvarious subjects including that of the underground nuclear-related \nfacility?\n  I can tell you that whatever the answer, it does not reflect well on \nthe administration or the Secretary of State. Secretary Albright's \ncomments yesterday that the test is ``something that we will be raising \nwith the North Koreans in the talks that are currently going on,'' are \nless than inspiring and they fail to address the essential issue of \nwhat the U.S. did or might have tried to do to forestall this test.\n  Mr. President, I have sent an amendment to the desk. I have asked for \nit to be set aside. It addresses the question of the funding that is in \nthis appropriation for North Korea related to development of \nnonthreatening nuclear facilities. Given the evidence and the \ninformation that we now have, these funds would be much better used on \ncounterterrorism efforts, and this amendment seeks to transfer the \nfunds for that purpose.\n  I will be debating this amendment at a later time. And I understand \ntwo amendments currently have been offered and are awaiting a vote at \nsome time in the future. But I want to alert my colleagues that I think \nthis situation in North Korea is critical. I think the continuation of \nthe current administration policy in this regard, in transferring U.S. \ntax dollars in accord with an agreement that was designed to terminate \nNorth Korean involvement in development of any nuclear facilities that \ncould be used for purposes other than providing power to their nation \nis a serious matter. I don't think continuation of funds for that \npurpose is appropriate. I think that money is much better used to help \nprepare us to implement the administration's new policy on the war on \nterrorism, and we will be discussing that amendment at some point in \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I understand we will now hear from the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, but I wanted to notify Senators that following \nSenator McCain's presentation, it will be our intention to move to a \nvote with relation to the Specter amendment No. 3506 as quickly as \npossible, so that Senators might know that a vote following Senator \nMcCain's presentation is pending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Coats amendment \nis set aside. The Senator is now recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3500, as modified\n\n(Purpose: To restrict the availability of certain funds for the Korean \n    Peninsula Energy Development Organization unless an additional \n                           condition is met)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk in the \nnature of a substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCAIN], for himself, Mr. \n     Helms, and Mr. Murkowski, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3500, as modified.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9767]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 33, line 4, before the colon insert the following: \n     ``; and (4) North Korea is not actively pursuing the \n     acquisition or development of a nuclear capability (other \n     than the light-water reactors provided for by the 1994 Agreed \n     Framework Between the United States and North Korea) and is \n     fully meeting its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I offer an amendment on behalf of myself \nand Senator Helms and Senator Murkowski pertaining to recent events in \nNorth Korea:\n  The announcement that U.S. intelligence has discovered a very sizable \nunderground construction project in the mountains northeast of the \nnuclear complex at Yongbyon, and Monday's firing of an intermediate-\nrange ballistic missile over Japanese territory.\n  Later I intend to propose another amendment expressing the sense of \nCongress that North Korea should be forcefully condemned for such an \nopenly belligerent act while the United Nations is once again debating \ncooperative arrangements with the Stalinist regime in Pyongyang.\n  This amendment adds to the certification requirements a Presidential \ncertification that North Korea is not pursuing a nuclear weapons \ncapability. The distinction between what is currently in the bill and \nthe provision in this amendment is crucial as it addresses new \nactivities as opposed to those already identified and incorporated into \nthe 1994 Agreed Framework.\n  Mr. President, it is instructive to go back in time and review the \nhistory of North-South relations on the Korean peninsula. Last summer, \nI came to the floor and submitted for the Record a comprehensive list \ncompiled by the Congressional Research Service of North Korean \nprovocations since its inception following the Second World War. That \nlist detailed numerous terrorist acts, intelligence-related submarine \nincursions into South Korean territory, kidnappings of Japanese \nnationals for intelligence purposes, and armed incursions across the \ndemilitarized zone.\n  At that point, I noted that the list illuminated an extraordinarily \nconsistent North Korean pattern of alternating minor and manipulative \ngestures of goodwill with acts of terror and provocation toward its \nSouth Korean neighbor. To that list, we can now add new provocations \ntowards Japan and the United States.\n  And make no mistake--Monday's missile firing was a message to the \nJapanese and to us that North Korea can strike our vital interests \nthroughout the region. Japan's declaration of intent to terminate \nfunding in support of the Agreed Framework should be supported and \nfollowed in kind by the United States.\n  At the time I spoke last summer, yet another North Korea-instigated \nborder altercation had just transpired. Go back and look at the \nnewspaper headlines pertaining to Korea at that time. The July 15, \n1997, Washington Post included an article titled ``U.S. Says it Will \nDouble Food Aid to North Korea.'' The following day, wire stories were \nheadlined ``Korea-Border Gunfire Exchanged.'' That contrast is \ndiscouragingly consistent. Offers to agree to negotiate a final peace \nagreement with the South or provisions of food aid for North Korea's \nstarving people regularly alternate with serious, often bloody \ntransgressions against the South. But, the missile firing, while not \nentirely unexpected, expands significantly the scale of the threat to \nregional peace and stability posed by North Korea.\n  At the time the Agreed Framework was signed in October 1994, I \nexpressed grave misgivings about its viability. I spoke at length on \nthe floor of the Senate regarding North Korea's abysmal record of \ncompliance with its previous commitments regarding its nuclear weapons \nprogram, listing nine such violations. Further, I emphasized the danger \nof an agreement that failed to adequately provide for full inspections \nof current and past nuclear sites, as well as of future such \nactivities, prior to the provision of assistance to the North Koreans. \nFour years and $86 million later, we are no more confident than we have \never been about North Korea's intentions and capabilities in the \nnuclear realm. I predicted back then that North Korea would violate the \nspirit and the letter of the Agreed Framework, and I believe today that \nI was correct.\n  A North Korean nuclear weapons capability is one of the most \ndangerous scenarios imaginable, and it's entirely possible such a \ncapability already exists. Bribing hostile, totalitarian regimes to not \ntake steps deleterious to our best interests seldom succeed, as the \nvery nature of such regimes is what makes them worrisome and unworthy \nof the kind of trust the 1994 agreement demands.\n  That is why the underground construction project is so troubling. Its \nprecise nature is still a matter of speculation, but one thing is \ncertain: North Korea does not have a history of concealing and \nprotecting cultural activities and fast food restaurants. It does have \na history of building underground military installations, including for \nthe construction of ballistic missiles. North Korea does not deserve \nthe benefit of the doubt. We have no option other than to assume that \nthe excavation activities northeast of Yongbyon are designed with \nhostile intent.\n  I will not mince words or phrase my beliefs diplomatically. I do not \nhave confidence the administration has in the past or will in the \nfuture handle North Korea with the firmness and resolve necessary to \nprevent the development of the most ominous of scenarios.\n  One U.S. official was quoted in 1996 with respect to the North \nKoreans as stating, ``They owe us some good behavior so we can continue \nto engage them.'' Mr. President, that is precisely the problem with the \nAdministration's approach to North Korea. It ignores the underlying \nreality that the North Korean regime is inherently hostile and \nexceedingly belligerent. Temporary expressions of goodwill have not and \nwill not translate into the kind of fundamental transformations in that \nregime necessary for us to ever have confidence that it will not \nexploit our goodwill. Any efforts of the international community to \nalleviate the suffering that North Korea itself has caused its people \nwill be misused to allow it to maintain a military force that ensures \nthe Korean peninsula will remain the most heavily fortified border in \nthe world.\n  Missile firings such as North Korea conducted only occur within the \ncontext of relations on the brink of war. That does not mean that I \nbelieve a North Korean attack is imminent. I have no such belief. The \nnature of the act, however, should be interpreted very cautiously. \nDuring the height of the cold war, the Soviet Union launched missiles \naimed directly at the Hawaiian Islands. During the peak of a crisis \nwith Libya, Mu'ammar Qhadafi launched a missile that impacted near \nMalta. And most recently, China fired missiles perilously close to \nTaiwan in response to the latter's pending democratic elections. And \nnow we can add to the list Pyongyang's launching of a Taepo Dong I \nmissile against Japan and, presumably, against U.S. forces stationed \nthere and in Guam.\n  If the new underground complex being constructed in North Korea is, \nin fact, for the purpose of establishing a new nuclear weapons complex, \nthe testing of the missile takes on an even more ominous tone. As some \nanalysts have pointed out, a series of missiles like the Taepo Dong-\nclass only make sense when armed with weapons of mass destruction. Even \nthe psychological ramifications of these missiles stems entirely from \nNorth Korea's eventual ability to arm them with nuclear, chemical or \nbiological warheads. We cannot afford to minimize the potential threat \nthis new complex represents.\n  The other countries I have mentioned that launched missiles under \ncrisis circumstances or, in the case of the Soviet Union, within the \ncontext of greatly heightened tensions, were largely deterrable. They \ncould, we calculated, be dissuaded from taking that final step into the \nabyss. Far less certain is the calculus involving the North Korean \ngovernment. There is no reason to believe that the regime of Kim Jong \nIl is susceptible to the kind of delicate maneuvering and counter \nmaneuvering\n\n[[Page S9768]]\n\ncharacteristic of relationships predicated upon a balance of terror. On \nthe contrary, we are dealing with the most unpredictable regime on \nearth.\n  Critics of missile defenses like to point out that deterrence through \nthreat of retaliation is all that is needed to dissuade an opponent \nfrom crossing the ambiguous line that would trigger an overwhelming \nU.S. response, including our use of nuclear weapons. Saddam Hussein was \nultimately deterred from employing chemical weapons against U.S. and \ncoalition forces during Operation Desert Storm by the implied threat of \na U.S. nuclear response. Ignored by such critics, however, are \nhistorically important incidences where dictatorial regimes struck out \nin anger and defiance against the logic of deterrence. A defeated \nGermany fired missiles against England designated ``V'' for \n``Vengeance,'' and an equally defeated Iraq similarly lashed out \nagainst Israel with a barrage of missile attacks.\n  North Korea is a defeated country in terms of the level of famine and \nthe utterly wretched condition of its society. Its willingness to \nstrike out irrationally must be assumed. That is why I offer these \namendments here today. That is why I once again come to the floor of \nthe Senate to decry this administration and the United Nation's \nhandling of relations with North Korea. The situation on the Korean \npeninsula is too inflammatory, the North Korean regime too \nunpredictable and violent for Congress to take anything other than the \nstrongest measures to demonstrate our resolve to confront the threat \naccordingly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the following articles be \nprinted in the Record: The Washington Post, Tuesday, September 1, \n``North Korea's Defiance''; today's, September 1, Wall Street Journal, \n``Pyongyang's Provocation''; New York Times, Wednesday, August 19, \n``North Korea's Nuclear Ambitions''; and August 24, a Washington Post \neditorial entitled ``Politics of Blackmail.''\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 1, 1998]\n\n                         North Korea's Defiance\n\n       North Korea is outdoing itself. In barely a week's time it \n     has been caught building a secret underground nuclear \n     facility, and now it has conducted a test of a new longer-\n     distance missile. The North Koreans even had the effrontery \n     and the foolishness to fire the second stage of this missile \n     across sovereign Japanese soil--an unmistakable attempt to \n     intimidate a nervous neighbor and, indirectly, its patrons.\n       The Stalinist regime's purpose seems clear. As it \n     acknowledges, it has little else of value to export except \n     the weapons it has accumulated to sustain its self-isolating \n     hedgehog pose. Its missile exports, put at $1 billion a year, \n     go to the rule-breaking countries, including Iraq, Iran, \n     Syria and Pakistan. The negotiation on freezing its bomb \n     capabilities that it has been conducting with a group of \n     countries led by the United States amounts to a demand that \n     it be paid off for doing the wrong thing--for rule-breaking. \n     It becomes an increasingly keen question whether American \n     accession to such a demand would be more of an incentive to \n     cheat or to comply.\n       Ordinarily, in a negotiation, the arbitrary and hostile \n     raising of the stakes by one party, which is what North Korea \n     is doing, would be taken as a sign of bad faith and would \n     cast into doubt the party's commitment to the stated goals of \n     the negotiation. In this case the North Koreans are able to \n     argue that Japan and South Korea and the European Union, as \n     well as the United States, have been slow to pay as promised \n     for the light-water nuclear power reactors and the fuel oil \n     that make it possible for Pyongyang to renounce its nuclear \n     ambitions. But what slows those countries down is less bad \n     faith than understandable cash-flow problems and, at root, \n     the sickening feeling that North Korea is playing them for a \n     fool.\n       Some suggest that the anti-proliferation countries should \n     be more sympathetic to the political requirements of Kim Jong \n     Il as he reaches to consummate the transition from heir \n     apparent to leader in his own right. This is absurd. The \n     leadership of North Korea, whatever it is, has assumed \n     national compliance obligations which, if they are not fully \n     binding, are valueless. The notion that North Korea's \n     defiance is a device intended to extract concessions from \n     Washington may have some truth to it. It puts an extra burden \n     on the Clinton administration to show that no concessions are \n     available by that route. If that threatens to upend the whole \n     negotiation--and it may--then North Korea alone will have to \n     account for it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 1, 1998]\n\n                        Pyongyang's Provocation\n\n       North Korea test-fired a new long-range ballistic missile \n     over Japan Monday, prompting some stern words from Tokyo, but \n     earning rewards from almost everyone else concerned. That's \n     the way it works these days. Only last week, Washington and \n     Seoul told North Korea that its suspected new nuclear weapons \n     plant does not violate a 1994 agreement freezing the North's \n     bomb program. If building more nukes is no big deal, who's \n     going to complain about a few missiles to deliver them with?\n       Among other things, lobbing a Daepodong I into the Pacific \n     was probably an advertisement by the world's leading missile \n     supplier to some of the world's scariest customers, including \n     Iraq, Iran, Syria and Pakistan. It also may have been a kind \n     of giant birthday candle ahead of next week's 50th \n     anniversary of North Korea's founding, and the possible \n     accession of dictator Kim Jong II to the presidency. Most \n     certainly, North Korea was telling the U.S., South Korea and \n     other partners in the ill-starred nuclear power plant and oil \n     giveaway consortium--also known as KEDO--that if those gifts \n     aren't forthcoming soon, there's always another missile in \n     Pyongyang's pipeline.\n       It worked. Within hours of splashdown--originally reported \n     to be in the Sea of Japan--Seoul promised to pay 70% of the \n     $4.6 billion cost of building North Korea two nuclear power \n     plants, and Washington eagerly reconfirmed a pledge to \n     arrange the financing needed. Japan spoiled the party by \n     refusing to sign on for $1 billion of the reactor costs. But \n     what should upset Tokyo most is how Bill Clinton has ensured \n     that the U.S.--and by extension Japan and America's other \n     allies--has no hope of an effective theater missile defense \n     anytime soon. Looking around at the world today, in fact, it \n     would appear that millions survive only because no crazed \n     dictator or terrorist gang has got around to targeting them.\n       At the state level, it is difficult to think of any outrage \n     that invites punishment these days. India and Pakistan, for \n     instance, are under patchy sanctions for testing nuclear \n     weapons last spring. But the countries and regions where \n     killing sprees are under way or threatened (Kosovo, Congo, \n     Sudan come immediately to mind) have generated little more \n     than handwringing.\n       The Clinton Administration did interrupt its long streak of \n     inaction recently by firing some missiles at terrorist \n     training facilities in Afghanistan and a factory in Sudan \n     said to be manufacturing chemical warfare components. At \n     the same time, however, we learned that the United States \n     was taking quite a different approach to Iraq's suspected \n     chemical warfare program, and many have been calling off \n     U.N. inspections of Saddam's facilities in an effort to \n     avoid a messy confrontation either with America's allies \n     or with the dictator Washington was vowing to bomb into \n     oblivion only six months ago.\n       Although an American inspector with the U.N. team resigned \n     in disgust last week, there is no sign that his gesture of \n     displeasure with both U.N. and U.S. prevaricating over Iraq \n     will change the status quo. In one of the most bizarre \n     developments yet, a Sudanese official announced to the world \n     that there was no way the bombed factory was making chemical \n     weapons because it had the ultimate seal of approval in the \n     form a U.N. permit to export ``medicines''--to Iraq. At the \n     very least, that would seem to open up a very wide avenue for \n     examining the U.N.'s decision to pick that particular factory \n     for special exemption from sanctions so it could engage in \n     trade with a country suspected of making weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       But that would mean lifting up the same U.N. petticoats \n     that the United States is now used to hiding behind whenever \n     Washington can't or won't come up with policies of its own. \n     If you ask American officials why they have walked away from \n     the dangerous mess in Afghanistan, they will tell you that \n     they are supporting a U.N. process to bring peace to that \n     unhappy country. In Afghanistan's case, it amounts to an \n     excuse for doing nothing while an entire region veers toward \n     chaos. Meanwhile, senior policy makers have their minds free \n     to think about countries like North Korea--which have figured \n     out that while nickel-and-dime killers like Osama bin Laden \n     get bombed for their sins, if you fire a long-range ballistic \n     missile over Japan and revive your nuclear weapons program, \n     you get a strange new respect and an offer of $4.6 billion.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Aug. 19, 1998]\n\n                    North Korea's Nuclear Ambitions\n\n       North Korea seems to have been caught preparing to betray \n     its 1994 commitment to trade in its nuclear weapons ambitions \n     for $6 billion in international assistance. American \n     intelligence agencies have detected construction of an \n     elaborate underground complex. If completed, the nuclear \n     reactor and plutonium reprocessing plant expected to be built \n     there could allow the North to produce as many as half a \n     dozen nuclear bombs two to five years from now. Washington \n     must insist that work on this project be halted immediately. \n     If North Korea wants economic cooperation from the United \n     States it must honor its promise to renounce all nuclear \n     weapons activity.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 24, 1998]\n\n                         Politics of Blackmail\n\n       It's doubly bad news that North Korea is building a secret \n     underground nuclear facility. First, the idea that North \n     Korea's Stalinist, hostile and repressive regime may once \n     again--or still--be committed to acquiring nuclear weapons is \n     ominous in its\n\n[[Page S9769]]\n\n     own right. But the report calls into question as well a 1994 \n     U.S.-North Korea agreement that is the basis for all other \n     American dealings, with that isolated state.\n       From the start, there's been a question of who was \n     stringing whom along with that agreement. Alarmed that North \n     Korea was accumulating weapons-grade plutonium, the United \n     States in 1994 agreed to lead a coalition of interested \n     nations that would provide the impoverished North Koreans \n     with two nuclear reactors of no military use, and a quantity \n     of fuel oil, in exchange for the mothballing of a plutonium-\n     producing reactor and other weapons facilities. The idea was \n     to buy time, assuming that the world's last pure Stalinist \n     dictatorship couldn't last forever, and it was a chance worth \n     taking. But the danger was that the North Koreans were buying \n     time themselves, taking advantage of U.S. generosity while \n     pursuing their nuclear ambitions.\n       Outside nations have faced a similar dilemma as they \n     confront famine in North Korea. There's little question that \n     thousands are dying of hunger; there's no question that this \n     starvation is entirely political, a result of North Korea's \n     wildly flawed economics and the regime's total denial of \n     freedom to its people. The West, including the United States, \n     provides free food nonetheless. This is in part out of \n     humanitarian principles and the belief that food should never \n     be a political weapon, but it is also out of fear that a \n     collapse in North Korea could cause the regime to lash out in \n     some lunatic and destructive way.\n       On both counts, in other words, the North Korean regime \n     successfully has practiced the politics of blackmail. If \n     North Korea is taking the ransom--fuel and food--and going \n     ahead with its weapons program, then it becomes clear that \n     the blackmail policy has failed--clear that North Korea is \n     stringing America along and not the reverse. So far the \n     Clinton administration insists, at least in public, that \n     North Korea is not yet in violation of the 1994 agreement. \n     The legal technicalities it cites--such as that the 15,000 \n     workers have not yet begun pouring cement for the new \n     facility's foundation--are not reassuring. We hope that in \n     private the administration is delivering a far firmer \n     message. If North Korea's nuclear program is continuing, it \n     shouldn't take long to figure that the whole deal must be \n     off.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, these are important articles. They point \nout the history of our relations with North Korea on this issue. Also, \n``. . . the ill-starred nuclear power plant and oil giveaway \nconsortium--also known as KEDO--that if those gifts aren't forthcoming \nsoon, there's always another missile in Pyongyang's pipeline.'' I think \nthey are important additions to the record.\n  (At the request of Mr. McCain, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record)\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. I rise today in support of \nSenator McCain's amendment restricting the transfer of funds to the \nKorean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (``KEDO'') until the \nPresident certifies that North Korea is not actively pursuing the \nacquisition or development of a nuclear capability and is fully meeting \nits obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons.\n  Mr. President, it is unfortunate that such language is necessary. For \nalmost four years, the United States has provided funding to KEDO under \nan ``Agreed Framework'' negotiated by this administration with the \nleadership of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n  Although this framework agreement was never submitted to the Congress \nfor ratification, the Administration has come to Congress each year to \nask for more and more money to carry out the Framework provisions to \nsupply the North Koreans with heavy fuel oil and to run KEDO. Each \nyear, the Administration has said that this is money well spent because \nthe Agreed Framework has frozen and stopped the North Korean nuclear \nprogram.\n  I have been skeptical of the Agreed Framework since its inception. I \nhave never understood how United States negotiators agreed to a deal \nthat did not allow international inspectors immediate and complete \naccess to North Korea's nuclear program, including the two suspected \nbut undeclared nuclear waste sites. Not only did this failure to demand \ncomplete access mean that we might never know how much plutonium the \nNorth Koreans diverted prior to the 1994 crisis, but it has also led to \nthis situation where the much heralded ``freeze'' may have provided \nconvenient cover for North Korea's more sinister plans.\n  In the year following the signing of the Agreed Framework, former \nMajority Leader Bob Dole and I successfully added amendments to \nprohibit North Korea from receiving foreign assistance until the \nPresident certified to Congress that North Korea's nuclear threat had \nbeen eliminated. Both times the amendments were dropped in conference \nat the insistence of the Clinton Administration. Senator McCain and I \nhave come to the floor countless times since then to try and correct \nloopholes in the Agreed Framework. I felt then, as I feel today, that \nthe Agreed Framework did nothing to eliminate the nuclear threat from \nNorth Korea.\n  In the last several weeks, disturbing intelligence information has \nsurfaced that North Korea is constructing a vast underground complex \nthat may be the site of another nuclear facility. This development \nalarms, but does not surprise, the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. President, the United States must demand immediate access to this \nsite before another penny of taxpayer dollars goes to subsidize this \nterrorist regime.\n  If the North Korean regime is ready to put aside its drive for \nnuclear arms and to move toward the family of nations, then I believe \nthe United States should rightfully welcome such a move and offer \n``rewards.'' However, I strongly believe that North Korea must offer \nthe concessions, and not the other way around.\n  For too long, I believe we have let the North Korean government \ndictate the terms of negotiations, while they gained valuable time to \npush the suspected nuclear program ahead. From the track record, it is \nhard to tell which country is a tiny, isolated, terrorist regime \nviolating international agreements and which country is a superpower \npulling the weight for the international community. This must change.\n  Mr. President, Senator McCain's amendment is a step in the right \ndirection, and I urge its immediate adoption.\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kyl \nbe allowed to speak after the vote. I also ask unanimous consent that \nthe vote on this amendment, the recorded rollcall vote on this \namendment, be set aside pending the determination of the managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3506\n\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, we do have an \namendment on which we are ready to vote. After brief remarks, I believe \nwe will be prepared to go to a vote on that amendment.\n  We will then go to the low-level waste compact between Texas, Maine \nand Vermont. I believe the vote will be on that tomorrow morning. There \nwill be some time before the vote, but I believe it is 30 minutes \nequally divided, or I hope that will be the time for a recorded vote.\n  Before we vote, though, I do want to urge my colleagues to oppose \nthis amendment. First, there is no treaty to monitor, and there will \nnot be one in the foreseeable future. Until all 44 specified nations \nratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, it will not enter into force. \nSo to be providing funds before we have anything to monitor seems very \nquestionable to me.\n  We have not acted on this treaty. And certainly something of this \nmagnitude should be given very serious, careful and extensive thought \nby the committee of jurisdiction and by the full Senate. We should not \nprovide the funding that prejudges whatever the Senate may or may not \ndo before it takes up the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  Beyond that, I have grave reservations, I admit, about whether the \nCTBT is in America's national interest. I am not convinced it is \neffectively verifiable. I am convinced it will limit our ability to \nmaintain the safety and reliability of our vital nuclear deterrent.\n  There are strong signs that India's decision to test nuclear weapons \nwas, in part, a response to pressure to sign the CTBT. Ironically, the \nmost tangible result of this treaty seems to be a nuclear arms race in \nSoutheast Asia. So I just think this is not the time or the place to \ndebate this treaty. Anything less than 67 votes in support of this \namendment will send a strong signal that the Senate is prepared to \nreject this treaty. So I question even the proponents of the treaty \nwanting to do this at this particular time.\n  Whatever the arguments for or against the treaty, putting millions in \nthis organization does not make sense at this time. So I urge the \ndefeat of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President. I believe we are prepared to go to \nthe vote.\n  (At the request of Mr. Lott, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. HELMS. I strongly oppose this amendment, which seeks to \nprovide funds to the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty.\n  As I advised the President on January 21, of this year, at the \nconclusion of Senate debate on NATO expansion, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee would then turn its attention to several other critical, \npressing matters which could affect the security of the American people \nand the health of the United States' economy. Chief among these are the \nagreements on Multilateralization and Demarcation of the 1972 Anti-\nBallistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.\n  The President promised more than a year ago to submit these treaties \nfor the Senate's advice and consent, but we are yet to see that promise \nfulfilled. Nevertheless, the Foreign Relations Committee intends to \npursue hearings on a number of associated issues--such as the recent \nRumsfeld Commission report--with the presumption that the President's \npromise will be honored in the near term.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, in listening to various justifications for the \nproposed amendment (which discuss the ongoing development of nuclear \nweapons by India, Pakistan, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, etc.) I was struck \nby the urgent need--not for another arms control treaty--but for a \nnational missile defense to protect the United States from these \nnuclear weapons when they are mounted on intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles.\n  Let me repeat that for the purpose of emphasis. The last thing the \nUnited States needs is another arms control treaty. In presuming to \nfund the Preparatory Commission, and in attempting to dictate to the \nForeign Relations Committee that CTBT consideration take precedence \nover the planned ABM Treaty hearings, the Senator from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Specter) obviously is willing to place a higher priority on the \ntest ban than on protecting the American people from ballistic missile \nattack.\n  Sure, I have heard the White House and the liberal media attempt to \nspin India's and Pakistan's actions into a justification for the CTBT. \nAnd some seem to have bought it hook-line-and-sinker. But as the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee heard a week after the Indian tests, from \nseveral expert witnesses, India's nuclear tests demonstrate that the \nCTBT is a complete sham from a nonproliferation standpoint.\n  Mr. President, this Senator will take no part in papering over \nIndia's actions with another ban on nuclear testing. The world already \nhas one such treaty, called the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). \nWe should demand that India sign on to that treaty, which already has \n185 States Parties and has been in force since 1970, not a ``Johnny-\ncome-lately'' CTBT, which is--in all respects--a far weaker version of \nthe Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The point is, Mr. President, there \nwould be no cause for worry about Indian nuclear tests if India has \nagreed not to have these weapons in the first place.\n\n  On the other hand, only less than two dozen countries have ratified \nthe CTBT, of whom only 6 are on the list of the 44 key countries which, \npursuant to Article 14 of the treaty, must ratify before it can enter \ninto force. In other words any one of these 44 countries (for example, \nIndia, Pakistan, North Korea, or Iran) can single-handedly derail the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty's (CTBT) entry into force.\n  That is why, Mr. President, the CTBT is so low on the Committee's \nlist of priorities. It has no chance of entering into force in the \nforeseeable future, regardless of what the U.S. Senate does, and \nregardless of whether we waste funds on the Preparatory Commission. I \nregret that it was necessary to come to the Senate floor and explain \nsuch an obvious fact.\n  All of this, of course, is without respect to the fact that the CTBT, \nby preventing tests to ensure the safety and reliability of the U.S. \nnuclear deterrent, is a bad idea from a national security standpoint, \nbut that is a debate better reserved for a time and place when the CTBT \nrealistically has a chance of entering into force.\n  In sum, Mr. President, I oppose the Specter amendment on both \njurisdictional and substantive grounds. Now it is my understanding, on \nthe basis of assurances given by the staff of the Foreign Operations \nsubcommittee, that no funds can be provided to the Preparatory \nCommission without notification to and approval by the Foreign \nRelations Committee. However, that said, this amendment is part and \nparcel of the Clinton Administration's effort to cover up the collapse \nof its nonproliferation policy. By promoting the CTBT with no mention \nof the NPT, the Clinton Administration and Senator Specter propose a \ncourse of action\n\n[[Page S9771]]\n\nthat will de facto legitimize Indian and Pakistani possession of these \nweapons, just so long as they are not caught testing them. Such a \npolicy sets a poor precedent--if one is worried that other countries, \nsuch as Iran and Iraq, might seek to withdraw from the NPT, and escape \ninternational opprobrium by signing on to the CTBT as a declared \nnuclear power.\n  Instead, the Senate should demand that India and Pakistan join the \nNPT, and should insist on vigorous international sanctions against \nproliferant countries, to be lifted only after their nuclear programs \nhave been rolled back.\n  India's nuclear testing also is compelling, additional evidence \npointing to the need for a national missile defense to protect the \nUnited States. Because India can readily reconfigure its space-launch \nvehicle as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), its actions \nclearly constitute an emerging nuclear threat to the United States. For \nthis reason, it is time that the Foreign Relations Committee review the \nantiquated ABM Treaty, which precludes the United States from deploying \na missile defense. Sad to say, the Specter amendment plays into the \nhands of those who seek to detract attention from this effort.\n  Finally, Mr. President, India's (and Pakistan's) actions should make \nclear to all just how vital the U.S. nuclear deterrent is to the \nnational security of the United States. What is needed, at this time, \nis not a scramble for an arms control treaty that prohibits the United \nStates from guaranteeing the safety and reliability of its nuclear \nstockpile. What is needed is a careful, bottoms-up review of the state \nof the U.S. nuclear infrastructure, which I fear is in sad repair after \nsix years of a moratorium. I expect that, after undertaking such a \nreview, the United States will find that the CTBT is the very last \nthing the United States should consider doing.\n  Mr. President, I do hope Senators will oppose the Specter \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Specter \namendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3506 offered by \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n              the child survival and disease programs fund\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support \nfor the Child Survival and Disease Program Fund. I understand that the \nHouse Committee on Appropriations, as a part of its Foreign Operations, \nExport Financing, and Related Programs Bill, has recommended that $650 \nmillion be allocated to the Fund's programs for fiscal year 1999. On \nthe House side, Subcommittee Chairman Callahan has taken the lead in \nprotecting these child survival programs and I commend him for his \nleadership on this issue. The Clinton administration, however, has \nreduced direct funding for child survival programs. In order to \npreserve the benefits of these important programs for children \nworldwide, I believe the Senate should accept in conference the House \nlanguage that was agreed to in Committee for this Fund.\n  It is a tragedy that millions of children die each year from disease, \nmalnutrition, and other consequences of poverty that are both \npreventable and treatable. The programs of the Child Survival Fund, \nwhich are intended to reduce infant mortality and improve the health \nand nutrition of children, address the various problems of young people \nstruggling to survive in developing countries. It places a priority on \nthe needs of the more than 100 million children worldwide who are \ndisplaced and/or have become orphans.\n  The Fund includes initiatives to curb the resurgence of communicable \ndiseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. In the underdeveloped world, \nthe Fund works towards eradicating polio as well as preventing and \ncontrolling the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n  Aside from addressing issues of health, the Fund also supports basic \neducation programs. An investment in education yields one of the \nhighest social and economic rates of return--because it gives children \nthe necessary tools to become self-sufficient adults. Each additional \nyear of primary and secondary schooling results in a 10-20% wage \nincrease and a 25% net increase in income.\n  The programs supported by the Child Survival Fund are effective \nbecause they save three million lives each year through immunizations, \nvitamin supplementation, oral rehydration therapy, and the treatment of \nchildhood respiratory infections, which are the second largest killer \nof children on earth. This year the Kiwanis International are leading a \nglobal campaign to raise seventy-five million dollars toward the \nelimination of Iodine Deficiency Disorder which is the world's most \nprevalent cause of preventable mental retardation in children. \nEliminating the symptoms and causes of this poverty is not only the \nhumane thing to do--it is also a necessary prerequisite for global \nstability and prosperity.\n  In my view, Congress needs to maintain its support for these valuable \nprograms. It is my hope that the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee \nwill accept the House language. The Child Survival and Disease programs \nare effective and are important. They should be continued. I would like \nto commend Representatives Tony Hall of Ohio and Sonny Callahan of \nAlabama for their tireless leadership in the effort to eliminate global \nhunger.\n  I see the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee on \nthe floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Ohio for his statement. I \nhave listened very carefully to his remarks, and I commend him for his \ntireless efforts in supporting children's causes, here in the United \nStates and throughout the world. I would like to assure him that I will \ngive every possible consideration to his request when we go to \nconference.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my distinguished friend from Kentucky, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9772]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3525\n\n (Purpose: To require a report on Iraqi development of weapons of mass \n                              destruction)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Earlier today, due to a mistake, an amendment by \nSenator Bond was, we thought, approved but in fact was not sent to the \ndesk. It is agreed to by both sides. So I would like to send the Bond \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. Bond, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3525.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Iraq is continuing efforts to mask the extent of its \n     weapons of mass destruction and missile programs;\n       (2) proposals to relax the current international inspection \n     regime would have potentially dangerous consequences for \n     international security; and\n       (3) Iraq has demonstrated time and again that it cannot be \n     trusted to abide by international norms or by its own \n     agreements, and that the only way the international community \n     can be assured of Iraqi compliance is by ongoing inspection.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the international agencies charged with inspections in \n     Iraq--the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the \n     United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) should maintain \n     vigorous inspections, including surprise inspections, within \n     Iraq; and\n       (2) the United States should oppose any efforts to ease the \n     inspections regimes on Iraq until there is clear, credible \n     evidence that the Government of Iraq is no longer seeking to \n     acquire weapons of mass destruction and the means of \n     delivering them.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall submit a report to \n     Congress on the United States Government's assessment of \n     Iraq's nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction programs \n     and its efforts to move toward procurement of nuclear weapons \n     and the means to deliver weapons of mass destruction. The \n     report shall also--\n       (1) assess the United States view of the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency's action team reports and other IAEA \n     efforts to monitor the extent and nature of Iraq's nuclear \n     program; and\n       (2) include the United States Government's opinion on the \n     value of maintaining the ongoing inspection regime rather \n     than replacing it with a passive monitoring system.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is no objection to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3525) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and move \nto lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/01/senate-section/article/S9753-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9772-S9782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TEXAS LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL COMPACT CONSENT ACT--\n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed as under the order to the Texas Low-Level Waste Disposal \nCompact conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the conference report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     629) have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by all of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of July 16, 1998.)\n  Mr. ALLARD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the conference report?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield time to myself off the time for the \nconference report and observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it may be, I say to my colleagues, \nbecause I have friends out here on the floor and we may have some real \ndisagreement on this, but I want to make sure we proceed on this \ntogether. I think on the order of this, the proponents might want to go \nfirst. That is fine with me. I want to make sure we can have one \nunderstanding. Before the recess, it was my understanding, albeit not a \nwritten contract, that we would not burn up all the time; that we would \nreserve 1 hour equally divided for tomorrow before the final vote. I \nask unanimous consent that we at least have that final hour to be \nequally divided before the vote tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I mention to \nthe Senator from Minnesota, it is not my understanding an hour would be \nreserved. I understand most of the time will be used this evening, with \nthe exception of 15 minutes to be equally divided prior to the vote \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, it is \nunfortunate that maybe there were a number of different parties \ninvolved in this, but I was very clear that I wanted to make sure there \nwas time for this debate also tomorrow morning, not late tonight.\n  I say to colleagues--it is not personal to my colleague from Maine--I \nam going to object to adjournment tonight, and Senators are going to \nhave to come back here tonight at midnight and vote if I don't get a \nhalf an hour tomorrow. I know what was said. I know what was the \nunderstanding, and this is an important enough issue that tomorrow \nmorning--and the other side can take a half hour, too--that we should \nhave a debate. It shouldn't go from 7 o'clock now until 10 o'clock, \ntime is burned off, no time to discuss this tomorrow morning, and then \nthere is a vote. I think that is unacceptable.\n  I guess we are starting the debate off in the wrong way. In all due \nrespect, a lot of the decisions made on this matter have been made kind \nof in the dark of night in the conference committee. I want part of \nthis debate to be open. I want Senators to be aware of this. I want the \npublic to be aware of it.\n  I renew my request one more time just so I know where I am at \ntonight. I ask unanimous consent that we have an hour equally divided \ntomorrow morning before final vote.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it may well \nhave been the understanding of the Senator from Minnesota that an hour \nwould be set aside. That was not my understanding in terms of how this \ntime would be divided, other than to say that most of the time was to \nbe used this evening, with the exception of 15 minutes to be equally \ndivided tomorrow.\n  I will agree to half an hour equally divided, if that will \naccommodate the Senator from Minnesota. But I, and I think the others \ninvolved in this debate, prefer to do most of the debate this evening. \nThat was our understanding.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, I am going to \nstick to this because this is, I think, an important issue. It takes \ntime to lay out the context and the background. I know the way it works \nhere. This now has been put off close to 7 o'clock. I understand that. \nI just think that 15 minutes is not a lot of time to go into the \ncomplexity of this. I know at least what was my understanding, and I \nsay to my colleague from Maine, this was not a direct conversation with \nher. In no way, shape, or form am I trying to say she had implied \notherwise.\n  I am going to be firm about this. Perhaps we could--and I wouldn't be \ntotally satisfied with it--but perhaps we could save colleagues some \ntrouble and\n\n[[Page S9773]]\n\ndo 40 minutes equally divided. I ask unanimous consent that there be 40 \nminutes, 20 minutes on each side, so colleagues don't have to come back \ntonight and vote at midnight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Do my colleagues want to proceed first? I say to the \nSenator from Maine, would you like to proceed first?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, yes, I will proceed first. I won't be very \nlong, and then both Senators from Vermont are here this evening as \nwell. I am willing to go first in this debate.\n  I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for the time she may \nconsume.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I say to the Members of the Senate, I rise \ntoday to ask for my colleagues' support for the conference report on \nH.R. 629, the Texas Compact Consent Act of 1998, which reflects the \noriginal language ratified by the States of Maine, Vermont, and Texas \nto address the safe disposal of their low-level radioactive nuclear \nwaste. The 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act states that it \nis the policy of the United States that each State is responsible for \nproviding for the availability of disposal capacity, whether in State \nor out of State, for waste generated within its borders, and the act \nauthorized interstate compacts as a principal means of providing for \nthis capacity.\n\n  The policy was reinforced in the 1985 amendments to the act. The \nStates of Maine, Vermont, and Texas are now approaching the end of a \nlong journey that started in 1980 when Congress informed the States to \nform compacts to solve their low-level radioactive waste disposal \nproblems.\n  My first chart shows the extent of the nine compact networks that \nhave already been ratified by Congress. California, for instance, has \nhad a compact with North and South Dakota, and Hawaii and Alaska ship \ntheir low-level waste to Washington State.\n  This chart designates all of the nine previous compacts that have \nbeen established with the various States across this country. As you \ncan see in the second chart with the list of States in the compact, Mr. \nPresident, when we adopted this report, Texas, Maine, and Vermont will \nbecome the 42nd, 43rd, and 44th States to be given congressional \napproval to enter into a compact and will meet their responsibilities \nof disposal of their low-level waste from hospitals, medical centers, \npowerplants, and shipyards. We will be the 10th compact to receive the \nconsent of the U.S. Congress. Only 6 States out of 50 will not yet have \nformed a compact with other States.\n  Again, in referring to this chart, it shows that 41 States have \nentered into nine different compacts, all of which have been ratified \nby the Congress in previous years. So this compact is not unlike any of \nthe other nine previous compacts that have been adopted by the U.S. \nCongress.\n  It is very important for my colleagues to understand that the \nlanguage ratified overwhelmingly by each State legislature is the same \nlanguage that has been passed by the conferees, so that the compact \nwill not have to be returned to each State to go through a \nreratification process that would, in all practicality, as well as \nreality, take several more years.\n  The compact that is before the Senate has been approved by large \nmajorities in all three State legislatures. The Texas Senate approved \nthe compact in May of 1993 with a vote of 28-0, and by a voice vote in \nthe Texas House of Representatives. Governor Ann Richards at the time \nsigned the compact. The compact is supported by the current Governor, \nGovernor George Bush.\n  The Vermont House voice voted the compact in March of 1994, and the \nVermont Senate voice voted the compact in April of 1994. Governor \nHoward Dean signed the compact.\n  The Maine Legislature approved the compact in June of 1993, by a \nhouse vote of 131 yeas to 6 nays, and a senate vote of 26 yeas and 3 \nnays.\n  Additionally, Maine held a public referendum on the compact in \nNovember of 1993, which passed by 73 percent. Then-Governor John \nMcKernan signed the compact. Today it is supported as well by the \ncurrent Governor, Angus King.\n  As Congress intended in the original law, the Low-Level Radioactive \nWaste Disposal Act of 1980, and in amendments enacted in 1985 by the \nCongress, the Texas Compact is site neutral. Site location questions \nare the exclusive purview of the State of Texas and can only be \naddressed through Texas political and regulatory processes. The chosen \nsite must, of course, meet Federal environmental, public health and \nsafety laws. To date, no site location has been finalized. No license \nhas been granted.\n  The compact does not determine who pays what, how the storage is \nallocated, or where the site is located. To the contrary, the intent of \nthe law is for the States to develop and approve and finalize these \ndetails after Congress has ratified the plan.\n  The compact is only an interstate agreement providing the terms under \nwhich Maine and Vermont can dispose of their waste at a licensed \nfacility in Texas, irrespective of where that facility is located. As \nwe all know, there has been a proposed site.\n  As to the statements by the opponents and by the Senator from \nMinnesota that there is no local support for the proposed site, all I \ncan say is that earlier this year local support was certainly evidenced \nthrough local elections that were held in Texas. The Hudspeth County \njudge, who is the top elected official in the county where the site has \nbeen proposed, and who has strongly declared his support for the \ncompact, won his race for reelection. This was an issue in his \nreelection, and the elections at the local level in this county.\n  Two candidates for county commissioner who also support the compact \nwon their races over two opponents of the compact. And a local \nindividual in opposition to the compact was the only person on the \nballot for Democratic Party Chair, and he lost to a write-in candidate.\n  In an August 25 letter, a top-elected official from Hudspeth, Judge \nPeace, stated: ``The truth is the socioeconomic benefits for the \nresidents of Sierra Blanca are enormous and overwhelmingly positive.''\n  Judge Peace also says, ``I want you to know that the majority of \ncitizens favor the development of such a facility.'' Further, he says, \n``The people of Sierra Blanca and Hudspeth County voiced their opinions \nfor a better future and tangible real life advances that will make our \ncommunities more livable.''\n  There is a grave concern in Maine and Vermont and Texas that there \nare some in Congress who want to add stipulations on to the Texas \nCompact that no other compact has had to endure. And that would be \naction that would discriminate against these three States.\n\n  Again, as I mentioned earlier, there have been nine previous \ncompacts. Not one of them have had any conditions or stipulations as \nthe ones that have been suggested by the Senator from Minnesota and \nothers--none. And the compact is site neutral because that is a \ndecision that has to be made by the State that will have the proposed \nfacility. That, of course, is the State of Texas--but all consistent \nwith the environmental and safety and health guidelines, not only at \nthe Federal level, but at the State and the local level as well. This \nis not irrespective; it is not overriding those concerns.\n  In fact, the conference report and the statute that is being proposed \nbefore the Senate is very clear that they have to follow specific and \ncertain guidelines. So that is the environmental justice that we are \npursuing. No one is saying to override environmental justice principles \nor regulations--absolutely not. That is for the State in question. I \nhave faith and confidence in the State of Texas and the elected \nofficials and other officials involved in this procedural approach in \ndetermining where the proposed site should be located. But that is a \njudgment that has to be made by the State of Texas and consistent with \ntheir laws, and Federal laws as well.\n  I might add that Senator Wellstone's own State of Minnesota is \nalready part of a compact that was ratified by Congress. And like all \nthe other compacts that Congress has approved, Congress made no changes \nor added any conditions or stipulations to that compact. There again, \nit was a decision made by the State who is going\n\n[[Page S9774]]\n\nto have the facilities, but again in keeping with Federal environmental \nand health and safety regulations, as well as the State and local \nguidelines.\n  With congressional ratification of H.R. 629 and the conference report \nthat is before us today, Texas will move forward to select an \nappropriate site for the disposal facility in a timely manner, most \nimportantly, consistent with all of the applicable State and Federal \nenvironmental, health and public safety laws, as I have already \nmentioned. It has always been the decision of the State of Texas as to \nwhere the facility will be sited. And it is not within the purview of \nthe U.S. Senate to decide for them. And I applaud the conferees in \ntheir judgment of passing out a conference report with the original \nlanguage ratified by Maine, Vermont and the State of Texas.\n  Without the protection of the compact, Texas will be compelled to--\nand I repeat, compelled to--open their borders to any other State for \nwaste disposal if they decide to create a new facility or they will be \nin violation of the Interstate Commerce Clause of the United States \nConstitution. This compact will protect Texas' right to decide what is \nbest for the State of Texas. The State will be able to construct a \nsingle engineered facility for storing and management of all of its \nlow-level waste rather than its current situation illustrated again on \nthis chart in which 684 temporary storage sites are strewn far and wide \nacross the State. Again, it shows in this chart 684 different \nfacilities across the State of Texas.\n  This compact will allow them to consolidate into one facility. But if \nthe Congress did not approve this compact, and the State of Texas \nwanted to go ahead and develop a new site, they would be required, \nwithout this compact, to open up their facility to all of the other \nStates in the country for the transport of low-level radioactive waste. \nSo that is why the State of Texas wants this compact, because then they \nwould only be accepting waste from the State of Vermont and the State \nof Maine.\n  Texas Compact members will now be able to exercise appropriate, \nresponsible control of their low-level nuclear waste as Congress has \nmandated.\n  I would like to put into the Record the entire letter that I received \nfrom the Organizations United for Responsible Low-Level Radioactive \nWaste Solutions--a coalition made up of such organizations as the \nAmerican Society of Nuclear Physicians, the American Heart Association, \nand the National Association of Cancer Patients--who are dedicated to \nsocially, environmentally, technically and economically responsible \nsolutions to low-level waste disposal. I would like to quote one of \ntheir lines within the letter that I think speaks to this issue.\n\n       Please support the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste \n     Disposal Compact bill which will allow the continued use of \n     low-level radioactive materials that provide critical health, \n     environmental, and safety benefits to millions of Americans.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the entire letter \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Organizations United,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 1998.\n     Senator Olympia J. Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: As you consider approving the \n     conference report on the Texas Compact legislation, you must \n     also consider the life-saving and life-extending medical \n     benefits which result from usage of radioisotopes. Such \n     benefits--prevention and treatment of cancer tumors, research \n     for a cure for AIDS, diagnosis and treatment of thyroid \n     disorders, study of lung ventilation and blood flow--require \n     responsible management and disposal of low-level radioactive \n     waste to ensure their continued operation. Without \n     ratification of the Texas-Maine-Vermont Compact and \n     subsequent selection and development of a disposal site, the \n     public will suffer a loss of these type of benefits because \n     of the lack of a disposal facility.\n       Approval of the conference report and support for the Texas \n     Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact bill will ensure \n     that important medical research and electrical processes can \n     continue to benefit the nation and groups like Organizations \n     United whose members include associations representing \n     doctors, electric utilities, universities, and other \n     researchers.\n       Another important piece of the proposed bill to remember is \n     that it does not designate a disposal site for low-level \n     radioactive waste; only the state of Texas has the authority \n     to approve a site. Texas has not made a final decision on \n     where the facility should be located. So, you will be voting \n     for the compact, which all three states negotiated in full \n     compliance with all federal and state laws and with full \n     support of their leaders, and not a particular site.\n       Please support the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste \n     Disposal Compact bill which will allow the continued use of \n     low-level radioactive materials that provide critical health, \n     environmental, and safety benefits to millions of Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Robert F. Carretta, M.D.,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, to sum up this issue, first and foremost, I \nthink we need to understand that most other States have already entered \ninto compacts that have been ratified by the Congress. In fact, 41 \nStates already have compacts. The same compact that we are asking for \nsupport here in the U.S. Senate has been already adopted by the House \nof Representatives by an overwhelming margin. It has been supported by \nthe conferees of both the House and the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this conference report that allows \nthese three States to enter into a compact that is consistent with the \nmandates of the laws that have been passed by the Congress both in \n1980, with the original act instructing the States that they must make \ndecisions with respect to the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, \nand consistent with the amendments to that act in 1985.\n  This compact is in keeping with the spirit and intent of those \nthoughts.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Maine still has \nthe floor. Does the Senator yield?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Well, Mr. President, I was going to yield to the Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I understand. I gather my colleague doesn't need a lot \nof time. I ask unanimous consent that I may follow the Senator from \nVermont. There is much that my colleague said that I want to respond \nto, but I will wait.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is always a very difficult subject \nwhen we talk about nuclear waste. We all have a fear of nuclear waste \nand the thought of radiation emanating from the ground in our \nneighborhoods or visions of trucks driving down from Maine and Vermont \nand dumping waste into the fields of Texas. That is sometimes what is \ndescribed. But we are talking here about a well-conceived law which has \nset out a process for low-level waste.\n  What is low-level waste? Well, it is the gloves that come from the \nworkers in the atomic energy plants. It may be waste from the \nutilization of radioactive materials in our hospitals. It is not the \nlarge nuclear rods that we are trying desperately to put somewhere. We \nare talking about something that is easily controllable. One would \ncertainly ask this question: If there is so much problem, how come all \nthe people in the area are voting and saying, yes, yes, bring it down? \nWhy? Because there is a price tag to those States that have the waste.\n  Vermont and Maine are not very big States. We are going to be \nspending $25 million sending it down, with other payments later, and \ncreating a facility in this area that will provide jobs and economic \nhelp to an area that right now is very low income, with no real \nproductivity or resources. So they will have an opportunity to benefit \nvery substantially--maybe build a new school, or other things--which \nwould not happen were it not for this compact. Also, we know well now \nhow we can control the nuclear waste from facilities that have low-\nlevel waste. We know what to do with the high-level waste, but we just \ncan't get the States to come around to accepting it. That is a problem \nfor the future. Right now we are talking about low-level waste.\n  The compact has the support of the Governors and the State \nlegislatures of Texas, Vermont and Maine. Passage of this compact will \nallow these States to responsibly manage low-level waste produced by \nhospitals, power plants, industrial facilities, and medical research \nlaboratories in our State where we do not have a place to do this, and \nit creates a danger. Whereas, if it is shipped and properly handled and \nplaced in areas where there is no chance to get into the groundwater \nand\n\n[[Page S9775]]\n\nall these things we have to worry about in our State, it can only \nbenefit those, and especially in providing schools and other things.\n  We come to the floor today asking that our states be given the same \nrights as forty-one other states. In 1980, and again in 1985, Congress \ndeclared that states must provide for the disposal of commercial low-\nlevel radioactive waste. Forty-one states have responded affirmatively \nto that mandate and formed nine regional compacts.\n  These nine compacts have been approved unanimously by the Senate, \nwithout amendment, and signed into law. We ask for nothing more than \nwhat Congress has already given these forty-one other states.\n  This compact, like the nine others that precede it, took years of \nnegotiating among the states. The Vermont legislature and the Governor \ncarefully reviewed each provision before approval. In fact in 1990, \nunder the leadership of then-Governor Madeline Kunin, the State of \nVermont began a study to find a suitable site for a disposal facility \nin Vermont. After two years of exhaustive review, the State determined \nthat a safe site could not be found in Vermont.\n  It is understandable that we can't bury things. We have water that \nflows down on us and runs off. It is no place to handle this kind of \nthing.\n  The agreement Vermont and Maine have reached with Texas is the best \noption for safe disposal. In fact, the compact we are debating requires \nthat it is the policy of the party states to cooperate in the \nprotection of the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens and the \nenvironment.\n  We are here today because one Senator is questioning the science used \nto find a safe and suitable site for disposal of this waste. I commend \nhim for questioning this, and I am glad we are having this debate, \nbecause people should be reassured and should know what happens in \nthese cases.\n  After the compact was signed into law by then-Governor Ann Richards, \nthe State of Texas launched a rigorous process to assure that the site \nlicensed to accept this waste would be safe. Prior to selecting the \nproposed site, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission spent \nfour years reviewing the site before issuing a draft license and \nenvironmental assessment.\n  Although this compact does not specify a site for the Texas waste \nfacility, I trust that the State of Texas has used and will continue to \nuse strict scientific criteria in selecting a disposal site.\n  This compact has strong bipartisan support. The consent legislation \nwas reported out of both the House Commerce Committee and the Senate \nJudiciary Committee without amendment and without opposition.\n  The Texas Compact was adopted by the House by a vote of 309 to 107. \nIn the Senate it passed with unanimous support. Moreover, the Texas \nlegislature, the Maine legislature, and the Vermont legislature \napproved the compact.\n  Mr. President, we should continue to work together in a bipartisan \nmanner and pass this compact.\n  Let's ensure that institutions in Maine, Texas, Vermont and all \nacross the United States have access to safe disposal sites for low-\nlevel radioactive waste.\n  Let's treat this compact just like we have treated all of the other \nnine. This compact is not about the virtues or vices of nuclear power, \nindustrial development or cancer research, it is about the safe \ndisposal of low-level waste.\n  Let's pass this compact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think my colleague from Vermont has \nbeen on the floor a long time today. He said he needed a brief period \nof time. If I could take a minute--and only a minute, I say to my \ncolleague from Vermont, whom I appreciate as a real friend here, I will \ntalk about the actual sites, Hudspeth and Sierra Blanca, and how this \nis all taking place.\n  This is an issue of environmental justice. But this nuclear waste is \nnot just gloves and medical waste. My colleague talked about that. \nNinety-nine percent of this low-level radioactive waste in Maine and \nVermont will come from nuclear reactors. Let's just be clear about \nthat.\n  Second of all, the distinction between low-level and high-level--I \nwill read from a GAO report of this year.\n\n       Any radioactive waste that are not high-level are low-\n     level, and as a result, low-level radioactive waste \n     constitute a very broad category containing many different \n     types and concentrations of radio nuclei, including the same \n     radio nuclei that may be found in high-level radioactive \n     waste.\n\n  This is an artificial distinction. It is not just medical waste. It \nsounds better when we talk about booties and gloves. Low-level waste \nconstitutes all of the same public health concerns to the people who \nlive in Sierra Blanca. I want to be clear about that.\n  I ask my colleague from Vermont, how much time does he think he will \nneed?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Six or seven minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that after my colleague uses \nhis time, I be able to follow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, thank you. I thank my colleague from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Texas Low-Level Nuclear \nWaste Compact. This legislation was originally introduced in the 103rd \nCongress and is long overdue.\n  Although this legislation is fairly simple on its face, merely \napproving a Compact already agreed to by each of the party states, many \nissues have arisen along the way to complicate the approval of the \nCompact.\n  We have before us the Conference Report to the Compact that works out \nthese issues. This Conference Report insures that the will of the party \nstates is followed.\n  When Congress passed the 1980 Low-Level Nuclear Waste Policy Act, we \nhanded over to states the responsibility of low-level waste disposal \nand encouraged them to enter into compacts to provide disposal on a \ncollective basis.\n  Nine of these compacts have already been approved by Congress. In \nthis case, the states of Vermont, Maine and Texas negotiated the terms \nof their Compact, all three states approved the Compact and all three \ngovernors have urged Congress to ratify it.\n  Approval of this Compact will give these states final resolution of \nthe problem they increasingly face in disposing of their nuclear waste.\n  In Vermont, we began this process almost ten years ago. Following the \ndirection of Congress, Vermont began looking for an in-state depository \nlocation. In 1990, former Governor Kunin created the Vermont Low-Level \nRadioactive Waste Authority to determine if there was a suitable site \nfor a low-level radioactive waste disposal facility in Vermont.\n  Over the next two years the Authority spent approximately $5 million \nevaluating numerous sites in our state. In particular, the Authority \nexamined the potential for a site next to Vermont Yankee in Vernon, \nVermont. The site was found to have extremely unfavorable geological \nconditions for a storage facility.\n  The combination of porous soil, a high groundwater table, a wet \nclimate and proximity to the Connecticut River made such a site too \nrisky.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the Public Service Board of the State of Vermont \noutlining the process we went through to find a site within our \nborders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 State of Vermont,\n\n\n                                 Department of Public Service,\n\n                                    Montpelier, VT, July 15, 1998.\n     Re low level waste activities in Vermont.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The purpose of this letter is to \n     provide you with: (1) information about Vermont's efforts to \n     site a low level radioactive waste storage facility in \n     Vermont; (2) information on why Vermont cannot rely on the \n     low level radioactive waste storage facility in Barnwell, \n     South Carolina to accept future shipments of low level waste \n     from Vermont; and (3) the reasons why I believe that the \n     Texas Compact is the best option for long term storage of \n     Vermont's low level waste.\n       In 1990, Governor Kunin signed the law which created \n     Vermont's Low Level Radioactive Waste Authority (``the \n     Authority'').\n\n[[Page S9776]]\n\n     This followed the inconclusive efforts over the course of \n     some years of the Vermont Low Level Radioactive Waste \n     Commission.\n       Among other things, the Authority was charged with \n     determining if there was a suitable site for a low level \n     radioactive waste storage facility in Vermont. Over the next \n     two years the Authority spent approximately $5 million \n     evaluating numerous prospective sites in the state.\n       A site next to Vermont Yankee was evaluated in depth. This \n     site was found to have extremely unfavorable geological \n     conditions. Specifically, groundwater was very close to the \n     surface and the underlying soil was comprised primarily of \n     porous sand and gravel with short transit times to the \n     Connecticut River. These conditions, in combination with \n     Vermont's wet climate, would permit rapid migration of any \n     materials leaking from a waste storage facility into the \n     Connecticut River.\n       Following the abandonment of Vermont Yankee as a storage \n     site, the Authority embarked on a voluntary siting process. \n     Initial interest in several towns waned quickly as groups \n     opposing nuclear power activated local opposition. It was the \n     opinion of those working in the low level radioactive waste \n     are that a facility could not be sited in Vermont.\n       Past experience with the existing low level radioactive \n     waste storage facility in Barnwell, South Carolina, has \n     demonstrated its unsuitability for Vermont's future low level \n     waste storage needs. It appears that while storage space at \n     Barnwell is adequate for some time, the continued operation \n     of the site is questionable due to possible changes in \n     political leadership in South Carolina. We believe that it is \n     possible that the Barnwell facility could close if the \n     current Republican administration in South Carolina were \n     replaced by a Democratic governor. If Barnwell remains open, \n     costs for storage are uncertain and will likely be higher. \n     South Carolina has an expectation of deriving a certain level \n     of funds for state education needs from Barnwell storage \n     fees. This amount of funding has not been met resulting in a \n     current crisis over continued Barnwell operations.\n       I expect that disposal in the Texas Compact will be less \n     expensive than other options, even considering the $25 \n     million cost for Vermont's participation. At current levels, \n     Barnwell's cost of approximately $400 per cubic foot is \n     higher than Texas' projected cost of between $118 and $275 \n     per cubic foot. While it is likely that both cost figures \n     will rise, I expect Texas to remain less expensive.\n       Not only is Barnwell more expensive than the Texas site, \n     but it also appears that Barnwell is refusing to accept the \n     internal components of commercial nuclear reactors that have \n     recently retired in the United States. This could be \n     especially troublesome for Vermont when Vermont Yankee ceases \n     operations because of the relative volume of these \n     components.\n       Vermont has attempted an in-state siting process and found \n     that siting in Vermont would be difficult if not impossible. \n     The uncertainty regarding the price and the availability of \n     the Barnwell site make it an undesirable choice for Vermont's \n     long term low waste storage needs. In summary, I believe that \n     after careful consideration of both environmental and \n     economic considerations that the Texas facility is the best \n     option for Vermont's long term, low level waste storage \n     needs. Please contact me if you would require additional \n     information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Richard Sedano,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, some critics of this Compact argue that the \nwaste should be stored where it is generated. Although this argument is \nnobly egalitarian, it is not practical nor is it safe.\n  We cannot control the rainfall in Vermont. We cannot change the \ndensity of our soil. And we cannot move the people of Vernon out of the \narea to meet the criteria of a safe disposal site. So, Vermont had to \nlook somewhere else.\n  Under this Compact, Texas has agreed to be the host for the disposal \nsite. The Compact does not name a specific site. That is an issue to be \ndecided by the people of Texas, as it should be.\n  Every other compact approved by Congress gives the host state the \nright to choose where the disposal facility is sited, according to the \nlaws and regulations of that state. The same is true for this Compact.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a minute to talk about the process \nundertaken by Texas to site this storage facility. In 1991, the Texas \nlegislature adopted legislation designating an area of 400 square miles \n(256,000 acres) in which the Texas Low-Level Authority was required to \nselect a proposed site.\n  After performing site screening in the area defined by the \nlegislature, the Texas Authority identified a 16,000-acre tract for \nfurther analysis, of which 1,300-acres would be used for the proposed \nsite. Texas undertook a siting and licensing process similar to the \nfederal National Environmental Policy (NEPA) process, which included \nnumerous public hearings and technical and environmental reviews.\n  This process was recently reviewed by the two administrative law \njudges from the Texas Office of Administrative Hearings, who \nrecommended the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission conduct \nadditional analysis before the facility is licensed. The Governor and \nthe State Legislature set up a process to select a site, which should \nbe allowed to more forward.\n  Congress should not put special restrictions on this Compact simply \nbecause Texas is exercising its rights as the host state to determine \nwhere the facility will be located.\n  This Compact also allows the states of Vermont, Maine and Texas to \nrefuse waste from other states. Specifically, Texas will be able to \nlimit the amount of low-level waste coming into its facility from out-\nof-state sources.\n  As stated by the Governors of Vermont, Maine and Texas in a letter to \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee in April, 1998, ``If the facility opens \nwithout a Compact in place, Texas will be subject to accepting waste \nfrom around the country, and Maine and Vermont will not be guaranteed \nany storage space at the facility.'' Under the Compact, there is a \ncontrolled process for transporting and disposing of the waste at the \nfacility. Without the Compact, that process evaporates.\n  This arrangement is not only the best environmental solution to store \nwaste from our three states, it is also the best economic solution. \nMaine and Vermont together produce a fraction of what is generated in \nTexas, but by entering into this Compact we will share the cost of \nbuilding the facility.\n  Right now, Vermont pays approximately $400 per cubic foot to dispose \nof our waste. Disposal at the Texas facility will cost only about $200 \nper cubic foot. If the Compact is not approved, it is the ratepayers of \nVermont, Texas and Maine who will have to pay the extra cost of \ndisposal.\n  Finally, building the facility does not end Vermont's obligation to \nthe safety of this site. We have a long-term commitment to the site, \nfrom ensuring that the facility meets all of the federal construction \nand operating regulations to making sure the waste is transported \nproperly to the site and that the surrounding area is rigorously \nmonitored. Vermont will not send its waste to Texas and then close its \neyes to the rest of the process.\n  I can assure you that Vermont will not send nuclear waste to Texas \nand then close its eyes to the rest of the process. We are just not \ngoing to do that. We are not a State that would do that.\n  Some might want to say it would be nice if we had no more nuclear \nwaste. Unfortunately, we will. We will continue to have it. And we will \nstill have to dispose of it.\n  I think we all recognize that there was no perfect solution for \ndealing with low-level nuclear waste.\n  But as long as we are generating power from nuclear facilities and as \nlong as our research universities, hospitals and laboratories use \nnuclear materials, we are going to have to dispose of the waste.\n  We cannot continue to ignore the need to safely store nuclear waste. \nTo do so would be to ignore the growing environmental problem of \nstoring this waste at inadequate, temporary sites in Vermont, Maine and \nTexas.\n  Instead, we need to make a commitment to developing and building the \nsafest facility for long-term storage of waste. That is what our States \nhave done, and Congress should not stand in their way.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me start out by saying to my \ncolleague from Vermont that this debate is not about suggesting that a \ndump has to be built in the Northeast. That is not what this debate is \nabout. I say that to my colleague from Maine. No one has ever suggested \nthat.\n  Let me also say that I have to smile as I hear my colleagues say that \nwe need this compact to provide people in Texas with the guarantee that \ntheir dump won't become a depository, a national depository for waste. \nIf there is no dump, they don't need the protection. This is an \ninteresting argument--we have to have a compact--which, by\n\n[[Page S9777]]\n\nthe way, I don't think holds up under scrutiny. I will talk about that \nin a moment. We have to have a compact in order to give people in \nTexas--it is really in their self-interest. This compact will provide \nthem with some protection that they won't have nuclear waste coming \ninto their State from all over the country. By definition, if the dump \nisn't built, if the compact doesn't go through, then there won't be any \nnuclear waste dump, and, therefore, people in Texas won't have to worry \nabout that protection. It is just a curious argument that caught my \nattention.\n  Mr. President, I want to say at the beginning that I rise to speak \nwith as much passion and as much evidence that I can marshal as \npossible against this conference report, H.R. 629, the Texas, Maine, \nand Vermont compact, which will result in the dumping of low-level \nradioactive waste from Texas, Maine, and Vermont, and potentially other \nStates and territories, at a dump located in Texas. The dump is \nexpected to be built near the town of Sierra Blanca in Hudspeth County \nwhere 66 percent of the residents are Latino and 39 percent live below \nthe poverty line. Let's not be fooling anybody. Here is what happened. \nThis is what we have to vote on one way or another.\n  In Texas, the decision has to be made. Where are you going to put a \nnuclear waste dump site? Not surprisingly, when you have a former \nGovernor here, or someone else living in another community who is \npolitically connected there, none of those sites is considered. \nInstead, what we come up with--I will go through the whole history of \nthis--is Sierra Blanca, Hudspeth County. This happens to be a community \nthat is disproportionately Hispanic and disproportionately poor. And \nthat is why this is a civil rights issue. That is why, colleagues, a \nlot of organizations--Latino and Latina--and a lot of environmental \norganizations are on record against this compact.\n  This is going the path of least political resistance. That is what \nthis is about.\n  This is an issue of environmental justice. It is the business of all \nof us in the U.S. Senate, because we have to vote for or against this \ncompact.\n  All of a sudden--I will get to this a little later on as well--some \nadministrative law judges take a look at this, and they say, ``You know \nwhat? This might not be a good idea because this is a geologically \nactive area.'' That is a euphemism for an earthquake area. That is \ntrue. They have said that. But the problem is that the members of the \ncommission in Texas that has made the decision are the Governor's \nappointees, and they don't have to listen to what these administrative \nlaw judges have said. And the executive director of this commission has \nmade it clear that he won't. The Governor has made it clear that he is \ngoing forward with this.\n  But what we have here is an interesting game. No wonder people get \nangry about politics. What the State of Texas is saying is: Let's just \nput it off and not make the final decision though we know what the \nfinal decision is. We are going to locate this in a community where you \nhave poor people and Hispanic people living. But we will not do that \nright away. Instead, we say we really haven't decided, and therefore we \ncan get people in the Senate and the House of Representatives, we can \ngive them cover, and they can say, ``Oh, no, this isn't about \nenvironmental justice because they haven't selected the site.''\n  I will go through this in a moment. That is an absolute sham. That is \njust a sham.\n  Mr. President, let me be real clear about this. The area that is \nchosen in Texas, not surprisingly, because this is apparent all around \nthe country--poor people always take it on the chin. The communities of \ncolor always take it on the chin. Where are you going to put an \nincinerator? Where are you going to put a waste dump site? It is never \nin our backyard.\n  I would like to know whether any Senator has ever had a nuclear waste \ndump site proposed in his or her backyard or his or her community. And \nwhile I have not taken the survey, I bet the answer is not one.\n  This has to stop. This is an issue of environmental justice. That is \nwhy we are not just going to talk about this tonight. We are going to \ntalk about this tomorrow, regardless of what the vote is.\n  Mr. President, here is what is really troubling about this process. \nWe have been through this over a period of a year. It has been kind of \none-sided, I say to my colleague in the Chair. It has been sort of like \nyou have people--we have some people here tonight from Hudspeth County. \nWe have people from other communities. We have some State legislators. \nWe have people from the community. But you know what, they get to come \nup like once a year maybe. It is a long trip, costs a lot of money. But \nat the same time the utility industry--this isn't about States rights. \nThis is about the utility industry, what the nuclear power industry \nwants, what the energy industry wants, what the big contributors want \nas opposed to the people who live in this community who have precious \nlittle by way of campaign contributions they can make. This is tied to \nreform and precious little clout, except this little community has been \nfighting hard for a year.\n  So what happened here? I came to the floor of the Senate twice and my \ncolleagues agreed. I didn't hear anybody dissent. There was unanimous \nconsent. Twice I came to the floor of the Senate with amendments. One \namendment said let's make it clear that this nuclear waste can only \ncome from Maine, Vermont and Texas. That is what we say it is about. So \nlet's codify that. That amendment was passed in the House of \nRepresentatives as well.\n  The other amendment said if the people of Hudspeth County, as they \nseek redress of grievance, can show that they have been \ndisproportionately targeted because they are Latina, Latino or poor, \nthey should at least have the right to challenge this in court. And my \ncolleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, supported these \namendments.\n  That is exactly what happens when an amendment passes on the floor of \nthe Senate with unanimous consent. But then what do they do? They rely \non the conference committee. I am starting to believe in a unicameral \nlegislature, I really am, because I think the conference committee is \nthe third house of the Congress and there is no accountability. This \nconference committee meets sometime, I don't know, 2 a.m., 1 a.m., \nsometime in the dark of night. Who knows when. And they just bulldoze \nright through and they knock out both amendments. The Senate is on \nrecord twice, first of all, voting for the amendments and then \ninstructions to the conferees to honor the Senate's position.\n  Colleagues, they took those amendments out. And when you vote \ntomorrow, please, remember the Latina and Latino community, please \nremember the organizations, remember the environmental organizations, \nand other organizations I am going to refer to because they are going \nto be watching our vote.\n  Now, it would have been one thing if those amendments had stayed in. \nI think you would have had more support for this compact, or at least \npeople could have said, well, you know what, at least now we know we \nare not going to get the shaft at least in one sense. People wouldn't \nhave wanted it in their community, nor would the Presiding Officer, nor \nwould my colleague from Maine, nor would any Senator here. No Senator \nhere would want this waste dump site in their backyard, not one \nSenator, but it at least would have made this political process look a \nlittle bit more open and maybe a little fairer to people, if we had \nkept the amendments in.\n\n  But, oh, no, the conference committee meets somewhere, sometime and \ntakes them out. So I will tell you, this compact should be defeated.\n  Now, the construction of this nuclear dump in this community raises \nimportant questions of environmental justice. This might be the first \ntime in the history of the Senate we have had a debate about \nenvironmental justice in the Chamber. It is not just the fight for the \npeople of Sierra Blanca or Hudspeth County or west Texas, for that \nmatter. This is a fight for communities all across the country that \ndon't have the political clout, that aren't the well heeled, that \naren't the well connected, that aren't the investors, that aren't the \nbig contributors, and all too often over and over again they are the \nones we dump these sites on. This is a fight for poor people and poor \ncommunities that are rarely consulted.\n\n[[Page S9778]]\n\n  This is a fight for people who are seen not as people who should have \nsome say about their environment and their lives but as victims to be \npreyed upon because they are least able to defend themselves. Except \nthe communities of Hudspeth County, Sierra Blanca, they have made it \nclear they are not victims. They have made it clear they are women and \nmen of worth and dignity and substance, and they have been fighting \nhard.\n  Environmental justice, colleagues, is a difficult issue. Too often \nlegislators and Government officials hide behind the excuse that there \nis nothing we can do about it, that discrimination results from \ndecisions that are made in the private sector, that it is a matter of \nState or local responsibility, that it is too hard to prove. Well, this \ncase is pretty easy. The dump won't be built if we reject this compact. \nWe have a direct responsibility. There is a direct Federal role. We \ncannot wash our hands of this. We cannot go away and pretend that we \nare not to blame. We are all responsible, and it is up to each and \nevery one of us to take a stand.\n  Let me go over some of the arguments. Argument No. 1: The Texas \nCompact raises troubling issues of environmental justice. There is a \nwell-documented tendency for pollution and waste dump sites to be sited \nin poor minority communities that lack the political power to keep them \nout. In this case, the Texas Legislature selected Hudspeth County and \nthe Texas Waste Authority selected the Sierra Blanca site after the \nAuthority, after the Authority's scoping study had already ruled out \nSierra Blanca as scientifically unsuitable.\n  Did you get that? Did you get that, colleagues, or staff, that are \nfollowing this debate? The Texas Waste Authority selected the Sierra \nBlanca site after the Authority's own scoping study had already ruled \nout Sierra Blanca as scientifically unsuitable. Communities near the \nstudy's preferred sites had enough political clout to keep the dump out \nbut Sierra Blanca, already the site of the largest sewage sludge \nproject in the country, was not so fortunate.\n  There you go. There is the calculus. You have this poor Hispanic \ncommunity. They have the largest sewage sludge project in the country. \nWhy not just build a nuclear waste dump site there as well? Sierra \nBlanca is a low-income, Mexican-American community. Over 66 percent of \nthe citizens of Sierra Blanca are Mexican-American and many do not \nspeak English. About 39 percent live below the poverty line. Hudspeth \nCounty is one of the poorest and most heavily Latino areas of Texas. \nUnder the Texas government code, Sierra Blanca is legally classified as \na ``colonia,'' which is an economically distressed area within 150 \nmiles of the Mexican border that possesses inadequate water and sewer \nservices, and this is the community that has been targeted for this \nnuclear waste dump site.\n  Sierra Blanca is already the site of the largest sewage sludge \nproject in the country, and the Environmental Protection Improvement \nCorporation is now asking the Texas environmental agency for a license \nfor yet another sewage sludge project east of Sierra Blanca.\n  Now, I ask my colleagues, I ask the Presiding Officer, if you had the \nlargest sewage sludge project in your community, you are now targeted \nfor another one, and on top of that you would have a nuclear waste dump \nsite also in your community, even though it is a geologically unstable \ncommunity, earthquake area, would you not have some questions about \nthis?\n  I heard my colleagues say somewhere that a judge had won an election \nand, therefore, oh, no, the people there really want it. Look, why \ndon't we just think about this for a moment? Do you really believe \nthat? Do you really believe that? Do you really believe the people in \nany of the communities that we represent would really want a nuclear \nwaste dump site where they live, on top of the largest sewage sludge \nproject in the country? Do you believe that?\n  Mr. President, 20 surrounding counties and 13 nearby cities have \npassed resolutions against it and no city or county in west Texas \nsupports it. I hear one person is elect and that is used as the basis \nfor arguing that the people in the community want it? Give me a break. \nGive me a break. Mr. President, 20 surrounding counties and 13 nearby \ncities have passed resolutions against it and no city or county in west \nTexas supports it. Over 800 adult residents of Sierra Blanca have \nsigned petitions opposing the dump, and a 1992 poll commissioned by the \nTexas Waste Authority showed that 66 percent of the people in Hudspeth \nand Culberson Counties were in opposition. Republican Congressman \nBonilla, who represents Hudspeth County, and Democratic Congressman \nCiro Rodriguez, who represent neighboring El Paso and San Antonio, have \nall actively opposed the Sierra Blanca dump. And we are being told the \npeople support it?\n  In an October 1994 statewide poll, 82 percent of Texans were against \nit--82 percent. Earlier this month, 1,500 U.S. and Mexican citizens, \nincluding Texas State Representatives and Senators and Representatives \nfrom Mexico, marched from the Mexican border to Sierra Blanca, through \nscorching desert heat--and it has been hot in Texas--to protest the \ndump. Local residents have had no say over whether the waste dump \nshould be constructed in Sierra Blanca; no say. They never were \nconsulted at any stage in the process, but rather they were informed \nafter the fact. Each time the waste authority or the legislature \nselected Hudspeth County for a dump site, and especially after local \nresidents had already won a court case to reverse the selection of Fort \nHancock, the news took local residents by complete surprise. At no \nstage in the site selection process were the residents of Sierra Blanca \ninvolved in the decisionmaking.\n  Now, I said this is an environmental justice question. Listen to \nthis, and I will come back with this tomorrow morning again. A 1984 \npublic opinion survey commissioned by the Texas Waste Authority \nprovides some real useful context for how this has all taken place. The \nreport is called, ``An Analysis of Public Opinion on Low-Level \nRadioactive Waste Disposal in Selected Areas.'' This report goes on to \ntalk about the benefits of keeping the Latinos uninformed:\n\n       One population that may benefit from [a public information] \n     campaign is Hispanics, particularly those with little formal \n     education and low incomes. This group is the least informed \n     of all segments of the population. . .. The Authority should \n     be aware, however, that increasing the level of knowledge of \n     Hispanics may simply increase opposition to the [radioactive \n     dump] site, inasmuch as we have discovered a strong \n     relationship in the total sample between increased perceived \n     knowledge and increased opposition.\n\n  I'll tell you what, I would be ashamed to be a decisionmaker in any \nkind of process, any kind of consulting report, saying: Better not have \nthese Latinos informed because there is a strong correlation between \nthe amount of their perceived knowledge and their increased opposition.\n\n  Well, I guess so. I guess, if every Senator had knowledge of a \nnuclear waste dump site that was going to be dumped in his or her \nbackyard, the more he or she knew, the more likely they would be in \nopposition. And we are being told the people in the community just \ncan't wait to have this. There is a danger. I am in profound \ndisagreement with my colleagues that this poor Hispanic community could \nbecome a national repository for low-level radioactive waste. We are \nbeing told that this will be their savior, this compact will protect \nthem from becoming a national repository.\n  The conference report--and if my colleagues have any information or \nfacts that contradict what I am about to say, I would certainly \nappreciate hearing it--the conference report on H.R. 629 would allow \nappointed compact commissioners to import radioactive waste from any \nState or territory. They have it within their authority to do so. There \nis no language that prohibits them from doing so. And both the State of \nTexas and nuclear utilities across the country will have an economic \nincentive to bring in as much waste as possible to make the dump \neconomically viable and to reduce the disposal costs.\n  Let me be clear about it again. This conference report does not have \none word that would prohibit the appointed compact commissioners from \nimporting radioactive waste from any State or territory in the country. \nIf you had not stripped out our amendment, which the Senate unanimously \nsupported twice, which said that the waste can\n\n[[Page S9779]]\n\nonly come from Texas and Vermont and Maine, then there would be some \nprotection of this kind. Not any longer. Don't be making the argument \nthat this Compact, stripped of the protection for people, now provides \npeople with the protection.\n  Section 3.05, Paragraph 6 of the Compact provides that the Compact \nCommission may enter into an agreement with any person, State, regional \nbody or group of States for importation of low-level radioactive waste. \nShall I repeat that, because I have heard it said on the floor of the \nSenate that this Compact is great because it protects people from \nbecoming a national repository site? Section 3.05, Paragraph 6 of the \nCompact provides that the Compact Commission may enter into an \nagreement with any person, State, regional body or group of States for \nimportation of low-level radioactive waste. All it requires is a \nmajority vote of the eight unelected compact commissioners. And the \nconference committee--and I know the Senators from the States out here \nwere part of this--stripped away the amendment that said it could only \ncome from Texas, Maine or Vermont.\n  Mr. President, according to the Texas Observer, March 28, 1997:\n\n       More than two or three national dumps will drive fees so \n     low that profit margins anticipated by States (and now \n     private investors) will be threatened. This economic \n     reality--and growing public resistance to new dumps--has \n     raised the very real possibility that the next dump permitted \n     will be the nuclear waste depository for the whole nation, \n     for decades to come.\n\n  They could very well be right, and you know what? They could not have \nmade that argument about what is about to happen to the people of \nSierra Blanca if the conference committee had kept in our amendment. \nBut, no, no. The utility industry, they know what the potential of this \nis. They didn't want that. The conference committee stripped the House \nand Senate environmental justice amendments.\n  To avoid turning this low-income Mexican-American community into a \nnational depository for radioactive waste, I offered two amendments. \nThe first would have given local residents the chance to prove \nenvironmental discrimination in court, and the second, as I have said \nthree times or more, would have limited incoming waste to the States of \nTexas, Maine and Vermont. My colleagues, in the dark of night in \nconference committee, decided that it would be a crime to give local \nresidents a chance to prove environmental discrimination in court. And \nmy colleagues, in the dark of night in conference committee, decided \nthat it would be a crime to make sure that we codified in language our \nclaim that the waste would only come from Maine and Vermont and Texas.\n  The Senate instructed conferees to insist on these amendments, but \nthe conference ignored the Senate's instructions and stripped them both \nand that is why Senators should vote against this compact. The \nconference committee even stripped the amendment limiting the waste to \nthree States, despite the fact that this provision was passed by both \nthe Senate and the House. Mr. President, we have a national \nresponsibility to remedy this injustice, especially since Congress \nwould be complicit in construction of this dump.\n  This is not a purely State and local issue. I have heard this \nargument made: This is a State or local issue; we have no business \nbeing involved. Of course we do. We are being asked to vote on it.\n  Then this argument that is being made, which I will get to in a \nmoment, is, ``Well, wait a moment, there is no waste dump site for sure \nthat has been selected.'' Do you know what? If you want to make this \nargument, why are we pressing for a vote on this compact? It is one of \ntwo ways: Either colleagues can come out here and they can say, ``You \nknow what? Now these administrative judges have issued a report, and \nthey should have, and what they said is correct saying this is a \ngeologically unstable area. And so maybe, Senator Wellstone, all that \nyou are talking about, about the injustice of this waste dump site \nbeing put right on top of a poor Hispanic community, may not happen, \nbecause we haven't really decided.'' So say some people right now in \nthis debate. I heard it from my colleagues tonight. If that is the \ncase, we shouldn't vote on this yet. Let's wait and see, and then we \nwill know what is in the compact and we will know exactly where this \nhas been sited.\n  Or, we have to vote no, because if you vote yes, you are complicit in \nthe construction of this dump. And I want to tell you, the siting \nprocess is outrageous. This siting process that took place in Texas is \noutrageous. It is an affront to anybody's sense of justice. This is not \na purely State or local issue, because we have to vote on it.\n  For constitutional reasons, the Texas compact cannot take effect \nwithout Federal legislation. Senators from all 50 States, not just the \ncompact States, will be asked to give their consent.\n  Mr. President, in the El Paso Times of May 28, 1998, Governor Bush \nsaid:\n\n       If there's not a Compact in place, we will not move \n     forward.\n\n  In an interview published April 5-11, El Paso, Inc., Governor Bush \nsaid:\n\n       The legislation would approve the Compact between Texas, \n     Maine and Vermont. If that does not happen, then all bets are \n     off.\n\n  Moreover, the Texas Legislature has indicated it will not fund \nconstruction without the upfront money from the compact.\n  The Texas Waste Authority requested over $37 million for fiscal year \n1998-1999 for construction of the dump, but the legislature allocated \nno construction money. They did not appropriate funding for the \nlicensing process and for payments for the host county after the House \nzeroed out funding for the authority altogether.\n  Congress is responsible for this dump. If you will, this dump site \nhas been dumped on the Congress, it has been dumped on the Senate. \nConstruction of the Sierra Blanca dump depends upon the enactment of \nthe conference report to H.R. 629. If the Senate rejects it, Texas will \nnot build a dump in Sierra Blanca. But within 60 days of its enactment, \nMaine and Vermont will pay Texas $25 million to begin construction.\n  We wouldn't even be having this battle if these amendments had been \nkept in. I wouldn't have liked it. I would have still had questions \nabout this, but I would have thought at least there was some sense of \nfairness and justice. I want every one of my colleagues to know, you \nvoted, we voted unanimously, to make sure that we made it clear that, \nindeed, this waste could only come from Maine, Vermont, and Texas, and \nwe voted unanimously that the people should have a right to \nprove discrimination in court.\n\n  But now, that has been taken out in conference committee. So you have \nthe compact without any of the protections for people. You have the \ncompact, with all of its injustice, and it is simple: If you vote \nagainst it, then you are voting against Texas building a dump site, a \nnuclear waste dump site in Sierra Blanca, which is an environmental \ninjustice. If you vote for it, then within 60 days of enactment, Maine \nand Vermont will pay Texas $25 million to begin construction. If my \ncolleagues want to say, ``Paul, we agree this isn't right, what is \nbeing done to these people, but you don't know for sure it is going to \nbe this site,'' then I say, ``Why don't we postpone this vote? Why are \nyou so anxious to ram it through?''\n  I heard about other compacts. There are two points. First of all, \nother compacts, other compacts, fine, but the issue at hand is this \ncompact, this site selection.\n  Mr. President, this whole argument about, ``Well, we don't really \nknow the specific site,'' again, the administrative judge's decision is \nnot binding. That is point No. 1. The Texas environmental agency's \nGovernor appointees are not bound by this at all. They are all \nappointed by the Governor. They can do whatever they want. The views of \nthis agency, as I said before, which will make the decision, are known. \nThe executive director argued against the hearing officer's \nrecommendation. He said:\n\n       Additional information on ``special impact'' [i.e., \n     environmental justice] is not needed to make a decision on \n     the license application. The executive director recommends \n     issuance of a license because the applicant has met all the \n     requirements under the law.\n\n  We know what they are going to do. Come on, let's just be direct \nabout this. The Governor's views are known. I have quoted him.\n  And then there is the box law. I say to my colleagues, you need to \nknow the specifics of what you are voting on\n\n[[Page S9780]]\n\nhere. The Texas Legislature selected Hudspeth County to host the dump \nin 1991, and the Texas Waste Authority identified a dump site near \nSierra Blanca in 1992. The 1991 box law is still on the books, and \nregardless of what the TNRCC does, the box law requires that the dump \nbe built in Hudspeth County, which is predominantly Hispanic and poor.\n  I want to make that clear--I want to make that clear--that is where \nit is going to be built, and it is an environmental injustice. It is \ntime we stand up against this kind of injustice. This is not the \ndecision of the people of Maine or the decision of Vermont, but this is \nwhat is going to happen.\n  Mr. President, this conference report is about nuclear utility \nrights, not State or local rights. The conference committee followed \nthe wishes of the nuclear utilities, not the local residents. Nuclear \nutilities who stand to benefit from cheap disposal of nuclear waste \nstrongly supported this legislation without amendments. Local \nresidents, including the local Republican Congressmen, overwhelmingly \nopposed the dump.\n  Of course, the utility industry got their way in conference \ncommittee. We know their clout here. They never wanted people \nanywhere--it is not, in all due respect to the people who are here \ntonight from Hudspeth County, it is not just you. This industry doesn't \nwant regular citizens anywhere in the country to have a right to prove \ndiscrimination. And this industry has big plans for Hudspeth County as \na national repository for waste, so they didn't want any amendment \nmaking it clear it could only come from Maine or Vermont or Texas.\n  Mr. President, I think that I might have said enough for tonight, or \nmaybe not. We will see how the debate goes. I will have tomorrow \nmorning to speak about this as well.\n  I have not, in all due respect, heard one argument on the floor of \nthe Senate that is very persuasive. It is just simply not true this \ncompact is all about giving people the protection from being a national \nrepository site. It is simply not true that this is just sort of \nmedical waste from hospitals, it is gloves. It is simply not true this \nis simply low level so we don't have to worry about it. It is simply \nnot true that this is none of our business. This is a civil rights \nissue.\n  Let me conclude by including some quotes, if I can find them.\n  Mr. President, I will do the quotes tomorrow. It is a civil rights \nissue. That is what this is all about. This is the issue that we have \nbeen talking about. As a matter of fact, this is an issue of, every \ntime we are faced with a situation about where a nuclear waste site \ngoes, a dump site goes, or incinerator--and the list goes on and on--\nthen what happens is communities of color, low-income communities, are \nthe ones that are targeted. That is exactly what has happened in Texas.\n  We had amendments that would have provided some protection. The \nSenate went on record. Every Senator supported those amendments, and \nthen they were stripped out of conference committee. That is why \nSenators should vote against this.\n  Mr. President, I just want to make it clear that the League of United \nLatin American Citizens, LULAC, is adamantly opposed to this. I believe \nthey are going to use this for scoring. That is important. By golly, \npeople in the Latino community ought to hold every Senator accountable \nfor their vote on this. It is a civil rights issue. There is a strong \nletter from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights in favor of both \nour amendments which were stripped out of the conference committee in \nthe dark of night. The House Hispanic caucus favored the amendments \nopposed to this compact, the Texas NAACP, League of Conservation \nVoters. This is a major issue of justice, and it is a major \nenvironmental issue as well.\n  I conclude by urging my colleagues to vote against this compact. And \non the floor of the Senate tonight and tomorrow morning I will also \nmake an appeal to the administration: Mr. President, Mr. Vice \nPresident, we need you to speak out on this. You have talked about \nenvironmental justice. You have said it is a major priority. What is \nhappening with this compact, what is now being proposed--just think of \nwhat this is going to mean for the people who live in Sierra Blanca. If \nthere is ever one example that brings into sharp focus the issue of \nenvironmental justice, this is it. We need the President to make it \nclear that if this should pass, he will veto it. This compact should \nnot pass in its present form.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I will just make a few brief concluding \ncomments in response to some of the issues that were raised by the \nSenator from Minnesota. I respect his views and his opinions although \nwe certainly differ on the perspective on this issue. This isn't a \nunique or different approach to this issue of the disposal of low-level \nradioactive waste. Indeed, the U.S. Congress mandated that the States \nassume the responsibility of the disposal of low-level radioactive \nwaste in or out of their States. And this is in response to a \ncongressional mandate that began in 1980 and, as I said earlier, \nreinforced by amendments to that act in 1985.\n  So this isn't a diversion from that approach. It isn't different from \nall of the other compacts that have been ratified by the Congress over \ntime. And, as I said earlier, there are nine different compacts, that \ninclude 41 different States, including the State of Minnesota, the \nState that the Senator represents. So why should Texas and Maine and \nVermont be any different?\n  The Senator referred to some of the amendments that he had offered to \nthis legislation, but they did not prevail. Those amendments did not \nprevail because those conditions and stipulations would require years \nof reratification. And I mention the fact that those conditions were \nnot included in any of the other nine compacts that were enacted and \nratified by the Congress over the years.\n  We all respect the Senator's perspective on the issue of \nenvironmental justice. No one is suggesting for a moment that we should \noverride the environmental issues, any of the issues that would \nadversely, and disproportionately adversely, affect a community with \nrespect to public health and safety questions, environmental issues, or \nincome.\n  We believe in the State of Texas--through its procedures, through its \npublic procedures, through its political process, through its State \nlaws, through the Federal laws--to make the appropriate decision, \nenvironmentally and scientifically and geologically, in terms of the \nsafe disposal of low-level radioactive waste. That is the issue here. \nAnd we are doing this consistent with all of the other compacts and all \nof the other statutes that have been enacted by the U.S. Congress over \nthe last 20 years.\n  In fact, I was in the House of Representatives back in 1980 when this \nwas a major question: How do we resolve it? It is not an easy question. \nIt is not as if we do not have low-level radioactive waste. We have a \nproblem, as we do with high-level radioactive waste. But we have \nhospitals and we have research laboratories, and we have to dispose of \nthe materials that result from those facilities; we have no choice. And \nthat is why we have this compact before the U.S. Senate, as do so many \nof the other States.\n  Forty-one States, including the Senator's own State of Minnesota, \nhave a compact. But now we are saying Texas and Vermont and Maine are \nnot allowed to enter into a compact? Are we saying that the Governor of \nthe State of Texas or the legislature, the house and the senate, are \nnot concerned with the views of their constituencies with respect to \nthis issue?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Are we saying that senators and representatives are not \nconcerned with the views of the constituents who live in Sierra Blanca \nor any other locations where these facilities are sited? Are we trying \nto override the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, that are all referenced, I might add, in the \nconference report? None of this can be sited anywhere on Earth without \nregard to environmental and public health and safety questions. It has \nto go through a process.\n  In fact, the Senator from Minnesota mentioned two administrative law\n\n[[Page S9781]]\n\njudges in Texas who have been conducting evidentiary hearings on the \nlicense application to construct and operate this disposal site. And \nthe judges issued a proposal for decision on the application in \nHudspeth County saying they needed more information in two aspects of \nthe potential site. And the appropriate Texas agency is now taking the \nrecommendation under consideration and responding on the safety \nquestion. And the judges want more information as to whether there are \nany negative socioeconomic impacts in this facility to the citizens and \nto tourism. So environmental justice is being considered. This isn't \nignoring those issues. That is why this legislation is site-neutral, \nbecause we want the appropriate agencies and statutes at the Federal, \nState and local levels to take hold and determine what is the safest \nlocation, respecting the wishes of a community.\n\n  Now, the Senator mentioned the people who don't support it in \nHudspeth County. We don't even know, in the final analysis, if that is \nwhere it is going to be. That is up to the State of Texas through its \nprocess. That has been stipulated in law in terms of what they have to \nconsider.\n  It says:\n\n       Nothing in this compact that diminishes or otherwise \n     impairs the jurisdiction, authority, discretion of the either \n     the following: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the \n     Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Nothing in the compact confers any \n     new authority to the State commission to do any of the \n     following: Regulate the packaging or transportation of low-\n     level waste, regulate the health, safety and environmental \n     hazards from source byproducts and special nuclear materials, \n     or inspect the activities of licensees of the agreement of \n     the States or U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\n  All of it is in place, just like it has been done for 41 other States \nover the years. That is what we are talking about. We are not saying we \nare going to run roughshod over anybody's wishes or rights. That is a \ndetermination that has to be made with the State of Texas through the \npublic process, which has been done and is continuing at this moment. \nThat is what we are asking.\n  So I hope that my colleagues will support the conference report, \nwhich is not unusual, not unlike any of the 9 previous compacts that \nhave been ratified by the Congress over the last 20 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, Mr. President, I want to say to my \ncolleague that this waste disposal compact is not functional. We have \nno nuclear waste dump sites that have been chosen. I am not sure how \nmany of these compacts have ever chosen a dump site. I don't know \nwhether my colleague knows the answer to that question. I don't, but I \nam guessing it's very few, if any. Let me be clear about that. I am not \naware that any of these compacts have led to nuclear waste dump sites. \nIf so, I bet it is precious few.\n  I'm confused. On the one hand, we hear some discussion on the floor \nof the Senate about how we look at the selection by this person. Do the \npeople in the community really want this? Then we hear that it may not \neven be in Hudspeth County. I spent 45 minutes going through the \nbackground of this, all the way from when the legislature made the \ndecision in 1991. Of course it is going to be there. I went through all \nthe quotes. Yes, you have some administrative judges. I ask my \ncolleague, if you are convinced that we don't know what the site is \nyet--and, of course, one difference between this and any other compact \nis that we didn't have sites before--then why don't we wait for a vote \non this until we know where the site is? That would be the best thing \nto do. That would be a fair thing to do.\n  Commissioner John Hall, by the way, in talking about the issue of \nenvironmental justice--my colleague says, of course, the people are \nconcerned about this--made it very clear that this issue isn't going to \nbe addressed in the State licensing process. It has not been addressed \nand will not be before the final license is issued. My colleague may \nwant to think otherwise because it is more comforting, but it is just \nnot the case.\n  The commissioners of the Texas administrative agency, TNRCC, which \nwill make the final decision on the Sierra Blanca license, have stated \nthat environmental justice must be addressed at the Federal level \nbecause Texas has no clear standards or requirements for evaluating \nthem. Commissioner John Hall explained at a 1995 meeting of the TNRCC, \n``This whole issue probably needs to be addressed. But it is not this \ncommission's job to articulate a new major policy of that sort. That \nhas to be left to the United States Congress. That is not our job. Our \njob is to apply the standards as they exist, and while that may be a \nvery legitimate issue, that is not our job.''\n  You just can't have it both ways. People in Texas say, and the \nCommissioner says, ``We are not going to be dealing with this issue of \nenvironmental justice.'' I went through the process. They came across \nHudspeth County and moved it away from other sites where people had \nclout. They have chosen a geologically unstable area. I have all sorts \nof religious and civil rights organizations who say this discriminates \nagainst people in the community who are disproportionately poor or who \nare Hispanic as well. The executive director of the TNRCC explained in \nhis motion to strike that ``environmental justice is not one of the \ncriteria to be considered under the Texas Radiation Control Act or the \nrules of the TNRCC in the commission's decision whether to license the \nfacility.'' They are not looking at that at all. They are saying they \ncan't. They are saying it is up to us. I had two amendments that my \ncolleague from Maine supported--it was unanimous consent, and any \nSenator who wanted to disagree could have come to the floor and \ndisagreed--which said people ought to at least have a right to prove \ndiscrimination if there is discrimination, and let's make sure this \nonly comes from Maine, Vermont and Texas. Both of those amendments, at \nthe wishes of the utility industry, were taken out in committee.\n  I am saying to colleagues one more time--vote for this and you just \nwatch. I will bet you every dollar I have, which isn't a lot, if we \nvote for this compact, that dump site will be located in this Hispanic, \nlow-income community. I will bet you there is not one Senator in here \nwho would want to make a bet with me on that. That is what this is all \nabout. Don't be fooled. The amendments were stripped out. This compact \nnow is a major injustice. It could have been a much better agreement, \nbut somebody--and I don't even know who--decided they wanted to take \nout these amendments. Now it is up to colleagues in the Senate to vote \nagainst this. Otherwise, you will be voting for a major injustice. You \nwill be voting for what I consider to be a violation of the civil \nrights of the people that live in Hudspeth County.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I have concluded my remarks for \ntonight.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to support the conference \nreport to H.R. 629, the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal \nCompact, a Compact among the states of Texas, Maine, and Vermont. The \nTexas Compact which was introduced in the House by Representative \nBarton and has 23 cosponsors, and the conference report to the Compact, \nboth passed the House overwhelmingly with bi-partisan support. I am \nconfident that the conference report to the Texas Compact will now pass \nthis body with the same commanding support it garnered in the House.\n  In July of this year, I was a Conferee to the Texas Compact along \nwith Senators Thurmond and Leahy. I thank Senators Thurmond and Leahy, \nCongressman Bliley who chaired the conference, and all other conferees \nfor working together to accomplish the goal of passing the Texas \nCompact through conference without any unnecessary or distracting \namendments that would have forced the Compact States to go through an \narduous re-ratification process. After thorough consultation with the \ngovernors of the Compact States, the conferees unanimously agreed to \nrecede from two amendments that were offered by Senator Wellstone. The \nWellstone amendments would have spawned costly litigation and imposed \nstrict limitation not imposed on other existing compacts. The conferees \nultimately concluded that the amendments were not in the best interests \nof the Texas Compact.\n  The passage of this Compact will place the States of Texas, Maine, \nand\n\n[[Page S9782]]\n\nVermont in compliance with the 1980 Low-level Radioactive Waste Policy \nAct which Congress passed in an effort to establish a uniform Federal \npolicy on nuclear waste disposal. While the Federal Government retained \nresponsibility over high-level waste disposal, this act placed the onus \non the States to dispose properly of low-level radioactive waste \ngenerated within their borders.\n  To promote and encourage the fulfillment of this obligation by all \nStates, Congress authorized the States to enter into compacts with \nother States to share waste disposal facilities. It is pursuant to this \nobligation and mandate that the Texas-Maine-Vermont Compact was \nnegotiated and approved by the legislatures of Texas and Vermont and \nthrough a public referendum in the State of Maine. The compact was \nsubsequently signed by the governors of all three states.\n  Currently, nine interstate compacts involving 41 States are operating \nthrough Congressional consent. I have received a letter signed by the \nGovernors of Texas, Maine, and Vermont urging Congress to pass this \ncompact as passed by the States. This compact would bring these states \ninto compliance with federal law. The hard work for drafting a compact \nthat all three states would ratify and that would meet with \ncongressional approval has been completed for some time. The States \nhave carefully crafted a compact that will serve their low-level waste \ndisposal needs in a responsible and lawful manner.\n  The States have done their part and have been patiently waiting for \ncongressional consent before moving forward with plans to construct the \nwaste disposal facility. It is now time for this body to do its part in \nassuring that this compact will be passed swiftly without further \ndelay. I therefore support this important piece of legislation, and \nencourage my colleague to do the same.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 40 minutes equally divided and \nreserved for tomorrow. Both sides are yielding back the balance of the \ntime for tonight?\n  Ms. SNOWE. That's correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That's correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/01/senate-section/article/S9772-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE.

Mr. President, this morning I missed the vote on the \nFiscal Year 1999 Military Construction Appropriations Conference \nReport, which this body approved by a wide margin. I missed the vote \ndue to a long airline delay--a delay especially vexing to me because I \nhad scheduled my departure from South Carolina to arrive here in plenty \nof time to vote on this legislation. Had I been here, I would have been \nproud to cast an ``aye'' vote for this bill.\n  As a combat veteran, I'm convinced a strong and vigorous military is \nvital to our nation's security and interests. The Military Construction \nAppropriations Conference Report is crucial to strengthening our armed \nforces, and it is tremendously important to the people of South \nCarolina.\n  I was proud to work with fellow Appropriations Committee members to \nsecure additional money for projects at the Parris Island Marine Corps \nRecruit Depot, McEntire Air National Guard Station, Spartanburg Air \nNational Guard Center, Beaufort Marine Air Corps Station, and \nCharleston Air Force Base. In addition to strengthening our military, \nthese projects will help the brave men and women in uniform who serve \non these bases and their dependents.\n  I was proud to help make the 1999 Military Construction \nAppropriations Conference Report a reality, and I'm pleased to see it \napproved today by the Senate.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, with regards to this morning's vote on \nthe military construction appropriations conference report, vote number \n253, I would like the Record to show that had I been present I would \nhave voted aye. This bill provides important funding for military \nconstruction projects across the country, including a number of \nprojects at military installations in Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/01/senate-section/article/S9782-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The following bill, previously received from the House of \nRepresentatives for the concurrence of the Senate, was read the first \nand second times by unanimous consent and referred as indicated:\n\n       H.R. 3696.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish a national cemetery for veterans in the Atlanta, Georgia, \nmetropolitan area; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                     national cemetery legislation\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today I am pleased to offer an important\n\n[[Page S9783]]\n\npiece of legislation designed to address a critical need of Georgia's \nveterans and their families.\n  One of the greatest honors our country provides for a veteran's \nservice is the opportunity to be buried in a national cemetery. It is \nlogical that a veteran's family would want to have the grave site of \ntheir loved one close by. They want to be able to visit to place \nflowers or a folded American flag by the headstone of their father, \nmother, sister or brother. Georgia veterans' families deserve such \nconsideration. The establishment of a new veterans national cemetery in \nthe Atlanta metropolitan area is one of my highest legislative \npriorities.\n  The current veterans population in Georgia is estimated to be nearly \n700,000, with over 400,000 residing in the Metro Atlanta area. Our \nstate currently has two cemeteries designated specifically for \nveterans, in Marietta and Andersonville. Marietta National Cemetery has \nbeen full since 1970, and Andersonville National Historic Cemetery is \nlocated in southwest Georgia, at a considerable distance from most of \nthe state's veterans population.\n  The large population of veterans' families in Metro Atlanta and North \nGeorgia is not being served, and we need to change that.\n  Abraham Lincoln once said: ``All that a man hath will he give for his \nlife; and while all contribute of their substance the soldier puts his \nlife at stake, and often yields it up in his country's cause. The \nhighest merit, then, is due to the soldier.''\n  We owe it to our veterans and their families to provide a national \nveterans cemetery close to their home.\n  I have been pursuing this matter for over 20 years, since I was head \nof the Veterans' Administration, now called the Department of Veterans' \nAffairs. Nationally, there are over 300,000 vacancies in national \ncemeteries for veterans, but in Georgia, there are no such vacancies. \nThe only option these veterans have is burial in Andersonville, a \nnational historic cemetery which is operated by the National Park \nService, not the VA, and is more than 100 miles away from the Metro \nAtlanta area. This deeply concerns me, especially when one considers \nthat Georgia has the highest rate of growth in terms of military \nretirees in the Nation, and that the majority of these veterans reside \nin Metro Atlanta. We really must do better for our veterans.\n  In 1979, when I was head of the VA, our studies documented that the \nAtlanta metropolitan area was the area having the largest veterans \npopulation in the country without a national cemetery. Later that same \nyear, I announced that Metro Atlanta had been chosen as the site for a \nnew VA cemetery, which was to be opened in late 1983. The Atlanta \nlocation was chosen after an exhaustive review of many sites, including \nconsideration of environmental, access, and land use factors, and most \nimportantly, the density of veterans population. Unfortunately, the \nReagan Administration later withdrew approval of the Atlanta site. Over \nthe years since then, Atlanta has repeatedly been one of the top areas \nin the United States most in need of an additional national cemetery.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today is simple. First, it \nrequires the Department of Veterans Affairs to establish a national \ncemetery in the Atlanta metropolitan area not later than January 1, \n2000. Second, it requires the Department to consult with appropriate \nfederal, state, and local officials to determine the most suitable \nsite. Finally, the bill further requires the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs to report to Congress on the establishment of the cemetery, \nincluding an estimate on its cost and a timetable for completion of the \ncemetery.\n  I believe this bill is a necessary first step toward the eventual \nestablishment of a national cemetery to meet the needs of Atlanta's \nveterans and their families. Admittedly, several factors must be \nresolved before the cemetery can be established. A site must be found \nand funding must be made available. However, we must move swiftly to \nresolve this problem so that a critical element of our commitment to \nthe Nation's veterans can be met.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will take favorable action on my bill \nearly in the next Congress. I want to thank my colleague from Georgia, \nSenator Coverdell, for joining me in this important effort, and \nRepresentative Barr for sponsoring the companion bill in the other \nbody.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2429\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     establish, in accordance with chapter 24 of title 38, United \n     States Code, a national cemetery in the Atlanta, Georgia, \n     metropolitan area to serve the needs of veterans and their \n     families.\n       (b) Consultation in Selection of Site.--Before selecting \n     the site for the national cemetery established under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall consult with--\n       (1) appropriate officials of the State of Georgia and local \n     officials of the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area, and\n       (2) appropriate officials of the United States, including \n     the Administrator of General Services, with respect to land \n     belonging to the United States in that area that would be \n     suitable to establish the national cemetery under subsection \n     (a).\n       (c) Report.--As soon as practicable after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress \n     a report on the establishment of the national cemetery under \n     subsection (a). The report shall set forth a schedule for \n     such establishment and an estimate of the costs associated \n     with such establishment.\n       (d) Deadline.--The Secretary shall complete the \n     establishment of the national cemetery under subsection (a) \n     not later than January 1, 2000.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I am proud to join my esteemed \ncolleague from Georgia, Senator Cleland, in introducing this very \nimportant piece of legislation authorizing a new National Cemetery in \nthe Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area. For many years Georgia has had \na pressing need for a new national cemetery for veterans. Now, with the \nleadership of my friend from Georgia who, I might add, has been working \nto make this a reality for about twenty years, and with the \nintroduction of this legislation, I believe we can finally build this \nmuch needed cemetery.\n  Mr. President, Georgia has one of the fastest growing veterans \npopulations in the country. Currently, about 700,000 veterans call \nGeorgia home with well over half, about 440,000, living in the Metro-\nAtlanta region; the area where this new cemetery would be built. \nHowever, the only national cemetery in the area has been full since \n1970. Furthermore, the only other veterans cemetery in the state is \noperated by the National Parks Service, not the Department of Veterans' \nAffairs, and is in Andersonville, a town in southwest Georgia far from \nthe concentration of Georgia veterans.\n  Mr. President, I believe my colleague has clearly demonstrated to us \nall further justification for a new national cemetery in Georgia. VA \nstudies have concurred the need for this cemetery and, in fact, Atlanta \nwas chosen as a site for a new cemetery in 1983. Again, Senator Cleland \nmakes all this clear and I thank him for his dedication to this \nproject.\n  Burial in a national cemetery is a deserving honor for our nation's \nveterans, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to bestow upon \nthem, especially in Georgia. This bipartisan legislation seeks to \nremedy this situation. Mr. President, by focusing on areas across the \ncountry with pressing needs for more burial slots, Congress can \nincrease access to the honor of burial in a national cemetery. Georgia \nis such an area. By passing this measure, Congress would help veterans, \nand their families, find a burial place befitting their patriotic \nservice to this great land.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for Mr. Biden, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Helms, Mr. Stevens, \n        Mr. Cochran, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Specter, Mr. \n        Faircloth, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Ford):\n  S. J. Res. 55. A joint resolution requesting the President to advance \nthe late Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel on the retired list of the Navy \nto the highest grade held as Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, \nduring World War II, and to advance the late Major General Walter C. \nShort on the retired list of the Army to the highest grade held as \nCommanding General, Hawaiian Department, during World\n\n[[Page S9784]]\n\nWar II, as was done under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 for all \nother senior officers who served impositions of command during World \nWar II, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n  joint resolution relative to rear admiral husband kimmel and major \n                          general walter short\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, on Wednesday, September 2, 1998 the \nU.S.S. Missouri, arguably our nation's most famous battleship, will be \npermanently berthed at Pearl Harbor. The Missouri, with its remarkable \nand gallant history of naval combat in the United States Navy, will \nserve as a fitting monument to those Americans who fought and died in \nthe name of freedom, liberty, and justice.\n  However, I must confess that the remembrance of the events \nsurrounding the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor also rekindles a \npainful memory of one of the great injustices that occurred within our \nown ranks during World War II, an injustice that still remains, an \ninjustice that continues to tarnish our nation's military honor.\n  Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short were the two senior \ncommanders of U.S. military forces deployed in the Pacific at the time \nof the disastrous surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. In the immediate \naftermath of the attack, these two commanders were unfairly held \nsingularly responsible for the success of the attack. They were \nscapegoated.\n  First, they were publicly accused of dereliction of duty by a hastily \nconducted investigation. Then, when subsequent investigations conducted \nduring World War II exonerated these officers, those findings were kept \nsecret on the grounds that they undercut the war effort.\n  But, what is most unforgivable is that after the end of World War II, \nthis scapegoating was given a near permanent veneer when the President \nof the United States declined to advance Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort on the retired list to their highest ranks of war-time command--\nan honor that was given to every other senior commander who served in \nwar-time positions above their grade. As Commander-in-Chief of the \nPacific and United States Fleets, Admiral Kimmel, a two star, served as \na four star commander. Major General Short, also a two star, served as \na three star commander when he was the Commanding General of the Army's \nHawaiian Department.\n  Today, this singular exclusion from advancement on the military's \nretired list only perpetuates the myth that Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort were derelict in their duty and singularly responsible for the \nsuccess of the attack on Pearl Harbor. This is a distinct and \nunacceptable expression of dishonor toward two of the finest officers \nwho have served in the Armed Forces of the United States. It is clearly \ninconsistent with the most basic notion of fairness and justice. Such \nscapegoating is inconsistent with this great nation's unmatched \nmilitary honor.\n  It is high time that this injustice suffered by General Short and \nAdmiral Kimmel be rectified. Toward that end, I introduce on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Biden, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nthe Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, the Chairman of the Veterans Committee and \nSenators Inouye, Cochran, Hollings, Faircloth and Durbin, a joint \nresolution intended to right this longstanding injustice.\n  The joint resolution calls upon the President to posthumously advance \non the retirement list Major General Short's grade to Lieutenant \nGeneral--his rank of command as Commanding General of the Army's \nHawaiian Department and Rear Admiral Kimmel's grade to Admiral--his \nrank of command as Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet.\n  The facts that constitute the case of Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort have been remarkably documented over time--which is one the \nreasons that I am disappointed that after fifty-seven years this \ninjustice has not been rectified.\n  Since the attack on Pearl Harbor back in December of 1941, there have \nbeen numerous investigations and histories on the job performance of \nKimmel and Short. These include nine official governmental \ninvestigations and reports and one inquiry conducted by a special Joint \nCongressional Committee. Findings of six of these inquiries are noted \nin the resolution.\n  Perhaps the most flawed, and unfortunately most influential \ninvestigation, was that of the Roberts Commission. Less than 6 weeks \nafter the Pearl Harbor attack, it presented a hastily prepared report \nto the President accusing Kimmel and Short of dereliction of duty--a \ncharge that was immediately and highly publicized.\n  Admiral William Harrison Standley, who served as a member of the \nRoberts Commission later and disavowed its report, stated that Admiral \nKimmel and General Short were ``martyred'' and ``if they had been \nbrought to trial, they would have been cleared of the charge.''\n  Later, Admiral J.O. Richardson, who was Admiral Kimmel's predecessor \nas Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, wrote:\n\n       In the impression that the Roberts Commission created in \n     the minds of the American people, and in the way it was drawn \n     up for that specific purpose, I believe that the report of \n     the Roberts Commission was the most unfair, unjust, and \n     deceptively dishonest document ever printed by the Government \n     Printing Office.\n\n  The highly publicized accusation of that infamous investigation \ncontributed to the inaccurate myth that these two officers were \nsingularly responsible for the success of the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n  Since 1941 a number of official investigations provided clear \nevidence that these two commanders were unfairly singled out for blame \nthat should have been widely shared with their senior commanders. These \nreports include, among others, a 1944 Navy Court of Inquiry, a 1944 \nArmy Pearl Harbor Board of Investigation, a 1946 Joint Congressional \nCommittee Report, and more recently a 1991 Army Board for the \nCorrection of Military Records. The findings of these official reports \nare described in the Resolution and can be summarized as four principal \npoints.\n  First, the investigations provide ample evidence that the Hawaiian \ncommanders were not provided vital intelligence that they needed and \nthat was available in Washington prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. \nTheir senior commanders had critical information about Japanese \nintentions, plans, and actions, but neither passed this on nor took \nissue or attempted to correct the disposition of forces under Kimmel's \nand Short's commands.\n  Second, the disposition of forces in Hawaii were consistent with the \ninformation that was made available to Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort. Based on the information available to the Hawaiian commanders, \nthe forces under their command at Pearl Harbor were properly disposed.\n  In my review of this case, I was most struck by the honor and \nintegrity demonstrated by General George Marshall who was Army Chief of \nStaff at the time of the attack. General Short interpreted a vaguely \nwritten war warning message sent from the high command in Washington on \nNovember 27, 1941 as suggesting the need to defend against sabotage. \nConsequently, when he concentrated his aircraft away from perimeter \nroads to protect them, he inadvertently increased their vulnerability \nto air attack. When he reported his preparations to the General Staff \nin Washington, the General Staff never took steps to clarify the \nreality of the situation.\n  The Report of the Joint Congressional Committee of 1946 is testament \nto General Marshall's sense of honor and integrity. General Marshall \ntestified that as Chief of Staff, he was responsible for ensuring the \nproper disposition of General Short's forces. He acknowledged that he \nmust have seen General Short's report, which would have been his \nopportunity to issue a corrective message, and that he failed to do so.\n  Mr. President, I only wish that the force of General Marshall's \nintegrity and sense of responsibility had greater influence over the \nmanagement of the case of Admiral Kimmel and General Short.\n  A third theme of these investigations concerned the failure of the \nDepartment of War and the Department of the Navy to properly manage the \nflow of intelligence. The Dorn Report completed in 1995 for the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense at the request of Senator\n\n[[Page S9785]]\n\nThurmond stated that the handling of intelligence in Washington during \nthe time leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor was characterized by \n``ineptitude * * * limited coordination * * * ambiguous language, and \nlack of clarification and follow-up,'' among other serious faults. The \nbottom line is that poor command decisions and inefficient management \nstructures and procedures blocked the flow of essential intelligence \nfrom Washington to the Hawaiian commanders.\n\n  The fourth and most important theme that permeates the aforementioned \nreports is that blame for the disaster at Pearl Harbor cannot be placed \nonly upon the Hawaiian commanders. Some of these reports completely \nabsolved these two officers. While others found them to have made \nerrors in judgement, all the reports subsequent to the Roberts \nCommission cleared them of the charge of dereliction of duty.\n  And, Mr. President, all those reports identified significant failures \nand shortcomings of the senior commanders in Washington that \ncontributed significantly--if not predominantly--to the success of the \nsurprise attack on Pearl Harbor. The Dorn Report put it best, stating \nthat ``responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall \nsolely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short, \nit should be broadly shared.''\n  Mr. President, I would like to emphasize two points about these \ninvestigations. First, these two officers were repeatedly denied their \nrequests--their requests--for courts martial.\n  Second, the conclusions of the 1944 Naval Court of Inquiry and the \nArmy Pearl Harbor Board--that Kimmel's and Short's forces had been \nproperly disposed according to the information available to them and \nthat criticized their superior officers for not sharing important \nintelligence--were kept secret on the grounds that they were \ndetrimental to the war effort.\n  For reasons unexplainable to me, the scapegoating of Admiral Kimmel \nand General Short has survived the cleansing tides of history. It is an \nunambiguous fact that responsibility for the success of the Pearl \nHarbor attack lies with the failure of their superiors situated in \nWashington to provide them the intelligence that was available.\n  One can make the case that back in the midst of World War II, \nallowing blame to fall and remain solely on Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort helped prevent the American people from losing confidence in \ntheir national leadership. But perpetuating the cruel myth that Kimmel \nand Short were singularly responsible for the disaster at Pearl Harbor \nis not only unfair, it blemishes the military honor of our nation.\n  This issue of fairness and justice has been raised not only by \nGeneral Short and Admiral Kimmel and their surviving families today, \nbut also by numerous senior officers and public organizations around \nthe country.\n  Mr. President, allow me to submit for the Record a letter endorsing \nour resolution from five living former naval officers who served at the \nvery pinnacle of military responsibility. They are former Chairmen of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas H. Moorer and Admiral William \nJ. Crowe and former Chiefs of Naval Operations Admiral J.L. Holloway \nIII, Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt and Admiral Carlisle A.H. Trost.\n  The efforts of these and other officers have been complemented by the \ninitiatives of many public organizations who have called for posthumous \nadvancement of Kimmel and Short. At various times down through the \nyears, they have included the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Retired \nOfficers Association, the Naval Academy Alumni Association, the Pearl \nHarbor Commemorative Committee, the Admiral Nimitz Foundation, and the \nPearl Harbor Survivors Association.\n  I submit for the Record a moving resolution passed by the Delaware \nChapter of the VFW last June calling for the posthumous advancement of \nGeneral Short and Admiral Kimmel and a letter from the President of the \nVFW to the President of the United States making the same request.\n  Mr. President, Admiral Kimmel and General Short have been unjustly \nstigmatized by our nation's failure to treat them in the same manner \nwith which we treated their peers. To redress this wrong would be fully \nconsistent with this nation's sense of justice.\n  The message of our joint resolution is about justice, equity, and \nhonor. Its purpose is to redress an historic wrong, to ensure that \nthese two officers are treated fairly and with the dignity and honor \nthey deserve, and to ensure that justice and fairness fully permeate \nthe memory and lessons learned from the catastrophe at Pearl Harbor.\n  The President should advance the ranks of Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort on the retired list to their highest war-time ranks, as was done \nfor all their peers. After 57 years, this correction is long overdue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution, the VFW resolution, and letters of support be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 55\n\n       Whereas, Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, formerly the \n     Commander in Chief of the United States Fleet and the \n     Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet, possessed an \n     excellent and unassailable record throughout his career in \n     the United States Navy prior to the December 7, 1941 attack \n     on Pearl Harbor;\n       Whereas Major General Walter C. Short, formerly the \n     Commander of the United States Army Hawaiian Department, \n     possessed an excellent and unassailable record throughout his \n     career in the United States Army prior to the December 7, \n     1941 attack on Pearl Harbor;\n       Whereas numerous investigations following the attack on \n     Pearl Harbor have documented that Admiral Kimmel and \n     Lieutenant General Short were not provided with the necessary \n     and critical intelligence available that foretold of war with \n     Japan, that warned of imminent attack, and that would have \n     alerted them to prepare for the attack, including such \n     essential communiques as the Japanese Pearl Harbor Bomb Plot \n     message of September 24, 1941, and the message sent from the \n     Imperial Japanese Foreign Ministry to the Japanese Ambassador \n     in the United States from December 6-7, 1941, known as the \n     Fourteen-Part Message;\n       Whereas on December 16, 1941, Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant \n     General Short were relieved of their commands and returned to \n     their permanent ranks of rear admiral and major general;\n       Whereas Admiral William Harrison Standley, who served as a \n     member of the investigating commission known as the Roberts \n     Commission that accused Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General \n     Short of ``dereliction of duty'' only six weeks after the \n     attack on Pearl Harbor, later disavowed the report \n     maintaining that ``these two officers were martyred'' and \n     ``if they had been brought to trial, both would have been \n     cleared of the charge'';\n       Whereas on October 19, 1944, a Naval Court of Inquiry \n     exonerated Admiral Kimmel on the grounds that his military \n     decisions and the disposition of his forces at the time of \n     the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor were proper ``by \n     virtue of the information that Admiral Kimmel had at hand \n     which indicated neither the probability nor the imminence of \n     an air attack on Pearl Harbor''; criticized the higher \n     command for not sharing with Admiral Kimmel ``during the very \n     critical period of 26 November to 7 December 1941, important \n     information . . . regarding the Japanese situation''; and, \n     concluded that the Japanese attack and its outcome was \n     attributable to no serious fault on the part of anyone in the \n     naval service;\n       Whereas on June 15, 1944, an investigation conducted by \n     Admiral T. C. Hart at the direction of the Secretary of the \n     Navy produced evidence, subsequently confirmed, that \n     essential intelligence concerning Japanese intentions and war \n     plans was available in Washington but was not shared with \n     Admiral Kimmel;\n       Whereas on October 20, 1944, the Army Pearl Harbor Board of \n     Investigation determined that Lieutenant General Short had \n     not been kept ``fully advised of the growing tenseness of the \n     Japanese situation which indicated an increasing necessity \n     for better preparation for war''; detailed information and \n     intelligence about Japanese intentions and war plans were \n     available in ``abundance'' but were not shared with the \n     General Short's Hawaii command; and General Short was not \n     provided ``on the evening of December 6th and the early \n     morning of December 7th, the critical information indicating \n     an almost immediate break with Japan, though there was ample \n     time to have accomplished this'';\n       Whereas the reports by both the Naval Court of Inquiry and \n     the Army Pearl Harbor Board of Investigation were kept \n     secret, and Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short were \n     denied their requests to defend themselves through trial by \n     court-martial;\n       Whereas the joint committee of Congress that was \n     established to investigate the conduct of Admiral Kimmel and \n     Lieutenant General Short issued, on May 23, 1946, a 1,075-\n     page report which included the conclusions of the committee \n     that the two officers had not been guilty of dereliction of \n     duty;\n       Whereas the then Chief of Naval Personnel, Admiral J. L. \n     Holloway, Jr., on April 27, 1954,\n\n[[Page S9786]]\n\n     recommended that Admiral Kimmel be advanced in rank in \n     accordance with the provisions of the Officer Personnel Act \n     of 1947;\n       Whereas on November 13, 1991, a majority of the members of \n     the Board for the Correction of Military Records of the \n     Department of the Army found that Lieutenant General Short \n     ``was unjustly held responsible for the Pearl Harbor \n     disaster'' and that ``it would be equitable and just'' to \n     advance him to the rank of lieutenant general on the retired \n     list'';\n       Whereas in October 1994, the then Chief of Naval \n     Operations, Admiral Carlisle Trost, withdrew his 1988 \n     recommendation against the advancement of Admiral Kimmel and \n     recommended that the case of Admiral Kimmel be reopened;\n       Whereas the Dorn Report, a report on the results of a \n     Department of Defense study that was issued on December 15, \n     1995, did not provide support for an advancement of Rear \n     Admiral Kimmel or Major General Short in grade, it did set \n     forth as a conclusion of the study that ``responsibility for \n     the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the \n     shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short, it \n     should be broadly shared'';\n       Whereas the Dorn Report found that ``Army and Navy \n     officials in Washington were privy to intercepted Japanese \n     diplomatic communications . . . which provided crucial \n     confirmation of the imminence of war''; that ``the evidence \n     of the handling of these messages in Washington reveals some \n     ineptitude, some unwarranted assumptions and misestimations, \n     limited coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of \n     clarification and follow-up at higher levels''; and, that \n     ``together, these characteristics resulted in failure . . . \n     to appreciate fully and to convey to the commanders in Hawaii \n     the sense of focus and urgency that these intercepts should \n     have engendered'';\n       Whereas, on July 21, 1997, Vice Admiral David C. Richardson \n     (United States Navy, retired) responded to the Dorn Report \n     with his own study which confirmed findings of the Naval \n     Court of Inquiry and the Army Pearl Harbor Board of \n     Investigation and established, among other facts, that the \n     war effort in 1941 was undermined by a restrictive \n     intelligence distribution policy, and the degree to which the \n     commanders of the United States forces in Hawaii were not \n     alerted about the impending attack on Hawaii was directly \n     attributable to the withholding of intelligence from Admiral \n     Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short;\n       Whereas the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, in establishing \n     a promotion system for the Navy and the Army, provided a \n     legal basis for the President to honor any officer of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States who served his country as a \n     senior commander during World War II with a placement of that \n     officer, with the advice and consent of the Senate, on a \n     retired list with the highest grade held while on the active \n     duty list;\n       Whereas Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short are the \n     only two eligible officers from World War II who were \n     excluded from the list of retired officers presented for \n     advancement on the retired lists to their highest wartime \n     ranks under the terms of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947;\n       Whereas this singular exclusion from advancement on the \n     retired list serves only to perpetuate the myth that the \n     senior commanders in Hawaii were derelict in their duty and \n     responsible for the success of the attack on Pearl Harbor, a \n     distinct and unacceptable expression of dishonor toward two \n     of the finest officers who have served in the Armed Forces of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas Major General Walter Short died on September 23, \n     1949, and Rear Admiral Husband Kimmel died on May 14, 1968, \n     without the honor of having been returned to their wartime \n     ranks as were their fellow veterans of World War II; and\n       Whereas the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Pearl Harbor \n     Survivors Association, the Admiral Nimitz Foundation, the \n     Naval Academy Alumni Association, the Retired Officers \n     Association, and the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Committee, \n     and other associations and numerous retired military officers \n     have called for the rehabilitation of the reputations and \n     honor of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short through \n     their posthumous advancement on the retired lists to their \n     highest wartime grades: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADVANCEMENT OF REAR ADMIRAL KIMMEL AND MAJOR \n                   GENERAL SHORT ON RETIRED LISTS.\n\n       (a) Request.--The President is requested--\n       (1) to advance the late Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel to \n     the grade of admiral on the retired list of the Navy; and\n       (2) to advance the late Major General Walter C. Short to \n     the grade of lieutenant general on the retired list of the \n     Army.\n       (b) Additional Benefits Not To Accrue.--Any advancement in \n     grade on a retired list requested under subsection (a) shall \n     not increase or change the compensation or benefits from the \n     United States to which any person is now or may in the future \n     be entitled based upon the military service of the officer \n     advanced.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE PROFESSIONAL \n                   PERFORMANCE OF ADMIRAL KIMMEL AND LIEUTENANT \n                   GENERAL SHORT.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the late Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel performed his \n     duties as Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet, \n     competently and professionally, and, therefore, the losses \n     incurred by the United States in the attacks on the naval \n     base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and other targets on the island \n     of Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, were not a result of \n     dereliction in the performance of those duties by the then \n     Admiral Kimmel; and\n       (2) the late Major General Walter C. Short performed his \n     duties as Commanding General, Hawaiian Department, \n     competently and professionally, and, therefore, the losses \n     incurred by the United States in the attacks on Hickam Army \n     Air Field and Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and other targets \n     on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, were not \n     a result of dereliction in the performance of those duties by \n     the then Lieutenant General Short.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Resolution Adopted by the Delaware Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n       Whereas, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and General Walter C. \n     Short were the Commanders of record for the Navy and Army \n     forces at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941 when the \n     Japanese Imperial Navy launched its attack; and\n       Whereas, following the attack, President Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt appointed Supreme Court Justice Owen J. Roberts to \n     a Commission to investigate such incident to determine if \n     there had been any dereliction of duty; and\n       Whereas, the Roberts Commission conducted a rushed \n     investigation in only five weeks. It charged Admiral Kimmel \n     and General Short with dereliction of their duty. These \n     findings were made public to the world; and\n       Whereas, the dereliction of duty charge destroyed the honor \n     and reputations of both Admiral Kimmel and General Short, and \n     due to the urgency of the war neither man was given the \n     opportunity to defend himself against the accusation of \n     dereliction of duty; and\n       Whereas, other investigations showed that there was no \n     basis for the dereliction of duty charges, and a \n     Congressional Investigation in 1946 made specific findings \n     that neither Admiral Kimmel nor General Short had been \n     ``derelict in his duty'' at the time of the bombing of Pearl \n     Harbor; and\n       Whereas, it has been documented that the United States \n     Military had broken the Japanese codes in 1941. With the use \n     of a cryptic machine known as ``Magic,'' the Military was \n     able to decipher the Japanese diplomatic code known as \n     ``Purple'' and the military code known as JN-25. The final \n     part of the diplomatic message that told of the attack on \n     Pearl Harbor was received on December 6, 1941. With this \n     vital information in hand, no warning was dispatched to \n     Admiral Kimmel or General Short to provide sufficient time to \n     defend Pearl Harbor in the proper manner; and\n       Whereas, it was not until after the tenth investigation of \n     the attack on Pearl Harbor was completed in December of 1995, \n     that the United States Government acknowledged in the report \n     of Under Secretary of Defense Edwin S. Dorn, that Admiral \n     Kimmel and General Short were not solely responsible for the \n     disaster but that responsibility must be broadly shared; and\n       Whereas, at this time the American public have been \n     deceived for the past fifty-six years regarding the unfounded \n     charge of dereliction of duty against two fine military \n     officers whose reputations and honor have been tarnished; \n     now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Veterans of Foreign Wars urges the \n     President of the United States to restore the honor and \n     reputations of Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and General Walter \n     C. Short by making a public apology to them and their \n     families for the wrongful actions of past administrations for \n     allowing these unfounded charges of dereliction of duty to \n     stand. Be it\n       Resolved, That the Veterans of Foreign Wars urges the \n     President of the United States to take the necessary steps to \n     posthumously advance Admiral Kimmel and General Short to \n     their highest wartime ranks of Four-Star Admiral and Three-\n     Star General. Such action would correct the injustice \n     suffered by them and their families for the past fifty-six \n     years.\n                                  ____\n\n     Re the honor and reputations of Admiral Husband Kimmel and \n     General Walter Short.\n     Honorable Members of the United States Senate.\n       Dear Senators: We ask that the honor and reputations of two \n     fine officers who dedicated themselves to the service of \n     their country be restored. Admiral Husband Kimmel and General \n     Walter Short were singularly scapegoated as responsible for \n     the success of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor December \n     7, 1941. The time is long overdue to reverse this inequity \n     and treat Admiral Kimmel and General Short fairly and justly. \n     The appropriate vehicle for that is the current Roth-Biden \n     Resolution.\n       The Resolution calls for the posthumous advancement on the \n     retired list of Admiral Kimmel and General Short to their \n     highest WWII wartime ranks of four-star admiral and three-\n     star general as provided by the Officer Personnel Act of \n     1947. They are the only two eligible officers who have been \n     singled out for exclusion from that privilege; all other \n     eligible officers have been so privileged.\n       We urge you to support this Resolution.\n       We are career military officers who have served over a \n     period of several decades and\n\n[[Page S9787]]\n\n     through several wartime eras in the capacities of Chairman, \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff and/or Chief of Naval Operations. Each \n     of us is familiar with the circumstances leading up to the \n     attack on Pearl Harbor.\n       We are unanimous in our conviction that Admiral Husband \n     Kimmel and General Walter Short were not responsible for the \n     success of that attack, and that the fault lay with the \n     command structure at the seat of government in Washington. \n     The Roth-Biden Resolution details specifics of this case and \n     requests the President of the United States to nominate \n     Kimmel and Short for the appropriate advancement in rank.\n       As many of you know, Admiral Kimmel and General Short were \n     the Hawaiian Commanders in charge of naval and ground forces \n     on Hawaii at the time of the Japanese attack. After a hurried \n     investigation in January, 1942 they were charged with having \n     been ``derelict in their duty'' and given no opportunity to \n     refute that charge which was publicized throughout the \n     country.\n       As a result, many today believe the ``dereliction'' charge \n     to be true despite the fact that a Naval Board of Inquiry \n     exonerated Admiral Kimmel of blame; a Joint Congressional \n     Committee specifically found that neither had been derelict \n     in his duty; a four-to-one majority of the members of a Board \n     for the Correction of Military Records in the Department of \n     the Army found that General Short had been ``unjustly held \n     responsible'' and recommended his advancement to the rank of \n     lieutenant general on the retired lost.\n       This injustice has been perpetuated for more than half a \n     century by their sole exclusion from the privilege of the Act \n     mentioned above.\n       As professional military officers we support in the \n     strongest terms the concept of holding commanders accountable \n     for the performance of their forces. We are equally strong in \n     our belief in the fundamental American principle of justice \n     for all Americans, regardless of creed, color, status or \n     rank. In other words, we believe strongly in fairness.\n       These two principles must be applied to the specific facts \n     of a given situation. History as well as innumerable \n     investigations have proven beyond any question that Admiral \n     Kimmel and General Short were not responsible for the Pearl \n     Harbor disaster. And we submit that where there is no \n     responsibility there can be no accountability.\n       But as a military principle--both practical and moral--the \n     dynamic of accountability works in both directions along the \n     vertical line known as the chain of command. In view of the \n     facts presented in the Roth-Biden Resolution and below--with \n     special reference to the fact that essential and critical \n     intelligence information was withheld from the Hawaiian \n     Commanders despite the commitment of the command structure \n     to provide that information to them--we submit that while \n     the Hawaiian Commanders were as responsible and \n     accountable as anyone could have been given the \n     circumstances, their superiors in Washington were sadly \n     and tragically lacking in both of these leadership \n     commitments.\n       A review of the historical facts available on the subject \n     of the attack on Pearl Harbor demonstrates that these \n     officers were not treated fairly.\n       1. They accomplished all that anyone could have with the \n     support provided by their superiors in terms of operating \n     forces (ships and aircraft) and information (instructions and \n     intelligence). Their disposition of forces, in view of the \n     information made available to them by the command structure \n     in Washington, was reasonable and appropriate.\n       2. Admiral Kimmel was told of the capabilities of U.S. \n     intelligence (MAGIC, the code-breaking capability of PURPLE \n     and other Japanese codes) and he was promised he could rely \n     on adequate warning of any attack based on this special \n     intelligence capability. Both Commanders rightfully operated \n     under the impression, and with the assurance, that they were \n     receiving the necessary intelligence information to fulfill \n     their responsibilities.\n       3. Historical information now available in the public \n     domain through declassified files, and post-war statements of \n     many officers involved, clearly demonstrate that vital \n     information was routinely withheld from both commanders. For \n     example, the ``Bomb Plot'' message and subsequent reporting \n     orders from Tokyo to Japanese agents in Hawaii as to \n     location, types and number of warships, and their replies to \n     Tokyo.\n       4. The code-breaking intelligence of Purple did provide \n     warning of an attack on Pearl Harbor, but the Hawaiian \n     Commanders were not informed. Whether deliberate or for some \n     other reason should make no difference, have no bearing. \n     These officers did not get the support and warnings they were \n     promised.\n       5. The fault was not theirs. It lay in Washington.\n       We urge you, as Members of the United States Senate, to \n     take a leadership role in assuring justice for two military \n     careerists who were willing to fight and die for their \n     country, but not to be humiliated by its government. We \n     believe that the American people--with their national \n     characteristic of fair play--would want the record set \n     straight.\n           Thank you.\n     Thomas H.

Your letter addressed \n     Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen's comments made in a \n     letter to Senator Strom Thurmond, Chairman of the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee, dated November 18, 1997.\n       Attached is a copy of a letter VFW Commander-in-Chief John \n     E. Moon recently sent to Secretary Cohen. This letter \n     supports the proposal, lead by Senators Joseph R. Biden and \n     William V. Roth, Jr. in May 1998, asking that Admiral Husband \n     Kimmel and General Walter Short not bear the full \n     responsibility for the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl \n     Harbor.\n       We hope that the Secretary of Defense will act favorably on \n     the request of Senators Biden and Roth.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Kenneth A. Steadman,\n                                       Executive Director.\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, tomorrow is an important day for all \nwho honor the valor and sacrifice Americans made in World War II. \nTomorrow, the history of America's war in the Pacific is brought full \ncircle. The U.S.S. Missouri, the ship on which the United States \nformally accepted Japan's surrender, will be permanently berthed at \nPearl Harbor, the site of America's entry into the war against Japan \nfollowing a devastating surprise attack.\n  It is appropriate that in this same week I, along with my colleagues, \nSenators Roth, Thurmond, Inouye, Stevens, Hollings, Ford, Durbin, \nSpecter, Helms, Cochran, and Faircloth, seek to close the circle for \nthe two commanders at Pearl Harbor fifty-seven years ago, Admiral \nHusband Kimmel and General Walter Short. Today, we are introducing a \nresolution that seeks long overdue justice for these two fine officers.\n  Now some of you will ask ``why now?'' The answer is not just because \nwe are honoring the service and sacrifice of Americans who served in \nthe Pacific campaign by permanently berthing the Missouri at Pearl \nHarbor. It is more basic than that--there can be no statute of \nlimitations for restoring honor and dignity to men who spent their \nlives devoted to America's service and yet were unfairly treated. When \nit comes to serving truth and justice, the time must always be ``now''.\n  I hope that most of you will read this resolution. The majority of \nthe text details the historic case on behalf of Admiral Kimmel and \nGeneral Short and expresses Congress's opinion that both officers \nperformed their duty competently. Most importantly, it requests that \nthe President submit the names of Kimmel and Short to the Senate for \nposthumous advancements on the retirement lists to their highest held \nwartime rank.\n  Mr. President, this action would not require any form of \ncompensation. Instead, it would acknowledge, once and for all, that \nthese two officers were not treated fairly by the U.S. government and \nit would uphold the military tradition that responsible officers take \nthe blame for their failures.\n  I will address these points in more detail and will review some of \nthe evidence regarding the soundness of Kimmel and Short's military \ndecisions.\n  First, I want to discuss the treatment of Kimmel and Short and who \nbore responsibility. Like most Americans, Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort requested a fair and open hearing of their case, a court martial. \nThey were denied their request. After lifetimes of honorable service to \nthis nation and the defense of its values, they were denied the most \nbasic form of justice--a hearing.\n  Let me review some of the facts. On December 18, 1941, a mere 11 days \nafter Pearl Harbor, the Roberts Commission was formed to determine \nwhether derelictions of duty or errors of judgment by Kimmel and Short \ncontributed to the success of the Japanese attack. This Commission \nconcluded that both\n\n[[Page S9788]]\n\ncommanders had been derelict in their duty and the President ordered \nthe immediate public release of these findings.\n  Several facts about the Roberts Commission force us to question its \nconclusions. First, Kimmel and Short were denied the right to counsel \nand were not allowed to be present when witnesses were questioned. They \nwere then explicitly told that the Commission was a fact-finding body \nand would not be passing judgment on their performance. When the \nfindings accusing them of a serious offense were released, they \nimmediately requested a court-martial. That request was refused. It is \ndifficult to imagine a fair review of the evidence given the rules of \nprocedure followed by the Commission.\n  I also think that it is important to note the timing here. It would \nbe difficult to provide a fair hearing in the charged atmosphere \nimmediately following America's entry into the war in the Pacific. In \nfact, Kimmel and Short were the objects of public vilification. The \nCommission was not immune to this pressure. One Commission member, for \nexample, Admiral Standley, expressed strong reservations about the \nCommission's findings, later characterizing them as a ``travesty of \njustice''. He did sign the Report, however, because of concerns that \ndoing otherwise might adversely affect the war effort. As you will see, \nthe war effort played an important role in how Kimmel and Short were \ntreated.\n\n  The Roberts Commission was the only investigative body that found \nthese two officers derelict in their duty.\n  In 1944 an Army Board investigated General Short's actions at Pearl \nHarbor. The conclusions of that investigation placed blame on General \nMarshall, the Chief of Staff of the Army at the time of Pearl Harbor \nand in 1944. This report was sequestered and kept secret from the \npublic on the grounds that it would be detrimental to the war effort.\n  That same year, a Naval Court of Inquiry investigated Admiral \nKimmel's actions at Pearl Harbor. The Naval Court's conclusions were \ndivided into two sections in order to protect information indicating \nthat America had the ability to decode and intercept Japanese messages. \nThe first and longer section, therefore, was classified ``top secret.'' \nThe second section was written to be unclassified and completely \nexonerated Admiral Kimmel and recognized that Admiral Stark bore some \nof the blame for Pearl Harbor because of his failure to provide Kimmel \nwith critical information available in Washington. Then Secretary of \nthe Navy James Forrestal instructed the Court that it had to classify \nboth sections ``secret'' and not release any findings to the public.\n  I won't go any further with this discussion of history, again I urge \nmy colleagues to read the resolution. I hope that I have made my point \nthat these officers were not treated fairly and that there is good \nreason to question where the blame for Pearl Harbor should lie.\n  The whole story was re-evaluated in 1995 at the request of Senator \nThurmond by Under Secretary for Defense Edwin Dorn. In his report, Dorn \nconcluded that responsibility for the disaster at Pearl Harbor should \nbe broadly shared. I agree. Where Dorn's conclusions differ from mine \nand my cosponsors, is that he also found that ``the official treatment \nof Admiral Kimmel and General Short was substantively temperate and \nprocedurally proper.'' I disagree.\n  These officers were publicly vilified and never given a chance to \nclear their names. If we lived in a closed society, fearful of the \ntruth, then there would be no need for the President to take any action \ntoday. But we don't. We live in an open society. Eventually, we are \nable to declassify documents and evaluate our past based on at least a \ngood portion of the whole story. One of our greatest strengths as a \nnation comes from our ability to honor truth and the lessons of our \npast.\n  Like most people, I can accept that there was a good case for the \nneed to protect our intelligence capabilities during the war. I cannot \naccept that there is a reason for continuing to deny the culpability of \nothers in Washington at the expense of these two officers' reputations \n57 years later. Continuing to falsely scapegoat two dedicated and \ncompetent officers dishonors the military tradition of taking \nresponsibility for failure. The historic message sent is that the truth \nwill be suppressed to protect some responsible parties and distorted to \nsacrifice others.\n  One point I want to make here is that we are not seeking to place \nblame. This is not a witch-hunt aimed at those superior officers who \nwere advanced in rank and continued to serve, despite being implicated \nin the losses at Pearl Harbor. I think the historic record has become \nquite clear that blame should be shared.\n  The unfortunate reality is that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were \nblamed entirely and forced into early retirement.\n  After the war, in 1947, they were singled out as the only eligible \nofficers from World War II not advanced to their highest held wartime \nranks on the retirement lists, under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947. \nBy failing to advance them, the government and the Departments of the \nNavy and Army perpetuate the myth that these two officers bear a unique \nand disproportionate part of the blame.\n  The government that denied these officers a fair hearing and \nsuppressed findings favorable to their case while releasing hostile \ninformation owes them an official apology. That's what this resolution \ncalls for.\n\n  The last point that I want to make deals with the military situation \nat Pearl Harbor. It is legitimate to ask whether Admiral Kimmel and \nGeneral Short, as commanding officers, properly deployed their forces. \nI think reasonable people may disagree on this point. I have been \nstruck by the number of qualified individuals who believe the \ncommanders properly deployed based on the intelligence available to \nthem. I will ask to enter this partial list of flag officers into the \nRecord. Among those listed is Vice Admiral Richardson, a distinguished \nnaval commander, who wrote an entire report refuting the conclusions of \nthe Dorn Report. My colleagues will also see the names of four Chiefs \nof Naval Operations and the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff Admiral Thomas Moorer. It was Admiral Moorer who observed that, \n``If Nelson and Napoleon had been in command at Pearl Harbor, the \nresults would have been the same.''\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe this case is unique and \ndemands our attention. As we honor those who served in World War II by \npermanently berthing the U.S.S. Missouri in Pearl Harbor, we must also \nhonor the ideals for which they fought. High among those American \nideals is upholding truth and justice. Those ideals give us the \nstrength to admit and, where possible, correct our errors.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and move one step \ncloser to justice for Admiral Kimmel and General Short.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a partial list of flag \nofficers be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       The following is a partial listing of high-ranking retired \n     military personnel who advocate in support of the posthumous \n     advancement on the retired lists of Rear Admiral Husband \n     Kimmel and Major General Walter Short to Four-Star Admiral \n     and Three-Star General respectively:\n\n\n                                Admirals\n\n       Thomas H.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Indonesia is the World's 4th most populous nation, with \n     a population in excess of 200,000,000 people.\n       (2) Since 1997, political, economic, and social turmoil in \n     Indonesia has escalated.\n       (3) Indonesia is comprised of more than 13,000 islands \n     located between the mainland of Southeast Asia and Australia. \n     Indonesia occupies an important strategic location, \n     straddling vital sea lanes for communication and commercial \n     transportation including all or part of every major sea route \n     between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, more than 50 \n     percent of all international shipping trade, and sea lines of \n     communication used by the United States Pacific Command to \n     support operations in the Persian Gulf.\n       (4) Indonesia has been an important ally of the United \n     States, has made vital contributions to the maintenance of \n     regional peace and stability through its leading role in the \n     Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Asia \n     Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC), and has promoted\n\n[[Page S9793]]\n\n     United States economic, political, and security interests in \n     Asia.\n       (5) In the 25 years before the onset of the recent \n     financial crisis in Asia, the economy of Indonesia grew at an \n     average rate of 7 percent per year.\n       (6) Since July 1997, the Indonesian rupiah has lost 70 \n     percent of its value, and the Indonesian economy is now at a \n     near standstill characterized by inflation, tight liquidity, \n     and rising unemployment.\n       (7) Indonesia has also faced a severe drought and massive \n     fires in the past year which have adversely affected its \n     ability to produce sufficient food to meet its needs.\n       (8) As a consequence of this economic instability and the \n     drought and fires, as many as 100,000,000 people in Indonesia \n     may experience food shortages, malnutrition, and possible \n     starvation as a result of being unable to purchase food. \n     These conditions increase the potential for widespread social \n     unrest in Indonesia.\n       (9) Following the abdication of Indonesia President Suharto \n     in May 1998, Indonesia is in the midst of a profound \n     political transition. The current president of Indonesia, \n     B.J. Habibie, has called for new parliamentary elections in \n     mid-1999, allowed the formation of new political parties, and \n     pledged to resolve the role of the military in Indonesian \n     society.\n       (10) The Government of Indonesia has taken several \n     important steps toward political reform and support of \n     democratic institutions, including support for freedom of \n     expression, release of political prisoners, formation of \n     political parties and trade unions, preparations for new \n     elections, removal of ethnic designations from identity \n     cards, and commitments to legal and civil service reforms \n     which will increase economic and legal transparency and \n     reduce corruption.\n       (11) To address the food shortages in Indonesia, the United \n     States Government has made more than 230,000 tons of food \n     available to Indonesia this year through grants and so-called \n     ``soft'' loans and has pledged support for additional wheat \n     and food to meet emergency needs in Indonesia.\n       (12) United States national security interests are well-\n     served by political stability in Indonesia and by friendly \n     relations between the United States and Indonesia.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the decision of the Clinton Administration to make \n     available at least 1,500,000 tons of wheat, wheat products, \n     and rice for distribution to the most needy and vulnerable \n     Indonesians is vital to the well-being of all Indonesians;\n       (2) the Clinton Administration should work with the World \n     Food Program and nongovernmental organizations to design \n     programs to make the most effective use of food donations in \n     Indonesia and to expedite delivery of food assistance in \n     order to reach those in Indonesia most in need;\n       (3) the Clinton Administration should adopt a more active \n     approach in support of democratic institutions and processes \n     in Indonesia and provide assistance for continued economic \n     and political development in Indonesia, including--\n       (A) support for humanitarian programs aimed at preventing \n     famine, meeting the needs of the Indonesian people, and \n     inculcating social stability;\n       (B) leading a multinational effort (including the active \n     participation of Japan, the nations of Europe, and other \n     nations) to assist the programs referred to in subparagraph \n     (A);\n       (C) calling on donor nations and humanitarian and food aid \n     programs to make additional efforts to meet the needs of \n     Indonesia and its people while laying the groundwork for a \n     more open and participatory society in Indonesia;\n       (D) working with international financial institutions to \n     recapitalize and reform the banking system, restructure \n     corporate debt, and introduce economic and legal transparency \n     in Indonesia;\n       (E) urging the Government of Indonesia to remove, to the \n     maximum extent possible, barriers to trade and investment \n     which impede economic recovery in Indonesia, including \n     tariffs, quotas, export taxes, nontariff barriers, and \n     prohibitions against foreign ownership and investment;\n       (F) urging the Government of Indonesia to--\n       (i) recognize the importance of the participation of all \n     Indonesians, including ethnic and religious minorities, in \n     the political and economic life of Indonesia;\n       (ii) take appropriate action to assure the support and \n     protection of minority participation in the political, \n     social, and economic life of Indonesia; and\n       (iii) release individuals detained or imprisoned for their \n     political views.\n       (G) support for efforts by the Government of Indonesia to \n     cast a wide social safety net in order to provide relief to \n     the neediest Indonesians and to restore hope to those \n     Indonesians who have been harmed by the economic crisis in \n     Indonesia;\n       (H) support for efforts to build democracy in Indonesia in \n     order to strengthen political participation and the \n     development of legitimate democratic processes and the rule \n     of law in Indonesia, including support for organizations, \n     such as the Asia Foundation and the National Endowment for \n     Democracy, which can provide technical assistance in \n     developing and strengthening democratic political \n     institutions and processes in Indonesia;\n       (I) calling on the Government of Indonesia to repeal all \n     laws and regulations that discriminate on the basis of \n     religion or ethnicity and to ensure that all new laws are in \n     keeping with international standards on human rights; and\n       (J) calling on the Government of Indonesia to establish, \n     announce publicly, and adhere to a clear timeline for \n     parliamentary elections in Indonesia.\n       (c) Report.--(1) Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \n     Congress a report containing the following:\n       (A) A description and assessment of the actions taken by \n     the Government of the United States to work with the \n     Government of Indonesia to further the objectives referred to \n     in subsection (b)(3).\n       (B) A description and assessment of the actions taken by \n     the Government of Indonesia to further such objectives.\n       (C) An evaluation of the implications of the matters \n     described and assessed under subparagraphs (A) and (B), and \n     any other appropriate matters, for relations between the \n     United States and Indonesia.\n       (2) The report under this subsection shall be submitted in \n     unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               FEINSTEIN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3508\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. McConnell, and Mrs. Boxer) proposed \nan amendment to the bill, S. 2334, supra;

According to numerous reports by human rights \n     groups, United Nations officials, and the press, ethnic \n     Chinese in Indonesia were specifically targeted in the riots \n     for attacks which included acts of brutality, looting, arson, \n     and rape.\n       (2) Credible reports indicate that, between May 13 and May \n     15, 1998, at least 150 Chinese women and girls, some as young \n     as 9 years of age, were systematically raped as part of a \n     campaign of racial violence in Indonesia, and 20 of these \n     women subsequently died from injuries incurred during these \n     rapes.\n       (3) Credible evidence indicates that these rapes were the \n     result of a systematic and organized operation and may well \n     have continued to the present time.\n       (4) Indonesia President Habibie has stated that he believes \n     the riots and rapes to be ``the most inhuman acts in the \n     history of the nation'', that they were ``criminal'' acts, \n     and that ``we will not accept it, we will not let it happen \n     again.''.\n       (5) Indonesian human rights groups have asserted that the \n     Indonesia Government failed to take action necessary to \n     control the riots, violence, and rapes directed against \n     ethnic Chinese in Indonesia and that some elements of the \n     Indonesia military may have participated in such acts.\n       (6) The Executive Director of the United Nations \n     Development Fund for Women has stated that the attacks were \n     an ``organized reaction to a crisis and culprits must be \n     brought to trial'' and that the systematic use of rape in the \n     riots ``is totally unacceptable. . . and even more disturbing \n     than rape war crimes, as Indonesia was not at war with \n     another country but caught in its own internal crisis''.\n       (7) The Indonesia Government has established the Joint \n     National Fact Finding Team to investigate the violence and \n     allegations of gang rapes, but there are allegations that the \n     investigation is moving slowly and that the Team lacks the \n     authority necessary to carry out an appropriate \n     investigation.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the mistreatment of ethnic Chinese in Indonesia and the \n     criminal acts carried out against them during the May 1998 \n     riots in Indonesia is deplorable and condemned;\n       (2) a complete, full, and fair investigation of such \n     criminal acts should be completed by the earliest possible \n     date, and those identified as responsible for perpetrating \n     such criminal acts should be brought to justice;\n       (3) the investigation by the Government of Indonesia, \n     through its Military Honor Council, of those members of the \n     armed forces of Indonesia suspected of possible involvement \n     in the May 1998 riots, and of any member of the armed forces \n     of Indonesia who may have participated in criminal acts \n     against the people of Indonesia during the riots, is \n     commended and should be supported;\n       (4) the Government of Indonesia should take action to \n     assure--\n       (A) the full observance of the human rights of the ethnic \n     Chinese in Indonesia and of all other minority groups in \n     Indonesia;\n       (B) the implementation of appropriate measures to prevent \n     ethnic-related violence and rapes in Indonesia and to \n     safeguard the physical safety of the ethnic Chinese community \n     in Indonesia;\n       (C) prompt follow through on its announced intention to \n     provide damage loans to help rebuild businesses and homes for \n     those who suffered losses in the riots; and\n       (D) the provision of just compensation for victims of the \n     rape and violence that occurred during the May 1998 riots in \n     Indonesia, including medical care;\n       (5) the Clinton Administration and the United Nations \n     should provide support and assistance to the Government of \n     Indonesia,\n\n[[Page S9794]]\n\n     and to nongovernmental organizations, in the investigations \n     into the May 1998 riots in Indonesia in order to expedite \n     such investigations; and\n       (6) Indonesia should ratify the United Nations Convention \n     on Racial Discrimination, Torture, and Human Rights.\n       (c) Support For Investigations.--Of the amounts \n     appropriated by this Act for Indonesia, the Secretary of \n     State, after consultation with Congress, shall make available \n     such funds as the Secretary considers appropriate in order to \n     provide support and technical assistance to the Government of \n     Indonesia, and to independent nongovernmental organizations, \n     for purposes of conducting full, fair, and impartial \n     investigations into the allegations surrounding the riots, \n     violence, and rape of ethnic Chinese in Indonesia in May \n     1998.\n       (d) Report.--(1) Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \n     Congress a report containing the following:\n       (A) An assessment of--\n       (i) whether or not there was a systematic and organized \n     campaign of violence, including the use of rape, against the \n     ethnic Chinese community in Indonesia during the May 1998 \n     riots in Indonesia; and\n       (ii) the level and degree of participation, if any, of \n     members of the Government or armed forces of Indonesia in the \n     riots.\n       (B) An assessment of the adequacy of the actions taken by \n     the Government of Indonesia to investigate the May 1998 riots \n     in Indonesia, bring the perpetrators of the riots to justice, \n     and ensure that similar riots do not recur.\n       (C) An evaluation of the implications of the matters \n     assessed under subparagraphs (A) and (B) for relations \n     between the United States and Indonesia.\n       (2) The report under this subsection shall be submitted in \n     unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        BOXER AMENDMENT NO. 3509\n\n  Mrs. BOXER proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 2334, supra;

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a \ncritical issue which I fear has not received the attention it deserves. \nI am speaking about the Year 2000 computer problem which will strike in \na mere sixteen months.\n  The year 2000 holds potential problems for all Americans. At numerous \nhearings by the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Financial Services and \nTechnology, on which I serve, witnesses have testified that the year \n2000 problem involves more than just computers--it is a pervasive \nproblem for which there is no quick fix. But fix it we must, because \nthere can be no extension of time.\n  I commend the efforts of Senator Bennett, Chairman of that Banking \nSubcommittee, for his tireless efforts\n\n[[Page S9798]]\n\nto raise the profile of Y2K issues. Senator Bennett now chairs the \njoint task force on Y2K, and he will be a forceful advocate for the \nnecessity of addressing this issue.\n  Government, businesses, farms and homes rely on computers for nearly \nevery aspect of their operations--from paying Social Security, to \noperating vehicles and equipment, to calculating interest, to \nconducting elections, to launching missiles. A failure in one computer \nsystem could not only be devastating to that particular operation, but \ncould also have a domino effect.\n  For these reasons, it is vitally important that government and the \nprivate sector work together to avoid a potential disaster. According \nto a recent General Accounting Office (GAO) study, the federal \ngovernment is extremely vulnerable to year 2000 problems because of its \nwidespread dependence on computer systems.\n  The GAO study found uneven progress and made a number of \nrecommendations for federal agencies to implement. Among them are the \nneed to establish priorities, solidify data exchange agreements, and \ndevelop contingency plans.\n  GAO testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee, on which I \nalso serve, focused on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) \ncomputer systems. The GAO concluded that if not properly fixed, severe \nconsequences could result such as:\n  Payments to schools, farmers and others in rural communities could be \ndelayed or incorrectly computed.\n  The economy could be adversely affected if information critical to \ncrop and livestock providers and investors is unreliable, late or \nunavailable.\n  The import and export of foodstuffs could be delayed, thus increasing \nthe likelihood that they will not reach their intended destinations \nbefore their spoilage dates.\n  Food distribution to schools and others could be stopped or delayed.\n  Public health and safety could be at risk if equipment used in USDA's \nmany laboratories to detect bacteria, diseases, and unwholesome foods \nis not compliant.\n  These are a few of the potential year 2000 computer problems in just \none agency of the federal government. Many federal agencies have made \ntremendous progress in solving their computer problems, but many more \nhave been remiss. Therefore, the role of the Administration through the \nPresident' Council on Year 2000 Conversion becomes even more important \nin ensuring the federal government's readiness for year 2000.\n  I am encouraged by President Clinton's recent initiatives to increase \nnational and global awareness of the Y2K problem and to facilitate \nprivate sector attempts to address it. The President's ``Year 2000 Good \nSamaritan'' legislation is designed to promote private sector exchange \nof year 2000-related information and would help our national \npreparedness for 2000.\n  Y2K will not just impact the United States. In today's global \neconomy, no area can remain isolated from any other. The United States \nalso will contribute $12 million to assist the World Bank's plan to \nraise awareness of the problem in developing countries.\n  I am also encouraged by the recent testing of Y2K compliance by Wall \nStreet firms which are conducting a series of tests to see whether U.S. \nmarkets will face Y2K difficulties. These firms represent the type of \nforesight which will limit any dislocation caused by the Y2K glitch. \nThis is the first known comprehensive effort to check the compliance of \ncorporate America for the Y2K bug, and I hope more sectors of the \neconomy quickly follow suit.\n  The potential difficulties are almost incalculable, when we consider \nthe tremendous role computers play in our everyday lives. From food \ndistribution to air traffic control. From our monetary infrastructure \nto electric power grids. Telecommunications systems and traffic lights. \nAll of these necessities we take for granted could be impacted on \nJanuary 1, 2000.\n  Congress must continue it's oversight to make certain that the \nnecessary resources are brought to bear on this critical issue. We have \nmade progress, but there is still a tremendous amount of work to be \ndone. The clock is running, and we cannot afford to fail to meet the \nyear 2000 deadline.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/01/senate-section/article/S9797-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9798-S9799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    GRAND RAPIDS' COMMUNITY SUCCESS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to bring to my colleagues' \nattention an important article from The American Enterprise magazine. \nIn it Michael Barone of Reader's Digest lauds the great success of \nGrand Rapids, Michigan in rebuilding its economy and community. Mr. \nBarone reports that a vital combination of entrepreneurship, public \nspirit, and responsible philanthropy have brought the people of Grand \nRapids together to build a vibrant economy and public life.\n  Business and community leaders in Grand Rapids have joined together \nto rehabilitate the downtown area. They have encouraged one another to \nsponsor important projects like the Van Andel Institute for nutrition \nresearch and Faith Inc., which trains people from close-in \nneighborhoods and places them in full-time jobs. A pro-business \nenvironment has facilitated the growth of diverse businesses, from \nfurniture manufacturers to merchandisers. And Grand Rapids' respect for \nfree markets and entrepreneurship has maintained an economy in which \nunemployment is low and small business thrives, with 80 percent of \nlocal businesses employing fewer than 30 people.\n  Mr. President, as we in the Senate continue our debate over how best \nto encourage the revitalization of distressed urban areas, I hope we \nwill learn from cities like Grand Rapids. As a member of the Renewal \nAlliance and a strong supporter of its efforts to help distressed urban \nareas, I feel that Grand Rapids can provide us with an extremely \nhelpful model of what works. This great city shows the importance of \nlocal involvement, free markets, and faith in rebuilding strong \ncommunities.\n  I heartily recommend this article to my colleagues and ask that its \ntext be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n            [From the American Enterprise, Sept./Oct. 1998]\n\n            A City Where Business and Philanthropy Flourish\n\n                          (By Michael Barone)\n\n       Looking for a city with a tradition of community \n     involvement, creative local philanthropy, vibrant cultural \n     institutions old and new? Try Grand Rapids. The home town of \n     President Gerald Ford, the city proposed by Chicago Tribune \n     publisher Colonel Robert McCormick as a new national capital, \n     Grand Rapids remains largely unknown nationally and even in \n     Michigan is often overshadowed by Detroit. But greater Grand \n     Rapids is now approaching a million people, its strong local \n     economy has led Michigan's economic recovery, and its \n     successful entrepreneurs have built civic institutions the \n     envy of many metro areas two or three times the size. Civil \n     society is alive and well here.\n       What are Grand Rapids' secret? One is a vigorous free \n     market economy, built steadily over decades. Grand Rapids was \n     first settled by New England Yankees and immigrants from \n     Germany and the Netherlands at the falls of the Grand River, \n     in the heart of Michigan's immense forests. Its first \n     industries were lumber and a natural offshoot, furniture. In \n     the first decades of this century Grand Rapids was the \n     nation's leading producer of household furniture. But the \n     forests were overharvested, the furniture market collapsed in \n     the Depression, and after World War II manufacturers \n     relocated to North Carolina.\n       Some furniture manufacturers who survived turned to office \n     furniture. Today three of the nation's four largest office \n     furniture manufacturers are located in Grand Rapids or nearby \n     Holland. But there is plenty of diversity as well. The city \n     is a leader in injected plastic moldings and a major center \n     for tool and die shops, with lots of small successful firms. \n     It is the headquarters of Meijer, whose 100-plus Thrifty \n     Acres stores combine supermarkets with general merchandise \n     stores--a formula Wal-Mart has copied but has not been able \n     to make pay as well as Meijer. Grand Rapids is the \n     headquarters of Universal Wood Products, the nation's largest \n     fence producer. It is the home of Gordon Foods and Bissell \n     carpet sweepers. It has one large General Motors plant and \n     dozens of auto suppliers. Ada, a village six miles east, is \n     the home of Amway, privately owned by the Van Andel and DeVos \n     families, founded in a garage in 1959, now selling over $7 \n     billion of home care housewares, and cosmetic products in 52 \n     countries, most of them manufactured in Grand Rapids' Kent \n     County.\n       Most of Grand Rapids' successful companies are small: 80 \n     percent of businesses employ fewer than 30 people, according \n     to John Caneppa, former chairman of Grand Rapids' Old Kent \n     Bank. Firms that have grown bigger have done so through \n     creative innovation and good employee relations. Local office \n     furniture manufacturers pioneered modular units and \n     electronic connectors. Amway\n\n[[Page S9799]]\n\n     took an old idea--direct sales--and made it work on a scale \n     never seen before. Fred Meijer, to make shopping more \n     pleasant for parents with kids, installed mechanical ponies \n     in his stores which cost one cent per ride and personally \n     hands out ``Purple Cow'' cards for free ice cream cones.\n       Employee relations are also an important part of Grand \n     Rapids' success. ``We have 60,000 people working with us,'' \n     Fred Meijer says. ``We need them; so let's treat them like we \n     need them.'' If any of us makes a mistake, he adds, ``we \n     don't need to be bawled out, we need to be helped to \n     succeed.'' That way, the ``job will be better, and everybody \n     will be more productive.''\n       Nor is there an adversarial relationship between business \n     and government. ``The best thing government can do is to get \n     out of the way,'' says Grand Rapids City Manager Kurt \n     Kimball. ``To try to create an environment that enables the \n     private sector to achieve its ends. Prosperity for business \n     means prosperity for residents. Then we'll have the resources \n     for quality of life.'' Says GR magazine editor Carol Valade, \n     ``There is a very low tolerance for government here--the \n     attitude is, I will do it myself. And a tremendous respect \n     for the arts of the entrepreneur. It spills over into \n     government. The city removed 98 percent of its effluents from \n     its sewers, without federal funds--the only city in Michigan \n     to do so.''\n       Successful small businesses and small businesses that have \n     grown large but have stayed headquartered here, have helped \n     build Grand Rapids' cultural institutions. Even the banks \n     have remained local. Old Kent is still based in Grand Rapids, \n     though it has spread outward; First Union sold out to \n     Detroit-based NBD, but David Frey, whose grandfather founded \n     the bank, has kept the Frey Foundation here, and 85 percent \n     of its grants are in western Michigan. ``Giving money \n     intelligently is hard work,'' Frey says. ``A lot of due \n     diligence is required. But there's the prospect of great \n     satisfaction.''\n       Anyone walking through downtown Grand Rapids can see some \n     of the reasons for that satisfaction. Twenty-five years ago, \n     downtown Grand Rapids looked dumpy, with aging and often \n     empty commercial buildings, and a grubby convention center. \n     Then Grand Rapids' business leaders decided to make it \n     something special. ``Always the private sector has taken the \n     lead,'' says Frey. ``And people are willing to put corporate \n     money into projects. Then they would get the city, county, or \n     state governments to forge a coalition.'' Phase one, in the \n     mid-1970s, included a new Old Kent building and Vandenberg \n     Center, which replaced abandoned warehouses. Phase two \n     included the Amway Plaza Hotel and the Gerald Ford Museum. \n     Phase three includes the recently opened Van Andel Arena for \n     Grand Rapids' minor league hockey and basketball, a new \n     convention center, and a downtown campus for Grand Valley \n     State College.\n       The secret is leadership and commitment. ``We have people \n     who give time and effort and support. They sit at the same \n     table,'' says Pete Secchia, head of Universal Products, and \n     also a leader of Michigan's Republican Party who served as \n     Ambassador to Italy under Bush. ``When we promise \n     something,'' says Fred Meijer, sitting around a table with \n     other Grand Rapids business leaders, ``we don't do it \n     lightly. Not one of us has ever reneged on a promise.'' If \n     there are problems, someone jumps in and solves them. ``The \n     Amway Plaza would be torn down or destitute if Amway hadn't \n     picked it up,'' Meijer adds.\n       With no major university or medical school, Grand Rapids \n     has missed out on the boom in biomedicine. But that's likely \n     to change with the building of a Van Andel Institute for \n     nutrition research at Grand Rapids' Butterworth Hospital. \n     Steve Van Andel, who has succeeded his father Jay as co-head \n     of Amway, describes the process. ``We watched our fathers \n     build the firm. The second generation got even more involved \n     with the community. The building decision was also made by \n     the second generation of the Van Andel and DeVos families. My \n     dad and family have been discussing it for years. We decided \n     to do something. Dad was always interested in nutrition, so \n     we decided to build an institute that would work on nutrition \n     research and education.'' He is thinking big. Peter Cook, who \n     owns several big car dealerships and is on the board, says \n     that it has five Nobel Prize winners as advisers and will \n     have 200 to 300 doctors and scientists in a $30 million \n     building.\n       Grand Rapids' philanthropists are buttressed not by the \n     liberalism of so many national foundations but by traditional \n     virtues. It's an early-to-bed-early-to-rise town, where \n     people eat at home with their families. ``Everyone is doing \n     well but restaurants,'' says Secchia, ``but the breakfast \n     joints are filled at 6:30 in the morning,'' The churches are \n     busy on Sundays, filled with people from all economic levels; \n     the billionaire Van Andels and DeVoses pray at a modest \n     Reform church not far from downtown. Or as Peter Cook puts \n     it, ``A lot of our people have done more than their share in \n     giving. We grew up in a Christian home and tithed, and after \n     that you gave more. We give 30 to 40 percent of our income. . \n     . . That type of thing is very influential. This is a good \n     place to work and live.''\n       Entrepreneurial and religious impulses also inform Grand \n     Rapids' programs to help the poor. Gene Pratt, now retired, \n     tells of raising $1 million in less than two hours to \n     renovate his community center, and how a kids' gardening \n     project produced City Kids Barbecue sauce, got it stocked in \n     Meijer's and other local supermarkets, and got 5 percent of \n     the market. Verne Barry, head of the Downtown Development \n     Agency, came to Grand Rapids in 1985 after living homeless in \n     New York. With ministries and social service agencies he \n     founded Faith Inc., which won competitive contracts with 25 \n     local manufacturers. Hiring people from close-in \n     neighborhoods, his group got commitments for 10 percent of \n     the jobs on projects like the Van Andell Arena. He claims \n     that more than 50 percent of those with little work \n     experience are now in permanent employment.\n       Grand Rapids has low crime, low unemployment, and scandal-\n     free local government. But statistics tell only part of the \n     story. For Grand Rapids' leaders have put the imprint of \n     their own personalities on the civic institutions they've \n     built. The Grand Rapids Museum hosted an exhibit of the \n     artist Perugino in 1997-98; Secchia helped set it up using \n     his Italian contacts and the fact that Perugia is a sister \n     city.

A TRIBUTE TO THE VARSITY\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to salute Georgia's beloved Varsity Restaurant for 70 years \nof prospering business and never-ending dedication to its customers and \nemployees. People have come from all around the world simply for a \nsampling of the Varsity's great food and down home hospitality.\n  The Varsity was founded by Frank Gordy in 1928. As the world's \nlargest drive-in, the Varsity's hot dogs, chili dogs, hamburgers, chili \nburgers, onion rings, french fries, and fried pies are the best in the \nworld. The Varsity also sells more Coca-Cola than any other single \noutlet in the world. Whether you get your ``dogs'' at Atlanta's North \nAvenue Varsity, the Gwinnett Varsity off Jimmy Carter Blvd., the \nVarsity Jr. on Lindbergh Drive or the Varsity on Broad Street in Athens \nyou are guaranteed to go back for more.\n  The menu is extensive and the Varsity's volume is legendary. Two \nmiles of hot dogs, a ton of onions, 2500 pounds of potatoes, and 5,000 \nfried pies are served every day. Six 50 gallon pots of chili are made \nfrom scratch and, like all specialty items, are prepared from original \nrecipes. Varsity orange is piped from the kitchen to faucets at the \nserving counter and the popular frosted version is also on tap.\n  Every time I come home to Atlanta from Washington, D.C., stopping by \nthe Varsity is a must on my agenda. In fact, it is often my first stop \nafter leaving the airport. All Georgians can attest that the Varsity's \nheavy weight, chili steak, frosted orange or fried pies are unlike any \nother food in the world. I cannot count the number of meals I have \neaten at this Atlanta institution, but the memories of dining at the \nVarsity are endless.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you join me, our colleagues, and the entire \nGordy family in recognizing 70 years of mouth-watering food and fond \nmemories, and in wishing the entire Varsity family many more successes \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/01/senate-section/article/S9799-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9799-S9800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer my \ncongratulations to the Women's Business Development Center (WBDC) as it \ncelebrates the 12th Annual Entrepreneurial Women's Conference. The \nevent, which is to be held on September 9, 1998, at Chicago's Navy \nPier, will celebrate the Women's Business Development Center's second \ndecade of outstanding service to women in the business community.\n  The Women's Business Development Center is a Chicago-based nonprofit \nwomen's business assistance center devoted to providing services and \nprograms that support and accelerate the growing role of women business \nowners in the economy. Since its founding in 1986 by Carol Dougal and \nHedy Ratner, the Women's Business Development Center has facilitated \nmore than $20 million in women's business loans and has assisted women-\nowned businesses in gaining over $90 million of government and private \ncontracts. More than 30,000 women business owners have benefitted from \nthe following programs and services: counseling, workshops, \nentrepreneurial training, the Women's Business and Finance Programs, \nthe Women's Business Enterprise Initiative, the Entrepreneurial Woman's \nConference and the Women's Business and Buyers Mart.\n  The success of the Women's Business Development Center has inspired \nsimilar initiatives across the country. Women's business development \nprograms modeled after the Center have been launched by economic \ndevelopment organizations in Indiana, Ohio, Florida, Massachusetts, and \nPennsylvania. The tremendous inroads made by women in the business \ncommunity over the past decade is due in no small part to the efforts \nof these organizations.\n  Mr. President, there are now more than 7.7 million women-owned \nbusinesses in the United States, and 250,000 of these businesses are \nlocated in my homestate of Illinois. Nationally, women's businesses \ngenerate $2.3 trillion of sales and employ one out of every four U.S. \ncompany workers.\n  Given the importance of women-owned businesses to the economy, I look \nforward to hearing about the continued successes of the Women's \nBusiness Development Center in the years to come. Once again let me \noffer my congratulations to the Women's Business Development Center on \ntheir 12th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/01/senate-section/article/S9800-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      5TH ANNUAL CROATIAN FESTIVAL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \nexemplary work of the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) and the \nGIA Gem Laboratory.\n  GIA has been the nation's leader in gemology training and education \nsince 1931, conducting valuable research and establishing standards \nupon which purchasers of gems in the United States and abroad have come \nto rely.\n  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), in establishing regulations \nconcerning gems that are the subject of trade in the United States, \nadopted standards developed by GIA.\n  GIA's Gem Laboratory--located in New York City and Carlsbad, \nCalifornia--operates to protect the public from misrepresentation of \ngems, to assist in the recovery of stolen property, and to provide \ninformation useful in the prosecution of criminals involved in gem \nfraud or theft.\n  The Gem Laboratory is also the main body applying the FTC's \nregulations on gems (26 CFR Part 23), such that consumers have a means \nof determining whether the products they purchase are, in fact, the \nreal thing. It serves an essential role in identifying gems and in \ndetecting synthetics as well as colored, doctored, or treated gems \nbeing marketed as natural and in deterring those who might attempt to \nprofit by misrepresenting their goods to American consumers.\n  The Laboratory can achieve these purposes only because it is \nresponsible for identifying and/or testing a large proportion of the \nsignificant gems purchased by consumers in the United States.\n  The Laboratory's extensive computerized gem database enables it to \nidentify stolen gems that it had previously tested and inhibits the \nfencing of stolen gems, thereby providing an important deterrent to gem \ntheft.\n  At the request of the United States Customs Service and pursuant to \nlicensing by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Gem Laboratory also \ntests for irradiated gems posing a health risk to the American public.\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation and local law enforcement \nagencies rely on the Gem Laboratory for assistance in solving crimes \ninvolving gems. The Laboratory has been instrumental in solving many \nsuch crimes, providing crucial evidence and expert testimony essential \nto their successful prosecution.\n  Mr. President, I commend GIA and the GIA Gem Laboratory for their \ncontribution to the protection of the consumer. Through its work, the \nGem Laboratory significantly lessens the burdens of the federal \ngovernment that would otherwise have to be borne by the FTC, the FBI, \nthe Customs Service, and other government agencies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/01/senate-section/article/S9800-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9800-S9802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT OF THE SPECIAL INVESTIGATION UNIT ON GULF WAR ILLNESSES\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs released the final report of its Special \nInvestigation Unit (SIU) on Gulf War Illnesses. The report represents \nthe culmination of the unit's year-long, 20-member staff investigation \ninto issues surrounding the illnesses that have affected many veterans \nof the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War.\n  The Gulf War ended over seven years ago, but the aftermath of this \nmilitary victory will remain with us for years to come. This brief war \nrepresented a critical turning point in our concept of modern warfare. \nFor the first time since World War I, we faced the possibility of \nwidespread use of chemical warfare agents. Previously, concerns about \nthe use of ``weapons of mass destruction'' focused on the threat of \nnuclear warfare, increasingly possessed by the more developed nations \nof the world, but still limited in availability. But in the Gulf, we \ncame face-to-face with the threat of the ``poor man's atomic \nweapons''--chemical and biological weapons.\n  Chemical and biological weapons have been around for a long time. The \nUnited States and its allies abandoned the use of chemical weapons many \nyears ago. In April 1997, the United States Senate ratified the \nChemical Weapons Convention, joining many other nations in the \ninternational disarmament of chemical weapons. But for terrorists and \nrogue nations, chemical and biological weapons remain the weapons of \nchoice, and they are likely to play a significant role in the \nbattlefields of the future. According to Secretary of Defense William \nS. Cohen, just as we faced this threat in the Gulf War, we are likely \nto face it again.\n  In hearings before the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, military \nheroes such\n\n[[Page S9801]]\n\nas General Norman Schwarzkopf and General Colin Powell recounted their \nfears about the potential use of chemical or biological weapons in the \nGulf War. They described the dilemmas they faced as they realized that \nvaccine supplies were inadequate to protect the 697,000 men and women \nwho were deployed to the Gulf, forcing our leaders to decide who would \nbe protected and who would not. They recalled the anguish associated \nwith making those decisions. But fortunately, the widespread use of \nchemical weapons and the massive casualties that had been predicted for \nthat war did not occur.\n  After the Gulf War, it was generally agreed that we must be better \nprepared to meet this threat in the future. We needed to develop new \ntechnologies for the detection of chemical and biological weapons in \nthe battlefield; to make sure that we had adequate supplies of vaccines \nand medical antidotes, and other protective equipment, especially masks \nand suits; and to ensure that our troops received adequate training to \ncarry out their mission in the event of use of chemical/biological \nwarfare. Given the crisis our military faced during the Gulf War as our \nleaders realized that we were not well prepared then, you might expect \nit would be high priority to make sure we are not caught unprepared \nagain. Sadly, this has not been the case.\n  The SIU report finds that almost eight years after the Gulf War, our \nmilitary is still not prepared to fight in a chemical or biological \nwarfare environment. The Inspector General of the Department of Defense \ncorroborated these findings in a recent report which states that with \nthe exception of Navy surface ships, our armed forces are unable to \nassess unit chemical and biological defense readiness because unit \ncommanders have not made this training a priority. Of the 232 units \nreviewed by the Inspector General, 80 percent were not fully \nintegrating chemical and biological defense into unit mission training. \nThis is completely unacceptable.\n  The SIU also found that training for chemical and biological warfare \nis still inadequate, and that the technology for battlefield detection \nof chemical warfare agents has not improved since the Gulf War. \nAlthough the threat of chemical and biological warfare has increased \nsince the Gulf War and hangs heavy over the potential battlefields of \nthe 21st century, the military still has inadequate supplies of \nvaccines and chemical/biological protective equipment. It is imperative \nthat we be prepared to face these very real risks. Moreover, we must be \nready for the possibility that the next terrorist attack on U.S. \ncivilians may include such weapons. The task of domestic defense and \npreparedness poses an even greater challenge.\n  Recent events underscore the need to make this defense and readiness \nissue a national priority. Eight years after the Gulf War, United \nNations inspectors still have not been able to fully assess Iraq's \nchemical and biological weapons capabilities. We have all seen the \nroadblocks that Saddam Hussein has succeeded in placing in the path of \nthis international effort to inspect for these weapons. Fortunately, we \ndid not have to send in military personnel in the recent U.S. attack to \ndestroy the chemical plant in Sudan. Had we needed to, however, and if \nthese terrorists had chemical and biological weapons, I fear our ground \ntroops would have been ill-prepared to function in such an environment.\n  My concerns here are not new. In 1994, when I was chairman of the \nCommittee, my staff issued a report that called attention to many of \nthe long-term health concerns arising from our soldiers' exposures to \nenvironmental hazards. Many of the concerns raised then remain today.\n  Senator Specter and I will call upon Secretary Cohen to carefully \nconsider the findings of this report and provide an emergency action \nplan to address these shortcomings. I am confident that he is as \nconcerned about our military's preparedness for this threat as we are, \nand we look forward to his response.\n  Our military men and women must be protected and they must be \nprepared to fight in a chemical/biological warfare environment. That \nmeans that they need ongoing, quality training in chemical/biological \ndefense and detection systems that will work quickly and reliably on \nthe battlefield. It means that they need adequate supplies of the \nrequired chemical protection masks and suits, and training in how to \nproperly use them under battlefield conditions. It means they need \nsufficient supplies of vaccines, antibiotics, and medical antidotes. \nAnd it means that they need well-trained medical personnel who are \nprepared to respond to chemical and biological warfare casualties, and \nthe medical equipment needed to care for such casualties.\n  All of this means a commitment of time and funding across all the \nservice branches, and the support and leadership of commanders \neverywhere to guarantee this commitment. Most of all, this requires a \nsolid commitment from this Congress and President Clinton.\n  We have had enough talk of readiness--it's time to make it a reality \nif we are to fight on the battlefields of the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I request that a summary of the report's findings \nprepared by my staff be printed in the Record.\n  The summary follows:\n\n\n                             Report Summary\n\n       The report of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs' Special \n     Investigation Unit (SIU) on Gulf War Illnesses is \n     thematically divided into 4 major sections or chapters.\n       Chapter 1 addresses DoD and CIA intelligence operations \n     during the War and the destruction of the Khamisiyah \n     munitions depot. It reviews some of the communication \n     problems that existed with poor transfer of critical \n     intelligence information between DoD and CIA on the locations \n     of Iraqi chemical weapons facilities. It also critically \n     reviews DoD's efforts to ``model'' the events that transpired \n     at the U.S. demolition of the Khamisiyah munitions depot in \n     March 1991. The SIU report is particularly critical of the \n     Office of the Special Assistant for Gulf War Illnesses' \n     (OSAGWI) efforts to research the weather conditions that \n     existed on the day of the demolition, as it related to \n     estimates of the numbers of U.S. servicemembers who would \n     have potentially been exposed to low levels of chemical \n     warfare agents, such as sarin.\n       The report points out that the OSAGWI modeling report does \n     not integrate crucial weather information provided by a \n     division of the Air Force that is typically viewed as expert \n     on such issues. Further, the OSAGWI report was largely an \n     internal document, and it was not subjected to the scientific \n     rigors of the peer review process. The Special Investigation \n     Unit (SIU) also contracted with a scientific consultant who \n     supported these criticisms and found that the estimate of \n     approximately 100,000 servicemembers who may have been \n     exposed to be a grossly overestimated figure.\n       The defense and intelligence chapter also details the SIU's \n     investigation of the question of whether there are additional \n     Khamisiyahs or chemical weapons exposures to be found. On the \n     basis of extensive review of classified and unclassified \n     documents, interviews with military officials in Great \n     Britain, France, the Czech Republic, and our Arab allies, and \n     an interview with inspectors of the United Nations Inspection \n     Team, the SIU found no evidence to either prove or disprove \n     that the Iraqis offensively used chemical weapons during the \n     Gulf War. The SIU did find that during the Gulf War, our \n     military was not adequately prepared to deal with the threat \n     of chemical or biological warfare, and our military continues \n     to be inadequately prepared today.\n       Chapter 2 is an ``Assessment of Gulf War Veterans' Health \n     Care Services and Compensation at the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs.'' The SIU team found that VA has often inadequately \n     monitored a number of Persian Gulf War health and benefits \n     programs. As a result, VA demonstrates inconsistent \n     compliance with their own regulations and policy directives, \n     and inadequate implementation of services and benefits for \n     Gulf War veterans. This chapter concludes that too many Gulf \n     War veterans are dissatisfied with the health care that they \n     are receiving from VA, and too few are receiving timely \n     responses to their compensation benefits claims.\n       The SIU report states that ``although VA purports to \n     operate as a single entity on behalf of veterans, in practice \n     it is a loosely linked group of bureaucracies that operate \n     largely in isolation from one another.'' This organizational \n     structure contributes to problematic communication and \n     bureaucratic hurdles that affect VA's ability to provide \n     effective and efficient service to Gulf War veterans. The \n     greatest problems were seen in VBA's handling of Gulf War \n     compensation claims, and their processing was characterized \n     as ``inconsistent and counterproductive.'' While the report \n     notes problems with the health care provided to Gulf War \n     veterans, the SIU staff also found a number of very caring \n     and competent health professionals who were delivering \n     appropriate health care, despite obstacles such as limited \n     information and resources.\n       Chapters 3 and 4 focus specifically on health concerns and \n     health research. This chapter reviews the chronology of \n     health-related events, the assessment of the range of \n     possible exposures in the Gulf War, the nature of the health \n     problems that have\n\n[[Page S9802]]\n\n     emerged, and the government research response on this issue. \n     This information is presented in Chapter 3, ``Evaluations of \n     Wartime Exposures, Gulf War Veteran Health Concerns, and \n     Related Research, and Unanswered Questions.'' Chapter 4, \n     ``Possible Long Term Health Consequences of Gulf War \n     Exposures: An Independent Evaluation,'' contains the brief \n     reports of scientists the SIU contracted with for independent \n     reviews. These prominent scientists reviewed scientific \n     literature on a variety of exposures including pesticides, \n     PB, chemicals, stress, and other wartime and environmental \n     hazards, and the health consequences that follow such \n     exposures.\n       Both health chapters conclude that there is no single \n     ``Gulf War Syndrome'' characterized by a single disease \n     entity or diagnostic label. Instead, there is a significant \n     proportion of Gulf War veterans who returned home with a \n     number of chronic, poorly understood symptoms such as \n     headaches, joint pains, rashes, fatigue, gastrointestinal \n     difficulties, and other symptoms that are potentially \n     disabling in some cases. In studies that have compared the \n     rate of these symptoms among Gulf War veterans to the rate of \n     symptoms in veterans of the same era who were not deployed to \n     the Gulf, significantly more symptoms are reported by the \n     Gulf War veterans. It is clear that many veterans are ill, \n     and it is also clear that we may never know why.\n       There are many reasons why the question of ``why are Gulf \n     War veterans ill?'' cannot be answered.\n       First, DoD deployed many reservists and active military \n     personnel to the Gulf without adequate pre-deployment medical \n     evaluations; as a result, we do not know what preexisting \n     illnesses or health conditions they may have had. In any \n     health investigation, such information would serve as an \n     important baseline from which to assess the pattern of \n     emerging illnesses.\n       Second, DoD's medical recordkeeping for the Gulf War was \n     grossly inadequate. There are no clear records of even basic \n     information, such as the vaccine records of the men and women \n     who served in the Gulf. It is unclear whether such records \n     were ever kept or whether they were destroyed because they \n     were not felt to be a high enough priority to warrant space \n     on the military cargo planes returning to the United States \n     after the war. Many of the medical records from the war are \n     also missing, hindering any efforts to review information on \n     the numbers of troops who were hospitalized or received \n     medical care in the Gulf. Finally, there was no DoD \n     recordkeeping on the range and extent of exposures present in \n     the Gulf. All these factors seriously hinder any research \n     efforts to establish a cause and effect for the health \n     problems that followed the Gulf War.\n       Also, in addition to the broad range of possible \n     exposures--heat, pesticides, PB, smoke from oil well fires, \n     petroleum products, ultra-fine sand particles, stress, and \n     others --and their individual health effects, there is also \n     the issue of the potential effects of an almost infinite \n     number of possible combinations of such agents. Health \n     research today is often not designed or conducted in ways \n     that allow us to fully understand the interactive effects of \n     such agents and their subsequent health consequences. All \n     these issues complicate, and in fact hamper, current \n     examinations of the events of the Gulf War while trying to \n     answer the question of ``why are Gulf War veterans ill?''.\n       Some of the scientific experts the SIU contracted with were \n     able to provide very sound criticism of some of the \n     hypotheses about Gulf War illnesses, such as discounting the \n     role of a possible infectious agent, such as mycoplasma. They \n     were also able to clarify issues such as the possible health \n     effects of PB or pesticides, as well as the links between \n     stressful exposures, such as combat, and long-term physical \n     health. These experts also made a number of important \n     recommendations regarding future research directions and \n     better prevention of unnecessary health risks which were \n     integrated into the report.\n       A number of the report's recommendations will be used to \n     develop additional legislation. Many of the major legislative \n     issues have been covered already in S. 2358, the legislation \n     that was introduced by Senators Rockefeller, Byrd, and \n     Specter. Specifically, S. 2358, the Persian Gulf War \n     Veterans' Act of 1998:\n       Calls for the Secretary of VA to contract with the National \n     Academy of Sciences (NAS) to provide a scientific basis for \n     determining the association between illnesses and exposures \n     to environmental or wartime hazards as a result of service in \n     the Gulf War;\n       Authorizes VA to presume that illnesses that have a \n     positive association with exposures to hazards during the war \n     were related to service even if there was no evidence of \n     illness during service;\n       Extends VA's authority to provide health care to Gulf War \n     veterans through 2001;\n       Requires the Secretary to task NAS with the identification \n     of additional research issues that the government should \n     conduct to better understand the adverse health effects of \n     exposures to environmental or wartime hazards associated with \n     Gulf War service;\n       Tasks NAS with assessing potential treatment models for \n     chronic, undiagnosed illnesses that have affected Gulf War \n     veterans;\n       Establishes a system to monitor the health status and \n     health care utilization of Gulf War veterans with chronic, \n     undiagnosed illnesses within VA and DoD health care systems;\n       Requires that VA, in consultation with HHS and DoD, carry \n     out an ongoing outreach program to provide information to \n     Gulf War veterans;\n       Extends and improves upon VA's Persian Gulf Spouse and \n     Children Evaluation Program, and;\n       Requires the Secretary of VA to enter into an agreement \n     with NAS to study the feasibility of establishing, as an \n     independent entity, a National Center for the Study of \n     Military Health. Such a center would evaluate and monitor \n     interagency efforts and coordination on issues related to \n     post-deployment and would look at issues of how to better \n     prevent and treat post-conflict illnesses.\n       In addition to these important issues addressed by S. 2358, \n     the report highlights further a number of shortcomings within \n     VA's and DoD's current policies. They include:\n       The need for DoD to place a higher priority on training and \n     preparedness for the threat of offensive use of chemical and \n     biological weapons (CBW) in today's warfare scenarios, \n     including better CBW detection systems, adequate supplies of \n     protective masks and suits, adequate numbers of vaccines for \n     protection, and medical isolation units for treatment of such \n     casualties;\n       The need for greater prevention of unnecessary health risks \n     in the battlefield (and on domestic military bases), such as \n     unnecessary exposures to inappropriate use of and inadequate \n     monitoring of environmental agents such as pesticides, \n     solvents, depleted uranium, and other identified health \n     hazards, to include coordination and consultation with EPA \n     and CDC on identifying and managing such risks;\n       The need for DoD to participate in the proposed national, \n     state-based birth defects registry in order to better assess \n     the relative risks of birth defects in military populations;\n       Given VA's history with environmental health issues such as \n     Agent Orange, atomic veterans, and Gulf War veterans' health \n     concerns, the need for VA to create the position of an \n     Assistant Secretary of Veterans Affairs for Deployment-\n     Related Health Matters, with responsibilities to include \n     oversight of issues such as battlefield illnesses;\n       The need for DoD and VA to improve monitoring of health \n     care to Gulf War veterans, to include identification of any \n     barriers to care currently in the system and the need to \n     develop methods for early detection of illnesses with delayed \n     onset, such as cancer;\n       The need to ensure comprehensive pre- and post-deployment \n     medical examinations of Reservists who are placed on active \n     duty for deployment for military operations; and\n       The need for the Secretaries of the Departments of Defense \n     and Veterans Affairs to implement doctrine that reflects and \n     builds upon the lessons learned from the Gulf War in order to \n     avoid repeating many of these same mistakes with future \n     military deployments and veteran populations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/01/senate-section/article/S9800-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9802-S9805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRANSPORTATION AND TRAVEL REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  Ms. SNOWE.
